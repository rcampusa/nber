Inferring the Ideological Affiliations of Political Committees via Financial Contributions Networks

JEL No. D72,D85,P16

                                           ABSTRACT

About two thirds of the political committees registered with the Federal Election Commission do
not self identify their party affiliations. In this paper we propose and implement a novel Bayesian
approach to infer about the ideological affiliations of political committees based on the network of
the financial contributions among them. In Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that our
estimation algorithm achieves very high accuracy in recovering their latent ideological affiliations
when the pairwise difference in ideology groups' connection patterns satisfy a condition known as
the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. We illustrate our approach using the campaign finance
record in 2003-2004 election cycle. Using the posterior mode to categorize the ideological
affiliations of the political committees, our estimates match the self reported ideology for 94.36%
of those committees who self-reported to be Democratic and 89.49% of those committees who self
reported to be Republican.

1     Introduction

    Campaign finance is an integral part of the U.S. politics, and political committees are major
participants in campaign finance related activities. We use the term Political Committees (hence-
forth, PCs) to refer to federal political action committees (PACs), party committees, campaign
committees for presidential, house and senate candidates, as well as issue-based groups or organi-
zations, including lobbyists or fundraisers. They collect contributions from individual donors, make
contributions to other committees and candidates, and spend money for or against candidates.
    U.S. campaign finance laws mandate that political committees disclose all financial transactions
including the contributions they receive and their expenditures, thus rendering numerous data
for analyzing their campaign related activities. However, the PCs are not mandated to file their
party (or ideological) affiliations. Indeed, as we will detail in Section 3, nearly 60% of PCs’ party
affiliations are unreported. This missing data problem may generate obstacles in the study of
important issues related to campaign finance. For example, for researchers who want to study the
patterns of individual contributions using the individual contributions data provided by the Federal
Election Commission (FEC), it is important to know the ideological affiliations of the PCs to which
individual donors contribute. Nevertheless, in the Contributions by Individuals (Year 2003-2004)
data released by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), about 24%, both in terms of the instance
and the amount, of individual contributions go to PCs with unknown party affiliations.
    In this paper, we contribute to the methodologies that aim to address the missing ideological
affiliations of the PCs. We propose a method of inferring PCs’ ideological affiliations from the
financial transactions network among the PCs. The Contributions to Committees from Committees
data, also administered by the FEC, contains the universe of all records of financial contributions
among all registered PCs. We use this data set of the contribution activities to construct a financial
transactions network of the PCs, where each PC is a vertex of the network, and the money flows
between the PCs form the (weighted) edges. The basic idea of our method of inferring ideological
affiliations of the PCs is simple. If the PCs tend to contribute more frequently to other PCs with
similar ideology, then the PCs that actually filed their party affiliations, together with the structure
of the observed financial transactions network, should provide information about the ideologies of
the PCs with unknown ideological affiliations. Specifically, we build an economic model of link
formation and transfer amount, and use the ideas of “community detection” first developed in the
stochastic block model literature where contribution decisions (both the link formation and the
weights) depend on both the observed characteristics and the potentially latent (for the PCs that
do not file their party affiliations) ideologies of the potential contributing and receiving PCs.
    Our model incorporates several new features that are absent in the existing stochastic block

                                                   1
model literature. First, we introduce weights and rich heterogeneity in the edge formation process:
the decision to make a contribution and its contribution amount is not only governed by the latent
political ideologies of the PCs, but also depends on the vertex-level contextual information such as
financial and institutional characteristics. Second, we model the reported party affiliations of those
PCs that do self report their party affiliations as noisy measurements of their true latent ideologies.
Thus, our methodology allows us to estimate the latent ideologies of all PCs, including those that
self reported party affiliations.
   We use three publicly available data sets in our analysis. Two are from the campaign finance
record in 2003-2004 election cycle, namely the Contributions to Committees from Committees, and
the Committee Master File, both maintained by the FEC. We use the first data set to construct
the financial transactions network of the PCs, and we use the second data set to obtain the party
affiliations of some PCs (if they self report), as well as the designations and types of all PCs. The
third data set is additional industrial breakdown information of the PCs which we collected from
OpenSecret.org.1 Our data sets cover the universe of all PCs engaging in transactions with other
PCs in 2003-2004. This feature of our network data has both advantages and disadvantages. An
advantage is that it avoids potential bias arising from analyzing a partially sampled network, but
a major disadvantage is the computational burden associated with the large network.2 There are
5,858 vertices (i.e., PCs) in the financial transactions network, 3,727 of which did not report their
party affiliations. Thus the number of potential ideological configurations is enormous, specifically,
23727 even if we just allow for the binary ideology of Democrat or Republican. For similar reasons, in
a Bayesian approach that delivers a probability distribution over different ideologies for each vertex
(see Section 4 for details), exact estimation of the posterior mode is infeasible. We instead propose a
Gibbs sampler algorithm to approximate the solution. In Monte Carlo Simulations, we demonstrate
that our estimation algorithm achieves very high accuracy in recovering the latent party affiliations
provided that the pairwise difference in ideology groups’ connection patterns satisfy what is known
as the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. We illustrate our approach using the campaign
finance record in the 2003-2004 election cycle. Using the posterior mode to categorize the party
affiliations of the PCs, our estimated ideological affiliations match the self reported ideology for
94.36% of those committees who self reported to be Democratic and 89.49% of those committees
who self reported to be Republican.

Related Literature.          This paper is closely related to two strands of existing literature. In terms
of the research question, our paper is related to the political economy literature on the measurement
of political ideologies. In terms of methodology, it is related to the statistics literature on community
detection.
   We first discuss the literature on the measurement of political ideology. In a seminal paper,
Poole and Rosenthal (1985) proposed a measure of the ideology points (NOMINATE score) of
federal legislators using the roll call data. In their paper, legislators’ ideology points can differ
by election cycle, and bridge legislators and bridge bills are used to ensure that the measures are
comparable across time.3 Note that Poole and Rosenthal’s NOMINATE score is only available
for members of Congress, which is a very small sample (around 500 legislators in each election
cycle); and it is tied to voting behavior. Subsequently, ideology measurement for other political
actors are proposed based on the NOMINATE score. For example, McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal
(2006) combined NOMINATE score and the amount of contribution from PACs to the legislators to
estimate PACs’ ideology. Their proposed measure is money-weighted average of the NOMINATE
scores of the legislators to whom the PAC has contributed. These measures could be biased because
they do not account for PACs’ contribution to losing candidates and other political actors. McKay
(2008) and McKay (2010) combined NOMINATE score and the preferred votes on key roll calls
published by interest groups to estimate interest groups’ ideologies. Her proposed measure is the
average of the NOMINATE scores of “perfectly scoring” legislators whose votes are exactly the
same as the preferred votes of the particular interest group. These measures are only available
for interest groups which publish their preferred votes. Additionally, they could be biased: if an
interest group publishes many key votes, the number of “perfectly scoring” legislators could be
too small and leads to inaccuracy; if an interest group publishes only a few key votes, the number
of “perfectly scoring” legislators could be too large and artificially draws the measure toward the
center.
   There are other proposed methods which do not rely on the NOMINATE score. Some studies
use the campaign finance data to jointly estimate candidates and PACs’ ideologies. For example,
McCarty and Poole (1998) proposed a measure based on PAC’s contribution decision between
incumbent-challenger pairs, excluding unchallenged and open seat elections which account for a
significant fraction in the federal elections. Their measures are not available for candidates in
these elections; and are potentially biased for PACs which contributed in these elections. More
recently, Bonica (2013) proposed a method using the contributions from PACs to candidates. This
   3
     “Bridge legislators” are legislators who serve multiple terms; and “bridge bills” are bills that are considered at
different legislative cycles but with similar contents.

approach, from the perspective of network study, restricted the sample to a directed bipartite graph,
excluding connections among PACs or candidates, as well as connections from candidates to PACs.
In our paper, in contrast, we use an unrestricted network incorporating all financial connections.
Moreover, he uses maximum likelihood estimation method which requires multiple observations, so
he pooled observations over a period of 30 years (1980-2010) and further restricted the sample to
PACs that have given to 30 or more unique candidates, and candidates who have received from 30
or more unique PACs. Pooling data over time is potentially problematic. It requires the assumption
that the actor’s ideology is fixed in a span of 30 years. Differently, in our paper, we make inference
about a PC’s ideology out of a single observation of financial transactions network: for any PC,
separate ideology measures can be calculated for each election cycles. As a result, our measures
are well suited for the study of the time trend of political activities. Moreover, his sample selection
excludes candidates and PACs with small numbers of financial transactions. However, in our paper,
we cover a more extensive scope of political actors: a PC is included as long as it has at least one
financial transaction with another PC.
   Other studies use data from the social media platforms. For example, Barberá (2015) used the
Twitter “following” links to estimate the ideology of the political elites (accounts of candidates,
parties, media, and journalists) and the mass (other individual accounts) in multiple countries on
the same scale. Similar to Bonica (2013), he restricted the sample to a directed bipartite graph
focusing on the mass following the elites. He used a Bayesian method and a two-stage estimation
strategy that exploits the bipartite structure. In the first stage, he used a sub-network induced by
a random subsample of the mass accounts and all the elite accounts, and jointly estimated their
ideologies. In the second stage, holding the first stage ideology measures of the elite accounts fixed,
he estimated the ideology for all the mass accounts using the full network. This two stage procedure
reduces the computational intensity; but using a partially sampled network may lead to bias in the
first stage, which may be further propagated in the second stage. Our approach is different in
that we simultaneously estimate the ideologies of all PCs using the full network. Finally, one key
difference between Bonica (2013) and Barberá (2015) and our paper is that both of these papers
use spatial models. Spatial models assume a priori homophily: political actors with closer ideology
points have higher propensity to connect. This has an especially strong implication on the centrists’
behavior. It rules out the possibility for the centrists to have low propensity to connect with other
centrists, and high propensity to connect with the center-left and the center-right. In contrast,
our model can accommodate non-homophilic patterns. In fact, according to our estimates, the
Independent PCs do have higher propensity to form financial connections with Democratic and
Republican PCs than other Independent PCs.


                                                  4
   We now discuss the literature of community detection. The main task in this literature is to
classify vertices in a network into different groups based on observed connections. When repeated
observations of the network are available, canonical statistical tools can be directly applied. For
example, Trebbi and Weese (2015) used generalized method of moments to estimate, for each
district (vertex), the fraction of insurgents in different groups. The number of parameters is of
order n, the number of vertices. Though large, it is fixed when the number of network observations
T grows. Therefore, standard asymptotic results and inference tools are valid.
   When only one observation of the network is available, which is the case for our application, the
nature of the problem is changed. In this case, the only hope for asymptotic result is to have network
size n → ∞; however, when the network size grows, the number of parameters (of order n) also
grows, which renders canonical statistical tools invalid. Some popular approaches circumvent this
issue by using model-free heuristics: minimum-cut method in Stoer and Wagner (1997) minimizes
the number of edges between communities; modularity maximization method in Newman (2006)
maximizes the difference between the fraction of the edges within groups and its expected value if
edges were formed at random; convergence of iterated correlations (CONCOR) method in Breiger,
Boorman and Arabie (1975) bisects the adjacency matrix by iteratively calculating correlation
coefficients among rows (or columns); and spectral method in Newman (2013) extracts information
of graph partition from the top few eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. Though widely used in
practice, these approaches have the following limitations. First of all, the first three methods all
assume a priori assortative communities, i.e., denser within-community connection than between-
community connection. They are not appropriate for problems where some group may have higher
external connectivity. For example, in our application, the Independent PCs may engage in more
transactions with Democratic and Republican PCs than with other Independent PCs. We need a
model which does not assume away this possibility. Second, in the absence of a statistical model,
none of these methods allows for statistical inference: we cannot state how confident we are in the
obtained classification. Third, these methods cannot incorporate vertex level or vertex pair level
heterogeneity beyond the latent community.
   Therefore, we took a model-based approach instead - we build on the stochastic block model
(SBM) initiated by Snijders and Nowicki (1997) and Nowicki and Snijders (2001). In the SBM, a
network is randomly formed conditional on the underlying community structure, and the community
structure itself is also stochastically generated. This model is widely accepted as a canonical model
for community detection and its estimators have desirable properties. Recent studies characterized
the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery, i.e. conditions on the data generating process
such that one observation of the network embodies enough information to exactly recover the


                                                  5
community structure. Mossel, Neeman and Sly (2014), Abbe, Bandeira and Hall (2014), and Abbe
and Sandon (2015) studied this problem in unweighted networks. Jog and Loh (2015) and Yun and
Proutiere (2016) extended previous results to weighted networks. In particular, they show that if
the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence of community pair’s connection patterns is above a particular
threshold, the probability of correctly recovering the entire community structure converges to 1
as n → ∞. Kanade, Mossel and Schramm (2016) and Cai, Liang and Rakhlin (2017) studied
this problem when a fraction of the vertices’s community affiliations are revealed. Finally, Abbe
(2017) provided a detailed review of the recent development in the research of exact recovery in
stochastic block models. As explained earlier, exact solution to the Bayesian posterior mode is
infeasible for large network, and various algorithms are proposed to approximate the solution.
For example, the spectral algorithm can be viewed as an approximation to posterior mode.4 The
Gibbs sampler algorithm we use in this paper is an approximation to first obtain the posterior
distribution and then the posterior mode. From the perspective of empirical implementation, a
weakness of the generic SBM is the lack of heterogeneity beyond community affiliations, so we
introduce pair-wise heterogeneity in a similar way as Peng and Carvalho (2015a) and Peng and
Carvalho (2015b). These papers proposed a degree correction strategy to capture vertex-level
heterogeneity: they use additional latent variable or observed degree to capture the popularity of
a vertex, and a “popular” vertex has higher propensities to connect to all other vertices. In this
paper, we allow heterogeneity at vertex pair level, by incorporating interactions of the observable
vertex level characteristics, such as location, industry, and budget. Apart from richer specification,
the use of observable characteristics has additional benefits: it entails less computational intensity
than the use of latent variable, and it avoids the endogeneity problem from the use of observed
degrees.
   The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic
framework for the financial network among political committees, and describe the statistical model
of random network formation that we will empirically implement; in Section 3, we describe the
data sets used in our analysis, as well as several “naive” methods that we attempted; in Section
4, we provide the details of the Bayesian estimation procedure and arguments for identification;
in Section 5, we present the Monte Carlo results; in Section 6, we describe the specifications used
in our empirical implementation, and present the main empirical results; finally, in Section 7, we
conclude and discuss directions for future research.

    The original discrete parameter space is relaxed to a sphere, and the spectral method is a solution to the relaxed
problem, and is derived through derivatives. A detailed description can be found in Newman (2013).

2        Financial Network of Political Committees

    We represent the money-flow network among political committees as a static, weighted and
undirected graph.5 A graph G consists of vertices V and edges E. In our model, each vertex
i ∈ V = {1, ..., n} represents a PC. In our application, n will represent the total number of PCs
registered with the FEC, and is 5,858 for the 2003-2004 election cycle. Each edge (i, j) ∈ E is an
unordered pair in V × V. In our application, (i, j) ∈ E if there exists money flow, either unilateral
or bilateral, between committees i and j. A weighted graph also includes, for each edge (i, j) ∈ E,
a corresponding weight wij , which in our application will correspond to the sum of money flows
between the two PCs. Equivalently, a weighted graph G can be represented by a weighted adjacency
matrix y where                                      
                                                     w
                                                        ij        if (i, j) ∈ E
                                              yij =                                                                  (1)
                                                     0           otherwise.

In addition to the network structure described above, each committee i ∈ {1, ..., n} is characterized
by the following attributes: a unidimensional latent ideology xi , and a multi-dimensional observable
characteristics zi , which captures the financial and institutional characteristics of the PC. The
details of the variables contained in the vector zi will be described in Section 6 when we present
our empirical specification.


Ideologies of Vertices.              We assume that there are m discrete categories of ideologies where
m ≥ 2. In our application, m will be equal to 3, corresponding to Democratic, Republican and
Independent respectively. We denote the true ideology of vertex i ∈ V by xi ∈ {1, ..., m}. We
assume that, for all vertices, their xi ’s are latent and unobserved to us. However, For a subset of
vertices V o ⊂ V, there exists a noisy measure, denoted by x̂i ∈ {1, ..., m}, of the latent ideology xi ;
but for vertices in V\V o , we do not have this noisy measure. In our application, the size of V o is
typically about 1/3 of the size of V.6
    To summarize, the framework for the financial network of PCs can be represented by:


                          hy, x, x̂, zi = h{yij }1≤i,j≤n , {xi }1≤i≤n , {x̂i }i∈V o , {zi }1≤i≤n i .                 (2)


Note, however, since we do not observe x, the data consists of


                             DATA : hy, x̂, zi = h{yij }1≤i,j≤n , {x̂i }i∈V o , {zi }1≤i≤n i .                       (3)
    5
   While both the model and the estimation strategy can be straightforwardly extended to a directed graph, an
undirected graph is adopted for computational tractability.
    6
        In Appendix H, we also implement a version of the model in which we assume that x̂i = xi for all i ∈ V o .


                                                              7
The goal of our empirical exercise is to make inference about the latent ideology x based on data
hy, x̂, zi .


2.1     A Statistical Model

    As we explained in the introduction, the vector of latent ideologies x = (x1 , ..., xn ) can be high-
dimensional. To circumvent the high-dimensionality problem, we adopt a Bayesian approach by
assuming that each vertex can, a priori, be of ideology k ∈ {1, ..., m} with probability θk where
θ = (θ1 , ..., θm ) ∈ ∆m−1 ; and then we use its observed links with other vertices and the weights
of the links to render a posterior probability distribution pi ∈ ∆m−1 over these categories. We
will use the mode of the posterior distribution pi as our best guess for i0 s political or ideological
affiliation.7
    Formally, our model of the financial network formation among PCs is based on the stochastic
block models of random network formation. In the model, the number of vertices n, the number of
blocks m, and vertices’ observable characteristics z are assumed to be exogenous and fixed. The
adjacency matrix Y, the ideology vector X, and the noisy measure X̂ are assumed to be random.8


Prior.         For any PC i ∈ V, its latent ideology Xi has the following marginal prior distribution:


                                         P(Xi = k) = θk for k = 1, ..., m                                             (4)


where θ = (θ1 , ..., θm ) ∈ ∆m−1 .


Measurement Error. For a PC i ∈ V o ⊂ V, we observed i0 s reported political affiliation X̂i ,
which we interpret as a noisy measure of its true ideology Xi . Specifically,
                                                
                                                 1−            for k = xi
                          P(X̂i = k|Xi = xi ) =                                                                       (5)
                                                               for k ∈ {1, ..., m}\{xi },
                                                        m−1

where  ∈ [0, 1) captures the rate of measurement error.9
   7
    Of course, the whole posterior distribution pi itself is of interest beyond its mode: pi will allow us to provide a
more continuous measure of i0 s ideology spectrum. For example, two vertices may end up with the same ideological
categorization based on their posterior mode, while one vertex could be more central than the other.
   8
     Throughout the paper, generic random variables are denoted by capital letters Y, X, and X̂, whereas their
realizations and specific configurations are denoted by small letters y, x, and x̂.
   9
     can be pre-specified as 0 if there is good reason to believe that there is no error in report (perhaps by the nature
of the data set). Otherwise, a positive  is more flexible because it allows for measurement error, which makes it
possible for the report x̂i to differ from the true ideology xi . We will implement a version of the model restricting
 to be zero in Appendix H, where we instead hold out a subset of the vertices with self-reported ideologies in our
estimation, and use the holdout sample to validate our estimation results.

An economic interpretation of this assumption is as follows. A PC designs its general principle
in contributions according to its political ideology as well as its financial and institutional char-
acteristic. Following the principle, its staffs make decisions on whether to contribute to a specific
committee, and the idiosyncratic factors in each of these decisions are unobserved by the researcher
and are assumed to be independent. This conditional independence assumption is a potentially
strong assumption, because it abstracts away from various possible strategic considerations that
a political committee may have in its contribution decisions; of course, the restrictiveness of this
assumption in practice depends on how complete the vector of characteristics z is. It is impor-
tant to note that Assumption 1 is stated conditional on the latent ideologies of the relevant PCs.
Thus, it allows for what we believe to be the first-order role of ideologies in political contributions.
Other characteristics of the PC, for example, its previous connections, are also allowed to affect its
contribution decisions, to the extent that such information is contained in its characteristics z. In
addition, it is well acknowledged that it is difficult to establish asymptotic results in a network mo-
del in the presence of widespread correlation (see, e.g., Leung (2016)); as a result, valid statistical
inference using data from a single network (or a small number of networks) necessitates restrictions
on the degree of correlation. Finally, conditional independence is a maintained assumption in the
literature of stochastic block model (Snijders and Nowicki (1997) and Nowicki and Snijders (2001)),
and the literature of classification in general (see, e.g., Koller and Friedman (2009)).10
   Specifically, we assume that the edge formation process is as follows. For any pair of vertices

                          Yij      = 0, otherwise,                                                                 (6)

with an undirected graph, we further assume that the process (6) satisfies parameter symmetry
over (k, l) , i.e.,


                                                    β 0,kl = β 0,lk ,

and that eij ∼ i.i.d. N (0, 1).
   To simplify notation in the likelihood function in Section 4, we will denote the conditional
probability of two vertices i and j forming an edge as η ij and express it in a compact form as:11


                                     η ij (Xi , Xj ) = P(Yij > 0|Xi , Xj , zi , zj )

Weights of the Edge. Once two vertices form an edge, we assume that the weight of their edge,
which in our application will correspond to the total amount of financial transactions between
the two vertices, is drawn from a Q-valued discrete distribution with probabilities that depend on
ideological proximity. Specifically, conditional on Yij > 0, if Xi = k, Xj = l, the Yij takes values
(w1 , ..., wQ ) with probabilities


                                           hkl ≡ (hkl,1 , ..., hkl,Q ) ∈ ∆Q−1 .                                      (9)


In our estimation we will pre-fix Q and the values (w1 , ..., wQ ). Again because we deal with an
undirected graph, we impose the natural symmetry assumption that


                                                       hkl = hlk .                                                  (10)

       Note that we omit the covariates zi and zj in the arguments of expression (8) for η ij for notational convenience.

2.2    Discussions

   First, we would like to note that the edge formation process as specified by (6) can be interpreted
as resulting from a model of matching. Two committees decide whether to establish a financial
connection based on their joint surplus from forming a match. The surplus has a deterministic
component β 0,kl + β 1,kl (zi +zj ) + β 2,kl zi zj as well as a stochastic component eij . Parameters differ
by ideology pair (k, l). β kl,0 captures the direct effect of ideology proximity, and β 1,kl and β 2,kl
capture the effect of committee specific characteristics interacting with ideology proximity. In other
words, ideology influences the edge formation probability through both the constant term and the
coefficients.12
   Second, financial and institutional characteristics zi and zj are included in the specification
(6) not only because they may be important factors in the PCs’ contribution decisions, but also,
technically, it is our strategy for degree correction. Without these covariates, the model is essentially
the same as Snijders and Nowicki (1997), where edge formation probability is governed only by
ideology proximity. In their model, variations in degree are attributed only to random shock and
ideology proximity. Moreover, the implied degree distribution is a mixture of m(m + 1)/2 binomial
distributions. However, when the number of ideology categories is small, the model-implied degree
distribution may not be able to capture the empirical degree distribution. Therefore, we include
vertex specific characteristics to introduce richer heterogeneity in the edge formation probability.
This is a variant of the degree correction strategy introduced in Peng and Carvalho (2015a) and
Peng and Carvalho (2015b). In addition to proximity of the latent ideology, Peng and Carvalho
(2015a) assume that the edge formation probability also depends on additional latent variables
ξ i , ξ j ∈ R, capturing vertex specific popularity. Peng and Carvalho (2015b) replace the latent
popularity variables with the quantile ranks of the vertices’ observed degrees qi , qj ∈ {1, 2, ..., Q}.
Our paper differs from Peng and Carvalho (2015b) in that the characteristics we use do not involve
any features of the network, rendering a much cleaner model with which to perform statistical
inference because the potential problem of endogeneity is avoided. Compared to Peng and Carvalho
(2015a), our paper has a faster convergence rate and lower computational intensity because it does
not require inferring about additional latent variable ξ i .
   Finally, note that conditional on the latent ideologies of the vertices, our model of network
formation is equivalent to a pair-wise matching model. However, since the vertices’ latent ideologies
are not known, our edge formation process as specified in (6) allows for correlation conditional on
  12
     In an empirical application, additional constraints can be added: for example, restricting some coefficients in
β 1,kl and β 2,kl to be 0, or to be the same for different ideology pairs. We provide the details of the additional
restrictions in Section 6.

observables        X̂i           and z. Moreover, the correlation is spread all over the connected component
                         i∈V o
of the network via the latent ideologies. As a result, our network is not decomposable based on
observables.


3         Data and Descriptive Statistics

     Three data sets are used in our study, two of which are administrative data sets from the Federal
Election Commission (FEC) in 2003-2004 election cycle: the “ Committee Master File”, and the
“Contributions to Committees from Committees” data; and the third data set is collected from
OpenSecrets.org.13
     The “Committee Master File” contains basic information about all the PCs registered with
the FEC. The PCs in this data set include federal political action committees (PACs), party
committees, campaign committees for presidential, house and senate candidates, as well as groups
or organizations such as lobbyists or fund raisers. This data set also contains information on the
PC’s geographical location, institutional characteristics, and the self-reported party affiliation, if
available.
     The “Contributions to Committees from Committees” data contains the universe of the con-
tribution records between PCs. We observe the universe of records because the campaign finance
laws mandate the disclosure of all transactions and expenditure related to federal election activi-
ties. In this data set, for each contribution, it lists the contributor, recipient, and the amount of
contribution. We will use this data set to construct the complete network of financial transactions
among the PCs.
     Finally, the OpenSecrets.org data set contains the industry categorization for the PCs. The
data sources corresponding to each of the variables we use are summarized in Table 1.

3.1    Vertex Characteristics

   In the 2003-2004 election cycle, 5,858 PCs participated in contribution activities with other PCs
and formed a financial network, among a total of 7,559 active PCs (defined as PCs with either
positive total receipts or positive total disbursement).14 We do not include in our study the PCs
that do not participate in financial contributions with other PCs, though they could alternatively
be viewed as isolated vertices in the network. This is not particularly worrisome because the PCs
excluded from our study are financially insignificant. Among all PCs with positive receipts, the
PCs in the financial network accounted for 96.83% of total amount of receipts; and among all PCs
with positive disbursement, these PCs accounted for 96.87% of total amount of receipts.
   Since the campaign finance laws do not mandate that political committees report their party
affiliations, the Committee Master File has incomplete information on the PCs’ political affiliation.
In Table 2, we summarize the distribution of reported party affiliations of the PCs in the Committee
Master File. Respectively 17.4% and 17.12% of the PCs reported to be Democratic and Republican,
while 1.01% of the PCs reported to be Independent, and 0.85% of the PCs reported other affiliations
such as Labor Party or Conservative Party. Importantly, 63.62% of the PCs did not report their
party affiliations. In terms of financial significance, contributions sent by the PCs without self
reported political affiliations accounted for 15.25% of the total amount of contributions among the
PCs, and contributions received by them accounted for 37.38% of the total contributions.

   In Table 3 we describe the non-ideological characteristics included in our analysis. Information
on state and industry enables us to capture the effect of geographical and industrial proximity on
political contribution. Figure 1 shows that the District of Columbia has the highest number of
political committees (896), followed by California (575), Virginia (436), Texas (301), New York
  14
     Information on total receipts and disbursement is obtained from data sets “Candidate Summary (All Candidates)”
and “PAC & Party Summary” released by the FEC. This information is missing for 89 PCs in the observed financial
network. We define them as active, and use their budget in the financial network as a proxy for their total receipts
and total disbursement.

ideological and party affiliated sectors, and use a finer breakdown for sectors such as Misc Business
and Other. We provide a detailed description of the construction of the industry variable in

paign committees of either House, Senate or Presidential elections, 45.43% are qualified PACs, and
4.52% are qualified Party committees, and the rest (“Other”) are mainly non-qualified committees.
In Table 6, we provide information about the committee designations. There are three distinct
categories of committee designation in the Committee Master File: authorized by a candidate,
joint fund-raiser, and others.16 Table 6 shows that 1.89% of the committees are authorized by a
candidate, 2.83% are joint fund-raisers, and the majority of the rest are either principal campaigns
or committees not authorized by a candidate. We do not list principal campaigns separately be-
cause it would be redundant given the more detailed categorization in committee type. Finally,
the national dummy listed in Table 3 takes value 1 if and only if the committee is one of the
following six committees: the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee (DSCC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the
Republican National Committee (RNC), National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), and
National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
   We compute a PC’s budget from its contribution record. It is constructed as the sum of its
contributions to all other PCs within this election cycle. Typically, this amount is lower than a
committee’s total receipts or total disbursements. We use this measure because it is most powerful
in explaining a PC’s probability of making political contribution, and thus its total number of
connections. In fact, the correlation between a PC’s total receipts or disbursements and its number
of contributions to other PCs is low. The distribution of budget is given in Table 7 and Figure 2.
It has a wide range and a fat tail: 25.7% of the PCs have budget less than or equal to $1,000, while
8% of the PCs have budget more than $500,000.


3.2       Descriptive Statistics of the Financial Transactions Network

   The Contributions from Committees to Committees data set records 411,106 transactions among
5,858 political committees in the 2003-2004 election cycle. Figure 3 is a graphical representation
of the network using graphing software Gephi.17 Each vertex represents a PC, and the color
of the vertex represents reported affiliation: blue for Democratic, red for Republican, green for
   15
      Qualified PACs need to have been in existence for six months and received contributions from 50 people and
made contributions to five federal candidates. Qualified party committees need to have been in existence for at least
six months and received contributions from 50 people or are affiliated with another party committee that meets these
requirements.
  16
     A committee is designated as “authorized by a candidate” if it is authorized by a candidate in writing to receive
contributions or make expenditures on behalf of the candidate, but is not her principal campaign committee. A
committee is designated as “a joint fundraiser ” if it is created by two or more candidates, PACs or party committees
to share the costs of fundraising, and split the proceeds.

contributions with the same direction between any pair of PCs into one edge: each edge represents
a directed financial connection; and we use the contributor’s color to represent the color of the
edge. Thus there are a total of 164,529 edges in Figure 3. This network has 20 disconnected
components.18 Nevertheless, the component in the center is disproportionately large with 5,806
vertices. The subsequent description focuses on this giant component.

well-connected. On the one hand, the average degree is 50.09, i.e. on average, a PC is connected
to only 0.86% of other PCs.19 This indicates sparsity because the number of edges is only a small
fraction of all the vertex pairs. On the other hand, it has a diameter of 10, and an average distance
of 2.99.20 Both statistics indicate that the network is well-connected, which poses a challenge for our
study. Given the connectedness, there is no straightforward approach to structurally decompose this
giant component into separate sub-networks, despite the visual patterns of clustering. Moreover,
there is no other natural way of decomposition. A common practice in the network applications is
to partition the full network into geographically disjoint sub-networks and assume no interaction
across sub-networks. However, this practice is not suitable in our application because political
contributions are not concentrated at local levels.

Distributions of Degrees and Edge Weights.                   To explore beyond the network-level summary
statistics, we further investigate the distribution of degrees. Figure 4 shows that the degree dis-
tribution has a large spread and a fat tail: the highest degree is as large as 978. An important
feature is that the shape of this distribution is inconsistent with a mixture of a small number of
binomial distributions–an implication in the standard stochastic block model. To capture the ob-
served degree distribution, we introduce rich heterogeneity in our model. Specifically, we include
budget whose distribution has similar patterns to account for the variations in degree.
   Additionally, we study the sub-networks induced by reported Democratic, Republican and Inde-
pendent PCs, and analyze connection patterns conditional on reported affiliations. In Figure 5, we
have three graphs for self-reported Democratic, Republican, and Independent PCs respectively. In
each graph, we present the distribution of the PCs’ numbers of connections with the three groups

    Degree is a vertex-level statistics. It is the number of direct connections
                                                                      P         a vertex has. Following the notation
introduced in the previous section, vertex i’s degree is given by di = j6=i 1(yij > 0).

    The diameter of a network is calculated as the maximum length of the (finite) shortest paths among vertex pairs.
The average distance of a network is calculated as the average length of the (finite) shortest paths among vertex
pairs.

of self identified PCs. Self-reported Democratic and Republican PCs show evidence of homophily.
On the one hand, many PCs are financially connected with PCs affiliated to same party, and a
sizable of them have more than 20 such connections; on the other hand, only a small number of
PCs are financially connected with PCs affiliated to the other party, and most of them have less
than 10 such connections. Self-reported Independent PCs show similar connection pattern with
the self-reported Democratic vs. Republican PCs. Many are financially connected with both par-
ties, and a sizable of them have more than 20 such connections. A small fraction are financially
connected with other self-reported Independent PCs, and most of them have less than 10 such
connections - partially due to the small number of self-reported Independent PCs. Note that we
cannot claim, based on the connection patterns between PCs with self reported affiliations, that
this is an evidence of heterophily. It is possible that they are connected with a large number of
Independent PCs without self-reported affiliations. Furthermore, even if Independent PCs exhibit
heterophily, this behavior does not invalidate either our model or estimation. Identification only
requires that PCs with different political ideologies have different contribution patterns. This is at
least true for the PCs with self-reported affiliation, which is reassuring.
   Finally, in order to infer about the unknown ideologies from the PCs with self reported ideologies,
an implicit assumption in our model is that the PCs without self reported affiliations do not act
systematically differently from the PCs with self reported affiliations. Therefore, we reproduce the
degree distribution in Figure 6 with the composition of each bar marked by color. The degree
distribution of PCs without self reported affiliations is similar to that of the PCs with self reported
affiliations. This evidence is consistent with the assumption, though insufficient. In Section 6, we

Figure 6: Decomposition of Degree Distribution
Note: The same as Figure 4, but the composition of each bar, i.e., the composition of PCs with a certain rage of
degrees, is presented with different colors.


   The financial network also provides information on transfer amount (the sum of the contribution
amount) between pairs of connected PCs. Its distribution is given in Table 9 and Figure 7. Most of
them are small because of the regulations on contribution limits (detailed description in Appendix
B). In addition, we present the distribution of transfer amount conditional on reported ideology in
Table 9 and Figure 8. On average, the transfer amount is high between PCs with the same reported
affiliation, and low for the other cases. A caveat in interpreting these statistics is that we exclude
all the contributions involving PCs without self reported affiliations, so they do not necessarily give
the full picture of the contribution pattern.

In other words, a PC is Democratic (Republican) if it is connected with more Democratic (Repub-
lican) PCs than Republican (Democratic) ones, or Independent if it is connected with an equal
number of Democratic and Republican PCs. However, neither existence nor uniqueness of the
solution is guaranteed. We attempted to solve this problem by iteration method, but failed. The
following example in Figure 9 illustrates the reason. According to the categorization rule described
above, the two “unknown” vertices should be assigned Democratic. However, this assignment gener-
ates inconsistency in the “Republican” vertex’s behavior: as a Republican PC, it is connected with
two Democratic PCs. There does not exist a categorization which can reconcile such inconsistency,
so the naive method proposed in (11) does not guarantee a well-defined solution.

In this case, a PC’s ideology is defined by its connected PCs with self reported affiliation. There are
two major problems with this method. First, when a PC is only connected to PCs with unreported
affiliations, its ideology is not defined. If we try to address this problem by iteratively applying the
equation above, we go back to the previous method. Second, categorization has very low precision
for PCs connected with few PCs with self reported affiliations and mostly with PCs with unknown
affiliations. The poor performance of naive methods necessitate the use of a more sophisticated
method.

             P (y, x̂|x, z; , β, h)

        = (1 − )                                      η ij (xi , xj )hxi xj (yij )              1 − η ij (xi , xj )           , (13)

where nt = i∈V o 1(xi = x̂i ) is the number of vertices in V o whose x̂i ’s coincide with xi ’s, ne =

  i∈V o 1(xi 6= x̂i ) is the number of vertices in V whose x̂i ’s differ from xi ’s, and hxi xj (yij ) = hxi xj ,q

    We use the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator to recover the latent ideology. It is a
Bayesian estimator that equals the mode of the posterior probability. Specifically, it solves


                                          max         P (y, x̂|x, z; , β, h) P (x; θ) .                                       (14)
                                       x∈{1,...,m}n


Note that the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) solves


                                               max         P (y, x̂|x, z; , β, h) ,                                           (15)
                                           x∈{1,...,m}n


                                                            1        1
and that MAP is equivalent to MLE under uniform prior θ = ( m , ..., m ).
    We now argue for the validity of the MAP estimator, and propose a Bayesian algorithm to obtain
an approximate solution. Theoretically, statistical inference is non-standard in our model. First of
all, we have only one observation of the network, i.e. one realization of y, x̂. Second, the number


                                                                28
of parameters (the number of latent political ideologies) grows with the network size. Therefore,
canonical asymptotic theory is not applicable. For example, law of large numbers cannot be directly
applied. As a result, in the recent literature, new concepts and tools are introduced to study this
problem. The following subsection summarizes the key concepts and results mostly related to our
study.


4.1      Threshold for Exact Recovery

  In this subsection we describe the theoretical results in Yun and Proutiere (2016) that justify
our estimation using one observation of the network. The standard stochastic block model was first
introduced in Snijders and Nowicki (1997) and Nowicki and Snijders (2001), and its exact recovery
problems were studied in Mossel, Neeman and Sly (2014), Abbe, Bandeira and Hall (2014), and
Abbe and Sandon (2015). The labeled stochastic block model introduced weights on edges, and its
exact recovery problems were studied in Jog and Loh (2015) and Yun and Proutiere (2016). First,
we provide a formal definition of the labeled stochastic block model.

Definition 1 (Labeled Stochastic Block Model LSBM (n, θ, log(n)
                                                           n W )). The LSBM gener-
      ates an n-vertex random graph with community affiliation X and weighted adjacency ma-
      trix Y according to the following process. Each vertex is assigned a community affiliation
      Xi ∈ {1, 2, ..., m} independently under probability θ = (θ1 , ..., θm ) ∈ ∆m−1 . Conditional
      on community affiliations, the edges are drawn independently. The edges Yij ’s take discrete
      values {0, w1 , w2 , ...wQ } where 0 represents no edge and wq represents an edge with the spec-
      ified (non-zero) weight. The distribution of edges is governed by an m-by-m-by-Q matrix
      W . Specifically, vector W (k, l; ·) characterizes edge distribution between a pair of vertices in
      communities k and l:

                                                      log(n)
                     P(Yi,j = wq |Xi = k, Xj = l) =          W (k, l; q) for q = 1, .., Q;
                                                        n
                                                                Q                                  (16)
                                                         log(n) X
                     P(Yi,j   = 0|Xi = k, Xj = l) = 1 −             W (k, l; q).
                                                           n
                                                                 q=1


Note that W is not indexed by the network size n, i.e. it does not change with n. This implies
that the distribution described above will change with n. More precisely, the probability of having
an edge scales as Θ( log(n)
                       n ) and the degree scales as Θ(log(n)). This logarithmic growth rate of
degree with respect to the network size is called the logarithmic degree regime. The literature on
exact recovery studies this regime because it is dense enough that the graph is connected with
high probability; yet it is still sparse enough that the conditional independence condition yields


                                                    29
asymptotic independence of the failures of the component-MAP for different vertices.
   Next, we provide the definition of exact recovery. Exact recovery is an asymptotic requirement
in the context of the SBM - a counterpart of consistency in the classical statistical problems.21

Definition 2 (Exact Recovery). Exact recovery is solved if there exists an algorithm such that
        P(X est = X) → 1 as n → ∞ where X est is the estimated community affiliation.22

In other words, exact recovery requires that for a large enough network, the probability of correctly
recovering the entire community structure (i.e. no misclassification) is almost 1. The most promis-
ing estimator to solve exact recovery is the MAP estimator because it minimizes P(X est 6= X) - if
MAP fails in solving exact recovery, no other algorithm can succeed (see, e.g., Abbe (2017) ).
   In order to describe the condition for exact recovery, we first define the Chernoff-Hellinger (CH)
divergence (Abbe and Sandon (2015)).

Definition 3 (Chernoff-Hellinger divergence D(θ, W )).


                                         D(θ, W ) = min DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l))                                      (17)
                                                          k,l:k6=l


        where DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) is given by

                                               Q X
                                               X m
        DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) = max                      θj [(1−λ)W (k, j; q)+λW (l, j; q)−W (k, j; q)1−λ W (l, j; q)λ ]
                                     λ∈[0,1]
                                               q=1 j=1
                                                                                                                   (18)

Intuitively, DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) measures the difference in connection patterns between a pair of
communities, k and l; and thus the CH-divergence D(θ, W ) is the minimum of such difference
between any pair of distinct communities. In the following, we explain more precisely the meaning
of difference in connection pattern. Note that mathematically θj [(1 − λ)W (k, j; q) + λW (l, j; q) −
W (k, j; q)1−λ W (l, j; q)λ ] measures the difference between θj W (k, j; q) and θj W (l, j; q). Moreover,
θj W (k, j; q) log(n) gives, for a vertex in community k, the expected number of wq -weighted edges
with community j; and θj W (l, j; q) log(n) gives, for a vertex in community l, a similar number.
Therefore, θj [(1 − λ)W (k, j; q) + λW (l, j; q) − W (k, j; q)1−λ W (l, j; q)λ ] measures the difference be-
tween communities k and l in terms of the number of wq -weighted edges with community j. Finally,
summing over different communities j and different edge weights wq delivers the expression in (18).
DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) is non-negative. Larger value of DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) represents larger differ-
  21
       Exact recovery is sometimes referred to as strong consistency, reflecting the resemblance to consistency.
  22
       The equivalence is up to group permutation of X est with respect to community names.



                                                               30
ence in connection patterns between communities k and l, and DL+ (θ, W (k), W (l)) is zero if and
only if the two communities have identical connection patterns, i.e., W (k, j; q) = W (l, j; q), ∀j, q.
       We further illustrate the definition of CH divergence in a special case of a homogeneous model
(Jog and Loh (2015)), where its expression is significantly simplified. In a homogeneous model,
vertices are assigned to different communities with equal probabilities; and the distribution of an
edge only depends on whether the pair of vertices belong to the same communities:

                                                                 1
                                                        θj =       , ∀j;                            (19)
                                                                 m
                                                            
                                                            Wwithin (·) if k = l
                                            W (k, l; ·) =                                           (20)
                                                               between (·) if k 6= l.
                                                            W

Under homogeneity, the CH divergence reduces to the Hellinger divergence (corresponding to λ =
1
2 ),   measuring the difference in within-community and between-community connection patterns:



  D(θ, W )

         q=1

                                                                                                    (21)

The first equation follows symmetry, the second equation directly applies the definition in (18),
the third equation uses (19) and W (k, j; ·) = W (l, j; ·) = Wbetween (·) ∀j 6= k, l, the fourth equation
                                                                     1
applies (20), and the last equation results from λ =                 2   being the maximizer.
       Now we can state the main theoretical results. Combining Theorem 3 and Claim 4 in Yun and
Proutiere (2016), we have:

Theorem 1 (Threshold for Exact Recovery). Exact recovery is solvable for LSBM (n, θ, log(n)
                                                                                       n W ))
         if D(θ, W ) > 1.

                                                                31
The theorem shows that: if the difference in connection patterns of any pair of communities is large
enough, we can correctly recover the entire community structure from one observed network with
high probability. This theorem provides theoretical foundation for the use of the MAP estimator
(because it is the “optimal” algorithm in terms of exact recovery), and it is very similar to the
consistency results in classical statistics.
   Some comment on the case where D(θ, W ) < 1 is useful. In this case, the MAP estimator
fails exact recovery (i.e. has misclassification) with strictly positive probability. This result should
not be interpreted as discouraging: although the probability of having misclassification does not
vanish with the growth of the sample size, the misclassification rate defined as the proportion of
vertices misclassified could still be low. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we observe that even when
the CH divergence is below 1, we still have reasonably good classification. Therefore, even if our
application falls in the second case, the MAP estimator is still a sensible choice.
   To apply this theorem to our model, note that W corresponds to a composition of the edge
                                                                                                              log(n)
formation probability Φ(γ 0 β), the conditional weight distribution h, and the scaling factor                   n .
In the Monte Carlo exercises, and the real data application, we will calculate the CH divergence
according to Definition 3 and (22)

                                                        n
                                      W (k, l; q) =          Φ( γ(k, l)0β )hkl (q)                             (22)
                                                      log(n)

where γ(k, l)0β is the median of (γ(k, l, zi , zj )0β) over (i, j) pairs such that xi = k, xj = l or
xi = l, xj = k. This accommodates our introduction of covariates in the edge formation process.


4.2       Estimation Algorithm

   Apart from the theoretical challenge, the large size of the campaign finance network poses
additional computational challenges. The parameter space of x is mn . With 3 categories and 5,806
vertices, the parameter space is far larger than the number of atoms in the universe.23 Therefore,
exact solution to MAP in (14) is infeasible, and instead we need an efficient approximation method.
In light of these considerations, we propose a Bayesian algorithm to approximate the posterior
distribution of the latent ideology as well as other parameters.
   In this Bayesian approach, the latent ideology vector X, and the parameters , θ, β are treated
as random variables with certain prior probability distributions. Adjacency matrix y and reported
affiliation x̂ are treated as one realization of the random variables Y and X̂. Observable charac-
teristics z are treated as fixed and exogenous.
  23
       According to Jackson (2010), the estimated number of atoms in the universe is on the order of 2270 .



                                                           32
   The prior distribution of the latent X is given by (4) in the network formation model. The prior
distribution of θ, the parameter governing the unconditional probability distribution of ideology, is
assumed to be a Dirichlet distribution:


                                                   θ ∼ Dir(αθ ),                                                  (23)


where αθ ∈ Rm
            + is a vector of pre-specified concentration parameters. The prior distribution of ,

the parameter governing measurement error, is assumed to be a Beta distribution:


                                                  ∼ Beta(α1 , α2 ),                                            (24)


where (α1 , α2 ) ∈ R2+ is a vector of pre-specified concentration parameters. The prior distributions
of h = {hkl }1≤k≤l≤m , the conditional distribution of edge weight (transfer amount), is assumed to
be a Dirichlet distribution:
                                                 hkl ∼ Dir(αhkl ),                                                (25)

where αhkl ∈ RQ
              + is a vector of pre-specified concentration parameters. The prior distribution of

β, the parameter governing edge formation probability, is assumed to be a multivariate normal
distribution:
                                                  β ∼ N (0, τ 2 I),                                               (26)

where τ ∈ R+ is pre-specified standard deviation.
   Given the prior probability distributions of X, θ, β, , and h, the goal of Bayesian estimation is to
update the belief on their joint distribution using data y, x̂ and z, i.e., to compute the posterior dis-
tribution P(θ, β, , h, X|y, x̂, z). Once the posterior distribution is computed, it is straightforward
to assess different objects of interest, especially the marginal distributions P(Xi |y, x̂, z). There is
neither an analytically nor a numerically convenient form to directly characterize of the joint poste-
rior distribution. Fortunately, calculations of conditional distributions P(Xi |x−i , y, x̂, z, θ, β, , h, ),
P(θ|y, x̂, z, β, , h, x), P(β|y, x̂, z, θ, , h, x), P(|y, x̂, z, θ, β, h, x), and P(h|y, x̂, z, θ, β, , x) are rel-
atively easy. Therefore, a Gibbs sampler algorithm is used to construct the joint posterior distribu-
tion. Gibbs sampler is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which repeatedly samples
a set of random variables conditional on the values of all other random variables. It is particularly
useful when sampling from conditional distributions is convenient.

tions. The posterior is an interaction of the three. When  > 0, i.e. allowing for measurement error,
if the network data highly favors an ideology different from x̂i , it is possible for the posterior to
override the prior, i.e. a posterior mode at k 6= x̂i . This can be viewed as a data-oriented correction
of measurement error. Similarly,

where nkl,q =        1≤i<j≤n max{1(xi         = k, xj = l), 1(xi = l, xj = k)}1(yij = q) is the number of edges
with transfer amount wq between PCs of ideologies k and l. Constructing the posterior distribution
of β is more delicate. β is essentially the coefficient vector in a Probit regression model, whose
posterior distribution does not have an analytically convenient form. Therefore, instead of directly
sampling from a closed form distribution, a data augmentation strategy introduced in Albert and
Chib (1993) is used. First, sample auxiliary variable u = {uij }1≤i<j≤n from the following truncated
normal distributions:
                                        
                                        N (γ(xi , xj , zi , zj )0 β, 1)|uij > 0 if yij > 0

                                        N (γ(x , x , z , z )0 β, 1)|u < 0 if y = 0.
                                               i j i j                ij       ij


   Conditional on the auxiliary variable u, the posterior distribution of β is given by:


                      β|y, x̂, z, θ, , h, x, u ∼ N (τ −2 I + Γ0 Γ)−1 Γ0 u, (τ −2 I + Γ0 Γ)−1 ,
                                                                                             
                                                                                                                 (33)


where Γ = γ(xi , xj , zi , zj )0 1≤i<j≤n .
                               

   The Gibbs sampler algorithm is summarized below:

   1. Initialize x0 , θ 0 , β 0 , 0 , h0 .

   2. Iteratively sample from conditional posterior distribution. Specifically, in iteration t, we
      sample one set of parameters (xt , θ t , t , ht , β t ) with the following procedure:

        (a) Sample {xi }t1≤i≤n sequentially from distribution
             P(Xi |y, x̂, z, θ t−1 , β t−1 , t−1 , ht−1 , xt1 , ..xti−1 , xt−1       t−1
                                                                            i+1 , ...xn ) using (27) and (28).

        (b) Sample vector θ t from distribution P(θ|y, x̂, z, β t−1 , t−1 , ht−1 , xt ) using (29).

        (c) Sample t from distribution P(|y, x̂, z, β t−1 , ht−1 , xt , θ t ) using (30).

        (d) Sample vectors ht from distribution P(h|y, x̂, z, β t−1 , xt , θ t , t ) using (31)

        (e) Sample auxiliary vector ut from distribution P(u|y, z, β t−1 , xt ) using (32).

        (f) Sample vector β t from distribution P(β|y, x̂, z, xt , θ t , t , ht , ut ) using (33).

   3. Burn in the first T1 iterations. Use samples from iterations T1 + 1 to T1 + T2 to construct
      posterior distribution.

The first step initializes the Markov chain. The initial values should not affect the steady state and
can be determined either at random or by other algorithms. We use the former in our application.
The second step simulates the Markov chain by repeatedly sampling one parameter conditional


                                                             35
on the values of all other parameters. The sampling order of the parameters is arbitrary, and a
different order can be used, e.g. one can sample θ before x. In order to speed up convergence,
we use the newly sampled parameter immediately in the following sampling procedures and do not
wait until the next iteration, e.g., xt sampled from (a) is used in the sampling of θ t in (b). The
final step discards the initial portion of the Markov chain, namely the first T1 iterations, where
steady state is not reached. Pooling the remainder samples gives an approximate joint posterior
distribution P(θ, β, , h, X|y, x̂, z).


5     Monte Carlo Evidence

    In this section, we present Monte Carlo evidence to evaluate the performance of the community
recovery algorithm proposed in Section 4. We conduct four sets of Monte Carlo simulations that
differ in the specifications of the edge formation process and the network size, both of which affect
the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence measure as defined in (18) because they enter the expression of
W (k, l; q) (see Eq. (22)).
    The first three sets of Monte Carlo simulations share a framework that is similar to the homoge-
neous labeled stochastic block model as in Jog and Loh (2015), even though the edge distributions
are not exactly homogeneous due to the introduction of the covariates in the edge formation proba-
bility. Our Monte Carlo results show a strong confirmation of Theorem 1 that CH divergence of 1 is
a sharp threshold for exact recovery. In the first specification, the network edge formation patterns
and the network size imply a CH divergence of 1.0074, and we find that the misclassification rate
is on average 1.10%. The second specification differs from the first one only in the weight distribu-
tion, resulting in a smaller CH divergence of 0.4719 and we find a larger average misclassification
rate of 5.68%. The third specification differs from the second one only in the network size, which
results in a larger CH divergence of 1.7537 and we find a smaller average misclassification rate of
0. In the fourth set of Monte Carlo simulations, the network size is similar to the real data (about
6,000 vertices), and the edge distributions are heterogeneous in a flexible way, resulting in a CH
divergence of 6.0110. This is intended to assess the performance of the algorithm in a data set that
resembles the real data. The results show that the algorithm performs surprisingly well with an
average misclassification rate of 0.0002%, although it is slower due to the scale of the network. We
summarize our main simulation results in the text, but many of the less essential details are left in
Appendices C-F.


Common Specifications Across All Four Sets of Monte Carlo Simulations.                    The spec-
ifications that are common across all four sets of Monte Carlo studies are listed as follows. The

specific results, are presented separately in subsequent subsections.

5.1       Monte Carlo I: 500 Networks with n = 100, CH Divergence Exceeding 1

   In the first set of Monte Carlo simulations, 500 networks are simulated and estimated. They
have network size n = 100, the coefficients in the network formation probability are given by β x =
(−1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0), and the edge’s weight distributions are given by hDem,Dem = hRep,Rep =
hInd,Ind = (0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.45), and hDem,Rep = hDem,Ind = hRep,Ind = (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1). Note that
the specification of β x = (−1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0) implies that the link formation depends on whether
the two vertices are of the same ideology or are of differen ideologies, and fits into the homogeneity
special case we described in Eq. (20). The implied CH divergence according to (21) and (22) is
1.0074 > 1.
   For these simulations, the total execution time is 235,405 seconds (about 65 hours). The speed of
convergence in terms of the number of iterations varies, which is shown in Figure C1 where we plot
the histogram of the number of iterations (including burn-in and posterior) across the 500 networks
we simulated. The distribution of misclassification rates is summarized in Figure C2 and Table C1.24
They are small in general, and in 37.4% of the simulations, there is no misclassification.25 Moreover,
98.8% of the simulations have misclassification rates lower than the measurement error rate 0.05,
which implies that in most cases our algorithm successfully corrects some of the misreports. Table
C2 provides a detailed tabulation of the estimated vs. true ideologies.
   The results above focus only on the posterior mode, and the following analysis further investi-
gates the patterns of the posterior distributions. For the correctly classified vertices, our categorical
classification based on posterior mode is rather precise. Figure C3 shows that the differences in
posterior probability between the highest posterior probability (i.e., the posterior of the true ideol-
ogy) and the second highest posterior probability are highly concentrated around 1. This indicates
that for most of these vertices, the posterior distribution is strongly informative of the true ideol-
ogy. For the misclassified vertices, however, the scales of misclassification vary. Figure C4 shows
that the differences in the posterior probability between the highest posterior probability and the
posterior probability of the true ideology are approximately uniformly distributed between 0 where
the classification is only a bit off and 1 where the classification is far off. This suggests that the mis-
  24
       Estimated ideology is defined as the posterior mode.
  25
    37.4% exact recovery is lower than the theoretical prediction, for several reasons. First, probability of exact
recovery approaches 1 only when network size approaches infinity. In this case, the network size is only 100, which
may be too small. Second, our model is not exactly the same as the model in Jog and Loh (2015) because we
include covariates in the edge formation probability, which is more complicated. Third, we do not use an exact MAP
estimator, which may also introduce approximation error.


                                                              38
classification is likely to be caused by unusual realizations of the networks process rather than the
failure of our estimation algorithm. The randomness in the network formation renders the ideology
information unclear or even misleading for some vertices, though this occurs rarely. Additional
analysis of the posterior mean of other parameters are presented in Tables C3-C6. These tables
show that the algorithm recovers the true parameters effectively, except for the weight distribution
parameters hkl . We will show that these parameters will be estimated more precisely as the network
size gets larger in Monte Carlo simulations III (where n = 500) and IV (where n = 6000).


5.2   Monte Carlo II: 500 Networks with n = 100, CH Divergence Less Than 1

   The specifications for the second set of Monte Carlo simulations are the same as those for
the first set except for the weight distributions hDem,Dem , hRep,Rep and hInd,Ind . Specifically, the
edge’s weight distributions are given by hDem,Dem = hRep,Rep = hInd,Ind = (0.2, 0.15, 0.35, 0.3),
and hDem,Rep = hDem,Ind = hRep,Ind = (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1). Again, 500 networks with size n = 100
are simulated and estimated. The implied CH divergence according to (21) and (22) decreases to
0.4719, which is now less than 1.
   The total execution time for these simulations is 418,322 seconds (about 5 days). The speed of
convergence in terms of the number of iterations is relatively slow; Figure D1 depicts the histogram
of the number of iterations (including burn-in and posterior). Figure D2 and Table D1 summarize
the distribution of misclassification rates across the 500 simulations. Comparing with Monte Carlo
I, the misclassification rates are higher; for the worst case, the misclassification rate is as high as
24%. Only 2.8% of the simulations have 0 misclassification. This is consistent with the theoretical
prediction of Theorem 1 that a CH divergence lower than 1 is associated with low probability
of exact recovery. Table D2 provides a detailed tabulation of the estimated vs. true ideologies
in this set of Monte Carlo simulations. Figure D3 plots, for the correctly classified vertices, the
histogram of the difference in posterior probability between the highest posterior probability (i.e.,
the posterior for the true ideology) and the second highest posterior probability. It is shown to be
mostly concentrated at 1, though relative to Figure C3 for Monte Carlo I, the difference is somewhat
more likely to be less than 1 and is more spread out. This indicates that, when CH is less than
1, our categorizations are not as informative even though we obtained the correct classification.
Similarly, Figure D4 plots, for the misclassified vertices, the histogram of the difference in posterior
probability between the highest posterior probability and the posterior probability of the true

I. Additional analysis of the posterior mean of other parameters are presented in Tables D3-D6.
These tables show that the algorithm recovers the true parameters effectively, except for the weight

5.3   Monte Carlo III: 500 Networks with n = 500, CH Divergence Exceeding 1

   The specifications for the third set of Monte Carlo simulations are the same as those of Monte
Carlo II except for the network size. Now we simulate 500 networks, each with a network size of
n = 500. As a result of the increase in the network size, the implied CH divergence according to
(21) and (22) is now 1.7537, which is larger than 1.
   The total execution time for these simulations is 31,974 seconds (about 9 hours). The speed of
convergence is fast in terms of the number of iterations (ranging from 600 to 900); Figure E1 depicts
the histogram of the number of iterations (including burn-in and posterior). The misclassification
rates in all 500 simulations are 0. Therefore, this set of simulations over-perform the previous
two in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy rate. Figure E2 plots the histogram of the
difference in posterior probability between the highest posterior probability (i.e., the posterior for
the true ideology) and the second highest posterior probability for the correctly classified vertices
(which are all vertices because of 0 misclassification rate). The difference is almost completely
concentrated at 1, indicating that our categorization based on posterior mode is very informative;
in fact, for 99.9976% of the correctly classified vertices, the posterior probability on the true ideology
is 1. Additional analysis of the posterior mean of other parameters are presented in Tables E1-E4.
These tables show that the algorithm recovers the true parameters effectively, including the weight
distribution parameters hkl (see Table E3).


5.4   Monte Carlo IV: 100 Networks with n = 6, 000, CH Divergence Exceeding 1

   In the fourth set of Monte Carlo simulations, we make several important changes. First, we
increase the network size to n = 6000, which is comparable to the size of the political contribution
network in our data. Also importantly, we deviate from the symmetry in the within-community and
between-community link formation probabilities. Both changes are intended to assess the perfor-
mance of our estimation algorithm in an environment that resembles the actual data. We again sim-
ulate and estimate 100 networks. Specifically, the coefficient in the network formation probability is
given by β x = (−3, 1, 1, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3), and the edge’s weight distributions are given by hDem,Dem =
hRep,Rep = (0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5), hInd,Ind = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25), hDem,Rep = (0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1), and
hDem,Ind = hRep,Ind = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1). Using expressions (18) and (22) to evaluate pairwise
divergence between ideology communities, we have DL+ (θ, W (Dem), W (Rep)) = 13.1003, and
DL+ (θ, W (Dem), W (Ind)) = DL+ (θ, W (Rep), W (Ind)) = 6.011, and thus the CH divergence
6.011 > 1.


                                                   40
    The total execution time for the fourth set of simulations is 930,673 seconds (about 11 days ). The
speed of convergence is fast in terms of the number of iterations (ranging from 600 to 900); Figure
F1 depicts the histogram of the number of iterations. Therefore, the long execution time is a result
of heavy computation in each iteration, not the number of iteration. Misclassification rates are 0 for
99 simulations, 0.0167% (i.e., 1 vertex is misclassified) for 1 simulation. For the correctly classified
vertices, the numerical posterior distributions of ideology are degenerate in the true ideology. For
the only vertex that is incorrectly classified in this set of simulations, the difference between the
highest posterior probability and the posterior probability of the true ideology is 0.13. These results
suggest that the simulated data exhibit strong information on the community structure, and that
our algorithm is efficient in identifying this structure. Additional analysis of the posterior mean
of other parameters are presented in Tables F1-F4. These tables show that the algorithm recovers
the true parameters effectively, including the weight distribution parameters hkl .
    To summarize, our algorithm has excellent performance when the data is generated with CH
divergence greater than 1. It has reasonably good performance even when the data is generated
with CH divergence lower than 1. The results also suggest that a large network is not necessarily
undesirable. On the one hand, it brings in more computational burden and increases the runtime;
on the other hand, it also embodies more information and speeds up the convergence.


6     Empirical Implementation and Results

6.1    Empirical Implementation.

    We empirically infer the ideologies of 5,806 PCs from the giant component in the campaign
finance network depicted in Figure 3. There are 3 categories of ideologies: Democratic, Republican,
and Independent. For the small number of PCs whose self-reported affiliations do not belong to
these categories, we treat them as if we do not observe their report. The set V o contains PCs
with self-reported affiliations x̂i ’s. We assume the following functional form for the edge formation

where the first term is a constant characterizing the baseline connection probability between Demo-
cratic and Republican PCs; the second to the sixth terms characterize the connection probabilities
for other ideology pairs; the seventh and the eighth terms capture the effect of the two PCs be-
longing to the same state or industry; the ninth to the sixteenth terms capture the effects of PCs’
institutional characteristics: whether one of them is a House campaign, a Senate campaign, a
Presidential campaign, a qualified PAC, a qualified Party, a national committee, authorized by a
candidate, or a joint fundraiser; and the seventeenth to the nineteenth terms capture the effect of
both PCs’ budgets on link formations probability, which is a restrictive form of that in (8) and
assumes that the effect of financial and institutional characteristics are the same across ideological
pairs. The main reason for this parsimonious specification is to reduce the computational inten-
sity. The estimation results do not seem to show signs of severe mis-specification. The transfer
amount Yij is discretized into multiples of $500, and can take values of {0, 1, 2, ..., 100} where 100
includes all the transfer higher than $50,000. The initial values in the Gibbs sampler are randomly
generated, and different sets of initial values are used.


6.2    Estimation Results: Posterior Mean and Standard Deviations.

   Table 10 presents the posterior mean and standard deviation of β, the coefficients in edge for-
mation probability. The second to the sixth coefficients are all positive, indicating that Democratic
and Republican PCs (the baseline case) have the lowest connection probability. Additionally, the
Democratic PCs have stronger within party connection than the Republican PCs. Moreover, In-
dependent PCs have a higher probability of connecting with Democratic or Republican PCs than
other Independent PCs. It is also interesting to note that, everything else equal, pairs of Republican


                                                          42
PCs are less likely to form a link than Republican/Independent or Democratic/Independent pairs
of PCs.
   Tables 11 and 12 present the posterior mean and standard deviation of θ, the unconditional
probability of ideology; and , the measurement error. Tables 11 shows that in the population of all
PCs, 40.01% are Democratic, 42.74% are Republican, and 17.24% are Independent. The posterior
standard deviations of these estimates are small. Table 12 shows that the self-reported ideologies
of the PCs are likely to be erroneous with probability 7.37%.
   Due to the large number of parameters in the weight distribution function, we present the
estimates of h in Figure 10, which shows the posterior means of all the values of (hkl,1 , ..., hkl,100 )
for all k, l ∈ {Dem, Rep, Ind} pairs graphically.

and the posterior means of θ, β, h, we calculate the implied Chernoff-Hellinger divergence:


                                                   DL+ (θ, W (Dem), W (Rep)) = 14.7760,

                                                        DL+ (θ, W (Rep), W (Ind)) = 22.4425,


and thus the CH divergence is 14.7760 > 1. Therefore, the data generating process, corresponding
to our estimated parameters, satisfies the condition for exact recovery as stated in Theorem 1.

   Using the posterior mode as a point estimate of the ideology, Table 13 presents the cross tabula-
tion of all PCs according to self-reported and estimated ideology. Overall, 90.70% of our estimates
match the self reports: 94.36% for self-reported Democratic PCs, and 89.49% for self-reported
Republican PCs.

6.4    Re-examining the Network Statistics Using Estimated Ideologies

   In Section 3, we presented the network statistics based on self-reported ideologies for those
PCs that self reported their ideologies. Here we re-examine these statistics based on estimated
ideologies of all PCs. Conditional on the estimated ideologies, the empirical distribution of transfer
amount is shown in Figure 11, and the mean of each distribution is shown in Table 14. On average,
the transfer amount is the highest for Democratic PC pairs and Republican PC pairs, and this is
partially due to the heavy tail of the within-party contributions. The transfer amount is smaller
between Democratic and Republican PCs, and smallest when it involves Independent PCs. This
is consistent with the estimates on connection probability. Independent PCs have overall high
connection probability, but the associated transfer amount is small. Democratic and Republican
PCs have relatively lower within-party connection probability, but the associated transfer amount
is larger.

connections with (estimated) Democratic, Republican, and Independent PCs respectively. In Fig-
ures 12-14, we plot the distributions of numDem (dark bar), numRep (white bar), and numInd
(gray bar) for different groups of PCs, focusing on the difference between self-reported and esti-
mated ideologies. The left panel in Figure 12 presents the distributions for PCs that self reported
to be Democratic, and the right panel for PCs that did not self report but are estimated to be
Democratic PCs. Figures 13 and 14 are similar, but for Republican and Independent PCs respec-
tively. Qualitatively, the degree distributions have similar patterns for self-reported and estimated
PCs with the same ideology. As a robustness check, we redo the analysis above, with each con-
nection weighted by transfer amount. Specifically, for each PC, we calculate its total amount of
transfer to and from (estimated) Democratic, Republican, and Independent PCs respectively, and
then plot the distributions of these numbers for different groups of PCs. The histograms are shown
in Figures 15, 16, and 17, respectively for Democratic, Republican and Independent PCs. Again,
the distributions are similar for self-reported and estimated PCs with the same ideology. These
results demonstrate that PCs without self-report, classified according to our estimation results,
behave similarly to PCs with the corresponding self reports of affiliations.

         Ideologies

   Now we analyze the posterior distribution of political ideology. Figure 18 plots, for PCs whose
estimates are the same as the self reports (i.e., the reported ideology has the highest posterior
probability), the distribution of the differences between the highest and the second highest posterior
probability. These differences concentrate around 1, meaning the posterior probabilities concentrate
on the self-reported affiliation. This confirms that we do not obtain these classifications by luck. We

do a similar analysis in Figure 19, for PCs whose estimates differ from the self reports, by plotting
the distributions of the differences between the highest posterior probability and the posterior
probability of the reported ideology. These distributions have larger spread, but still a mass around
1. This indicates that these are not “near misses”: our estimate strongly favors an ideology different
from the PC’s self-reported ideology.


Diagnostics of the Discrepancy.                                                                 We further investigate the reason for the discrepancy between
our estimates and the self reports by comparing PCs with different estimated ideology but the same
self reported affiliation.
   First of all, their financial conditions are different. Table 15 shows that self-reported Democratic
PCs that are estimated as Republican are mostly PCs with high budget, and self-reported Demo-
cratic PCs that are estimated as Independent are mostly PCs with low budget. Similarly, among
self-reported Republican PCs, the ones estimated to be Democratic or Independent are mostly PCs
with lower budget.
   Second, their contribution patterns are different. For each PC i, we define DemSharei as its

RepShare, and IndShare for different groups of PCs. As a robustness check, we also calculate the
shares in terms of transfer amount and present the results in the same table. The table supports
our categorization of some PCs as Republican (Democratic) whose self-reports are Democratic
(Republican) because they have significantly higher shares of connections with the Republican
(Democratic) PCs, a pattern exhibited by all estimated Republican (Democratic) PCs.

   Next, we will discuss the discrepancy in more detail case by case. The discrepancies will fall
into one of six cases, as shown in the panel label of Figure 20. Figure 20 depicts the distribution
of the number of connections with PCs with different ideologies according to our estimates.
   In the first case, some self-reported Democratic PCs are estimated to be Republican. In the data,
these PCs have a small number of connections with PCs that self reported affiliations, most of which
are Democratic. However, they are mostly connected with PCs without self reported affiliations,
most of which are Independent by our estimates. As our estimate β suggests, Republican PCs have
the highest connection probability with Independent PCs. Therefore, although they self reported
to be Democratic and are connected with few self-reported Republican or Independent PCs, their
overall contribution patterns are close to that of the Republican PCs. In the degree distribution
presented in Figure 20 for this case, it can be seen that the tail distribution is very close to that of
the self-reported Republican PCs in Figure 13.
   In the second case, some self-reported Democratic PCs are estimated as Independent. Only one
of these PCs has one connection with another Independent PC, and the rest have no connection with
Independent PCs. According to estimate β, classifying them as Independent, rather than Demo-
cratic, better rationalize this pattern because Independent-Independent connection probability is
lower than Democratic-Independent connection probability.
   In the third case, some self-reported Republican PCs are estimated as Democratic. These PCs
have similar number of connections to all three classes of PCs, with slightly more Democratic
connections. Their number of connections to the Republican and the Independent PCs are not


                                                  52
jointly high enough to be estimated as Republican.
    In the fourth case, some self-reported Republican PCs are estimated as Independent. These PCs
have more connections with Republican than Democratic PCs, but not large enough connections
with Independent PCs to be estimated as Republican. In other words, they do not exhibit the heavy
tail on connection with Independent PCs which is observed for other self-reported Republican PCs.
    In the fifth case, some self-reported Independent PCs are estimated as Democratic. These PCs’
numbers of connections with Democratic PCs significantly outweigh that with the Republican and
Independent PCs. There are not large enough connections with Republican PCs to be estimated
as Independent.
    In the sixth case, some self-reported Independent PCs are estimated as Republican. These PCs
do not have large enough connections with Democratic PCs to be estimated as Independent.


Discussion.     Here we present and analyze the discrepancy between our estimate and the self-
report, in an attempt to better understand the implications of our model and algorithm. We are
not making a claim that these PCs strategically misreported their party affiliations. We show that
under our model, their contribution patterns to other PCs are different from the majority of the
PCs self reporting the same affiliation as they did. Simplifications in our model are also potential
reasons for the discrepancy. For example, our model does not capture all aspects of the incentives in
political contribution between PCs. Additionally, we only study the contributions among PCs, and
do leave out other campaign activities such as collection of individual contribution and independent
expenditures. In Appendix G we list the PCs that self reported to be Democratic (Republican),
but are estimated to be Republican (Democratic).


7     Conclusion

    About two thirds of the political committees registered with the Federal Election Commission do
not self identify their party affiliations. In this paper we propose and implement a novel Bayesian
approach to infer about the ideological affiliations of political committees based on the network
of the financial contributions among them. In Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that our
estimation algorithm achieves very high accuracy in recovering their latent ideological affiliations
when the pairwise difference in ideology groups’ connection patterns satisfy a condition known
as the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. We illustrate our approach using the campaign
finance record in 2003-2004 election cycle. Using the posterior mode to categorize the ideological
affiliations of the political committees, our estimates match the self reported ideology for 94.36%
of those committees who self reported to be Democratic and 89.49% of those committees who self

   Since PCs are required to report to the FEC the financial contributions among each other, our
proposed methods to infer the ideological affiliations of political committees via financial contribu-
tions network can be implemented readily. To the extent that the estimated ideologies for the PCs
are close to their true latent ideologies, our estimated PC ideology can fill the missing “ideologies”
problem for researchers who are interested in studying individuals’ political contribution patterns
using FEC’s “Contributions by Individuals” data. Moreover, since our estimation methods can be
implemented using data from only one election cycle, we can estimate the ideological affiliations of
the same PCs using data from different election cycles. This would allow us to study the possible
evolutions of ideological affiliations of PCs over time. We can also exploit the permanent presence
of the national committees such as Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican Na-
tional Committee (RNC) and use their network links as a vehicle to study the possible changes of
party platforms that are not necessarily reflected in official documents. These are exciting areas
for future research.

Appendix A                 Construction of Variable industry ∗

   We construct PCs’ characteristic “industry ∗ ” using the industrial breakdown information from
OpenSecrets.org. Their breakdown has three nested levels - from coarse to fine - “sector”, “in-
dustry”, and “category”.        26   We define variable industry ∗ to be the sector for PCs in sectors that
are relatively homogeneous such as agricultural business. We define industry ∗ to be a finer level,
industry or category, for PCs in sectors that are relatively heterogeneous such as miscellaneous
business. The reason is that we use interaction term “same industry ∗ ” in our analysis; and we
want, within each industry ∗ , similar level of heterogeneity. A detailed description of the construc-
tion of the variable industry ∗ is given below, and the corresponding codebook is given in Table
A1.

  1. industry ∗ =sector if:
        A PC belongs to one of the following sectors: Agribusiness, Communications/Electronics,
        Construction, Defense, Energy & Natural Resources, Finance, Insurance & Real Estate,
        Health, Labor, Lawyers & Lobbyists, Transportation.

  2. industry ∗ =industry if:

         (a) A PC belongs to the Miscellaneous Business sector.
         (b) A PC belongs to the Other sector, but not in the Other industry.
         (c) A PC belongs to the Ideological/Single-Issue sector, but not in one of the following in-
              dustries: Misc Issues, Republican/Conservative, Democratic/Liberal, Leadership PACs,
              Candidate Committee.

  3. industry ∗ =category if:

         (a) A PC belongs to the Other industry in the Other sector, but not in the Other category.
         (b) A PC belongs to the Misc Issues industry in the Ideological/Single-Issue sector.

  4. industry ∗ =NA if:27

         (a) A PC belongs to one of the following sectors: Unknown, Joint Candidate Committee,
              Party Committee, Candidate, Non-contribution.
         (b) A PC belongs to one of the following industries in the Ideological/Single-Issue sector:
              Republican/Conservative, Democratic/Liberal, Leadership PACs, Candidate Commit-
              tee.
         (c) A PC’s sector, industry and category are all Other.

 26
      The codebook is available at https://www.opensecrets.org/downloads/crp/CRP_Categories.txt.
 27
      We define the interaction term “same industry ∗ ” to be 0 if one or both PCs’ industry ∗ s are NAs.

Appendix B              Contribution Limit

   Contribution limits for the 2003-2004 Election Cycle are given in Table B1.28 They differ by the
identity of the contributor and that of the recipient. As a contributor, individual, national party
committee, non-national party committee, multicandidate PAC, and non-multicandidate PAC have
different contribution limits. As a recipient, candidate or candidate committee, national party
committee, non-national party committee, and other PC have different contribution limits. As
shown in the table, there is no limit for contribution between party committees, national or local.
For the rest of the contributions between PCs, the limits range from $2,000 to $25,000, most of
which are set at $5,000.

     1   A contribution earmarked for a candidate through a political committee counts against the original contributor’s limit for
         that candidate. In certain circumstances, the contribution may also count against the contributors limit to the PAC. 11 CFR
         110.6. See also 11 CFR 110.1(h).
     2   No more than $37,500 of this amount may be contributed to state and local party committees and PACs.
     3   This limit is shared by the national committee and the Senate campaign committee.
     4   A multicandidate committee is a political committee with more than 50 contributors which has been registered for at least 6
         months and, with the exception of state party committees, has made contributions to 5 or more candidates for federal office.
         11 CFR 100.5(e)(3).
     5   A federal candidate’s authorized committee(s) may contribute no more than $1,000 per election to another federal candidate’s
         authorized committee(s). 11 CFR 102.12(c)(2).
     6   Combined limits are shared by federal accounts of all other state and local committees of the same party in the same state.

Appendix H              Alternative Model: No Measurement Error, but with
                        Hold Out Sample

   In this alternative model, we randomly select 200 PCs in V o to be the holdout sample. Addi-
tionally, we assume no measurement error, i.e.,  = 0 and xi = x̂i when x̂i is available. We estimate
this model pretending x̂i is not available for the holdout sample. In order to assess our estimates,
we compare the estimated posterior distribution and the self report for the holdout sample.
   Posterior distributions of β, θ, h are summarized in Table H1, H2, and Figure H1.

to be Republican.
           In this part, we analyze the posterior distribution of political ideology. Figure H2 plots, for
PCs whose estimates are the same as the self-reports (i.e., the reported ideology has the highest
posterior probability), the distribution of the differences between the highest and the second highest
posterior probability. These differences concentrate around 1, meaning the posterior probabilities
concentrate on the self-reported affiliation. This confirms that we do not obtain these classifications
by luck.
           We do a similar analysis in Figure H3, for PCs whose estimates differ from the self-reports,
by plotting the distributions of the differences between the highest posterior probability and the
posterior probability of the self-reported ideology. The distributions for PCs which self reported
to be Democratic (Republican) but are estimated as Republican (Democratic) are concentrated
around 0, indicating that these are “near misses”.
           Finally, Table H4 and H5 list the PCs that self reported to be Democratic (Republican), but
are estimated to be Republican (Democratic).
