                                          ABSTRACT

We study the impact of the 1918 Spanish Flu on U.S. stock prices. We use the death rate to
control for the impact of the global pandemic and war news reported in the New York Times to
capture the positive effects of the end of World War I on stock prices. Using a new weekly hand
collected NYSE stock price index, we show that there is a -.73 correlation between the aggregate
stock market and the death rate. Furthermore, vector autoregressions demonstrate that the death
rate can explain up to 24 percent of the forecast error variance in the aggregate stock index from
September 1918 until the end of the pandemic in March 1920. We also find that the flu had a
significant, but varied impact on nine NYSE sectors. The empirical analysis indicates that
pandemics can matter big time for stock prices.

I. Introduction



       We provide an historical perspective on the impact of a global pandemic on stock prices.

The Spanish flu was the deadliest pandemic of the twentieth century. It killed approximately 2

percent of the global population and 675,000 Americans over a two-year period that covered four

waves of the virus. We examine the effect of the 1918 Spanish Flu on the aggregate U.S. stock

market given that the influenza was the last global pandemic that is similar in magnitude to the

current coronavirus outbreak. Our study uses a new weekly, equally-weighted stock index of 149

firms constructed from stock prices taken from the New York Times. Simple descriptive statistics

suggest that the pandemic may have mattered big time for stock prices given that the simple

correlation coefficient between the log death rate and the log of the aggregate stock index is -.73




                                                                                                                                                                                          2
from September 1918 to March 1920. The nine NYSE sectors in our sample also have

correlation coefficients with the flu variable ranging from -.40 to -.76.1

         We focus on the impact of the virus on the aggregate stock market as opposed to GDP

because macroeconomic data are often only available at the annual frequency for this time period

and of questionable quality given that national income accounting was developed in the post-

World War II period. Furthermore, the aggregate stock market has been shown to forecast future

economic activity (Fama 1990; Schwert, 1990). Our new weekly U.S. stock index provides high

frequency identification and a window into the effects of the influenza on the aggregate stock

market as well as different stock market sectors.2

         An empirical analysis of the Spanish flu is potentially complicated by the fact that the

grip was concurrent with the end of World War I. It is likely that the influenza had a negative

impact on stock prices while asset prices increased in value with good war news and an end to

the World War. To separately identify the two factors, we estimate vector autoregressions to

measure the dynamic impact of the Spanish flu and World War I on U.S. stock prices. We use

the death rate to control for the impact of the grip on stock prices and war news reported in the

New York Times to capture the effect of World War I on asset prices. We employ vector

autoregressions for the empirical analysis since we have a small number of stock sectors (9), and

a much larger number of weeks (81 weeks) in the data sample.

         The empirical analysis demonstrates that the Spanish flu had a large impact on the stock

market. Specifically, we find that the Spanish flu can explain 24 percent of the forecast error

variance in the aggregate U.S. market from September 1918 until March 1920. Furthermore, we

find that the pandemic had a significant, but varying impact across nine NYSE sectors. We also

find that war news increased stock prices as the Allies marched to victory in the fall of 1918.

Overall, the analysis suggests that the 1918 Spanish flu had a large negative impact on U.S. stock

prices and probably depressed the market for more than a year.

       We begin the empirical analysis with a brief history of the pandemic in the United States.

Then we provide a description of the data used in the study. This is followed by an empirical

analysis of the 1918 Spanish flu using vector autoregressions. We then conclude the study with a

discussion of the implication of the results for asset returns and pandemics.



II. A Brief History of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic



       As the U.S. scaled up training and troop deployments in the last year of World War I, a

novel influenza virus began spreading. Detected in Kansas in March of 1918, the new influenza

spread through the Army training camp in Fort Riley, Kansas: Over 100 soldiers became ill in

March and the number of flu cases increased five-fold within a week (CDC, 2018). The first

public mention of the pandemic came in April 1918 with 18 cases and 3 deaths in Haskell,

Kansas. The U.S. military grew to 4.7 million soldiers by April 1918, and dozens of camps

across the U.S. trained tens of thousands of troops at a time creating ideal conditions for

spreading the virus through the military. As the war continued, hundreds of thousands of

soldiers traveled to Europe each month. The first wave of the influenza made little news in the

U.S., and U.S. cases waned over the summer. Through the spring and summer of 1918




                                                                                                  4
newspapers published articles about the "grip" and "German sickness" ­ all focused on the

spread of flu in Europe and often emphasized its negative impact on the enemy.

       By September, the second wave arrived back in the US, appearing first in military bases

in the Boston area. "By the end of September, more than 14,000 flu cases are reported at Camp

Devens--equaling about one-quarter of the total camp, resulting in 757 deaths" (CDC, 2018).

Again, the close quarters facilitated the spread of the virus among the troops, and the movements

of troops continued to transport the virus back across the Atlantic to the U.S. The autumn 1918

wave brought far more infections, community spread, and high death rates. According to a "war

department" analysis at the time, the pervasive outbreaks of flu among enlisted men cost the

Army 8,743,102 work-days in 1918 alone (Byerly, 2010).

       The flu struck and spread to different regions across the country, depending both on

transportation patterns and on the mitigation measures different cities took. Some locales closed

gathering places (movies, theaters, pubs, and some types of schools), required masks in public,

and forced sickened individuals and whole families into quarantine. Some cities hosted mass

war victory celebrations, which caused huge spikes in infections and deaths.

       The third wave developed over the winter and spring of 1919. San Francisco recorded

1,800 new cases and 101 deaths in the first five days of January (CDC, 2018). Even President

Wilson was stricken, collapsing at the Versailles conference in April 1919. Flu subsided over the

summer of 1919 but more cases emerged over the subsequent winter, creating a fourth wave that

continued into the early months of 1920--clearly evident in the "death rate" shown in Figure 1.




                                                                                                  5
III. Data



        The data come from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) database detailed in Fohlin

(2019). The data used in this paper include transaction prices for all common stocks that traded

on the NYSE every Friday from 1918 through 1920. The full dataset covers 1911-1925 and

incorporates all data reported in the New York Times stock tables: The data include the full

company names with details on type of security (preferred, rights, trust certificates), ex-dividend

days, ex-rights days, and any other details; number of shares traded ("sales"); first and last

transaction prices, as well as high and low transaction prices; and the quoted bid and ask prices

prevailing at the close of the market. Our total market index is an equally-weighted average of

149 stocks that had no more than two weeks in which they did not trade. The sample covers the

period September 1918 through March 1920 for a total of 81 weekly observations.

        We employ weekly death rates from influenza and pneumonia for 35 cities in the United

States. The data are taken from Collins et al. (1930). Our sample begins in September 1918, the

first month for which there is weekly mortality data from the flu, and ends in March 1920 after

the end of the fourth wave of the pandemic. War news is defined as the weekly number of

newspaper stories (article, display ad, editorial article, front page and letter to editor) that

mention terms related to World War I in the New York Times from September 1918 to March

1920. To construct this variable we searched the ProQuest Newspaper Archive for stories that

contained the following keywords: i) "world war" or "Great War" or "European War", and ii)

one of the following terms : "deaths" or "casualties" or "military conflict" or "invasion" or

"blockade" or "killed in action" or "fatalities" or "killed in battle".




                                                                                                    6
IV. Empirical Analysis



       We begin the empirical analysis by looking at simple descriptive statistics for the variables

used in the empirical analysis. Table 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for the aggregate

stock market and control variables. The equally-weighted stock index has a mean value of 65.11

and a standard deviation of 7.26. The death rate variable has a mean of 581.37 and a standard

deviation of 907.38. The flu variable has a large standard deviation which reflects the dramatic

rise in deaths with the outbreak of the grip in August and September 1918. The log of the pandemic

covariate has a -.73 percent correlation with the log of the aggregate stock index. The war news

variable has a mean of 2.21 and a standard deviation of 1.53.

       Next, we estimate vector autoregressions (VARs) to analyze the dynamic effects of the

Spanish flu on U.S. stock prices. We use VARs because our data sample has a small number of

stock sectors (9) and a much longer time series of asset prices (81 weeks). The makeup of the data

series strongly suggests time series methods as opposed to a panel analysis that relies primarily on

the cross-section for identification. Formally, we estimate the following specification:

                    Yt = A0 + A1Yt ­ 1 + (...) + APYt ­ P + t,   t ~ N(0, )                       (1)

where Yt is a vector of macroeconomic variables described below, A0 is a matrix of intercept

coefficients, and A1 through AP are matrices of coefficients relative to each lag of Y, ranging

from 1 to P. To obtain causal relationships between the variables of the VAR, we estimate

equation (1) and map the reduced-form shocks t into structural shocks applying a Cholesky

decomposition of the variance-covariance matrix . This procedure--known as recursive

identification implies that the ordering of the variables matters for determining the dynamic

relationships between the VAR variables.




                                                                                                        7
         We specify a three-variable vector autoregression (VAR) that includes the log of the

equally-weighted stock price index of NYSE firms (NYSE), a World War I news variable

(NEWS), and the log of the death rate (DEATH). The sample covers the period from September

1918 until the end of March 1920. We select a lag length of 2 weeks based on the Akaike

Information Criteria (AIC). The impulse responses show the impact of a one-standard deviation

shock to the death rate and war news on stock prices along with 68 percent confidence intervals.

We give the log of the equally-weighted index the first ordering since asset prices quickly

respond to new information. War news is given the second ordering since World War I predates

the outbreak of the Spanish flu. This means that the log of the death rate is given the third

ordering.3 The impulse responses for the aggregate stock market are reported in Figure 2. A one-

standard deviation shock to the death rate reduces the equally-weighted stock index. A shock to

the war news variable also has a statistically significant effect on stock prices. As for the forecast

error variance, we find that the death rate can explain 24 percent of the movements in stock

prices after 16 weeks. On the other hand, the war news variable can only account for about 3.7

percent of the fluctuations in stock prices4. The significant, but small impact of the war news

variable may be explained by the fact that World War I ended three months into our sample

period. If flu data were available starting in 1918, it is likely that war news would have a much

larger impact on stock prices. Another possibility is that lags of the aggregate stock market index

might also capture the positive effect of war news on asset prices.




3
  The empirical results are robust to giving death rate the second ordering in the Cholesky decomposition. Details
are available from the authors by request.
4
  The results are robust if we restrict the sample to years 1918 and 1919. Death rate can explain 42 percent of the
movements in stock prices after 16 weeks, while war news can explain 4 percent of the fluctuations in stock prices.
Also, at 90% confidence level, death rate continues to have a robust and significant effect on stock prices, while war
news has no effect.


                                                                                                                     8
Overall, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the Spanish flu had a large and negative impact

on the aggregate stock index. 5

         We follow-up the baseline analysis by examining the impact of the Spanish flu on nine

sectors of the New York Stock Exchange. The nine sectors are automobile, consumer products,

light manufacturing, mining and oil, other manufacturing, railroads, steel, trade and services, and

utilities. We use the equally-weighted index to control for overall market conditions. Table 2

reports summary statistics for the nine NYSE sectors. The mean index value ranges from 33.84

for mining and oil sector to 111.19 for trade and services. The standard deviation ranges from

2.56 for mining and oil to 20.40 for automobiles. The log of the nine sector indices has a

correlation coefficient ranging from -.40 to -.76 which indicates a strong statistical relationship

between the pandemic and the aggregate stock index.

         Figure 3a shows the impulse responses of a given sector to a one-standard deviation

shock to the log of death rate. We give the log of the sector index the first ordering, followed by

the log of the market index, war news, and the log of the death rate.6 Table 3 shows the forecast

error variance for each of the nine sectors. Figure 3a shows that the death rate significantly

lowers the automobile index. The Spanish flu can explain 17.7 percent of the movements in the

automobile index after 16 weeks. Second, the consumer products index presented in Figure 3a

significantly falls in response to a one-standard deviation shock to the flu variable. The death rate

can account for 23.3 percent of the movements in the consumer products index after 16 weeks.

With respect to light manufacturing, Figure 3a shows that the death rate significantly reduces the

light manufacturing sector. The death rate can account for 13.9 percent of the movements in the


5
  We also looked at the impact of mitigation measures on stock prices. Mitigation measures included public

they explain less than one percent of the forecast error variance in stock prices

light manufacturing sector index after 16 weeks. A shock to the death rate presented in Figure 3a

significantly decreases mining and oil. The grip can explain 23 percent of the movements in the

industrial index after 16 weeks. An increase in the death rate significantly reduces the other

manufacturing sector in Figure 3b, explaining 19.1 percent of the movements in the sector after

16 weeks.

       The railroad index also shown in Figure 3b significantly falls in response to a one-

standard deviation shock to the influenza variable. The flu can explain 5.7 percent of the

fluctuations in the railroad sector. In addition, the steel sector presented in Figure 3b declines

following a shock to the death rate. The influenza variable can explain 13.4 percent of the

movements in steel. A shock to the death rate significantly reduces the trade and service index.

The death rate can account for 21.4 percent of the movements in the trade and service index after

16 weeks. Finally, the utility sector falls in response to a shock to the death rate. The flu

variables explain 24.1 percent of the fluctuations in the utility sector.

       With respect to the impact of war news on stock prices, Figures 4a and 4b show that a

one-standard deviation shock to war news has a statistically significant effect on four of the nine

sector indices. A one-standard deviation shock to war news significantly increased consumer

products, light manufacturing, steel, and trade and services. War news can explain 5.5, 3.7, 2.0,

and 6.3 percent of the forecast error variance (FEVD) for the four sectors at a sixteen-week

forecast horizon, respectively.

       The rise in the U.S. stock market in 1918-1920 also reflects the return to a peacetime

economy that was shifting from producing guns to butter. Trading activity on the NYSE, for

example, grew rapidly at the end of World War I and the early 1920s. The number of actively

traded common stocks increased from roughly 150 to 250 between 1918 and 1920. Meanwhile,




                                                                                                     10
volume (number of shares traded) rose from an average of 380 thousand shares in the 1911-14

period to nearly 870 thousand shares on average in the 1919-22 period. Dollar volume, in

nominal terms, rose less dramatically, from an average of $37 million per day in the early period

to about $55.5 million per day in the post-war period.



V. Conclusion



       We examine the effect of the 1918 Spanish flu, a global pandemic, on U.S. stock prices.

We estimate simple vector autoregressions to assess the impact of the influenza on firms that

traded on NYSE using a new weekly stock price index collected from the New York Times as

well as news articles to control for the impact of the end of World War I. Simple summary

statistics show that there a -.73 correlation between the log of the death rate and the log of the

aggregate stock index. Then we estimate vector autoregressions that demonstrate that the grip

can explain up to 24 percent of the forecast error variance of the aggregate U.S. stock market

after 16 weeks. We follow-up the aggregate analysis by examining the effect of the influenza on

nine NYSE sectors. The analysis shows that the pandemic had a significant and negative impact

on all nine sectoral indices. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the Spanish flu mattered

big time for U.S stock prices from 1918-1920.
