                  Unemployment, Unsatisfied Demand for Labor, and
                 Compensation Growth in the United States, 1956—1980




                                ABSTRACT



      This paper presents two key facts which call into question the

 value of unemployment rates as barometers of labor market tightness.

 First, while both unemployment rates and unsatisfied labor demand

 proxies perform reasonably well on their own in compensation growth

 equations, in models which include both, only the unsatisfied demand

variable appears to matter. Second, the past decade's outward shifts

 in Phillips plots can to a substantial degree be tied to outward

 shifts in plots pairing the relevant unemployment rate and unsatisfied

demand proxies. The paper also provides results which indicate that

Phillips relationships which are defined in terms of unsatL'fied

demand variables appear to be somewhat more stable than those using

unemployment rates.

     Taken together, our findings have a clear message for those

concerned with macroeconomic theory and policy: labor market pressure

on wages can be more reliably assessed by looking at measures of

unsatisfied labor demand than by looking at the unemployment rates

on which most earlier analyses have focused.

     Virtually all empirical analyses of short run aggregate wage growth

have an unemployment rate at their heart.' What lies behind the expected

inverse relationship between unemployment and the rate of growth in wages?

The following quotation clearly presents the standard rationale for

including an unemployment rate variable in wage growth regressions: "In

a given labor market, wages tend to rise under conditions of excess demand,

fall with excess supply, arid remain constant when excess demands are zero.

Since the aggregate unemployment rate is a good indicator of the general

state of labor markets, as unemployment decreases, more and more markets

come into a state of excess demand and the general pace of wage inflation

increases.

     For an unemployment rate to in fact be "a good indicator of the general

state of labor markets," two conditions must be satisfied. First, a given

unemployment rate must represent the same number of available units of

labor at each point in time. Second, the relationship between the number

of available units of labor and labor market tightness must remain constant,

which implies that there must be stability in the relationship between

number of units of labor available and unsatisfied labor demand. Thus,

if the unemployment rate does not mirror the number of available units

of labor or if the importance of structural unemployment changes over

time, the unemployment rate will not be a good indicator of wage pressure

from labor market imbalance.

     This paper presents evidence concerning the use of various unemployment

rates as barometers of tightness in the labor market. In Section I, we

demonstrate that proxies for the unsatisfied demand for labor (the help
                                                                       2




wanted index and the manufacturing quit rate) perform at least as

well as either the official or the prime age male unemployment rate

when entered alone in wage growth regressions. Moreover, we find

that in regressions which include both an unemployment rate and a

measure of unsatisfied labor demand, the unemployment rate does not

matter while the unsatisfied demand proxy does. The second section

presents evidence which strongly suggests that, at least for the

United States, a substantial fraction of the growing instability

in Phillips relationships (again defined in terms of either the

official or prime age male unemployment rates) can be linked to

growing instability in the relationship between unsatisfied

labor demand and the relevant rate of unemployment. Furthermore, the

relationship between our unsatisfied demand proxies and

the rate of compensation growth appears to have been more stable

than the relationship between unemployment and the rate of

compensation growth. In sum, measures of employers' unsatisfied

labor demand dominate measured unemployment rates as indicators

of wage pressure emanating from labor market conditions. Section

III discusses the interpretation of our empirical findings. The

paper's concluding section discusses the main implication of our

analysis for:macroecoflomic theory and policy, that labor market

pressure on wages can be more reliably assessed by looking at

measures of unsatisfied demand than at the unemployment rates

which have played the key role in earlier analyses, and emphasizes

the need for new microdata if we are to fully understand why.

 I.    Compensation Growth and Its Correlates


      Most economists would think it important to consider the role of "tight"

versus "loose" labor markets as part of any study of wage growth. Since the

appearance of Phillips' very influential 1958 article, most econometric

analyses of wage growth have attempted to gauge the degree of labor market

tightness with an unemployment rate variable. An alternative approach

would be to use available proxies for the unsatisfied demand for labor to

assess how tight labor markets are. In this section, two such variables

are experimented with. These unsatisfied demand variables perform well

when they replace the unemployment rate in standard compensation growth

equations. Of greater interest, however, is the finding that in compensaticn

growth equations which include both an unemployment variable and an

unsatisfied demand proxy, only the unsatisfied demand variable matters.



      Model Specification


      While the rationale for including an unemployment rate variable in wage

growth equations is not always clearly stated, the most prevalant notion

seems to be that the unemployment rate should be highly correlated with the

degree of excess demand in the labor market. A similar argument might be

made regarding the inclusion of some measure of employers' unsatisfied

demand for labor in place of an unemployment rate variable. A priori,

such a measure should be at least as likely as any unemployment rate to

be highly correlated with the excess demand for labor.

      The labor market variable which has most commonly appeared in wage

growth equations is the official unemployment rate. One important question
                                                                              4




is whether the official (total civilian labor force) unemployment rate

adequately reflects the availability of qualified potential employees.

Various researchers have argued that women and teenagers are less likely

to possess, or to be seen as possessing, requisite oh skills and comrdtment

than prime age males. This line of reasoning h8s lead many to believe that

the prime age male (men 25 to 5L) unemloYment rate might he a better variable

                                                official rate.
to use in wage growth equations than the

     As mentioned above, measures of the unsatisfied demand for labor

could be substituted for the unemployment rate in wage growth models.

One likely candidate for the job of measuring the degree to which employers'

demands for labor are unsatisfied is the job vacancy rate.       Another possible

unsatisfied demand measure is the fraction of employers' work forces choosing

 to leave their jobs during a given time period. Some job vacancies arise

 because a new job has been created rather than because someone has quit and

 the job vacancy rate reflects both the flow and the duration of job openings,

 so that the vacancy rate and the quit rate will not mirror each other

 perfectly. Nonetheless, the quit rate should be highly correlated with

 the seemingly better unsatisfied demand proxy, the vacancy rate.

      The first compensation growth equations presented in this paper include

 either an unemployment rate:

                                       n
      (1) w/w      c. +               2 l.(f/p)
                            B(l/u) + j=l j      t—j

 or an unsatisfied demand variable:

                                       n
      (2) i/w =    c.   +   (l/d) + j=l Ij (a/p) t—j
 where 1/w is the rate of growth of nominal hourly compensation, u is the chosen

 unemployment rate, d is the chosen unsatisfied demand proxy,               is the rate

 of inflation in period t—j, and c, 3, y and the 1. are regression coefficients.
                                                                            5



 The reasoning behind including labor market variables in wage growth equations

 stated above implies that 3 should be positive (unemployment negatively

 related to the rate of wage growth) and that y should be negative (unsatisfied

 demand positively related to the rate of wage growth).

     One way to ascertain whether unemployment rates or our unsatisfied demand

 proxies represent better measures of labor market tightness might be to include

both together in estimated Phillips—type equations. For this reason, perhaps

 the most interesting wage growth regressions presented in this paper are those

which include both an unemployment rate and a measure of unsatisfied demand.

The relevant regression model can be written as:


     (3) /w =       +    (l/u) +   y(l/d)   +
                                                .X.(/p)
where all the variables are defined as above.



     The Role of Inflation


     We have included either four or sixteen lagged inflation values ((k/p).

terms) in the compensation growth equations presented in this paper instead of

a single variable intended to capture the expected rate of inflation in the

current period ((/p)). There are several considerations which lead us to

this course of action.

     First, there is rio generally accepted expected inflation series which we

could have used even had we wanted to. The usual approach to generating an

expected inflation series is to assume that people expect a current rate of

inflation equal to some distributed lag function of past inflation, with the

distributed lag weights based on previous inflation history. This seems

unrealistic insofar as many factors other than past rates of inflation will

have an effect on current inflationary expectations. One way to construct a

more realistic expected inflation series might be to survey a random sample
                                                                           6


of the population on a regular basis, asking those surveyed what they expect

the average rate of inflation to be over the period until the next such

survey. Unfortunately, reliable data of this sort have not been collected.3

      Suppose we could have obtained a time series which accurately

captured expectations each period regarding the rate of inflation in

the immediately subsequent period. Even if the rate of wage growth

reflected only labor market conditions and expectations regarding

inflation, more than the single expected inflation variable just

described should play an important role. For one thing, in a world

where union wage contracts are typically set for three years at a

time, some period t wage changes may reflect period t price change

expectations generated up to three years earlier, rather than period t

price change expectations based on information through period t—l.

A similar situation will exist in nonunion establishments to the

extent that across—the--board wage increases may occur only at annual

intervals. Entering a large number of lagged inflation terms (we

experiment with as many as sixteen) may allow us to capture the

price change expectations which should have existed at the time

the oldest union contract still in force as of period t would have

been negotiated, at least to the extent that price change expectations

are a function of past price changes. Including a single (Ip)

variable based on a rolling ARIMA or other mechanistic model using price

data through period t—l would have been considerably more restrictive.

      Perhaps more fundamentally, there is no clear reason why

quarter t wage changes should reflect only quarter t expected price

 changes. Particularly where workers remain attached to the same

 employers over relatively long time periods,4 moiey wanes may reflect

 the expected pace of inflation over some longer horizon but not

 necessarily during a single quarter. One would expect the parties

 negotiating a wage bargain in period t to be concerned about the
                                                                          7

expected rates of inflation in periods t, t+l, t+2, and so on through

period t+n, the end of the relevant time horizon. Again, entering lagged

inflation terms rather than a single (IIp) term based on inflation

through period t—l allows added flexibility; the coefficients on lagged

price terms may reflect their influence on longer term as well as on

current period inflationary expectations.

      Finally, to the extent that inflation is not always perfectly

foreseen, past rates of inflation may play an important role in their

own right rather than solely because they influence expectations.

Under many union contracts, cost of living adjustment (COLA) clauses

provide for wage increases tied directly to the rate of inflation;

union members covered by COLA clauses ar€ thus at least partially protected

against unforeseen price increases. Where prices have grown faster

than wages, both union and nonunion workers may receive "catch—up"

wage increases that are independent of what the rate of inflation is

expected to be in the future. The existence of both COLA and "catch—up"

wage increases provides an additional rationale for including lagged

inflation terms in wage growth equations.

      To summarize, the two main reasons we chose to specify our wage

growth equations with lagged inflation values rather than a single

(/p)e variable are, first, that no generally accepted expected

inflation series is available and, second, that the relationship

between inflation and wage growth is almost certainly much more

complicated than could be captured by including a single price

expectations variable in the model.

    Data Used for Model Estimation


    Throughout this study, we use both the official unemployment rate

(which refers to the entire civilian labor force) and the prime age male

unemployment rate (which refers only to male civilian labor force members

who are between 25 and 54 years old). Two variables serve as unsatisfied

demand proxies (the d variable in equations (2) and (3)):   the help wanted index

and the manufacturing quit rate. The help wanted index is used as a

vacancy surrogate since no suitable vacancy series is available. This

index is based on counts of help wanted advertisements printed in the

classified sections of leading newspapers in approximately 50 Standard

Metropolitan Statistical Areas.5 One potential problem with using the

help wanted index rather than actual vacancy data is that affirmative

action pressures may have led to greater advertising of available job

openings, particularly after the AT&T consent decree was signed in 1973,

so the help wanted index may have trended upwards relative to the number

of vacancies. Any decline in the price of newspaper advertisements relative

to the price of other methods of recruiting employees would also have a

similar effect. The fact that forces other than affirmative actior can

affect the amount of help wanted advertising done by employers is consistent

with the paths of the normalized Canadian help wanted index and

 Canadian job vacancy rate during the period from the beginning of

 1971 through the end of 1978; the help wanted index

 seems to have trended uDwards somewhat relative to the vacancy

 rate after 1974. Note that the help wanted index as reported by the Conference

 Board is a proxy for number of vacancies, not the vacancy rate; to create a

variable that we could use as a rate proxy, we divided the published help wanted

 index by the number of employees on nonagricultural payrolls.6 Monthly quit
rate information exists only for the manufacturing sector; these data are collected

by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in its "Monthly Report on Labor Turnover".7

      Recall that our estimating equations are written with the rate of growth

in nominal compensation as the dependent variable and
                                                        lagged inflation

terms on the right hand side. The hourly compensation series we used for

calculating *1w, the rate of growth in nominal compensation, was generated

by BLS; they divided total compensation of nonfarm business sector

employees as reported in the National Income and Product Accounts by the

total number of payroll hours in private nonagricultural establishments.

The employee compensation figure in the National Accounts includes wages

and salaries, employer contributions to social insurance programs such

as Social Security and unemployment insurance, and other labor income

such as employer contributions to private pension and welfare funds.8

      As noted above, we entered either four or sixteen lagged inflation

variables into all our regression models. As far as the choice of an

appropriate price deflator series to use for cDnstructing these lagged

inflation terms, it is important to note that in a world with more

than one commodity, the price series that is relevant for suppliers

of labor will very likely differ from the price series that is

relevant for demanders of labor. One would expect labor suppliers

to be concerned about their earnings relative to the price of the

bundle of commodities they consume, whereas labor demanders should

be concerned about the wages they pay relative to their product

prices. Using lagged inflation terms based on the Gros Natiohal

Product (CNP) deflator thus seemed like a reasonable compromise

between the price relevant to consumers and the price relevant to

producers.
                                                                           10



     The Data Resources, Inc. (DRI) computer system was the source of all

of the data and programs used in conducting the analyses under discussion.

All of the reported regressions were fit on the DRI system with seasonally

adjusted quarterly data for 1956:1 through 1980:3 and were estimated using

a maximum likelihood correction for first—order serial correlation.9



     Compensation Growth: Unutilized Supplyersus Unsatisfied Demand


     Table 1 presents compensation growth equations which include a single

labor market variable and either four or sixteen lagged inflation terms

based on the GNP deflator. The official unemployment rate, the prime age

male unemployment rate, the help wanted index and the manufacturing quit

rate are each entered in inverse form as alternative measures of labor

market conditions. The unemployment rate variables consistently assume

the expected positive sign and the unsatisfied demand variables uniformly

take on the expected negative sign. The official unemployment rate

coefficient is not statistically significant in the model with four

lagged inflation terms; it achieves statistical significance in

the model with sixteen lagged inflation terms.1° All of the

prime age male unemployment rate, help wanted index and

manufacturing quit rate coefficients are statistically

significant. The 's for the unsatisfied demand variable models are

consistently larger than the R2's for the unemployment rate models.

This would seem to suggest that the unsatisfied demand variables work

better than the unemployment rates we have used; however, the magnitude

of the differences in R's between the two sets of models are small,

so no strong conclusion regarding the relative strength of the various

 labor market variables seems warranted on this basis alone.1

are uniformly negative, though never significant.    The prime age male unemployment

rate performs just as poorly as the official unemployment rate, even though

some have argued that it is a better indicator of unutilized

labOr supply. In contrast, all of the coefficients on the two

variables we have chosen as proxies for the level of unsatisfied demand,

the inverse of the help wanted index and the inverse of the manufacturing

quit rate, are of the expected negative sign and statistically significant.12



     The Sensitivity of Our Results to Alternative Spçifications


     Thus far we have explicitly or implicitly made a number of assumptions

about the "proper" specification of the compensation growth models we have

estimated. Fortunately, our central conclusions appear to be quite robust

with respect to alternative plausible specifications.

     The key compensation growth (i/w) models presented in the text included

an unsatisfied demand variable (either the help wanted index or the quit

rate) in inverse form (lid). We chose this functional form because it

matched the way the unemployment rate is usually entered in this sort of

regression (as 1/u) and because regressions with both d and d2 as independent

variables indicated that 'z/w increases with d at a decreasing rate. We

did replicate all of the relevant Table 1 and Table 2 models with d or

log d replacing lid; our qualitative results were completely unaffected

by this substitution.

    Another question which might be raised concerning the results presented

is whether the Perry—weighted unemployment rate might not be a better variable

to use than either the official or the prime age male rate.13 Through 1978:4, the

last quarter for which we could calculate the Perry—weighted unemployment

rate, the Perry—weighted and the prime age male unernplyment rates were

correlated .991. Not surprisingly, substituting the Perry—weighted rate

for the prime age male rate did not alter the message of our results.

     A third possibility we considered was that unemployment and/or our

unsatisfied demand variables might affect /w with some lag rather than

concurrently. To determine whether allowing for delayed impacts would

alter our central conclusions, we re—estimated each of the models in Table 1

and Table 2 with four lagged values of 1/u and four lagged values of l/d

added wherever a current value of 1/u or 1/d appeared. The sums of the

coefficients on the 1/u variables and l/d variables were uniformly very

similar to the 1/u and l/d coefficients in our original models.

     A fourth specification issue which seemed potentially important was

that, as has been suggested by Robert J. Gordon and George Perry,

certain periods during the past two decades are likely to have had

below or above average wage growth because of events which would not
                                                  14
make their way into a normal wage growth model.        Respecified models

which included dummy variables for each of three periods (1964:1 to

1966:2, when the Johnson guideposts were in effect; 1971:3

to 1972:4, the Nixon controls period; and 1974:2 to 1975:1, quarters

during which our country witnessed very sharp increases in oil prices)

produced conclusions no different than those based on the original

regressions.
                                                                             15




     Another question which might be raised regarding our results is

whether the higher rate of growth in hourly compensation associated with

increases in either the help wanted index or the quit rate actually

reflects higher base wage rates as opposed to greater use of overtime

hours and thus more time worked for premium pay. From the point of view

of understanding what factors lie behind inflation, the answer to this

question may not be particularly important. Nevertheless, we did try

adding a measure of average weekly overtime hours in manufacturing to

each of those models which included an unsatisfied demand variable. The

overtime hours variable was always completely insignificant and none of

the affected 1/u or l/d coefficients increased or decreased appreciably.

It should also be noted that the inverse of this overtime hours variable

performed in very much the same way as the inverse of the help wanted index

or the inverse of the quit rate when used alone as a proxy for unsatisfied

demand in models like those in Table 1 and Table 2.

     A sixth issue which deserves mention is our choice of an inflation

series to appear on the right hand side of our compensation growth models.

We picked the GNP deflator in an attempt to strike a compromise between

the prices most relevant to labor suppliers and the price most relevant to

labor demanders. Redoing the Table 1 and Table 2 analyses with a more

"supplier oriented" price index (the Implicit Consumption deflator,

considered vastly superior to the Consumer Price Index because of its

treatment of housing expenditures) and then again with a more "demander

oriented" price index (the Wholesale Price index) changed none of our

conclusions.

     Thus, the central implications of the compensation growth equations

reported in Table 1 and Table 2 appear to be quite robust with respect to
                                                                           16




the precise model specification used. When entered separately, both

unemployment and our unsatisfied demand variables perform in the expected

fashion, with unemployment negatively and unsatisfied demand positively

related to the rate of compensation growth (although inevery instance but

one the R2's in the unsatisfied demand models were larger than the 2's in

the comparable unemployment models). However, in equations which include

both an unemployment rate variable and an unsatisfied demand proxy, only

the unsatisfied demand variable matters. We will wait until Section III

to discuss a possible interpretation of these results.



II. Observed Instability in the Phillips Curve Relationship


     One empirical phenomenon which has received considerable attention

during the past decade has been the breakdown in the Phillips

relationship.15 This event is consistent with the hypothesis of Milton Friedman

and Edmund Phelps that revisions in inflationary expectations will cause outward

shifts in the short run Phillips curve)0 While inflation is

clearly important, we believe that a substantial fraction of the

outward shift in the Phillips curve may be linked to an outward shift

in the inverse relationship between unemployment and the unsatisfied

demand for labor. Furthermore, the relationship between unsatisfied

demand and compensation growth appears to have been more

stable than the relationship between unemployment and compensation

growth.



     Plots of the Shifting Phillips Curve

readers: the rate of growth in compensation associated with any

given value of the official unemployment rate has been substantially

higher since 1970 than prior to that date. The curve linking percentage

change in average hourly compensation to the official unemployment rate

appears to have shifted outward first in 1970 arid then again in 1974; a

smaller backward shift seems to have occurred after 1976.

        As demonstrated in Figure lB, the relationship between the rate of

growth in compensation and the prime age male unemployment rate has

exhibited a similar shift pattern. Sharp outward shifts in 1970 and

1974 appear to have been followed by a smaller backward shift after

1976.

        The question we are interested in answering is whether the observed

shifts in both the official unemployment rate and prime age male

unemployment rate Phillips relationships are somehow related to changes

in the relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied demand. There

is at least good circumstantial evidence which suggests that this

question should be answered in the affirmative.



        Plots of the Shifting Relationship Between Unemployment

        and Unsatisfied Demand


        Figure 2 presents plots relating each of our two unsatisfied demand

proxies for the United States, the normalized help wanted index and the

manufacturing quit rate, to the official United States rate of unemployment.

In both plots, the points from 1958 through 1969 seem to lie more or less

along a single curve. Both plots exhibit a dramatic shift outward in 1970,

which is when the first obvious outward shift in the official unemployment

rate Phillips relation occurred.17 The help wanted index versus official

unemployment rate plot shifts sharply outward again after 1974, but the

quit rate versus official unemployment rate plot does not. As was mentioned

earlier, the volume of help wanted advertising may have increased during

the middle and late 1970's because of increased affirmative action pressures;

this could have caused the post—1974 shift in Figure 2A even if there were

no shift in the underlying vacancy versus unemployment relationship. The

outward shift in the official unemployment rate Phillips curve which

occurred in 1974 thus might better be linked to the sharp increase in the

price of oil around the same date than to labor market changes. The

quit rate versus official unemployment rate plot may have shifted

slightly backwards after 1977; no backward shift appears in the help

wanted index versus official unemployment rate plot. As noted earlier,

the official unemployment rate Phillips relation appeared to shift

backward after 1976.

     Figure 3 presents plots like those in Figure 2 ,   except with the
prime age male unemployment rate substituted for the official unemployment

rate. While the shifts in the Figure 3 plots are somewhat less pronounced

than those in Figure 2, their timing is very similar. The same connections

can be drawn between each of the two unsatisfied demand proxy versus prime

age male unemployment rate plots and the prime age male unemployment rate

Phillips curve plot as were drawn between the relevant pairs of official

unemployment rate plots.

     It is interesting to note that the relationship between unsatisfied

demand and unemployment seems also to have been quite unstable in a large

number of other developed countries. Beveridge curve (job vacancy rate

versus overall unemployment rate) plots for Canada, the United Kingdom,

Japan, France, Norway, Finland and Australia all clearly exhibit sharp outward

shifts during the late 1960's and early 1970,8.18 It would be of considerable

interest to conduct a careful exploration of whether these Beveridge

curve shifts might also be linked to movements in the relevant countries'

Phillips curves.

     While looking at pictures is interesting, quantifying the extent to

which shifts in the United States' official unemployment rate and prime age male

unemployment rate Phillips relationships might be linked to the shifting

relationship between these unemployment variables and unsatisfied demand

can perhaps better be accomplished econometrically. Let us turn to the appro-

priate regressions.



     Econometric Evidence Regarding the Shifting Phillips Curve


     To summarize the magnitude of the overall shift in the Phillips

relations shown in Figures 1A and lB, we estimated equations of the

following form:


     (4) /w         a + 13(lIu) + St,



where u is either the official or the prime age male unemployment rate and

t is a time trend. The estimate of cS from the official rate regression

indicates that    the   annual rate of wage growth associated with any given

level of unemployment grew by approximately 6.1 percentage points between

1956 and 1980. Over the same period, the similarly estimated shift in

the prime age male relationship was approximately 5.7 percentage points.

     Adding an unsatisfied demand variable to equation (4) is one

approach to estimating the extent to which these upward shifts can

be linked to the changing relationship between unemployment and

unsatisfied demand. The relevant regression is:


     (5) i/w =          a +     (1/u) + cSt + Y(1/d),


where d may be either the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing

quit rate and the other variables are as before. To the extent that

the outward shifting of the relationship between /w and 1/u, indicated

by >0 in equation        (4),   can be linked to the shifting   relationship
                                                                              23


 between 1/u and l/d, the estimate of    in equation (5) should fall toward

 zero. Introducing the normalized help wanted index variable into the

 official rate equation reduced the magnitude of the estimated time trend

 by 20 percent; adding the manufacturing quit rate variable reduced the

official rate equation time trend by 29 percent. In the prime age

male models, the introduction of the inverse of the help wanted index

knocked the estimated time trend down by 23 percent and adding the

inverse of the manufacturing quit rate lowered the estimated time trend

by 25 percent. Thus, this approach suggests that between 20 and 30 percent

of the observed upward shift in these Phillips relationships may be

linked to the shifting relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied

demand.

     Econometrically estimated Phillips curves more typically include

a variable or variables intended to capture the impact of the rate of

inflation. In this paper we have focused primarily on augmented Phillips

curve equations containing either four or sixteen lagged inflation

terms. An alternative approach to assessing the role of the shifting

relationship   between unemployment and unsatisfied demand would be to
look at the time trend remaining after lagged inflation terms have
been introduced into the wage growth model, then to add an unsatisfied

demand variable to see whether it can knock out the residual time

time trend in the augmented model.

     The first and fourth columns of Table 3 contain regressions of

the following form estimated using the official unemployment rate and

either four or sixteen lagged inflation terms:

 lagged inflation terms (column (1)) implies that the annual rate of wage

 growth associated with any given level of the official unemployment rate

 would have been approximately 2.1 percentage points higher in 1980 than

 in 1956, even if the four previous quarters' inflation rates had been

 the same. The point estimate of the time trend coefficient in the model

 with sixteen lagged inflation terms (column (4)) implies that the annual

 rate of wage growth would have been approximately 1.2 percentage points

 higher in 1980 than in 1956, again holding the official unemployment

rate and the relevant inflation rate history constant. The coefficient

in the model with four lagged inflation values is strongly significant,

but when sixteen lagged inflation values are included in the model, the

time trend coefficient loses its significance. The point estimates of

these time trends are 66 percent and 81 percent smaller than the time

 trend in the crude Phillips curve with no lagged inflation terms based

on the official unemployment rate, which means that a residual shift

between 19 and 34 percent of the total remains to be explained.

     If this residual shift is related to the outward shift in the

relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied demand, then adding

l/d to equation (6), which gives:


     (7) /w =       + (l/u) + 1X (b/p)       + at + y(l/d)


should drive S to zero. Columns (2), (3), (5), and (6) of Table 3

report coefficient estimates for equations with either the inverse

of the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing quit rate

added to our augmented Phillips equations based on the official

unemployment rate. The point estimate of the time trend coefficient

remaining after either of these unsatisfied demand variables has

been introduced is either very close to zero or negative (in the
                                                                             26




model with sixteen lagged inflation values to which the help wanted index

has been added); none of these estimated time trend coefficients is

statistically significant. The negative time trend in the model which

includes sixteen lagged inflation terms and the normalized help wanted index

might reflect the spurious increase in the level of the index relative to

the vacancy rate which we suspect may have occurred after 1973 or 1974.

In any event, the positive time trend in the augmented compensation

growth models with just the inverse of the official unemployment rate

but no unsatisfied demand variable does seem to disappear once some

control   for the level of unsatisfied demand has been introduced.
     Qualitiatively similar results were obtained from augmented
Phillips   curve equations estimated based on the prime age male

unemployment rate. The augmented Phillips curve equation with four

lagged inflation terms presented in column (1) of Table 4 implies

an upward shift between 1956 and 1980 of 1.7 percentage points in

the annual rate of wage growth associated with any given unemployment

rate (coefficient statistically significant). The comparable model

with sixteen lagged inflation terms presented in column (4) implies

an upward shift of 0.7 percentage points (coefficient estimate not

significant). Thus, changes in the pattern of inflation would appear

to account for between 71 and 88 percent of the total shift in the

Phillips curve relation based on the prime age male rate of unemployment,

leaving an unexplained residual of between 12 and 29 percent of the total.

     As was true with the official rate equations, adding an unsatisfied

demand variable to the augmented prime age male Phillips curve equations

seems to knock out the positive residual time trend. When the help

wanted index variable is introduced, the point estimates of the time trend

 coefficents fall very near zero; adding the quit variable brings the

 point estimates of the time trend coefficients down by roughly 60

 percent. None of the time trend coefficients in the equations which

 include an unsatisfied demand variable is statistically significant.

     Taken as a whole, our econometric results seem supportive of

 the proposition that a substantial fraction of the total observed

 instability in the Phillips curve relations based on both the

 official and the prime age male unemployment rates can be linked

 to shifts in the relationships between those two variables and the

 level of unsatisfied demand.




     The Relative Stability of the Relationship Between_Unsatisfied

     Demand and Compensation Growth


     At this point the question might be asked whether the relationship

between unsatisfied demand (proxied by the help wanted index or the quit

rate) and the rate of growth in compensation has been more stable than

the relationship between unemployment and compensation growth. To answer

this question, we first estimated equations of the following form:


     (8) i/w =    c + y(l/d) + 5t,


which is just like equation (4) except with an unsatisfied demand variable

(l/d) based on either the help wanted index or the manufacturing quit rate

substituted for the unemployment rate variable (1/u). The estimate of S

from the help wanted index regression indicates that the annual rate of
 wage growth associated with any given value of that variable increased by

 approximately 4.9 percentage points between 1956 and 1980; the estimate

 of cS from the quit rate regression implies a comparable upward shift of

 approximately 5.0 percentage points. These shifts are appreciably smaller

 than the 6.1 percentage point shift estimated for the official unemployment

 rate Phillips curve equation with no lagged inflation terms and the 5.7

 percentage point shift estimated for the prime age male unemployment rate

Phillips curve equation with no lagged inflation terms.

     Throughout this paper, we have focused primarily on compensation growth

equations which include a string of lagged inflation terms on the right hand

side. Models with an unsatisfied demand variable, a time trend and lagged

inflation terms:


     (9) /w =       + (l/d) + jlXj (/) + t

are presented in Table 5. In both the help wanted index and the quit rate

models with four lagged inflation values, the time trend coefficient has a

positive point estimate but is not significant. Where the significant

time trend coefficients in the comparable official and prime age male unemployment

rate equations implied upward shifts of 2.1 and 1.7 percentage points,

respectively, in the annual rate of inflation associated with given values

of those variables, the insignificant time trend coefficients in these help

wanted index and manufacturing quit rate equations imply smaller upward

shifts of 0. and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. In models which

include sixteen lagged inflation values, the time trend coefficient in

the help wanted index equation is slightly negative but not significant

and the time trend coefficient in the quit rate equation is extremely close to,

and not significantly different from, zero. The slightly negative or zero

 implied   shifts in the help wanted index and quit rate equations with sixteen

 lagged inflation terms compare to 1.2 and 0.7 percentage point upward shifts

in the analagous official and prime age male unemployment rate equations

respectively, as discussed above. In spite of the problems with our measures

of unsatisfied demand, the Phillips—type compensation growth equations

in Table 5 which contain an unsatisfied demand proxy rather than an

unemployment rate do appear to be relatively more stable than the comparable

equations in Table 3 and Table 4.

     We noted earlier that the help wanted index and the manufacturing quit

rate are most certainly flawed measures of the level of unsatisfied demand

for labor in the economy as a whole. It seems plausible that compensation

growth equations estimated with a better unsatisfied demand variable, in

particular    a well measured job vacancy rate, should one become available,
might exhibit even greater stability. Unfortunately, we cannot test this
hypothesis at present.


     The Sensitivity of Our Results   to Alternative_Specificaticns

     In    order to determine whether the conclusions just reached were

robust with respect to alternative specifications, we reestimated the

equations in Tables 3, 4 and 5 in each of the various ways we had

previously reestimated the Table 1 and 2 equations, as described at the

end of the first section of the paper: with d or log d replacing l/d;

with the Perry weighted unemployment rate rather than the prime

age male unemployment rate; with the current and four lagged values of 1/u

and l/d instead of just the current value of each; with the three special

period dummy variables added to the original models; with overtime hours

added to all equations containing either the help wanted index or the quit
                                                                           32




rate; with overtime hours used instead of the help wanted index or the quit

rate as our unsatisfied demand variable; and with lagged values of either

the implicit consumption deflator or the wholesale price index replacing

lagged values of the gross national product deflator. The conclusions

implied by these alternative sets of models were quite similar to the

conclusions implied by the results we originally presented: in all of

the models with four lagged inflation values and in all but one set with

sixteen lagged inflation values, the standard augmented Phillips curve

seemed to have shifted upwards over time, sometimes by substantially more

than in the models discussed in the text; introducing an unsatisfied

demand proxy into the standard Phillips equations always reduced the point

extimate of the time trend coefficient; and the equations with only

unsatisfied demand variables seemed for the most part to have been more

stable than those with only unemployment rates.

     How should these results be interpreted? How do they relate to the

evidence presented in Section II? In the next section we discuss the in-

terpretation of our findings.



III. Interpretation of findings


     Thus far, we have presented empirical results without seriously

addressing the issue of their proper interpretation. In this section we

first lay out one plausible interpretation of our findings, that the

unemployment rate is a poor measure of the effective unutilized supply

of labor. We then discuss some of the potential reasons why the

relationship between measured unemployment and effective unutilized

labor supply has not been stable.
                                                                                33



     A Possible Explanation


      Suppose the effective unsatisfied demand for labor and the effective

unutilized supply of labor to have been stably correlated with one another.

If the rate of growth in wages had been a stable function of effective

unsatisfied demand and/or effective unutilized supply (for example, the

rate of wage growth might depend of d —   s,   c d —   s, d alone or s alone,

where d represents effective unsatisfied demand and s effective unutilized

supply), then good measures of either variable should serve equally well

in wage growth regressions. One potential explanation of our findings

can be built on the premise that available unemployment rates do not

provide consistent measures of the effective unutilized labor supply.

In particular, it can be hypothesized that the effective unutilized

labor supply associated with any given unemployment rate has fallen

over time.

     Why might there have been a divergence between the unemployment rate

and the effective unutilized supply of labor? Two sorts of possible

changes in the labor market suggest themselves as potentially relevant:

either the number of units of available labor represented by the typical

unemployed person may have fallen or the mismatch between the skills of

unemployed persons and the skills required to fill available jobs may

have become more serious over time.

     What does it mean to say that the typical unemployed person might

represent fewer units of available labor today than previously? Examples

of the sort of problem we have in mind here include declines in the

average number of hours the unemployed wish to work per week or changes

in the attitudes of the unemployed so that they are less eager to secure

employment. In principle, one could deal with these problems by developing
                                                                           34




an appropriate correction factor for each time period; the correct&i period

t unemployment rate would simply equal the raw   period   t unemployment

rate times the fraction of a typical base year unemployed person's

labor supply represented by the typical period t unemployed person. In

the absence of such a correction, the cited problems would be expected

lead to an increase in the amount of unsatisfied demand associated with

any given unemployment rate.

     Alternatively, available unemployment rates might not represent

consistent measures of the effective unutilized labor supply because of

growth in the importance of structural imbalance. One might suppose

that the perceived availability of workers qualified to fill existing

jobs should be reflected in the difficulty which employers experience

in filling those jobs. To the extent that the piece of the unemployment

rate which captures what employers know about the potentially usable

unutilized labor supply is reflected in measures of unsatisfied demand,

the residual piece of the unemployment rate which is uncorrelated with

unsatisfied demand would tell us only about the amount of irrelavant

unutilized labor supply.

     For either of the above sources of divergence between the unemployment

rate and the effective unutilized supply of labor to explain our results,

we must further suppose the normalized help wanted index and the manufacturing

quit rate to measure the effective unsatisfied demand for labor more

consistently than the unemployment rate measures the effective unutilized

supply of labor. The existence of greater total measurement error in the

unemployment rates we have used than in our unsatisfied demand proxies

would be consistent with our result that in wage growth equations which

include both, unsatisfied demand variables matter but unemployment rates
                                                                             35




do not. A positive time trend in the error with which unemployment captures

the effective unutilized supply, that is, a decline in the effective

unutilized labor supply associated with any given level of unemployment,

could explain the positive time trend in estimated Phillips relationships.

Furthermore, if the trend in the measurement error in unemployment rates

is greater than the comparable trend in our unsatisfied demand proxies,

then a measurement error story could be used to explain the somewhat

greater stability of Phillips curves defined in terms of unsatisfied

demand proxies instead of unemployment rates. Most of our results can

thus be explained in terms of a simple time trend measurement error in

unemployment rates. However, a simple trend—related error could not

explain our finding that, even after a time trend is entered into wage

growth models, unsatisfied demand proxies still dominate unemployment

rates when both are present. To explain this result, one must further

suppose there to be some non—trend—related measurement error in unemployment

rates which is greater than the comparable error in our unsatisfied demand

measures. However, any non—trend—related error would not have to be just

noise. For example, a one—time shift in the meaning of the unemployment

rate as a measure of the effective unutilized labor supply would be

imperfectly captured by a simple time trend, leaving a non—trend—related

error component.

     While the story we have just told seems plausible, a measurement

error interpretation of our results may be suspect insofar as it is easy

to believe that our unsatisfied demand proxies might be at least as poorly

measured as our indicators of unutilized labor supply, the official and

prime age male unemployment rates. As stated above, affirmative action

considerations and other factors are likely to have caused some upward
                                                                          36




trend in the ratio of help wanted advertising to effective unsatisfied

labor demand. In addition, neither of our unsatisfied demand proxies

fully reflects all sectors of the economy. The help wanted index is

based on newspaper advertising and some types of job vacancies may be

more likely to be advertised than others; the quit rate we have used is

based on data for just the manufacturing sector. Any divergence between

the degree of effective unsatisfied demand for labor in the sectors

covered by our surrogates and the degree of effective unsatisfied demand for labor

in the economy as a whole would cause measurement error problems with

our proxies. For this reason, we are somewhat hesitant to assert that the

story given above offers the best possible explanation of our findings.



     The   Shifting   Relationship Between Unsatisfied

     Demand and Unemployment


     Suppose it to in fact be true that the relationship between the

effective unsatisfied demand for labor and the effective unutilized supply

of labor has remained stable over time and that our unsatisfied demand

proxies provide consistent measures of the effective unsatisfied demand

for labor. Knowing why the relationship between our unsatisfied demand

proxies and unemployment has shifted outward should then tell us why the

unemployment rate has not been a consistent measure of the effective

unutilized supply of labor and thus why the unemployment rate is dominated

by measures of unsatisfied demand in wage growth equations. While we

cannot fully explain the observed outward shift in the relationship

between our unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment, some of the

 likely causes of the shift can be identified.
                                                                             37




      Readily available data can document that significant demographic

 and unemployment insurance program changes have occurred in the United

 States during the period we are studying)9 The proportion of the

 labor force between 25 and 54 fell from a 1956 to 1960 average of 66

 percent to a 1976 to 1980 average of 61 percent. Female labor force

 participation grew so that women accounted for an average of 33 percent

 of the total labor force during the 1956 to 1960 period and an average

 of 42 percent during the 1976 to 1980 period. If the 1956 to 1960

 period is compared to the 1976 to 1980 period, we observe that employment

 covered under state unemployment insurance (UT) programs grew from an

 average of 78 percent of non—federal civilian wage and salary workers to

an average of 93 percent, accompanied by a roughly constant average

potential duration of benefits for all UI claimants (23.5 weeks versus

23.2 weeks) and a slight increase in the ratio of average weekly UI

benefits to average weekly wages of covered employees (from .34 to •37)20

Unfortunately, hard data on other potentially important changes are not

so readily accessible.

     Changes in the demographic composition of the labor force do seem to

have played an important role in shifting the relationship between our

unsatisfied demand variables and the official unemployment rate. As noted

before, the shifts in the plots of the unsatisfied demand proxies against

the prime age male unemployment rate appear to be less pronounced than the

shifts in the comparable official unemployment rate plots. To summarize

the magnitude of the shifts in these relationships, we estimated equations

of the following form:


     (10) d =
                                                                                38




where d represents either the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing

quit rate, u represents either the official or the prime age male unemployment

rate and t is a time trend. The time trend coefficients imply that the shift of

the normalized help wanted index was approximately 32 percent smaller

against the prime age male unemployment rate than against the official

unemployment rate and that the shift of the manufacturing quit rate was

approximately 40 percent smaller against the prime age male unemployment

rate than against the official unemployment rate.          This would seem to

suggest that the changing age and sex structure of the labor force may

account for a substantial fraction of the shift in the official rate

curves. We also estimated a more complete set of models of the same

form   as   equation (10),   except   with u equal in turn to the official

unemployment rate, the prime age unemployment rate, and the prime age

male unemployment rate. The time trend coefficients from the male

 (prime age male) unemployment rate curves were compared with those

from the official (prime age) unemployment rate curves to assess the

 effect of changes in the sex structure of the labor face; the time

 trend coefficients from the prime age (prime age male) unemployment

 rate curves were held up against those from the official (male) unemployment

 rate curves to gauge the impact of changes in the age structure of the

 labor force. On the basis of these comparisons, it would appear that changes in

 sex structure are associated with factors which can explain between one quarter

 and one third, and changes in age structure with factors which can explain between

 two thirds and three quarters, of the difference between the magnitude of the

outward shifts in the unsatisfied demand proxy/official unemployment rate curves

and the magnitude of the less pronounced outward shifts in the unsatisfied demand

proxy/prime age male unemployment rate curves.20
                                                                             39



        It is perhaps worth noting that shifts in the relationship between

unsatisfied demand and unemployment occurring because of changes in

demographic structure might reflect either a change in the number of

available units of labor represented by the typical unemployed individual

or increased structural imbalance. On the one hand, women, youth or

older persons might desire to work fewer hours per week or be less

committed to finding and keeping a job than others. On the other hand,

these people might simply be less likely to possess (or be perceived

by employers as less likely to possess) requisite job skills. To say

the same thing in a slightly different way, the elasticity of substitution

between prime age male workers and other workers might be infinite but

with a prime age male worker equivalant on average to a larger number

of effective labor units, or alternatively, the elasticity of substitution

between prime age males and others might be less than infinite.

        It seems likely that changes in UI coverage and benefits may have

played a substantial role in shifting the relationship between unsatisfied

demand and measured unemployment. While an investigation for the U.S. has

not yet been completed, research for Canada and Great Britain has linked

outward shifts in those countries' Beveridge curves (which plot the

vacancy rate versus the unemployment rate) to changes in the relevant UI

laws.
        2   Increased generosity of UI benefits is commonly supposed to affect

the eagerness of the typical unemployed worker to secure new employment.

        Other factors, such as a growing mismatch between the requirements of

vacant jobs and the skills of the unemployed, even beyond what might have

been expected given observed demographic changes, appear likely to have

also played important roles in the phenomenon under discussion.23

Unfortunately, at this point we cannot document how large the role of each

of the potentially important factors might he,
                                                                            40




IV.   Conclusions   and Directions


      This paper has presented two key facts which call into question the

value of unemployment rates as barometers of labor market tightness.

First, while both unemployment rates and unsatisfied labor demand proxies

perform reasonably well on their own in compensation growth equations,

in models which include both, only the unsatisfied demand variable appears

to matter. Second, the past decade's outward shifts in Phillips plots

can to a substantial degree be tied to outward shifts in plots pairing

the relevant unemployment rate and unsatisfied demand proxies. We also

found that Phillips relationships which are defined in terms of unsatisfied

demand variables appear to be somewhat more stable than those using

unemployment rates.

      Taken   together, our findings have a clear message for those concerned
with macroeconomic theory and policy: measures of emnlovers' unsatisfied
demand dominate unemployment rates as indicators of how labor market

conditions are likely to affect wage growth.

      Before the 1970's, the choice between various indicators of

labor market tightness had little practical consequence, since the

relationship between unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment

rates was so stable. Moreover, without some independent variation in

the potential tightness indicators, it was not possible to determine which

was "best." This all changed in the past ten years when relationships

between unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment rates broke down in

many countries throughout the world. This event has allowed us to peek

inside the black box which links unemployment rates and compensation

growth. This glimpse has revealed that unemployment rates affect wage
                                                                           41



growth only to the extent that they are correlated with unsatisfied labor

demand and has raised very basic questions about the whole wage growth

process.

     For us to fully understand the determinants of wage growth in our

country, it would seem that the following queries must be addressed: How

exactly does a wage—setting unit determine the rate of wage growth? Which

factors are central and which are tangential in this process? What

information is available to those
                                    determining wages? Does the shifting during
the past decade of the curves which link unsatisfied demand proxies and

unemployment rates reflect a diminished desire to work or growing

structural unemployment? Thus, it appears to us that an analysis of the

issues at hand has as a prerequisite the collection of new microdata.

     This paper has demonstrated that labor market pressure on wages can

be more reliably assessed by looking at measures of unsatisfied labor

demand than by looking at the unemployment rates which have played the

key role in most earlier analyses. However, for now, our understanding

of the reasons for this finding must remain incomplete.
                                                          Nevertheless,
we are confident that the collection and analysis of microdata can lead

to a solution of this macro puzzle.

"The Relation Between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage

Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861—1957", Economica, vol. 25 (November 1958),

pp. 283—299.


      2. This statement of the standard rationale for including an

unemployment rate variable in wage growth models. is taken from William

Nordhaus, "The Worldwide Wage Explosion", Brookings Papers on Economic

Activity, 2:1980, p. 442.


      3. Since 1947, Joseph Livingston, a journalist, has conducted a

small semi—annual survey of economists. mong other questions, on each

survey occasion he has asked these economists what they anticipate the

level of the CPI and the WPI will be roughly 6 and 12 months later. Given

certain assumptions, these level forecasts can be converted into rate—of—

inflation forecasts. There are a number of problems with these predicted

rates of inflation, perhaps the most serious of which for our purposes

is that economists are hardly a random sample of the population.


      4. Based on tenure data collected as part of the Current Population

Survey program, Robert Hall estimates that almost 60 percent of all

 currently employed workers hold jobs which will end up lasting 5 years

or more and that nearly 30 percent hold jobs which will end up lasting

 20 years or more. See Robert E. Hall, "The Importance of Lifetime Jobs in

 the U.S. Economy", Working Paper No. 560 (National Bureau of Economic

 Research, October 1980).

 creating the index can be found in the Conference Board publication, The

      6. The need for normalization is discussed in Malcolm Cohen and

Robert Solow, "The Behaviour of Help—Wanted Advertising", Review of

Economic Statistics, vol. 49 (February 1967), pp. 108—110. They

normalized with the civilian labor force rather than employment.

Our results are quite insensitive to the choice between these two

deflators.

Handbook of Methods, Bulletin 1910 (GPO, 1976), pp. 43—48, for a discussion

of the "Monthly Report on Labor Turnover".


      8. The construction of the employee compensation figures

we used is not at the time of this writing described in

print, although the Department of Commerce will soon publish

a volume describing the derivation of each element in the National

Accounts. Discussion with individuals at Commerce indicated that the

series was produced with wage and supplements information from various tax

forms, censuses, records of some private sector venders, and files of some

professional and trade associations. The total payroll hours data used

in converting these figures to hourly rates came from the "Monthly Report

on Employment, Payroll and Hours", which is discussed on pp. 26—42 of U.S.

Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Handbook of Methods.


      9. We did estimate all of the models reported in the tables of this

paper without any serial correlation correction. The Durbin—Watson statistics

for these equations were often such that we could not readily determine

whether or not the presence of an autoregressive error process was indicated;
                                                                           44




to be on the safe side, we chose to present models incorporating a serial

correlation correction. The parameter estimates in the corrected models

were very similar to those in the ordinary least squares models.


        10. Throughout this paper, when we say a variable is statistically

significant, we mean that it has passed at least a .05 level one—tailed

test.


        11. Earlier papers in which variables such as the manufacturing

 quit rate, the manufacturing layoff rate or the help wanted index have

been substituted for the unemployment rate in wage growth models include

Sara Behman, "Wage Determination Process in U.S. Manufacturing",

Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 82 (February 1968), pp. 117—142;

 Charles L. Schultze, "Has the Phillips' Curve Shifted? Some Additional

 Evidence", Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2:1971, pp. 452—467; and

Martin N. Baily and James Tobin, "Macroeconomic Effects of Selective

 Public Employment and Wage Subsidies", Brookings Papers on Economic

 Activity, 2:1977, pp. 511—541. Each of the cited articles concludes that

 the demand side variable or variables experimented with perform as well or

 better than the unemployment rate in manufacturing sector (Behman)

 or aggregate (Schultze, Baily and Tobin) wage growth equations. Although

 Baily and Tobin also present results for different sectors of the economy,

 these findings seem irrelevant for the present discussion since information

 on help wanted advertising does not exist at the sectoral level.

        12. The results presented in Table 2 are consistent with earlier

 findings reported by Martin Baily and James Tobin. They estimated

 several aggregate wage growth equations using quarterly data for 1958:1

 through 1976:4 which included both an inverse unemployment rate variable
                                                                          45

and   the   help wanted index deflated by total employment; while their

model specification is otherwise rather different from ours, they also

obtain generally insignificant wrong—signed unemployment coefficients

and strongly significant right—signed help wanted index coefficients.

Baily and Tobin also present similar equations for different sectors of the

economy; again, we would argue that these findings are not relevant for the

present     discussion since information on help wanted advertising does not
exist at the sectoral level. See Baily and Tobin, "Macroeconomic Effects
of   Selective Public Employment and Wage Subsidies."

       15. Instability in the Phillips curve may take the form of shifts

in the intercept or changes in the slope. Here we consider shifts in

the intercept. For analyses suggesting that the United States' Phillips

curve has been much flatter    since World War II   than earlier,
                                                                             46

Changing Cyclical Behavior of Wages and   Prices:    1890—1976", American

Economic Review, vol. 70 (March 1980), pp. 7 8—90. Any flattening in the
Phillips curve which may have occurred during the post—war period appears

to have been substantially less pronounced.

       17. Schultze, "Has the Phillips' Curve Shifted? Some Additional

Evidence", looks at quit rate and official unemployment rate data for the

period 1952 through 1971. The article reports that the curve linking

these two rates seems to shift outwards in about 1966 and argues that

this points to a shift in the Phillips relationship likely having

occurred. This last 1960's shift is not obvious in our quit rate/official

unemployment rate plot in part because we omit the data points for 1952

through 1955 so as to be consistent with the time period covered by our

regression analysis and in part because the shift in the quit rate!

official unemployment rate relationship which occurred after 1969 was

much larger than any shift occurring during the late 1960's

      19. Perry, "Changing Labor Markets and Inflation", was the first

to emphasize the importance of the growing proportion of women and

teenagers in the labor force in the context of understanding the

relationship between unemployment and wage growth.


      20. The figures pertaining to the participation rates of teens and

women come from the relevant DRI data bank. The UI program statistics

were provided by the Employment and Training Administration.


      21. Katharine Abraham is currently exploring a cross—section!

time—series data set which may shed additional light on the role played

by demographic changes in shifting the relationship between uisatisfied

demand and unemployment. Preliminary results seem supportive of the

proposition that changes in age structure have been more important than

changes in sex structure.


      22.   See,   for example, Frank Reid and Noah M. Meltz, "Causes of

Shifts in the Unemployment—Vacancy Relationship: An Empirical Analysis

for Canada", Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 61 (August 1979),

pp. 420—425, and "The Changed Relationship Between Unemployment and

Vacancies", Appendix H, British Labour Statistics 1976 Yearbook, which

discuss the shifts in the Canadian and British Beveridge curves sources

are cited in these articles. The cross—section/time series data set

current being explored by Katharine Abraham may yield insight into the

role of unemployment insurance changes in explaining shifts in the

relationship between unsatisfied demand and unemployment in the United

States. Preliminary results seem to support the proposition that increases

in the percent of employment covered by unemployment insurance have played

an important role.
