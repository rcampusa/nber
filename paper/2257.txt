                          Social Security Benefits:
             An Empirical Study of Expectations and Realizations




                                     ABSTRACT



        I employ data drawn   from the   Retirement History Survey to study
the   accuracy of pre—retirement expectations concerning social security
benefits. The major findings of this study are as follows. First,
survey responses to questions about expected benefits are reasonably
noisy. However, when one properly filters out the noise, reported
forecasts appear to explain roughly 60% of the variance in realizations.
Second, consumers do not form expectations on the basis of all available
information. Proper adjustment of forecasts for information contained
in concurrent social security entitlements could reduce the residual
forecast error variance by roughly 15%. The potential gains from
incorporating other information are minimal. Third, individuals do not
ignore or forget information which they have used in the past, and they
tend to form all expectations on the basis of the same information.
Fourth, expectations are highly accurate, given the information that
people do use. Extreme optimism Is uncommon. Surprisingly, expecta-
tions were not abnormally inaccurate during periods of rapid legislative
change. Fifth, of various population subgroups, widows and single women
tend to make both the most conservative and most accurate forecasts.
Married men are least conservative and least accurate. Accuracy and
conservativism are not systematically related to wealth or education.
Finally, individual behavior appears to conform more closely to the
predictions of theory as retirement approaches.

I •   Introduction
      Expectations play a key role in modern life cycle theory. This is

something of an embarrassment to applied economists, since perceptions

are not, in general, directly observable. Little if any existing

evidence sheds light on the plausibility of central life cycle tennets,

which hold that     consumers   think seriously and coherently about the

relatively    distant and uncertain future. The extent to which financial
hardship among the elderly stems from myopia and inept financial
planning therefore remains largely a matter of speculation. In
addition, economists are frequently forced to invoke a variety of strong
assumptions concerning the structure of expectations in order to
identify behavioral models (e.g. many studies are based on the
supposition that consumers understand the Social      Security benefit

formulae,   and form their expectations "rationally").       Specific empirical

results    often depend heavily upon the nature of these assumptions.      An

excellent   example of this appears in the literature on Social Secrity
and personal saving: when employing macroeconomic data, one can obtain
virtually any desired result by altering assumptions concerning
expectations (see Leimer and L.esnoy's [1981] criticism of Feldatein
[1974]).    The   study of expectations is therefore absolutely central to a
comprehensive understanding of life cycle behavior.
      Previous    empirical work on household expectations has focused

primarily on inflation (see Huizinga [1980], Curtain [1982], Gramlich

[1983], and Papadia [19821; Aiginger 11981] considers a somewhat broader

range of variables). To my knowledge, there has       been   no previous
                                        —2—




systematic     analysis of expectations and realizations among the

elderly. Since the concerns and characteristics of the elderly differ

from those of the non—elderly, it would be unwise      to   generalize from

existing evidence when considering problems associated with aging.

        In this paper, I employ data drawn from the Social Security

Administration's Retirement History Survey (RHS) to study the accuracy

of    pre—retirement expectations concerning social security benefits.
This   emphasis on social security is    appropriate, since program benefits
are typically      the most important single financial resource of retired

individuals, comprising on average more than      half of   net wealth (see

Bernheirn    [1987a3).   In a separate piece (Bernheim 11987b]), I examine

the   accuracy of expectations concerning the timing of retirement.
        The major findings of this study are as follows.
        1.   Survey    responses to questions about expected social security
benefits     are   reasonably "noisy". It is extremely important to bear this

in    mind when interpreting the data. When one filters out the noise

appropriately, it appears that consumers do think seriously about future

events, and report expectations which may well reflect, albeit

imperfectly, their true beliefs. Indeed, respondentst forecasts explain

roughly 60% of the variance in realizations.

        2. Consumers do not form expectations on the basis of all

available information. The data strongly suggest that individuals

ignore a great deal of information contained in concurrent social

security   statutes. Proper adjustment for this information could reduce
the   residual forecast error variance by roughly 15%. There is also
                                       —3—




somewhat    weaker evidence that consumers at least partially ignore
certain demographic factors which help to predict future events.
However, the potential gains    from   more refined use of demographic
information   appear minimal——proper adjustment would reduce the residual

forecast error variance by at most 5%.

      3.    The evidence is broadly consistent with the view that

individuals use the same information to form expectations concerning a

variety of different variables (social security benefits, other income,

and date of retirement). When forming expectations concerning social

security,   individuals do not appear to ignore   information upon which

they base other expectations at the same point in time. In addition,

consumers have good memories, in that they do not ignore information

upon which they based expectations at previous points in time.

      4.    People seem to be reasonably competent at forming relatively

accurate expectations conditional upon the information that they do

chose to use. In addition, it is somewhat comforting to note that few

individuals exhibit the kind of extreme optimism that might be

responsible for catastrophic errors in financial planning; indeed, there

is a general bias towards conservativism. Surprisingly, there is very

little evidence to support the   view that expectations were abnormally

inaccurate during periods of significant statutory reform. Indeed, the

data broadly suggest that consumers correctly anticipated the general

effects of legislative action during the early 70's, contrary to the

supposition of most previous authors (see e.g. Hurd and Boskin
                                       —4—




[1981]).      Data on retirement expectations bear this conclusion out

(see Bernheim [198Th]).

        5. Of various population subgroups, widows and single women tend

to form both the most conservative (i.e. low relative to realizations),

and   most accurate (judged by correlations or mean squared errors)
forecasts. The forecasts of married men are the least conservative, and
least accurate. There is no evidence that the          poor, or those with

relatively      little education have particular difficulties forming
accurate expectations.
      6. The properties of reported expectations conform more closely
to theory as retirement grows imminent. This suggests that individuals
may   become more serious about forming expectations with the approach of
retirement.
        The paper is organized as    follows. Section 2 describes a general
conceptual     framework for analyzing social security expectations.

Section      3 contains a description of   the data.   Simple    tabulations of the

raw   data   appear in sectIon 4.   Section   5   contains   regression results

which   permit formal testing of certain aspects of the conceptual
framework. While the results are generally unfavorable, I attribute
this to the noisiness of reported expectations. I take up the issue of
measurement error in section 6, and present new results which motivate

many of the conclusions described above. Section 7 summarizes my
findings, and discusses directions for subsequent research.
                                   —5—




2.    A Conceptual Framework

      It is plainly unreasonable to expect that an elderly person could

predict without error his financial resources several years hence.

Uncertainty is simply a fact of life. For purposes of conducting

behavioral analyses and designing public policy, the relevant issue is

whether individuals have learned to deal with this uncertainty as well

as their circumstances allow. Economists frequently employ the

assumption that households form their expectations "rationally," in the

sense that they are not fooled systematically, and furthermore, that

their forecasts are as precise as possible conditional upon available

information. Given data on expectations, one can test this hypothesis

in a variety of ways. One approach is to determine whether or not

forecast errors are systematically related to information which the

individual possesses (or has access to) at the time his forecast is

made. If they are, then one can actually identify the kind of

information which individuals either ignore, or use improperly. Another

approach is to examine the accuracy of predictions, and to see whether

they become more accurate as knowledge improves. In this section, I

develop these ideas formally.

      Suppose that at each point in time, t =   0,1,...,   T — 1, an

individual forms an expectation, X, about the value of same variable

X, which is realized at time T. During period t, he has access to

certain information, which I denote as      Throughout, I assume that

the individual's memory is perfect, so that all information available at

time t is also available in period v > t.
                                  —6—




      In subsequent sections, I interpret X as social security

benefits, and T as date of retirement.iJ When an individual reports

expected social security benefits, there is, of course, some ambiguity

as to what this means. While he may have in mind something like a

mathematical expectation, it is also possible that his report reflects

his view of the most likely outcome (i.e., the mode). As long as the

distribution of X is approximately symmetric and single—peaked, this

ambiguity is probably of very little consequence. Throughout, I

therefore focus on the hypothesis that individuals report expected

values, i.e.


(1)                         x =   E(X)
      From equation (1), one can derive a number of simple testable

implications, which I summarize below as properties I through 4.


      Property 1: Realizations should exhibit more variability than

forecasts.


      Property 2: The variability of forecasts should increase as the

date of realization approaches.


      Property 3: The variance of the forecast error should decline as

the date of realization approaches.


      Property 4: The correlation between forecasts and realizations

should rise as the date of realization approaches.
                                            —7—



           The intuition for these results is straightforward. Different

 individuals should make different forecasts only if their information

 differs. Thus, as individuals acquire more differentiated information,

 forecasts should become more heterogeneous. Since Information improves

over time, property 2 follows naturally. Note               also   that    the    improvement

of information Immediately suggests properties 3 and 4,                   which
essentially state     that forecasts     become more accurate as the date of

realization approaches, Pinally, since a realization Is equivalent to a

forecast based upon perfect information, realizations should exhibit

more heterogeneity than      forecasts      (property 1).    I    refer the reader to

appendix A for formal demonstrations.

       Tests of the four properties listed above can               help   to determine

whether or not consumers efficiently process available information. If

these tests should fail, further Investigation would be warranted. In

particular, one would want to identify the kinds of information that

individuals tend to ignore or process incorrectly. It is possible to

shed some light on this issue by adopting a somewhat different

approach. Specifically, equation (1) suggests the following regression

framework:


(2)                           =   a +        ÷   w1y +

where the w        are   variables   that   are observable    at time t (i.e.

elements of Qft). Theory implies that a = 0,                  =    1, y = 0, and that
      is   orthogonal to          and             Thus, least squares estimation of

(2) generates an additional set of tests../ In addition, it allows us to
                                       —8—




isolate   particular types of information which consumers fail to process

correctly, and to determine the direction and magnitude of the resulting

forecast bias. Note     in   addition that   by   omitting          from the

regression, one can    test a   weaker proposition——that individuals form

unbiased (conditional upon the information that            they   do use), although

possibly inefficient expectations (a = 0,             =   i).

3.    tta
      The data for this study are drawn from the Social Security

Administration's Retirement History Survey (RHS), which              followed   a

sample of retirement—aged households (58 to 63 years old in 1969) for a

period of 10 years, beginning in 1969. Wach household was surveyed once

every two   years   (1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1979). Although the

initial wave included more than 11,000 households, there was substantial

attrition over successive waves.

      In 1969, 1971, and 1973, respondents reported the level of social

security benefits that    they   expected to receive upon retirement. In

subsequent sections, the variable ESS (expected social security)

reflects answers to these questions, adjusted to an annual basis.

Unfortunately, data on expected benefits were extremely poor in 1969.

Casual inspection revealed a low resonse rate (due in part to survey

skip patterns), as well as a high frequency of nonsensical values. I

have therefore confined attention to responses given in 1971 and 1973.

      Unfortunately, interpretation of expected benefits is somewhat

problematic, in that    the   treatment of inflation is ambiguous.
                                           —9.-




Certainly, the survey instrument does not specify whether the individual

is to report a real or nominal figure. Throughout, I simply assume that

respondents report expected benefits in current (i.e. survey year)

dollars. This seems the most natural choice, since respondents would

otherwise have had      to   forecast future inflation rates     before   formulating
an answer to the question. To the extent my assumption is incorrect,

the scale of expectations may be somewhat off.

         The primary advantage of the RHS is that it allows the analyst to

identify realizations by employing data from subsequent survey waves.

In the case of social security benefits, this process is somewhat

involved.     While respondents are   to report social security income
                                         asked

in each survey year, these data are of questionable reliability. For
example,    it is   not uncommon to    find households    which first report the
receipt    of benefits in a particular year, only to report no social

security income in one or more of the subsequent waves. Furthermore,

reported benefits frequently vary by 50%          or   more between consecutive

waves.     Since most of this undoubtably reflects "noise", the use of such
data would introduce spurious forecast error. I therefore opt to use
calculated values instead. The calculation procedes in several steps.
      First, I Identify the year in which each repondent began to
receive social security benefits. While it is safe to assume that
individuals rarely report the receipt of benefits when they in fact

receive none, failure to report positive benefits does not necessarily

indicate   that none   have been received (see above). accordIngly, I use

the   minimum of the date     at   which each respondent first reported social
                                     —10—




security income, and the respondent's reported date of retirement.

Unfortunately, respondents are never asked to report their dates of

retirement directly. Instead, they indicate whether or not they are

retired at two year intervals. I take the respondent's reported date of

retirement to be the date at which he left his last job prior to first

classifying himself as retired. When the respondent fails to report

this date, I take it to be midway between successive survey years (i.e.

in the year prior to the survey year when he first reports himself as

retired).

      Second, I calculate yearly social security income for each

individual by compiling his earnings history, and applying the benefit

formula in effect during the year when he first began      receiving
benefits. Fortunately, the social security administration has provided

matching administrative records on official earnings histories through

1975——the SSA uses these same data to calculate henef its In practice.

These records are,   of   course, incomplete for individuals who began to

receive benefits after 1975. In these cases, I use survey data on

reported earnings after 1975 to complete the records. While survey data

are available only through 1979,    this    turned out to be immaterial——

according to the criterion described above, no Individual who reports an

expected benefit in either 1971 or 1973 actually began to receive social

security benefits after 1979.

      As described in section 2, part of my objective is to relate

forecast errors to available information, in order to identify the kinds

of information that individuals either Ignore or process incorrectly.
                                         —11—



consider two dozen informational variables, which I group into three

distinct categories.

         The first category contains variables which measure other reported

expectations. The inclusion of these variables allows me to determine

whether or not individuals have internally consistent expectations, in

the sense that they base all expectations on the same set of

information. By including lagged expectations, I can test the

hypothesis that individuals have good memories, in the sense that they

never    ignore information which they employed at some prior point in
time. Definitions of specific variables follow.
      ERET:  expected data of retirement.

         EOI:    expected     retirement income, other than social security
         LESS:   expected social security income, reported in the     preceding
                 survey wave.
         LERET: expected date of retirement, reported in the preceding
                 survey wave.
         LEOI:   expected income other than social security, reported in

                 the    preceding survey wave.

Data on expectations is, of course, incomplete—-many individuals who

report   expected    social   security benefits do not, for example, report an
expected    date of   retirement. Accordingly, I also use dummy variables,
which   equal I if    the individual reports the associated expectation, and
o   otherwise.   I refer to the dummies corresponding to the five

expectational variables listed above as DRET, DOl, LDSS, LDRET, and

LDOI, respectively.
                                     —12—



     The second category includes a single variable, which is the

individual's current social security entitlement, CSS, defined as the

level of benefits he would receive under current law if he retired

immediately. CSS is, theoretically, part of each individual's

information set, in that   it depends only upon his own past earnings
history, and upon current law (which is public information). i3y

including CSS, it is possible to determine the extent to which

individuals ignore information related to existing statutes.

      The third and final category includes various demographic
variables   and other household characteristics which might be useful in

predicting future social security benefits. The list of variables

includes:


      MAR:      a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the respondent

                is married (1 =   married, 0 = other).
      DIV:      a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the respondent

                is divorced (1 =   divorced,   0 =   other).
      WID:      a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the respondent

                is a widow or widower (1 = widow or widower, 0 =   other).
      AGE:      the respondent's age.

      SAGE:     the respondent's spouse's age.

      ED:       the respondent's level of educational attainment (measured

                in number of years).

      SED:      the respondent's spouse's level of educational attainment.

      W:        the household's net wealth (including financial assets,

                businesses, and real property).
                                          —13—



        GH:         a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the

                    respondent reports his health as being better than

                    average for his age (1 =     better,   0 =   other)
        BH:         a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the

                    respondent reports his health as being worse than average

                    for his age (1 = worse, 0 =     other).
        KIDS:       number of children.

        COMPRET: a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the

                    respondent's employer maintains a compulsory retirement

                    age (1 = compulsory retirement, 0 = no compulsory

                    retirement).

        MOVE:       a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the

                    respondent has moved within the past two years.


        Before   passing on   to analysis of the data, it is important to

discuss   two potential problems. The first concerns sample selection
biases. I drop observations from the analysis for four reasons: i)             the

respondent      fails to report expected social security benefits, ii)

reported expectations are obviously nonsensical, iii) data on net wealth

are   Inadequate,   or iv) the household disappeared from the RHS prior to

receiving social security benefits. Note that the first three items all

reflect   household characteristics that are       known when the respondent

makes   his forecast. According to theory, these factors should therefore
be uncorrelated with the forecast error——dropping these observations
should not bias the regression results. The fourth item (subsequent
attrition)    does reflect events occurring after the forecast was made,
                                   —14—



and therefore may well be correlated with the forecast error.

Nevertheless, this seems relatively unlikely. Attrition occurs

primarily because of death, or because the respondent has moved. Death

is, of course, highly correlated with realized social security benefits,

in the trivial sense that an individual who dies prior to retirement

receives nothing. However, I strongly suspect that individuals report a

conditional (upon survival) expectation (i.e. the respondent thinks, if

I live until retirement, what will I get?) If so, no sample selection

bias arises. When attrition occurs for other reasons, one cannot make

the same argument. However, the RHS did successfully locate many

respondents after they had moved. Consequently, the variable MOVE

should give some indication as to whether the resulting sample selection

bias is significant. As we shall see, the evidence suggests that it is

not.

       The second problem concerns the non—independence of realizations.

In a short panel such as the RHS, forecast errors are probably

correlated accross observations, due to "macro" events. Suppose, for

example, that subsquent to the date at which forecasts are recorded,

Congress unexpectedly raises social security benefits by 20%. Then one

would presumably discover that, on average, forecast errors are

significantly positive. One should not construe this as contradictory

to theory, since forecasts may indeed be unbiased given the ex ante

distribution of macro events.

       Since the 1970's witnessed several large and potentially

unexpected real increases in social security benefits, this problem is
                                           —15—




potentially    severe. I am particularly concerned about the 20% increase

in benefits enacted in September 1972, and the double indexing for

inflation which caused real benefit levels to rise substantially between

1975 and 1977. However, these were, for the most part, across—the—board

increases in benefit levels. As a result, they probably affected little

more than scale. To put it another way, one would not be surprised to

find       > 1 in estimates of equation (2), and one should not construe

this as contrary to theory. Indeed, through estimates of , one can

hope to discern the extent to which these legislative changes were

actually anticipated. However, one wOuld still expect to find cx = y = 0

under the hypothesis that the theory is accurate.

       This last remark is somewhat debatable. Legislative changes

during the 70's did alter individuals' budget constraints (see Hurd and

Boskin 119811 for an example). Presumably, this had behavioral

consequences. To the extent different types           of    individuals had

systematically different behavioral response to changes in their budget
constraints, then the corresponding characteristics would, ex post, be
correlated with forecast errors, even if the theory was valid. In the
absence of more extensive longitudinal data, little can be done about
this problem. The reader should bear this qualification in mind when
evaluating    the evidence.



4.     A   Comparison   of   Forecasts   and Realizations

       It is possible to learn a great deal about the raw data by
tabulating simple summary statistics. I devote the current section to

this task; sections 5 and 6 contain    regression    results.

      Tables 1 and 2 provide a general picture of expectations and

realizations, broken down by several different respondent categories,

including married men, widows, widowers, single men, single women,

wealthy married men, and high educated married men./ I report the total

number   of   observations not yet receiving social security, the fraction

of these observations reporting expected social security benefits, the

average expectation along with its standard error, the average

realization for those reporting an expectation, along with its standard

error, the relative mean forecast error (=       (—              where bars

denote means), the correlation between expectations and realizations,

and the mean square forecast error.

      Consider first the response rates     to   questions about expected

benefits. Since respondents may fail to report expectations for a

variety of reasons, one should not attach too much importance to any

particular rate. However, since the quality of an individual's

information almost certainly affects the likelihood that he will report

an expectation, relative response rates may be informative. The over-

all rate was 42% in 1971, and 40% in 1973. Since the average individual

is closer to his date of realization in 1973 than in 1971, this is

somewhat surprising——one would expect information to improve, and hence

reporting to rise, as individuals approach retirement.

         A comparison of response rate across population subgroups reveals

that in 1971, single women and widows were least likely to report

expected benefits. Yet in 1973, these subgroups were among the most

likely to respond. One might conclude that the evidence on response

rates does not establish a consistent pattern of Intergroup

differences. On the other hand, it is also possible that women become

substantially more serious about planning for retirement as It

approaches. Single men and widowers have relatively high response

rates, and these rates         change   very little (a slight increase) between

1971 and 1973. In contrast, response rates              for   married men decline

substantially     over the two       year   interval. This phenomenon——which is
confined to married men         (the aggregate response       rate declines simply
because   married men dominate the          sample)——is rather puzzling. In
addition,   neither the response rates           themselves   nor the decline in these

rates for   married men Is       systematically     related to wealth   or education.
Poor, uneducated individuals are      as likely to report expectations
                                             just

as their wealthy, highly educated counterparts.
       I turn next to the relative mean forecast errors. The data
Indicate that in 1971, the average forecast was about 10% lower than the
average   realization. In 1973, it was about 6% lower. At this level,

the data are consistent with the view that at least some of the

statutory benefit increases during this period were unanticipated.

Note,   however, that    the mean     error was less that     the   real increase in
benefit levels, so these changes were apparently not fully unanticipated
(Boskin   [1987] reports that the real          benefit increase in 1972 was
14.1%).    Furthermore, we       shall see that     further   disaggregation   casts

doubt   on the   view   that   the   mean forecast error   is attributable to
unexpected statutory      changes,
                                         —18—



        A further point about the overall average forecast error deserves

mention. In conducting regression analysis (see sections 5 and 6), I

also calculated averages for several other variables, including current

social security entitlement (css). Astonishingly, in 1973 the mean

value of expected social security benefits differed from the mean value

of current social security entitlement by only 4Oc. While this may be

largely coincidence, it also raises the possibility that, once

individuals have reached retirement age (recall that respondents are

between 62 and 67 years old in 1973),        they   form expectations by

observing the experiences of similarly situated acquaintances who,

unlike the respondent, choose to retire and receive their current

entitlements.

       Differences     between subgroups are apparent. In 1971, married men
had the smallest relative mean forecast error. Widows and single women
were, on average, furthest off——their expectations tended to be very
conservative. In 1973, widows and single women were still among the
most conservative, but were joined by married men. The average forecast
for single men was almost right on the nose. Once again, there appears

to be no clear relationship with either education or wealth; if

anything, the   data   indicate that the forecasts of educated individuals

tend to be    further off than those of uneducated individuals.

        In the second to last collumn of Tables I and 2, I report the

correlation   coefficient between expectations and realizations. Note
that   this correlation is by far the     highest   for single women and widows

——it is lowest for married men.      .   similar    pattern is evident in 1973,
                                        —19—



although married men improved their performance relative to other groups

(note that the correlations were generally lower in 1973——more on this

later). Mean squared errors (the final collumn of Tables 2 and 3) also

suggest that, despite their conservatism, women tend to make the most

accurate forecasts, and that married men tend to make the least accurate

forecasts.

         I can only speculate as to the causes of this pattern. Unmarried

women (especially widows) nay depend more heavily upon social security

benefits      than other groups, and may therefore have more of a stake in
acquiring accurate      information.   In contrast, couples maygreater
                                                                    have

access to other resources, and nay therefore spend less time thinking
about social security benefits. While this explanation seems plausible,
it is apparently contradicted by the fact         that the expectations of

relatively poor married men are not      systematically better      than   those of
the    relatively wealthy, despite the fact that the poor undoubtably

depend upon social security to a greater extent. Conceivably, income

could be correlated with ability, and ability with accuracy; this might

offset any correlation arising from a diminished stake in social

security.

        The   data in Tables I and 2 also allow us to draw    some    tentative
conclusions concerning properties I —          4. I will take them in order.
        The data for 1971 are superficially consistent with property I
(for each subgroup, the variance of expectations is smaller than the
variance of     realizations).   However, there are   two reasons    to   question

this   evidence. First, as mentioned above, the average realization
                                         —20—




exceeds   the average expectation by 10. Assuming that this is

attributable to some macro event that increased benefits proportionally

across the boards, one should adjust for scale by inflating the standard

deviation of expectations by 109, in which case the data appear

inconsistent with property 1. Second, the rather small            differences
between the standard errors of expectations and realizations suggest

that relatively little new information becomes available between 1971

and retirement. The opposite conclusion is suggested by the rather low

correlations between expectations and realizations. Note finally that

the data for 1973    directly    contradict property 1.

      While the evidence seems contradictory to theory, strong

inferences may be premature. In view of the fact that actual income is

reported with a high level of noise (see section 3), it seems likely

that expectations are also measured with error. In particular,

respondents may report "ballpark figures" in surveys, despite using a

more precise forecast for planning purposes. Measurement error could

easily account for the apparent failure of property 1. I will return to

this issue in section 6.

      Next,    note that   the standard deviations of reported expectations

are substantially    higher in 1973     than    in           is strongly
                                                     1971. This

consistent    with property 2,    and   supports the view that individuals
remember information which they used to form expectations at previous

points in time4." If the theory is valid, one would expect to flnd this

pattern even in the presence of measurement error.
                                           —21—




         Properties 3   and   4 indicate   that        forecast error
                                                  the mean square

should fall, and the correlation between forecasts and realizations
should    rise as individuals approach retirement. A comparison of the

data from 1971 and 1973 reveals precisely the opposite pattern. The

mean squared errors rise for every subgroup, and the correlation

coefficient falls for 5 of 7 groups. This suggests either that

individuals process information incorrectly, or, contrary to my

assertion in the preceding paragraph, they ignore information which they

have employed at previous points in time.

         Tables 3 and 4   provide   a more disaggregated tabulation of the data

for married men (other subgroups simply did not contain enough

observations to permit similar calculations). In particular, I report

the same set of items broken down by date of expected retirement. Since

retirement Is for the moat part equivalent to realization of social

security benefits, this disaggregation facilitates a more explicit

analysis of properties 2 through 4.          I use expected date of retirement
rather than the actual date because the actual date is presumably

correlated with information that became available subsequent to the

survey year, and which therefore may well be correlated with forecast

error.

         Note first that, in 1971, the fraction of individuals reporting an

expectation declines monotonically with the expected date of retirement.

The same pattern holds in 1973, expect for one aberration (I.e. those

expecting to retire In 1974 had an unsually low response rate). This

finding contrasts with the longitudinal result noted above, that

response rates were lower in 1973.

      The relative mean      forecast   errors in Tables 3 and 4 merit

particularly close scruitiny. Consider first the results for 1971.

Recall that legislative action raised benefit levels by about 20% in

September of 1972, and that most analysts have thought of this as an

unanticipated change. I have already suggested that the overall mean

forecast error Is at least partially consistent with this view.

However, the disaggregated results are         not.   Note that respondents who

expected to retire in 1971, prior to the benefit increase, had the

largest mean forecast error, in most cases by a wide margin. Those

expecting to retire in 1972, 1973, and 1974, after the benefit increase,

had much smaller mean forecast errors, and the magnitudes of these

errors fell well short of the real benefit increase. Forecast errors

were somewhat larger for those intending to retire after 1974, but

smallest of all for those who planned to continue working indefinitely.

      A qualitatively similar pattern         holds   for 1973. Those expecting

to retire in the   current   year had   the   smallest mean forecast error.

However, the magnitude of this error declined monotically with the date

of expected retirement thereafter. Indeed, the mean forecast error was

relatively low for those expecting to retire after 1975, despite the

fact that 1975 through 1977 was the period of double indexing.

      One   might object that expected dates of retirement nay differ
substantially   from actual realizations. If, for         example, those
expecting   to retire in 1971 actually worked on average for several more

years, one would not necessarily expect this group to exhibit a
                                         —23—



systematically        lower mean forecast error, even if the 1972 legislation
was unanticipated. In practice, the correspondence between expected and
actual dates     of   retirement is quite close. Analysis of the data reveals

that the expected date of retirement was always the modal realization.

More specifically, in 1971 approximately 40% of those who expected to

retire in the current year actually did so, while in contrast only 10%

of those expecting to retire in 1972 actually retired in 1971 (see

Bernheim [1987bJ       for   more details). Accordingly, under the view that

the 1972 legislation was indeed unanticipated, one would be hard pressed

to account for the apparent differences between subgroups.

         Overall, the evidence contradicts the hypothesis that the overall

mean forecast errors in 1971 and 1973 were attributable to unanticipated

reforms. Individuals do not appear to form systematically less accurate

forecasts during periods of legislative change.

         Consider   next the pattern of standard deviations on reported
expectations. Property 2 suggests that these should rise as individuals
age. The evidence from Tables 3 and 4 is mixed—-the standard deviation
does   not   move monotonically with expected date of retirement. This
contrasts    with the rather strong evidence in favor of proposition 2

arising from a pure longitudinal comparison (see above).

       Turn finally to correlations and mean        squared errors. Note    that

in 1971, the correlation between forecasts and realizations declined

almost monotonically with expected date         of retirement (there is a
significant    departure from     monotonicity for the group intending to
retire   after 1975), while the mean squared error rose rnonotonically.
                                      —24—



These results are supportive of properties 3 and 4. The general pattern

is basically the same, although perhaps somewhat weaker in 1973.

        Tables    3 and 4 also jointly facilitate more refined longitudinal

comparisons. For those who expected to retire in any given year (e.g.

1974), i) the standard error of forecasts rises between 1971       and   1973,

ii)    with only one exception, the mean squared forecast error rises, and

iii) the correlation between forecasts and realizations rises for some

groups, and falls for others. The      first observation    is consistent with

property 2; the second is inconsistent with property 3; and the third is

weakly inconsistent with property 4. Thus, disaggregation does not

alter the apparent implications of longitudinal comparisons.

        One finalobservation of interest is that the relationship between

expected and realized social security benefits for those who fail to

report an expected date of retirement seems very similar to the

relationship for those who do report such a date. I find this result

somewhat surprising, in that an accurate forecast of one's retirement

date seems essential when one is formulating an expectation about future

social security benefits.

        I close   this section by addressing a somewhat different issue.
Part of the    motivation for studying expectations is    to determine whether

faulty expectations could be accountable for financial hardship. In the

case of social security benefits, hardship could arise if individuals

tended to be overly optimistic——those anticipating large benefits nay

make   inadequate private   provisions. In Table 5,   I   compute the fraction

of    each subsample for which expected benefits exceeded actual benefits

by more than 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100%. According to these data,
approximately one in six individuals believes that benefits will exceed

their actual levels by more than 25%; approximately one in twelve

individuals expects over 50 more than they receive; and 29—3% of all

individuals receive less than half of what they expected. Widows,

widowers, and single women are the most conservative groups, although

single    men are not far behind. Married men are the least conservative,
regardless of wealth or educational attainment.
       In interpreting     these numbers, one should bear in      mind the
possibility raised earlier, that individuals may report expectations
with substantial noise. If so, Table 5 may substantially exagerate the
extent of excessive optimism.
       Since this section has      touched   upon a large number of detailed
points,    it   is useful to summarize the major findings. Women's forecasts
tend   to be relatively conservative, but also the most accurate of any

subgroup. Married men tend to form the least conservative and least

accurate    expectations. Education and wealth appear to have very little
to do with the quality of      forecasts. Surprisingly, expectations are not

systematically       less accurate during periods of significant legislative

changes.     While many individuals   are    overly   optimistic, this does not
appear to    be an   especially pernicious problem for the vast majority of
households.
       Evidence on the theory of expectations developed in section 2 is

mixed. Property I Is generally contradicted by the data, but this is

consistent      with the presence of measurement error. Property 2 is weakly
                                                 —26—




contradicted by cross—sectional evidence, but supported by longitudinal

evidence. The reverse is true of properties 3 and 4. Overall, the

evidence suggests some incomplete degree of coherence with the theory.



5.      Regression Analysis

        tn this section I present estimates of equation (2) based upon the

data and variables described in section 3. I provide separate                results
for 1971 and 1973. The 1971 sample contained 1949 observations, while

the 1973 sample included 942 observations.

        I will begin with tests            of   the comparatively weak hypothesis that

individuals form unbiased (conditional upon whatever information they do

use), although possibly inefficient expectations. That is, I estimate

equation (2), omitting all Informational variables, w. For 1971, I

obtain:


                    SSI   =    1212  + 0.560*ESS        +
                                                             I
                              (44.8)   (0.020)

                          =     7.05 x     io
Analysis of data for 1973 yields:

                    SSI = 1369 +            O.426*ESS    +
                              (56.6)       (0.024)


                    C7
                          = 7.20       x


In   both cases, the intercept is large and estimated very precisely,

while the   slope   coefficient is significantly less than unity.            The point

estimates imply that, if an individual responds to information by
                                     -27-



raising his expected benefits $1, his     realization will,   on average, rise

by roughly 50+. This qualitative pattern persists when other

informational variables are added.

        Table 6 contains estimates of equation (2) where         includes the

full complement of informational variables described in section 3. In

1971, a large number   of   informational variables have statistically

significant coefficients. These include the respondent's expectation of

other income (EoI), current social security entitlement (CSS), age (AGE

and SAGE), education (ED and SED), poor health (PH), number of children

(KIDS), and compulsory retirement (COMPRET). Marital status (MAR, Dlv,

WID) does not appear to matter, nor does mobility (MOVE).       Wealth (w)   is
marginally   significant.
        In 1973, fewer informational variables have statistically
significant coefficients. As before, CSS plays an important explanatory
role. Note that the 1973 regressions also include lagged expectations
(this   was not possible in 1971 due to data quality). LESS, the lagged

value of social security benefits, appears with a very significant

coefficient, which suggests that individuals nay have poor memories.

Aside from CSS and LESS, only ED enters significantly.

        These results strongly contradict the theory of expectations

outlined in section 2. Unfortunately, interpretation of the

coefficients is problemmatic. Since the coefficient of ESS is in

general rather small, other variables are probably explaining the

magnitude of actual benefits, rather than the forecast error.

         It would, however, be premature to reject the theory on the basis

of    this evidence alone. As mentioned in section 4, there is some

indication that         reported   expectations are rather noisy. Measurement

error could account for the positive intercept and small          slope
coefficient. Other informational variables (especially CSS and LESS)

might then help to filter out the noise, in which case they would appear

with spuriously significant coefficients. These observations motivate

the analysis of section 6.



6.       A   Treant of Measurement Error
         In   this section, I devote serious attention to the possibility

that   expected benefits are measured with error. I adopt two separate
estimation strategies. The first is to regress forecast errors on
information; the second is to reestimate the regressions of section 5,
instrumenting for expected benefits. I devote a separate subsection to

each of these approaches. The section closes with an analysis of "true"
forecast errors.

         A. Forecast Error Regressions
         For motivation, I return to the analysis of       section 2. Note that

one can rewrite equation (1)          as


(3)                     x—x=
where             is   uncorrelated with X. Suppose we observe        with
error.       In   particular,   survey responses measure X,   where
                                        —29—




(4)
                  x=x+
and where       and        are unoorrelated.        Substituting   (4)   into   (3), we

obtain


(5)

By hypothesis         is uncorrelated with available information. It is

also   plausible to assume that          is unrelated to other contemporaneous
variables, including the measurement error on these variables.
Accordingly, equation (5) suggests the, following regression framework:

(6)                   —     =a +                    —
                                    (A)ity + (eit

Theory   predicts that a = y     = 0.   Estimates of (6) are not only robust
with respect to measurement error, but also easily interpretable: from
the coefficients y, one can Infer the manner in which individuals
misuse information when constructing forecasts.
       Estimates of equation (6) are presented in Table 7. I begin with
the results for 1971.       first that the intercept is usually
                          Note

statistically significant, which, strictly speaking, is contrary to
theory. However, neither expected date of retirement nor expected other
income appears with a significant coefficient. This supports the
hypothesis that individuals employ an internally consistent set of
information when formulating expects tions.
       CSS continues to play an important explanatory role, which
strongly suggests that individuals ignore much of the information

enbodied in current statutes. The coefficient of CSS is, however,

substantially smaller than in section 5, which Is consistent with the

view that CSS was, in part, filtering the noise in ESS.

        Married individuals tend to make high forecasts relative to

realizations——this conclusion is consistent with the simple tabulations

of section 3. The other marital status dummies are           Insignificant.
        AGE and SAGE both appear significantly. The negative coefficient

on AGE implies that older individuals tend to make high forecasts

relative to realizations. Since the overall mean of expected benefits

is lower than the mean realization, this implies that individuals tend

to   meke more accurate forecasts as they approach retirement. While this
accords with intuition, note that SAGE has the opposite effect.
       SED comes in significantly negative. This implies that men             with

highly educated spouses tend to       make   less conservative, and more
accurate forecasts of     benefits.    In contrast, the coefficient of ED is
statistically    insignificant.
       Wealth enters with    a significantly positive coefficient, which

implies   that wealthier individuals tend to be      more   pessimistic relative
to   realizations——in this sample, they are on average further off the

mark. This result is consistent with the view that poorer individuals

have a greater    stake   in finding out about their   social security
benefits. Finally, neither GH, PH, COMPRET, nor MOVE enters with a
significant coefficient.
      Turn next to the results for 1973. Surprisingly, FRET appears
with a significant coefficient, which suggests that individuals may not
                                      —31—



form expectations on the basis of an internally consistent set of

information. However, note also that the coefficient of LESS falls to

zero. This is consistent with the view that     the   coefficient of LESS was

significant in section 5 only because ESS was measured with error.

Furthermore, It supports the hypothesis that individuals do not ignore

information which they have used in the past.

      As in 1971, the coefficient of CSS is still very significant,

although once again its magnitude has declined. Note also that none of

the other demographic variables or other individual characteristics

enter significantly. Only the coefficient of wealth appears to be even

marginally    significant.
      In   summary, these results suggest that although individuals ignore

Information embodied in current statutes, they do recall the bulk of

information used in the past, and for the most part base all their

expectations on the same set of information. There is mixed evidence

concerning the roles of marital status, age, and education. The partial

correlation between wealth and forecast errors is marginally

significant. Individual characteristics seem less important in 1973

than In 1971, which is consistent with the view that individuals get

serious   about planning for retirement as the date   of retirement becomes

more imminent (the apparent role of age confirms this view). Overall,

these results suggest at least a partial degree of coherence with the

theoretical   framework of   section 2.

        B.    Inatruented Regressions
        The classic remedy for measurement error is, of course, the use of

instrumental variables. One requires an instrument that                 is   uncorrelated

with both          and         but correlated with X. Accordingly, valid
instruments must be related to information which the invididual actually

uses to construct X. Thus, one necessarily tests the basic

expectations hypothesis jointly with the assumption that individuals use

certain information (i.e., that contained in the instruments)

efficiently.

       Thisapproach confers two important advantages. First, it allows
one to estimate P. This facilitates a more powerful test of the
theory.      In addition, one can    also   allow for the possibility that, due

to   the "macro"   events problem    discussed earlier, the scales of
expectations    and realizations differ slightly. Second, it allows one to

separate true forecast error from measurement error. I persue this

second point in the next subsection.

       The choice of instruments is completely arbitrary: one can employ

any inforntional variable, and perform             the   associated joint test. I

present results based upon the plausible assumption that individuals'
expectations are internally consistent (i.e., all expectations are based

on the same informetion).        Accordingly, I      instrument with the concurrent

expectational    variables.
       As in   section   4,   I begin with tests of       the   comparatively weak
hypothesis that    individuals form    unbiased (conditional upon information
contained    in other forecasts, and whatever other             information they use),
                                               —33—



although possibly inefficient expectations. That is, I estimate

equation (2), omitting all informational variables, c' and

instrumenting with expectatiorial variables. For 1971, I obtain:

                 SSI   =    122        +   1.09*ESS   +
                                                                  I
                           (175)           (0.085)
                       =   9.65    X




Analysis    of data for 1973 yields

                 SSI = —57.1 + 1.12*ESS               +   C
                                                              i
                           (245) (0.118)
                       =   13.58       X



       These results are quite striking. In both cases, the intercept

becomes Insignificant, as predicted by theory. The slope coefficient

for 1971 is 1.09, which is consistent with the observation that

forecasts   are, on average, about 9 lower than realizations. The slope

coefficient for 1973 is slightly larger. In both cases, the standard

errors   are not terribly large. These estimates strongly support the

view   that, after a small scale adjustment, reported expectations are
unbiased estimates of realizations, conditional upon the information
contained in other forecasts, and whatever other information individuals
actually use. Results to the contrary (section 5) are apparently
attributable to measurement error.
       It is also possible to test jointly for the correct usage of other
information. Accordingly, Table 8 presents regressions of realized
benefits on expected benefits (instrumented), current social security

entitlement,   and various individual characteristics, for 1971 and 1973,

respectively. In both equations, CSS still enters significantly (in

fact, ESS and CSS roughly divide up the original coefficient on ESS),

although, as expected, the coefficient of CSS is lower than in section

5. This result confirms the view that individuals ignore information

embodied in current statutes. In 1971, AGE, SAGE, ED, SED, W, and PH

all enter significantly, while MAR is nrginal. The direction of each

effect is essentially the same as in section 6A. In 1973, nothing

besides ESS and CSS is statistically significant (AGE and W come

closest). Once again, it appears as though individuals used information

better in 1973, when they were closer to retirement, than in 1971.

      As mentioned at the outset of this subsection, there are a variety

of candidates for instrumental variables. The alternative employed

above is not only intuitively appealing, but also yields results that

are highly consistent with the basic theory. However, I have also

estimated equation (2) with other instruments. One set of estimates

tested the basic expectations hypothesis jointly with the assumption

that respondents   make proper use of available data   on   demographic
characteristics when formulating expectations (i.e., I used variables in
the third category as Instruments). Once again, the results supported
the view that, after a small scale adjustment, reported expectations are
unbiased estimates of realizations, conditional upon demographic
variables and whatever other information individuals actually use. The
pattern of coefficients on the informational variables corroborated the
                                           —35—




findings     of section 6B.    I omit a complete tabulation        of the results in
order   to conserve space.

        One could also estimate equation (2) by using CSS            as an
instrument,     thereby testing the basic      expectations     hypothesis jointly

with the assumption that       individuals    efficiently use all of the

information contained in CSS. Since the preceding evidence uniformly

contradicts this assumption, it is hardly surprising that              the   associated

results (omitted) are non—sensical.

        To summarize, estimates with instrumental variables support the

joint hypotheses that individuals form all of their expectations on the

basis of the same information, and that expectations about social

security     benefits are   unbiased    (conditional   upon   whatever information is
used   to construct them) up tosmall scale adjustment. Individuals do
                                    a

not, however, make efficient use of all available information. Most
importantly, they tend to       ignore information     embodied in statutory
entitlements.      In addition, there is some evidence that forecast errors
are   correlated   with age, education, wealth, and health.

        C.   Recovering   True Forecast Errors
        One of the   central   objectives of this study is       to assess    the
accuracy     of individuals' expectations. If expectational variables are

contaminated    by measurement error, then inferences          based upon    simple
indeces   of accuracy can be highly misleading. Specifically, the

variance of the    observed forecast error reflects both the          variance of

the true forecast error, and the variance of           the measurement error (see
equation (5)).
                                           —36—



         Fortunately, it is possible to recover the variance of the true

forecast errors through IV estimates, such as those presented in section

613.    I provide a detailed description of the procedure in appendix 13.

In essence, one recovers the variance of the measurement error by

comparing OLS estimates from a regression of SSI on ESS with IV

estimates. One then computes the variance of the true forecast error as

a residual from the variance of the IV regression error. One can also

use this procedure to assess the net reduction in true forecast error

that would result from incorporating new information into the forecast.

        To emphasize the importance of correcting for measurement error, I

begin by presenting the unadjusted variances of regression errors

(Table 9). The first row of Table 9 simply provides, as a basis for

comparison, the population variance of realized social security income

for 1971 arid 1973, respectively. The second row contains the variances

of error    terms from IV    estimates (using expectational variables as

instruments)   of the regressions reported in the text of section 613        (i.e.

SSI on   an intercept   and 1355).   The   next three rows contain the variances
of   error terms   from IV   estimates of   regressions that   also incorporate
other   informational variables. The regressions corresponding to the

entries   in the final row appear in Table 8; I omit a complete tabulation

of the other regression results in order to conserve space.

        If we ignore   the   fact that   regression errors are contaminated with
measurement error, then the following picture        emerges. In 1971, private

forecasts   explained almost none of the population variance in realized

benefits. In 1973, these forecasts were actually worse than simply

naming the population mean——a finding that is clearly at odds with the
hypothesis that individuals use information rationally. While a

significant improvement results from augmenting the information

contained in ESS with CSS (current entitlements), the proper use of

demographic information seems, on the whole, more important.

      When we adjust the numbers in Table 9 for the presence of

measurement error in order to obtain the variance of true forecast

error, a dramatically different picture emerges (see Table 10). Private

forecasts for 1971 now explain 56% of the variance in realized benefits;

1973 forecasts explain 65% of the variance. Note in particular that, as

predicted by theory, the explanatory power of these forecasts is clearly

better in 1973 than in 1971. This finding contrasts sharply with the

results of simple data tabulations (section 4), which in general produce

longitudinal   patterns that are unfavorable to the expectations
hypothesis. We now see that    these    negative findings are largely
attributable to measurement error.
      Table 10 also suggests that      individuals   nake excellent, although
incomplete use of available information. Augmentation of forecasts with
demographic information would achieve a minimal gain (less than a 5%
reduction in residual forecast error variance) in 1971, and no gain at

all in 1973. On the other hand, augmentation with information about

statutory entitlements (css) could     achieve   a reduction in residual

forecast error variance of between 14% and 17%. Thus, CSS emerges as

the most important piece of information that individuals fail to

incorporate fully into their forecasts.

      I close this section with one final remark. While the existence

of measurement error is fully consistent with the results of this

section, there is another interpretation of the model described in

equations (3) through (6). Specifically, individuals may not know the

true empirical model, and may form expectations, X, that are related as

in equatIon (5) to the objective expectation, X, by some randomly

distributed term,        reflecting   idiosynchracies of the individual's

calculations. Under this view, one must adjust one's reading of my

results slightly. Specifically, the IV estimates indicate that

individuals on average form unbiased expectations. Furthermore, the

calculations of this subsection apply to the variance of the forecast

error for a particular individual (i.e., after adjusting the mean for

the Idiosynchratic component), rather than to the population variance.



7.    ConcludIng Rerks
      The evidence In this paper indicates partial coherence with the

theory of expectations outlined in section 2. In addition, inspection

of the data reveal several interesting patterns. I have already

summarized these patterns    in   the introduction.

      One   pattern does, however, deserve further comment, in that It has
an obvious policy implication. Specifically, the bulk of the evidence
indicates that individuals are simply not completely familiar with their
current statutory entitlements. Presumably, the government could
improve   individuals'   forecasts, and hence financial planning, by
providing   this Information. Indeed, there is a precedent in the private
                                      —39—



sector. TIAA—CREF provides participants with an annual statement, which

specifies the level of annuity benefits available upon immediate

retirement, and projections of benefits besed on assumptions about

continued employment. Presunbly, the Social Security Administration

could provide each participant with similar information. If necessary,

the program could be restricted to individuals over a certain age.

According to my findings, most individuals would find this quite useful.

      This paper leaves many important questions unanswered. In

subsequent work, I plan to focus on the evolution of expectations,

testing the hypothesis that expectations follow a random walk, and

examining the manner   in   which individuals revise forecasts when

confronted with new information. In     addition,   I plan to explore the

link between expectations and behavior.

         Equation   (1)   can be rewritten as

where

From (A.1) and (A.2), it is evident that

                                        var(X)          +

Accordingly,    we obtain

which is property 1.

                                             E(XJQt)

from    which it follows that

(A.6)                                     =         +



where


(A.7)                              E(nJQ) = 0

From (A.6) and (A.7), it is clear that
                                               —41—




(A.8)                 var(X1) =           var(X)   +
                                                       var(1)t)

which gives us


(A.9)                 var(X1) > var(X)

which    is    property 2.

         Further properties follow from combining equations (A.1) and

(A.6). In particular, recursive substitution yields



(A.lo)                t =             +



since            is an element of .the inforntion set                   (A.2) and (A.7)

then imply that

                                                       T-2
                                 = var(c                  var(ii

Accordingly, we see that var(X — x) is declining in t (property 3).
     The final property of interest concerns the correlation between

forecasts and realizations, p(X,X). Note that

(A.12)              p(x,x) =
                                     cov(X,X)[var(X)var(X)J_1'2
                                 =
                                     var(X)[var(X)var(X)J_1'2
                                 =   Ivar(X)/var(X)]hh'2

where    the   second equality follows from (A.1) and (A.2). Combining
(A.12) with (A.9), we see that               p(X,X)       is Increasing in t

(property 4).

      Note that   equation   (A.6) suggests a regression much like equation

(2), and could be used as the basis for additional tests. Although I do

not exploit this relationship here, I do plan to examine the evolution

of expectations in future work.

         Consider the forecasting equation

Let

Suppose further that we observe                       rather   than X.   Substitution of

(A.14) into (A.13) yields

Now let OLS be the OLS estimate of 13.                       As is well known,

is a consistent estimator for the true                    forecast error, a.

                                  Footnotes


     Here, I abstract from the possibly that       T   is itself uncertain.

     I   take this issue up in Bernheim [198Th].

31   Since the variance of          should, according to theory, depend

     upon t, heterostedasticity is a potential problem. I have

     ignored   this issue   throughout. Calculated standard errors may

     therefore   be somewhat inaccurate.
2'   The RHS does not include married women as a separate       respondent
     category. When surveying couples, the RHS always classifies the

     husband as "respondent," and the wife as his spouse. In this

     study, data on social security benefits for married men include

     their spouse's benefits. For purposes of categorization, I take

     the dividing lines for high wealth and high education to be

     $20,000 and tenth grade, respectively——these figures correspond

     roughly to medians.

     Of course, the 1973 sample is not identical to the 1971 sample, so

     caution is warranted. However, the average respondent in 1973 is

     1.6 years older than the average respondent in 1971, and

     accordingly more   advanced in the life cycle. It is therefore
     appropriate to evaluate properties 2—4 by comparing data from 1971

     and 1973.
