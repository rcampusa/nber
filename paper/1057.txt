                                 Abstract



        On the Relevance or Irrelevance of Public Financial Policy



     This paper establishes conditions under which public financial policy
has neither real nor inflationary effects; under which it has inflationary
effects, but not real effects; and under which it has real effects. An increase
in government debt (keeping real expenditures fixed), accompanied by a decrease
in lump sum taxes has neither inflationary nor real effects (even in a
stochastic environment) provided there are no redistribution effects: the
increase in supply of government bonds gives rise to an exactly offsetting
increase in demand. An increase in the interest rate paid on government debt
will be associated with an increase in the rate of inflation, but there will
be no real effects. A change in financial policy which preserves the mean
rate of return on bonds has no real effects if individuals are risk neutral
and changes in the level of debt are offset by changes in lump sum taxes!
subsidies for the owners of bonds. Except in these special cases, changes in
public financial policy will always have real effects.

     The second part of the paper establishes that the optimal intertemporal
risk redistribution scheme can be implemented through financial policies which
entail constant price levels. This result is established in the context of a
life cycle model with homogeneous individuals. It is shown, furthermore,
that only     a single financial instrument is required to implement the optimal
policy; additional financial instruments are redundant. This redundancy
result does not obtain, however, with heterogeneous populations if there are
restrictions on the ability of the government to impose differential lump
sum taxes on different groups.

I.   Introduction

     There is a long—standing belief that while the money supply affects

the price level, "real" variables are determined independently. This

proposition is generally referred to as the "classical dichotomy." Variants

of this belief in the inefficacy of monetary policy, its inability to effect

anything real, have regained strength with the emergence of the new classi-

cal economics. This belief, however, is far from universal, with some

economists maintaining that government deficits, while inflationary, dis-

place private investment, while other, more traditional Keynesian econo-

mists claim that government deficits and monetary expansion can have real

effects without at the same time inducing inflation.

     The object of this paper is to establish a set of propositions con-

cerning the circumstances under which

     (a) public financial policy is irrelevant: it has neither real nor

          inflationary effects;

     (b) public financial policy has price effects, but no real effects

          (as in the classical dichotomy); and

     (c) public financial policy has real effects.

     Two basic premises underlie our analysis: that the effects of all the

financial policies of the government——both its debt and tax policies——need

to be taken into account simultaneously; and that these effects can only be

analyzed within intertemporal models with explicit assumptions about the

formation of expectations by individuals and about the impact of the finan-

cial policy on the intertemporal distribution of income.

     In Section II, I present the Basic Irrelevance Theorem, establishing

that if the government's debt—cum—tax policy does not involve any intergen—
                                    2




erational redistribution, government financial policy not only has no effect

on any real variable in the economy, but it also has no effect on any fin-

ancial variable (including the price level). The increase in the supply of

debt (accompanying the decrease in taxes) leads to a precisely identical

increase in the demand for government debt. (Accordingly, I shall sometimes

refer to this result as Say's Law of Government Deficits.)

     This result is in sharp contrast to the implication of deficits in the

portfolio balance approach (e.g., of Tobin), though like Tobin (and unlike

much of the recent literature in the new Classical macro—economics) we have

explicitly assumed that all individuals are risk averse. In the portfolio

balance models, the increase in government debt has real effects because

individuals will not hold the additional government debt unless the return

to debt relative to equities changes; but in these models, individuals are

myopic——they fail to take into account future tax liabilities,' and when

they do so, their optimal portfolio turns out to require an increase in

government debt just equal to the current increase in supply.

     The model of Section II involves a single, infinitely—lived generation.2

In contrast, in the remainder of the paper we focus our attention on models

with overlapping generations (and without bequests). In Section III we show




1. Thus, our result can be viewed as an extension of the Ricardo—Barro
   approach to include uncertainty; obviously, in the absence of uncertainty,
   the form in which individuals hold their assets is not of much interest;
   all assets are perfect substitutes.

2. Or equivalently, families, all of whom have and care about their des-
   cendant(s), with descendants, all of whom have and care about their
   descendants, etc. See Barro (1974).
                                      3




that there exist some financial policies (in particular, an increase in the

nominal interest rate paid on government debt, financed by the issuance of

additional debt) which have no real effects, including no effect on the

intergenerational distribution of income; at the same time, this policy

does have an effect on the rate of inflation. As a result, I sometimes

refer to this Second Irrelevance Theorem as establishing the neutrality of
             1
inflation.

        (It should be emphasized that not all inflation is of the "pure" form

described in Section III. There are often other, accompanying changes in

policy which have real effects.)

     Most changes in public financial policy do, however, have consequences

for the intertemporal distribution of income, and in Sections IV and V, I

show that when the government's financial policy does involve intergenera-

tional redistribution, then (even restricting ourselves to policies with

the same expected rate of inflation) it has real effects on the economy,

except in certain limiting cases. It is easy to see why alternative finan-

cial policies have an important effect on the intertemporal distribution of

income. If the government should decide at some date to increase the supply

of government bonds more than it   had    previously planned, it   will   increase

the price level; owners of debt (the "old" in the typical life cycle model)
become worse off; similarly, if it decides to decrease the debt, the price
level   falls, making the older generation better off, at the expense of the

younger generation. In this sense, there is a close link between debt policy




1. This result thus represents an extension and generalization of an earlier
   result reported in Stiglitz (1981).
                                     4




on the one hand, and social security policy on the other (a link which was

extensively discussed in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) for non—stochastic

models). These redistribution effects of debt policy will, in general,

have a real effect on the patterns of capital accumulation; only if the

demand for capital were independent of wealth would there be no such effect,

a possible but implausible case.

     That there is a close relationship between debt policy and capital

accumulation can be seen from a slightly different perspective. It is well

known,   from the literature on money, debt and growth, that, in the absence

of uncertainty, debt policy has a significant effect on capital accumulation.'

     There, debt policy (the rate of change in the money or debt supply)

has real effects, because individuals substitute government debt for capital

in their portfolios. In those models, slince there was no uncertainty, the

real return on money had to equal the real return on capital,2 and this

asset equilibrium (or portfolio balance) condition determined the rate of

change of prices. In the analysis here alternative debt policies change

the probability distribution of the returns to financial assets (relative

to, say, capital), and thus again there is a substitution between capital

and government debt. Only if individuals are risk neutral-—and so are in—




1. Though earlier studies of Tobin (1965) or Shell, Sidrauski, and Stiglitz
   (1969) are open to the criticism that the individuals are not explicitly
   maximizing their intertemporal utility, the studies of Cass and Yaari
   (1967) and Diamond (1965) made it clear that similar results also obtained
   in the life cycle models. See also Atkinson—Stiglitz (1980).

2. This is a slight simplification. While Tobin (1965), Johnson (1966) and
   Sidrauski (1967), for instance, did not explicitly introduce uncertainty
   into their analysis, they treated the two assets as imperfect substitutes,
   without formally explaining why this was so.

different among financial policies which generate the same mean rate of

inflation——can such changes in policy have no effect.

     It is important to realize, however, that this is just an intuitive

argument: it would appear to be equally valid for the overlapping genera-

tions (life cycle savings) model as it would for the model with long—lived

individuals; yet for the latter, we establish in Section II that changes

in financial policy of the government (without redistributive effects) have

no real effects; the reason for this is in fact that they have no effects

on prices. The price distribution is clearly endogenous, and whether it is

or is not affected by a particular financial policy is the central question

with which we are concerned.

     Having established that, in general, public financial policy does matter,

the next natural question is, what do optimal public financial policies look

like? Section VI characterizes the optimal policy of intertemporal risk—

sharing and income distribution, and shows that this policy can be imple-

mented by means of a simple set of public financial policies. In Section VII

we expand the set of financial policies considered so far to include debt

instruments of varying maturity. We show that, in our simple model of iden-

tical individuals, the additional instruments are redundant. If, however,

there are restrictions on the set of admissible taxes and individuals differ,

then the additional instruments may not be redundant. Section VIII summarizes

several directions in which the analysis may be extended.

     Before beginning our formal analysis, there are two caveats concerning

what I mean by public financial policy that I should mention. First, through-

out the analysis, I keep the level of real government expenditure at each

date fixed. Financial policy is simply concerned with the manner in which
                                       6




those real expenditures are financed (and with the inseparable question of

how income is redistributed among individuals). Second, I am not concerned

here with those issues arising from there being both interest and non—

interest bearing short—term financial assets in the economy at the same

time.     (I have dealt with those issues extensively.elsewhere (Stiglitz

(1982).)     I shall focus extensively on the demand for financial assets as

a store of value.''2

        A standard question that is often raised at this juncture, in our argu-

ment that public financial policy is3 relevant, is what can the government

do that the private sector cannot do (or undo)? Within the life cycle model,

there are two answers: first, the government can engage in intergenerational

redistribution, which the private sector cannot undo; second, by the very

structure of the model, there cannot exist a full set of Arrow—Debreu

securities in such an economy: there is no way that individuals at date t

can trade the risks which they face with individuals at date 0 .      Government

financial policy can provide risk—sharing opportunities which the private

market cannot provide.


]•   The First Irrelevance Proposition: Say's Law of Government Deficits

        In this section, we develop a simple model in which debt policy has

neither real nor financial effects. We consider an economy with infinitely—




1. Recent developments in financial markets make it clear that the costs
   involved in providing transactions services associated with interest
   bearing bonds is not significant.

2. I shall occasionally refer to government policies with respect to the
   supply of short—term bonds (or more general financial policies) as
   "monetary" policies.

3. With the minor exceptions previously noted.

supply of L.(t,0) ,       holdings   of capital2 of K.(t+1, 0(t))    and holdings

of the single, interest bearing financial asset of B.(t,0)            In the ab—

sence of uncertainty {L.,C.,K.,B.} are chosen to maximize the individual's

the vectors {L.,.}

subject to the lifetime budget constraints.3

     For simplicity, we take consumption as our numeraire; we assume that

the price ratio of capital goods to consumption goods is fixed at unity

(this, like the assumption of a single consumption good, is a simplifying

assumption which can easily be removed). We let v(t,O) be the price of

bonds in terms of consumption goods; p(t,0) E                 is the price of
                                                     v(t,0)
goods in terms of the financial asset. We shall refer to p as the price

level. Let p(t,0) be the real rate of return on a financial asset. In

general, this consists of two parts, an interest payment and a capital gain

(or loss). If i(t,0(t)) is the interest paid at date t+1 on a bond

purchased at date t in state 0(t),1 then




1. We shall, for notational simplicity, simply write 0 for 0(t) when
   there is no ambiguity.

2. K.(t+1,0(t)) is the amount of capital purchased at time t , but used
   at date t+1

3. It should be clear that nothing in this formulation requires us to
   restrict our analysis to preference orderings satisfying the expected
   utility axioms.

(1)          p(t,O(t),O(t--l)) =             + v(t+1,@(t+1))    —    i
        Clearly, in the absence of uncertainty, if the marginal transactions

value of the financial asset is zero,2 and i is the real rate of return

on capital,3


(2)          n(t)   = p(t)

the real return on bonds must equal the real return on capital.

        The value A. (in real terms) of the individual's assets at time t

in state O(t+1) is


(3)          A.(t,U(t)) =    K.(t,O(t—1))(1+ri(t,O(t))

             + B(t_1,O(t_1))[v(t,O(t)) + i(t—1,O(t—1))]


             + w.(t,O(t))L.(t,O(t)) —   T.(t,8(t))


1. It makes no difference f or our analysis whether the individual knows the
   interest which will be paid, i.e., i =        i(t,O(t))
                                                     or does not, i.e.,
   i = i(t,O(t+1)). We shall, for simplicity, assume he does. i is a real
   interest payment, i.e., i is measured in terms of consumption goods.
   This assumption too is made for notational simplicity. It is more real-
      istic if we let i be dominated in financial units, so

          p(t,O(t),O(t+1)) =    (1 + i(t,O(t))                 - 1

      The requisite modifications to the analysis are straightforward. Even if
      i is measured in consumption goods, and is specified at t , p is un-
      certain because v(t+1,D(t+1)) is uncertain. In Stiglitz (1982) the
      analysis is extended to indexed bonds.

2. As we assume throughout this paper. But see Stiglitz (1982).

3. r will, in general, depend on the capital—labor ratio. The individual,
   however, simply takes r as given, and hence in our notation, we simply
   write r as a function of t (and 8) . Again, when there is no ambiguity,
   we suppress the dependence of variables (such as p and fl) on 8
                                                   9




i.e., the capital he had at the end of the last period, plus the return on

that capital, plus the value of his bonds, plus the interest payments and

wage payments, minus lump sum taxes. This wealth can be used to purchase

goods or assets,' i.e.,


(4)          A.(t,O(t)) =           c.(t,O(t))     + K.(t+1,O(t)) + v(t,6(t))B.(t,O(t))


        We assume a neoclassical production function of the usual form,


(5)          F(K, L, 0)         =   C   + AK + C


where C is expenditure on public goods, K is aggregate capital, C is

aggregate consumption, L aggregate labor supply:


(6a)         K = 1K.

(6b)         L =      1L.


(6c)         C =      IC.

Market equilibrium requires, in addition, that if B*(t,0) is the outstand-

ing government debt at time t


(7)          B*(t,0) =          IB.(t,0)

The demand for bonds must equal the supply of bonds. Moreover, we require

real government revenues (taxes plus revenues from the issue of new bonds)




1. In a finite period model, we have a natural boundary condition
             =          =   0
                 BT
      In the infinite period problem, we need to impose a corresponding trans—
      versality condition.

 to equal real government expenditures (interest payments plus purchases

 of public goods).1


 (8)        i(t_1,0(t—1))B*(t_1,O(t_1)) + G(t,0(t))


               v(t,0(t))[B*(t,O(t)) —   B*(t_1,O(t_1))]   —-ZT.(t,O(t))


Equation (8) is the government budget constraint.

       We now establish, in this simple context, thedebt neutrality proposi-

tion. Assume at t1 the government increases B*(t1) by one bond and (to

keep the government budget constraint satisfied) decreases ZT.(t1) by

v(t1) .   Now assume that at some later date, t2 ,    the government restores
the debt to its previous level; again, if government expenditures remain

unchanged, this necessitates an increase in taxes by v(t2,O) .            At   inter-

vening dates, to keep (8) satisfied,2


           Ti(t,0) =       i(t,O)

Finally, let us assume that the taxes are imposed in such a way as to have

no redistributive effect, i.e.,


           ,T.(t,O)       AT.(t1)
                      =             all t, I, and 0
                          AT.(t1)

Corresponding to this new tax—debt policy, there exists a new equilibrium

in the private sector. Denote by a single caret the original equilibrium




1. If all the other equilibrium conditions are satisfied, (8) must be satisfied.

2. We could, alternatively, finance the additional interest payments by addi-
   tional bond issues; if these new bond issues are themselves retired at
   the analysis remains unchanged.

                          = .(t,0)            or, equivalently, (t,O)      (t,0)

            B(t,0) =           B.(t,O)                   for t1 < t < t2
                                                v(t1)


       To see this, assume that all aggregate variables other than B*(t,0)
                      1
remain unchanged.

       From (3) and (4)


            C.(t,0(t)) =               K.(t,0(t-1))(l+(t,0(t))

           + fi.(t-1,e(t-1))[(t,e(t)) + I(t-1,0(t-1))]

           + .(t,0(t))L.(t,0(t)) —                T.(t,0(t))
            -   K.(t+1,O(t))           -   (t,0(t))B.(t,0(t))
It is apparent from (9) and (10) that the policy described by (10) is

feasible, and    yields       exactly the same consumption profile over time as did

the original equilibrium. In fact, the feasible set of consumptions for




1. In the new situation, there may, of course, be more than one equilibrium,
   just as in the old situation there may be more than one equilibrium. The
   argument is only that corresponding to any equilibrium in the original
   situation there exists an equilibrium in the new situation which is
   related to the original equilibrium by equation (10).
                                    12




each individual in the new situation is identical to that in the old,' and

hence each individual will choose exactly the same values of consumption,

capital holdings, and labor supply in each state and at each date, and will

only alter his bond holdings in the manner indicated. But, if they do this,

the increase in the demand for bonds will precisely equal the increase in

the supply of bonds. Hence, if all markets cleared before, they do now.

Debt policy has no effects on either the real economy or on the price level.

     The proof we have employed is a straightforward extension of the proof

I used earlier to establish the irrelevance of corporate financial policy

(Stiglitz (1969, 974))23 The critical assumption in that analysis was

that of no—bankruptcy. Here, bankruptcy is not an issue,4 since the govern—

   situation is feasible in the original situation, and conversely. This
   ignores any non—negativity constraints. See below and Stiglitz (1982).

   His model differs in a number of important ways from that presented

   there is a complete set of Arrow—Debreu securities. He focuses his
   attention on changes in financial policy which are accompanied by
   changes in government's holding of capital, and thus are not pure finan-
   cial changes (as we have defined that term).

4. The reason that bankruptcy made a difference in the earlier analysis was
   that it resulted in the creation of a new security; in the absence of a
   complete set of Arrow—Debreu securities, this, of course, may have real
   effects. Similarly, public financial policy——the issuance of a new kind
   of bond——may result in the creation of a new security, in the absence of
   a complete set of Arrow—Debreu securities. But the simple kinds of
   financial policy considered in this section cannot have that effect.
   But see Section VII below and Stiglitz (1982).

  There is a sense   in which bankruptcy is relevant here too: as we note
  below, the proof   of the irrelevance proposition requires that as the in-
  dividual borrows   more, the interest rate he has to pay is unchanged.
  This will be the   case only if there is no probability that the borrower
  defaults.

ment can always impose taxes to pay back the bonds. What is critical here

is the assumption that the bonds will eventually be redeemed, that there

are no distributive implications of the tax changes (equation (9)), and that

there are no binding constraints on individual borrowing.

     Note that in obtaining this result we did not specify how the bonds

were distributed by the government to the private sector. The changes in

taxes that the government must undertake, if it is, at the same time to issue

more bonds while keeping real expenditures fixed, in conjunction with the

anticipated increases in taxes at some later date associated with the subse-

quent retirement of the new bonds, generate precisely the requisite demand

for bonds. The only direct action of the government is to change taxes and

to change the supply of bonds publicly offered. The market takes care of

the rest.   (Thus, this result is quite different from that associated with

Umoney rain" or, in this context, "bond rain.")

     Note too that although we have assumed that the bonds will be retired

at a particular date t2 , the retirement date itself can be a policy var-

iable, a function of U .   So long as individuals anticipate that the current

deficits will eventually be retired by the imposition of taxes in the future,

debt policy has no real effects and is non—inflationary.1



1. Some difficult problems arise if there is some probability that the govern-
   ment will never retire the bonds. Then the increase in the government debt
   is inflationary. To see this, assume that prices remain unchanged and that
   individuals' consumption, labor supply and capital holdings remained un-
   changed at each date and in each state. Then their bond holdings must have
   increased, and if the transversality condition held before, it no longer
   holds. Assume now that v falls in proportion to the increase in B , so
   that vB remains unchanged, and that the government reduces i proportion-
   ately at each date. Then, it is easy to show that nothing real has changed,
   and hence if we were initially in equilibrium, we will still be in equilibrium,
   with p   increasing proportionately at each date and state. Now, if we move
   from this equilibrium to a new equilibrium where i remains at its original
   value, but the corresponding differences in government expenditure are re-
   flected in changes in new issue of government bonds, then we again obtain an
   equilibrium in which all real variables remain unchanged, but the price level
   has changed.  (See below, Section III.)
                                   14




     One might be tempted to argue that if nothing real changed, as we

have asserted, then individuals will want to allocate their portfolios in

the same ratios between bonds and capital (if, say, the individual had con-

stant relative risk aversion) as before; but since the relative supply of

bonds has increased, this implies that the market could not be in equilib-

rium with real variables unchanged. This argument ignores the nature of

the tax liability which the individual anticipates will be imposed on him

in the future. The individual hedges this particular risk by holding on to

bonds (since he knows that the magnitude of the tax liability will be related

to the price of the bonds by the basic government budget constraint). There

is a simple moral to this story: traditional portfolio theory, based on

myopic risk analysis, may be seriously misleading when analyzing intertem—
                     1
poral equilibrium.

     We summarize this section in Proposition I.    (The General Irrelevance

Theorem, or Say's Law of Government Deficits). An increase in the

ment deficit has neither real nor inflationary effects so long as the

ciated changes in taxes are distribution neutral and so long as the debt

will eventually be reduced to its original level.




1. Another area in which myopic portfolio analysis has recently been shown
   to be very misleading is in the analysis of the effect of capital gains
   taxation. A reduction in the tax rate on long—term capital gains might
   increase government revenue, but at the same time lead to an increase
   in consumption and a reduction of savings (since individuals' future
   tax liabilities have been reduced.) See Stiglitz (1981).

     The Second Irrelevance Proposition: The Neutrality of Inflation

     In this section we prove a second irrelevance proposition. We estab-

lish Proposition II. A change in the interest rate paid (in any state of

nature, at any date) financed by an increase in debt has an effect on the

price level, but not on any real variables. In particular, the real value

of debt (By) at all subsequent dates and states remains unchanged.

     This proposition is true not only in models with infinitely—lived

individuals, but also in life cycle models. An immediate corollary of this

proposition, then, is that such a financial policy has no intergenerational

distributive implications.

     Since in the subsequent sections of this paper we shall focus our

attention on the life cycle model, we establish the proposition in that

context. The modifications required to establish the proposition for the

economy analyzed in the previous section are straightforward.

     We assume individuals live for two periods, working in the first, and

saving part of their wage income for their retirement. In the subsequent

discussion, all variables are functions of t and the state of nature,

but for notational simplicity we shall suppress the dependence on the state

of nature except where it would give rise to ambiguities. To simplify our

analysis further, we assume labor is inelastically supplied, with L

normalized at unity. We assume a constant population, which we also

normalize at unity.
                                      16




        For simplicity, we assume that individuals' utility functions

are separable.1'2


(12)         U     u1(C1(t)) + 3 u(C2(t))


where


            C1(t) is the consumption the first period of those born at

                   date t,and
            C2(t) is the consumption the second period of those born at

                   date t   .
The individual maximizes his expected utility


(13)        max E u(C1(t)) +
                                u(C2(t))

subject to this budget constraint, which we can write in parametric form as




1. This plays no role in this section, but has some interesting implications
   for the analysis of Section VI.

2. As in the standard life cycle model, we assume away altruism: individuals
   do not care either for their antecedents or their descendants. If all in-
   dividuals care about their children, and their children care about their
   children, then clearly, we obtain a derived utility function where consump-
   tion at all future dates enters into the individual's welfare function (see
   Barro (1976)). Though the fact that some individuals do intentionally leave
   bequests suggests that the assumption of no altruism is extreme, the assump-
   tion that everyone leaves a bequest, and adjusts fully for a change in gov-
   ernment debt by a change in his bequest, is also extreme. The qualitative
   propositions presented in this section require only that there exist some
   individuals who leave no bequests, either because of a complete lack of
   altruism, or because they have no children. Since, in fact, a significant
   fraction of the population has no children, and with a non—zero probability,
   any individual will have only a finite number of descendants, we believe
   that the qualitative results presented here are of some relevance.

3. Thus, C2(t) occurs at date t+1

(14)         C2(t) =    K(t+1)(l+(t+1))         + B(t)(v(t+1) + i(t)) —
                                                                          T2(t)

(15)         K(t) + B(t)v(t) =      w(t)   -            -
                                                T1(t)       C1(t)

where


             T1(t) =     lump sum taxes on young individuals at date t , and


             T2(t) =     lump sum taxes on old individuals at date t+1


Equation (15) simply says that the individual takes the resources available

to him at date t (his wages minus lump sum taxes), and either consumes

them or saves them; and if he saves them, he saves them either in the form

of bonds or in the form of capital (equities). Equation (14) says that the

individual's consumption the second period of his life consists of his return

on capital and bonds, minus any lump sum taxes, plus what he can sell his

capital and bonds for to the younger generation. (These are just equations

(3) and (4) rewritten for this simple case.)

        Individuals form expectations concerning future prices and are assumed

to know the      probability distribution of the return on equities. They are
also    assumed to know the probability distribution of the real lump sum

transfers that they will receive when they are old. This yields, in a

straightforward way, individuals' optimal consumption and investment
             1
decisions:


(16a)        C1(t) =     Ci(w(t)   + T1(t), (t), i9(t+1), T2(t))


             K(t+1) =
(16b)
                         K+i(w(t)    + T1(t), (t), ?j(t+1), T2(t))




1. C2(t) is determined as a residual, from equation (14).
                                                18




 (16c)        v(t)B(t)           B+i(w(t) + T1(t), (t), fj(t+i), T2(t))


 (Equations (16a), (16b), and (16c) are, of course, not all independent; from

the budget constraint, knowing C1(t) and K(t) we can infer what B(t)

must be. Equation (16c) shows the important property that the real demand

for bonds (vB) depends on the real rates of return on the different assets.)

         Assume we initially have an equilibrium, with the values of all (market

clearing) variables denoted by a single caret. Assume now that at t1 the

government increases i to i and finances the increased interest payments

by issuing more bonds. Then, there exists a new equilibrium to the economy

with all real variables unchanged, but with (denoting the new equilibrium

values by double carets):



(17)
             (t+1) + (t)          =   (t+1)   + I(t)   =   p(t)   + 1   for all t > t1
                    (t)                    (t)

             (t)
             A
                       =   (t)        for t <


i.e., the rate of inflation will adjust to keep the real return on debt the

same (in every state of nature) and at every date. Moreover,

                   A
(18)         (t)B(t) =           (t)B(t)      for all t


       Since the real returns on all assets are unchanged, and taxes are un-

changed, demands for capital, "real" bonds (vB) and consumption are

unchanged. If all markets cleared in the initial situation, they still do.

       To confirm that the government budget constraint is satisfied, we re-

write (8) using (1):
                                             19




(19)            G(t,O(t)) =     T.(t,O(t))

                + v(t,O(t))B*(t,O(t)) -      v(t_1,O(t_1))B*(t_1,O(t_1))

                + p(t,O(t),8(t_1))v(t_1,O(t_1))B*(t_1,O(t_1))


So long as vB and p remain unchanged, the government's budget constraint

will be satisfied at each date, in every state.            It immediately follows that

any sequence of such changes (such as a permanent change in the interest

rate) also has no effect on the economy.


Iv. The Fundamental Relevance Theorem

        In the preceding two sections, we provided two general sets of condi-

tions under which government financial policy would not matter; in

Proposition I, it had neither real nor financial (price) effects, while in

Proposition II, it had no real effects, but there were effects on the price

of bonds (relative to consumption goods). In this section, we show that

changes in financial structure-—other than those described in the preceding

two propositions——always have a real effect on the economy.

        Not surprisingly, it makes a difference to the analysis whether the

change in financial policy is announced (or anticipated) or unannounced

(unanticipated). We first consider the effects of perfectly anticipated

policy       changes.   Assume that the government announces that at some date,

        in the future, it will increase its debt, and        at   the same   time changes
       and     T2 to keep the budget constraints of the government satisfied.

At some subsequent date, t2 (t2 >          t1 + 2) ,   it will decrease the outstanding
debt and increase taxes in a corresponding way. In intervening               periods, it
increases      bonds    to pay the additional interest costs.      (This is the kind of
                                      20




policy change we considered in Section II, but there, the individuals were

infinitely-lived, so there was no intergenerational distributive effect of

the change.) Such a change obviously affects the consumption of different

individuals. The question is, under what conditions will the change in

debt policy have no real aggregate effects, e.g., on the level of capital

accumulation?1

        There is one special case that we shall focus on, that will be helpful

in developing our intuition concerning the nature of the equilibrium. Assume

that there is no risk, or that individuals are risk neutral. Clearly, as we

noted earlier, botids and capital must yield the same return and they will

then be perfect substitutes.

        The argument that the financial change we described above will have

real effects is simple. Either the price of bonds on the new path is the

same as on the old path, or it is not. Assume the prices are the same.

Then,    clearly, real returns at each date are unchanged. For this to be an
equilibrium,    individuals at all dates from t1 on   must be willing   to hold

the larger (real) bond supply. But an individual born at any date after

t1 and dying at any date before t2 finds his budget constraint unaffected,

and thus has his wage income, lump sum transfers, and savings unaffected. If

real capital accumulation is to be unchanged, therefore, his holdings of real

bonds must be unchanged, contradicting our assumption that the real bond

supply has increased.

        Suppose now that prices change. For simplicity, assume i is unchanged.

(The Second Irrelevance Theorem implies that this makes no difference.)

This implies   that if the policy change is to have no effects on

                  —

and


          v(t)B(t)           (t)B(t)         for t1+1 < t < t2—1


This implies that over the interval (t1—2, t1+1) the average rate of return

on bonds must have been less than that on capital, and hence this could not

be an equilibrium.

      There are two conditions imposed on the equilibrium; one relating to

the equality of the returns between financial assets and capital assets,

the other that investment must be equal to savings minus holdings of finan-

cial assets. It is impossible, within the life cycle model, to change the

supply of bonds in such a way as to have no real effects. Only if the bond

supply is increased at t1 and retired at t1+1 , and the additional

revenues generated at t1 are used to finance a lump sum subsidy to the

young, while a lump sum tax is levied on the old at t1+1 to retire the

debt, is the financial policy neutral. But then, the financial policy

affects only the t1 generation, i.e., it is completely described by

Proposition I.

      It should be clear that the assumptions of risk neutrality or no risk,

though they simplified our exposition, were not critical to the results.

        Even if the increase in the government debt at t is unanticipated,

 the policy change will have a real effect unless it is anticipated that

 there will be no subsequent reduction in the government debt. So long as

an unanticipated change gives rise to anticipations of further changes,

the previous analysis (mutatis mutandis) applies.

        This analysis has one interesting corollary. Assume for simplicity

that the single financial asset is non—interest .bearing (i =    0).   Assume,

moreover, that the government announces that it will increase the bond

(money) supply by a given percentage. It is sometimes supposed that equilib-

rium will be restored simply by an equi—percentage reduction in the price of

bonds (so that the real bond supply remains unchanged). But if this change

were anticipated, it would have had effects on the demand for bonds in pre-

ceding periods. Only if individuals completely ignore the asset return

will such a change be neutral. Moreover, if it is believed that the increase

in the bond supply is temporary, with it returning to the previous level the

next period, with prices at subsequent dates unaffected, individuals will

now anticipate a larger return to holding the bond than they obtained pre-

viously, and this will induce them to hold more bonds, again contradicting

the assumption of no real effects. On the other hand, if it is believed

that the increase in the bond supply is permanent, unless in the previous

situation the bond supply at all future dates were fixed, then the fixed

increase in bond supply represents a variable proportionate increase. Thus,

for the real bond supply to be fixed at every date requires the return to

the bond to vary from date to date. Finally, even if it is believed that

there   will be an equi—proportionate increase in the bond supply at every
date,   so that if   the price of bonds fell by a given percentage, the real
                                       23




bond supply at each date would be unchanged, there will be real effects. If

it were anticipated, of course, it would have had real effects in previous

periods. But even if it is unanticipated, it will have real effects, through

the government's budget constraint. The equi-proportionate fall in the price

of bonds is equivalent to a lump sum levy on the present owners of bonds.

Only if the extra revenue generated by this "tax" is spent on the old (the

owners   of   the bonds) will there be no distributive effects of the change

(and hence will there be no real effects).

      We can summarize the results of this section on Proposition III. 4

anticipated     changes in financial action other than those described in

Propositions I and II, have real and financial effects on the economy.

      ny unanticipated change has no real effects on the economy only if

(a) it does     not give rise to anticipations of further changes (i.e., it    does

not   change individuals' subj ective probability distributions concerning
future government actions); and (b) increases in debt are used to provide
lump sum subsidies to current owners of the financial asset (the aged).
      These results should not be surprising: it is well known that in this

form of the simple life cycle model there are simple equivalency relation-

ships between debt policy and social security policy; they induce equivalent

intergenerational redistributions of income and will, in general, have real

effects. (See Atkinson—Stiglitz, 1981.) We shall return to this theme in

Section VI.


V.     Second Relevance Proposition

       So far, we have considered the effect of a change in the financial

structure of the government at two points of time. We saw how any such
                                             24




changes would have real effects. We now ask, are there combinations of

such changes, with offsetting real effects? In particular, we now consider

the effect of financial policies, i.e., rules that specify what the govern-

ment will do under each contingency. In our simple model, the government

controls four variables; the bond supply, the interest it pays on government

debt, and the lump sum transfers to the young and to the old. It can make

these variables a function of all observable variables, i.e., letting


             x(t)    =   {K(t) , L(t),    C1(t), c2(t—1), (t), v(t)}

where     (t)   is   the vector {ri(t), w(t)} ,            the exogenous variables describing
the    state of the economy at any time, and


             x*(t) =      fx(t) x(t—1),
                                  ,          .   ..}


i.e., the entire history of the observable variables up to and including
their values at date t then a government financial policy is a sequence
                              ,



of   functions1 of the form


(20)        T1(t) =      Tit(x*(t))
            T2(t) =      T2t(x*(t))
                     =
            B(t)
                         B(x*(t))
                     =
            i(t)
                         1t(x*(t))

which satisfy the government's budget constraints. Thus, future government
actions   are unknown, simply         because the      events on which they will be based


1. In this formulation, actions at date t                 depend   on observables at t
     Other formulations, with lags in observations, will work as well.
                                         25




are unknown; but the policies are assumed to be known. As soon as the events

on which they depend become known, the government action is well specified.

       A rational expectations equilibrium can now be easily defined (for each

set of feasible policy functions). For each public financial policy (set

of functions (20)), and for each set of expectations about the price dis-

tribution


            v(t) =    v(x*(t_1),    fl(t), w(t))


(prices next period are a function of the entire history of observables up

to and including their values at t—1 and the realization of the exogenous

variables r and w ), there will be a demand for bonds B(x*(t))

Equilibrium requires that this demand for bonds equal the supply


                                              for all x*(t)
(21)        B(x*(t)) =    B(x*(t))
Rational expectations requires in addition that given the assumed known

probability distributions of           and w , and the policy functions (20),

expectations are realized

       A simple policy, for instance, would be to increase the bond        supply
by x% if the return to capital exceeds its average value, decrease it by
x% if the return to capital is less than its average value. This           kind of
rule makes little sense. In     a   sequel to this paper (Stiglitz (1982)),    we

consider the consequences of several simple but more reasonable rules.'

For now, we wish to show that, even if the government restricts itself to

policies which are functions of current exogenous variables, and confines

itself to policies which, in any state, have the same expected rate of in—

flation, i.e., E =      E   ,   changes in financial policy have real effects.

       The government, for instance, announces that if, at t ,         w(t)   =
                                                                                  w1

it will increase the bond supply more than it had planned to do under the

original financial policy, while if w(t) =
                                                 w2   ,   it will increase the bond
supply less. The two changes are chosen so that, in the rational expectations

equilibrium, the expected rate of change in the price level is unchanged.

       Consider first the case where individuals are risk neutral; by our

earlier   analysis we can, without loss of generality, restrict ourselves to
economies   in which government bonds pay no interest, so        in equilibrium2

(23)        Ev(t+1) =   v(t)(1+j)

       We investigate two cases, that where the changes in bonds are accompanied

by changes in taxes on the young, and that in which they are accompanied by

by changes in taxes on the old. In the latter case, since T1(t1) is unchanged,




1. A specification of a financial policy requires specifying not only the
   circumstances under which, for instance, B is increased or decreased,
   but who is taxed or subsidized. We consider three alternative rules for
   deficits (keeping the bond supply constant, keeping prices constant,
   keeping the real bond supply, vB , constant) under the assumption that
   any resulting deficits (or surpluses) are financed by (distributed as)
   lump sum taxes (subsidies) on, alternatively, the young or the old.

2. If we restrict ourselves to economies in which bonds pay an interest of
   Erj(t), so equilibrium requires
          Ev(t+1)     v(t),
   i.e., the price level is a Martingale.

if K(t) were unchanged for all t ,              vB      would be unchanged for all t

This follows from substituting the government's budget constraint into the

individual's      budget constraint, to obtain

(24)         v(t)B(t) + T1(t) = w(t)        —
                                                C1(t)
                                                        —
                                                            K(t+1)

If T1(t) is unchanged,           individuals' opportunity sets are unchanged,1       and
hence     C1(t) is unchanged. But this implies that T2(t1—1) must be in—




                                                             t)
creased. Rewriting the government's budget constraint for this case, we

obtain    (from   (8)



                                v(t,0(t))B(t,0(t)) -                     x
(25)         G(t,0(t))



            v(t—1,0(t—1))B(t—1, 0(t—1)) + T2(t—1,0(t))

Hence, if  B(t1,O(t1)) is changed for some 0(t1), v(t1,0(t1)) must have
changed, and hence T2(t1—l,O(t1)) must have changed. If, however, the
expected value of v(t1) is unchanged,(i.e., (23) is satisfied), the ex-

pected value of T2(t1—1) is unchanged, and if individuals' behavior only

depends    on their expected taxes next period, this change            has no effect on

capital accumulation at dates prior to t1 .                 Under these circumstances,

then, this change in financial policy has no aggregate real effects.                (By

the same    token,      a sequence of such changes, e.g., changes in the financial

rules at every date, or at the same         date   in more states, will have no real

effects.)



1. We required in addition that T2(t) be unchanged for t > t1 . But if
   vB and p at all subsequent dates (in all states) are unchanged, then
   the government's budget constraint will be satisfied, without the alter-
   ation in any taxes, and in particular, without the alteration in T2(t)
   for t>t
                                   28




     But this is, essentially, the only circumstance in which a change in

financial policy has no real effects. Consider, by contrast, what happens

if the change in the debt is accompanied by a change in T1 .   From the

government's budget constraint, it is clear that an increase in the return

on government bonds in some state 0 accompanied by a tax on the young is

equivalent to a transfer of resources in that state from the young

to the old. But the marginal propensity to consume of the old is unity;

the marginal propensity to consume of the young is, in general, less than

unity; and hence the total demand for consumption goods increases. But

then it is impossible for the level of capital accumulation in that state

to remain unchanged.

     Moreover, even if the government accompanies changes in the returns to

government bonds by changes in the taxes of the old, these changes will not

be neutral if individuals are not risk neutral. For our earlier analysis

showed that if v(t1)B(t1) remains unchanged, in all states, C2 will

remain unchanged. But then individuals at t2 will not be in portfolio

equilibrium, except if the marginal utility of consumption in the two states

for which p is altered are the same.' This establishes that the previous

argument for the neutrality of financial policy cannot be extended to the

case of risk averse individuals.1

     The results of this section are summarized in Proposition IV. Mean—p

preserving changes in financial policy have no real effects if and only if

the individual is risk neutral and changes in the level of debt are offset

by changes in lump sum taxes/subsidies for the aged.


VI. Implementability of Optimal Intertemporal Risk Redistribution Schemes
     Through Financial Policies with Constant Price Levels

     We have stressed in the preceding two sections that alternative govern-

mental financial policies have real effects, largely because they generate

changes in the intertemporal distribution of risk and wealth. Because in-

dividuals of different generations cannot get together to trade risks, the

only way such risks can be exchanged is through governmental action. Any

financial policy has implications for the intergenerational distribution

of risk bearing, and changes in the financial policy thus benefit some gen-

erations at the expense of others. The government needs to take this into

account when designing its financial policies.

     In this section, we characterize the optimal intergenerational distribu-

tion of risk bearing and show that this policy can be implemented by means

of a financial policy with constant prices, provided that the government's

ability to levy lump sum taxes on the young and the old is sufficiently

flexible.




1. What this establishes is that if financial policy is to have no real
   effects at t1 ,  it must change v(t1)B(t1) . To establish that the
   change in financial policy must have real effects, we need to show that
   it is not possible for there to be a sequence of changes in v(t)B(t)
   for t > t1 , and associated changes in T2(t) (to keep the government's
   budget balance), such that the level of capital accumulation at each date
   is unchanged. We do not present the proof here.
                                               30




        The problem of the optimal intertemporal allocation of resources can

be easily formulated; for simplicity, we assume an additive social welfare

function of the standard form


                 Ut
(28)
               t (l-H5)

where u denotes the utility of the tth generation, given by


                =
                      u1(C1(t)) +        u2(C(t))
where 1/1+5 is the social rate of discount. We wish to maximize (28)

subject to the resource constraints of the economy. For simplicity, we

assume that labor is fixed (L = 1) and that capital (like rabbits) can be

eaten, so that the resources available at date t            are   given by:'


(29)         S(t) =    w(t)   + K(t)(1+(t))


while


(30)        K(t+1) =       s(t)   —
                                      C1(t)
                                              —
                                                  C2(t—1)

In addition, there is a natural non—negativity constraint on


(31)        K(t) >     0


       Formulated in this way, we have converted our problem into a standard

optimal savings problem with random wages and returns on capital, with the

standard non—negativity constraints on capital. This can be solved using




1. Again, for simplicity, we have ignored population growth. This may easily
   be incorporated into the analysis.
                                          31




dynamic programming techniques.' Our interest here, however, is not in

characterizing the solution so much as in providing an analysis of the imple—

mentation of the optimal intertemporal redistribution of income through

financial and tax policy. Hence, we simply assert that the solution yields

consumption and capital accumulation functions of the form2


(32)        C1(t) =    C(S(t))
(33)
            C2(t—1)        Ci(s(t))

and


            K(t+1) =
(34)
                       K1(S(t))
       The assumptions that wages and the return on capital, at each date, are

identically distributed independent random variables are essential in ob-

taining this simplification. If, for instance, wages were described by a

random walk, then w itself would be a state variable.

       We now consider how this optimal colution can be implemented in a market

economy with a single financial instrument.

       To implement any policy, it must control, at each date, and each state,

three variables; C1, C2, and K .          The government has four instruments,

T1, T2 ,     i   and B .    This   suggests a redundancy of instruments, and indeed,




1. The solution to this problem, ignoring the non—negativity constraints,
   is fairly straightforward. Taking these non—negativity constraints into
   account, however, complicates the problem in an essential way. Newbery
   and Stiglitz (1981) provide an extensive discussion of the solution of
  this problem for the special case where n is non—random.

2. The assumption of separability of the utility function was essential in
   arriving at this simplification in the structure of the solution. With a
   non—separable utility function, there are two state variables describing
   the economy at any date t , S(t) and C1(t—1)
                                      32




Proposition   II showed that there was such a redundancy. We could change        i
and change the bond supply in such a way as to keep the government's budget

balanced, and have no real effects; such a policy would, however, have an

effect on the price level (v).

       The four instruments are not independent, since they are linked together

by the government's budget constraint. There are thus three independent in-

struments. On the other hand, the three variables C1, C2 , and           K are

also not independent; they are linked together by the individual's budget

constraint, or, equivalently, by the national income constraint:


(35)
            c(t) + c2(t—1)
                           + K(t+1) =      w(t)   + (l-i-(t))K(t)


If we take these constraints into account, we thus have three independent

variables controlling two independent equations. It would seem apparent

that we could easily implement any desired intertemporal allocation of risk

bearing, including the optimal one we have just derived. We establish, in

fact, a slightly stronger result: we can implement this policy through a

financial policy involving constant prices, i.e.,


(36)        v = v+i     =        =    1        (without loss of generality)


       To see this, and to help develop our intuition, we begin with the case

where there is no risk. Then, (36) together with the equilibrium require-

ment of equality of returns, implies that we set


(37)        i(t)      (t)            all   t



In   this situation, individuals are indifferent to holding bonds or capital

in their portfolio.
                                                  33




        To induce any generation to consume the correct amount, we increase or

decrease T1 .          So long as the marginal propensity to consume is not zero,

this will lead to a change in C1 .                   Next, we increase or decrease B so
that the desired amount of capital accumulation occurs. (Since the two are

perfect substitutes, an increase in B induces a dollar—for—dollar decrease

in K .)        If   C1 and K are set at their correct levels, C2 must be at

its desired level (by (35)). Similarly, any deficit is financed by lump sum

taxes on the aged and any surplus is distributed to the aged.

        Formally, we find the optimal policy by solving the set of equations.1


(38a)                C(S(t)) =          Ci(w(t)     + T1(t), r, T2(t+1))


(38b)                K*(S(t))           w(t) —
                                                  C(S(t))
                                                               —   B(t)   —
                                                                              T1(t)

(38c)                                    + B(t) — B(t—1)              C + i(t—1)B(t—1)
                     T1(t) + T2(t)

Essentially the same argument holds if r is random; now, however, indi-

viduals are not indifferent as to the form in which they hold their assets.

Changing T1 alters the level of consumption and savings the first period.

Now, however, the fraction of this savings that they wish to hold in the

form of capital is not indeterminate. To induce individuals to hold more

capital, we have to make the return on capital more attractive relative to




1. (38b) can easily be solved for the optimal sequence of B(t) + T1 E                             z*(t).
   Then, using (38c), we can rewrite (38a)
           C!(S(t)) =      Cit(w(t)    + T1,        z*(t+1) + (l+fl)(z*(t) —          T1(t))   + G)

  which we can solve for Tt(t), and hence for B*(t)

money. We can do this by lowering i .      By this means we can ensure that

C1 and Kt are "correct" for each S .        But this (through the national

income    identities) assures us that C2(t—1) is also correct.
    We have thus established Proposition V. The optimal intertemporal
distribution   of income can be implemented by means of a financial policy

with a constant price level, provided there is a sufficient flexibility in

the imposition of lump sum taxes/subsidies on the young and the old.


VII. The Role of Additional Financial Instruments

     Since we have shown that we can obtain the optimal intertemporal dis-

tribution of income with a single financial asset, is there any role to be

played by the introduction of additional financial assets, e.g., government

bonds of   differing maturities? We show here that if   there is   complete flexi-
bility in    the imposition of lump sum taxes and subsidies, such an additional

financial asset has no effect, but if there are restrictions, say, on the

variability of lump sum payments to the aged, then an additional financial

instrument can be used to achieve the optimal intertemporal distribution of

income.

     For simplicity, let our second financial asset be a long—term bond, a

perpetuity, paying $1 every period. The price, q ,      of   these bonds is,

however, random, so that the net yield r is a random variable. Government

policy again entails a rule for the increase or decrease in the supply of

these financial instruments, as a function of the state (and possibly history)

of the economy.

     It is obvious that, in the case where r is not random, and v              is
constant, such a financial instrument is completely redundant. For since
                                                   35




is constant, the price, q ,              of   this security is fixed, and it is no different

from a short—term bond.

        In the case where r is random, however, such a security is different

from a short—term bond. To show that it is still redundant, we need to

rewrite the government's budget constraint.


(39)           T1 +     T2 + q(t)(D(t)   — D(t—1)) +       v(t)(B(t)   —   B(t—1))

               =    G   +   i(t—1)B(t-1) + D(t-1)

where    D(t) is the number of long—term bonds outstanding at date t.
       Thus,       assume that the government were to £ ix T2 at zero (or at any

other arbitrary fixed level). Assume the government set T1 at its pre-

vious level, and            set

(40)                +             vB   for all dates and states


i.e., made the total value of outstanding government securities the same.

We can easily verify that, taking the government budget constraint into

account, the value of second period consumption is


(41)           K(t+1)(l+(t+1)) + T1 —          C   + q(t+1)D(t+1) + v(t+1)B(t+1)


which is identical to what it would have been had the government had a single

financial asset. (Compare (41) and                 (25),   using (40).)

       Thus, the individual's first order condition for savings (first period

consumption) is still satisfied (equation (24)) at the original value of

C1     and since savings are unchanged, and the value of financial assets is

unchanged, capital accumulation is unchanged. By the national income identity
                                             36



(35),     C2 must be unchanged."2

        The analysis so far has assumed that there is a single type of indi-

vidual. Is the second financial instrument redundant if individuals differ?

        First best optimality would necessitate the government imposing a

different set of lump sum taxes/subsidies on each type of individual. We

assume that that is not feasible. The addition of a second risky asset may

have two effects: it may affect the ability of the economy to efficiently

share risks within a generation; and it may affect the intra— and inter-

generational distribution of income. In order to abstract from the first

effect, let us assume that there is initially a complete set of intra—

generational Arrow—Debreu securities markets, so that the marginal rate of

substitution between consumption in two different states is the same for

all individuals alive contemporaneously. Still, the addition of a second




1. We assume q(t), i(t), v(t)} adjust to whatever they have to in order
   for portfolio equilibrium to be established.

2. More formally, we show that the individual's opportunity set is unchanged.
   For simplicity, we normalize by letting (t)     1 =      .         (t)
                                                                  the indi- If
   vidual sets

           (t) =       (t) +
   the government's budget constraint is satisfied with unchanged taxes if
           A       A      A
           i(t)B(t)     + B(t) =       (1+i)B(t) ÷ D(t)   + (t)D(t)
               A                       A
           + B(t—1) — B(t—1)       —
                                       (t)D(t—1)
           =   (1+i)B(t) +D(t) +       q(t)D(t)

   Clearly, any sequence of {i, C2,                }
                                         which was initially feasible is
   still feasible (and conversely). Hence, the same {C1, C2, K} will be
   chosen: nothing real has changed. This establishes that corresponding
   to any equilibrium with long—term bonds, there is a corresponding and
   essentially identical equilibrium without long—term bonds.
                                   37




financial asset will, in general, have real effects. For assume not. Then

it must be the case that the Arrow—Debreu prices are unaffected by the

changes in financial policy; but the change in financial policy does result

in a change in T2 , and hence in the value of the individuals' endowments.

But this change in the value of endowment, at fixed Arrow—Debreu prices,

will have real effects, both on C1 and C2

     In general, then, adding an additional financial asset will have real

effects.

     The basic intuition behind this result is that policies which affect

aggregate consumption, say, in the second period, in the same way, may have

different effects on different individuals. Paying an effectively higher

return on long—term bonds, but lowering social security payments, may, on

average, have no effect on the consumption of the aged. But the old who are

less risk averse and buy risky, long—term bonds are better off under such a

policy, and those who do not speculate, and   rely   on their social security

payments, are relatively worse off. But these intragenerational distribu-

tional changes have, in turn, real effects on the economy.

     Note that for any particular specification of the financial policy of

the government, we can calculate the term structure of interest rates, the

relationship between the expected return on the long—term bond and the return

on the short-term bond; though the normal presumption is that, since the

long—term bonds are riskier, they have to yield an expected return which

exceeds that on the short—term bond, since, in equilibrium, the yield on

the long—term bonds is related to S(t+1) , as is T2(t) ,       it   is conceivable

that just the opposite result obtains.

     It is easy for the government to create additional financial instruments.

Assume that the government announces a long-term bond, which when the state

is S(t)   , will yield (in the following period) a return I(S) ;    such a per-

petuity will (with the appropriate financial policy) yield a variable return,

which will not, in general, be a linear function of the return on short—term

bonds and long—term perpetuities with fixed payments. And so long as such

instruments represent real additions to the set of assets, and so long as

there are fewer such instruments than there are types of individuals in the

economy, then these additional instruments will not be redundant.

     The basic insight behind the results of this section can be put fairly

simply. When all individuals are identical, to tcontroltt the economy, all

one needs to do is to control C1(t) and K(t+1) .     This   requires two in-

struments, and the availability of age specific lump sum payments and short—

term bonds provides us with all the instruments we need. But when individuals

are not identical, and we cannot vary the age specific lump sum payments from

individual to individual, we have more uobjects we wish to control than we

                                                                        and
have instruments; i.e., we would like to control C(t) ,
                                                             C(t)   ,         K(t)

Increasing the set of financial instruments, then, does in general increase

the real opportunity set of the economy.

     The results of this section are summarized in Proposition VI. With a

single type of individual, and full flexibility in the imposition of lump

sum taxes and subsidies, additional financial instruments (such as long—term

bonds) are redundant. When there are more types of individuals, or when

there are restrictions on the flexibility of lump sum taxes and subsidies,

additional financial instruments are not redundant. The maturity structure

of the government debt then has real effects.

     Extensions and Concluding Remarks

     The object of this paper has been to develop a framework within which

alternative financial policies of the government may be analyzed. It is our

contention that any meaningful analysis of public financial policy requires

the integration of all the important aspects of debt, tax, and social

security policy within a single framework, and in particular, requires an

intertemporal, stochastic model. There are some circumstances in which we

have shown that changes in public financial policy (such as changes in cor-

porate financial policy) have neither real nor financial effects (i.e., all

prices remain unchanged). An increase in the supply of bonds gives rise to

an exactly equal increase in the demand for bonds. There are other circum-

stances in which changes in public financial policy have effects on prices,

but no real effects. Thus public financial policy affects the rate of

inflation, but the rate of inflation has no real consequences. In general,

however, public financial policy has real consequences for the intertemporal

distribution of risk bearing, and thus for tle intertemporal distribution of

welfare. Even restricting the government to financial policies with the

same expected rate of inflation, and the same expected return to financial

assets, changes in financial policy have important real effects on the

economy. Indeed, we showed how an appropriately designed public financial

policy could be used to implement the first best intertemporal allocation

of resources. To do this required, however, complete flexibility in the

imposition of lump sum taxes and subsidies on the young and the old. When,

for instance, social security payments were not allowed to vary from year

to year and from state to state, the first best intertemporal allocation of

resources could only be implemented through public financial policy if there

was an additional financial instrument.

       It should be noticed that in the model we have constructed all indi-

viduals have fully rational expectations concerning the nature of future

government policies. Yet, in general, in spite of the rational expectations,

public financial policy does have real effects. Those models which have

concluded that with rational expectations government financial policy is

irrelevant reach their conclusions not because of their assumptions concern-

ing how expectations are formed, but rather from the specific structural

assumptions of their models. One such assumption which has been extensively

criticized is their assumption of complete price flexibility (see Taylor

(1980) and Neary—Stiglitz (forthcoming)); results concerning full employment

(and hence the inefficacy of monetary policy) are perhaps not surprising in

a world with perfect price flexibility, and could be established under a

variety of assumptions concerning how expectations are formulated. Here,

we have established that even with perfect price flexibility, changes in

public financial policy will in general have real effects.

       The   analysis of this paper raises several further questions of interest.
First, we have assumed, throughout, that all taxes are lump sum. In practice,
most taxes are distortionary. With lump sum taxes, the intertemporal pattern
of   the imposition of taxes (on a single    individual) makes no difference.

When   taxes are distortionary, it does. In the absence of uncertainty, for
instance,     with suitable symmetry and separability assumptions, it would be

optimal      to levy wage taxes at a constant rate throughout the individual's

lifetime. This provides, then, a simple theory of the optimal size of the

government debt: government debt simply serves as a "buffer stock" between

the optimal pattern of government expenditure and the optimal pattern of

tax revenues. The analysis of optimal taxation in the presence of uncertainty

is a far more complicated question, which we hope to pursue elsewhere.

     Second, it is of interest to know the consequences of alternative simple

financial rules. If the government must choose, say, between a rule which

maintains prices fixed, and a rule which keeps the real value of the debt

fixed, which is preferable?

     Third, although we have provided a general result characterizing the

optimal pattern of the intertemporal distribution of resources under uncer-

tainty, we have not provided many insights into its detailed structure; this

will be required if we are to analyze the structure of optimal public finan-

cial policies.

     Fourth, although we have discussed the role of additional financial

instruments, there are two such securities that merit more detailed attention.

We have ignored throughout the role of government debt in facilitating trans-

actions; in particular, we have ignored the distinction between non—interest

bearing short—terni debt and interest bearing short—term debt. If we intro-

duce money, and assume that it has transactions advantages over interest

bearing short—term debt, how are our results affected? The results reported

in Stiglitz (1982) suggest that, if anything, introducing debt strengthens

the presumption that public financial policy does matter.

     A second financial instrument which has received extensive attention

in recent years is a government bond with a guaranteed real rate of return.

Would the introduction of these indexed bonds make a difference? The analy-

sis of this paper (confirmed by the results in Stiglitz (1982)) suggests

that if individuals are essentially identical, then this additional finan-

cial instrument is redundant; but that if they differ enough, then providing

this extra instrument does expand the real opportunity set of the economy.

       Finally, and   perhaps   most importantly, the analysis of this paper has

been conducted within a neoclassical framework, in which there is full

employment every period. One of the central issues with which public finan-

cial   policy has traditionally been concerned is the extent to    which it can

affect the level of employment and       output. To address these questions re-

quires the formulation of a macro—economic model with unemployment. It is

likely that at least some of the mechanisms by which public financial policy

affects the economy in such circumstances are quite different from those

portrayed here.
