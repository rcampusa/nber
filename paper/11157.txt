An Improved Annual Chronology of U.S. Business Cycles since the 1790's
Joseph H. Davis
NBER Working Paper No. 11157
February 2005
JEL No. N1, E3

                                           ABSTRACT

The NBER's pre-WWI chronology of annual peaks and troughs has the remarkable implication that

the U.S. economy spent nearly every other year in recession, although previous research has argued

that the post-Civil War dates are flawed. This paper extends that research by redating annual peaks

and troughs for the entire 1796-1914 period using a single metric: Davis' (2004) annual industrial

production index. The new pre-WWI chronology alters more than 40% of the peak and troughs, and

removes cycles long considered the most questionable. An important implication of the new

chronology is the lack of discernible differences in the frequency and duration of industrial cycles

among the pre-Civil War, Civil War to WWI, and post-WWII periods. Of course, my comparison

between pre-WWI and post-WWII cycles is limited by its reliance on a single annual index (as

opposed to many monthly series) that is less comprehensive than GDP.

    As the official arbiter of when U.S. business cycles occur and how long they last, the

National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) maintains a chronology of monthly peaks and

troughs since 1854 and an annual record as early as 1790. As is well known, Willard Thorp’s

Business Annals (published in 1926) marked the initial step that the then-recently-formed NBER

took toward identifying these business-cycle turning points.

    The Business Annals are a brief summary and interpretation of U.S. economic conditions in

every year from 1790 through 1925 that could be best discerned from contemporaneous business

and popular press reports. Thorp compiled the annals by consulting extant newspapers and other

trade publications held at the New York Public Library. In doing so, Thorp formed an annual

“phrase summary” across four broad categories: (i.) industry, commerce, and labor; (ii.) money,

security, and foreign exchange markets; (iii.) agricultural production and farm prices; and, (iv.)

non-economic phenomena, such as political events, wars, and catastrophes. Thorp then

subjectively weighed the four narrative summaries that, in his judgment, best reflected one (or

more) of the four phase cycles that business conditions were likely in: depression, revival,

prosperity, and recession.1 From glancing at the Business Annals, it becomes clear that Thorp

gave primacy to industrial and commercial activity in arriving at his aggregate assessment.

    Mitchell (1926; 1927, 387, table 23) mapped one-for-one Thorp’s inflection years marked

recessions and revival as peaks and troughs, respectively, to serve as the critical foundation for

the NBER’s business-cycle chronology.2 Since the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee has

not revised their original prewar cycles, Thorp’s anecdotal-based assessment of annual business

1
  For example, Thorp’s phrase summary for 1813 is simply “prosperity,” but his assessment of 1847 is “revival;
prosperity; panic; recession.” On several occasions, Thorp interjected adjectives to indicate the relative severity of a
contraction, such as “deep depression” for 1894 or “mild depression” for 1911.
2
  The term recession was a novel one suggested by Wesley Mitchell (Thorp’s dissertation advisor at Columbia) to
replace the more vague and confusing term crisis found in previously written and often-contradictory business
annals unaffiliated with the NBER. Mitchell’s use of the term recession marked the NBER’s attempt at
                                                                                                               3




conditions remains the cornerstone underpinning the NBER’s identification of whether a U.S.

recession occurred between 1790 and 1915. (The first two columns of Table 1 present the annual

peaks and troughs to the prewar NBER chronology).

    Historical comparisons of the frequency and duration of recessions and expansions based on

the NBER chronology proffer very persuasive evidence that the American business cycle has

moderated recently. Indeed, post-World War II expansions (contractions) are twice as long

(short) as their pre-WWI counterparts (see Diebold and Rudebusch, 1992). Although the precise

reasons for this apparent stabilization remain a source of debate, Samuelson (1998, 34–35)

argues that longer post-WWII expansions and shorter post-WWII contractions testify to “an

important truth” and signify the most compelling aspect of the U.S. economic stabilization story.

    Yet an investigation during the 1990s into Burns and Mitchell’s (1946) disclaimer on the

very limited and rather circumstantial empirical support for the pre-WWII NBER chronology

revealed inherent biases in the official turning points. Watson (1994) showed that when post-

WWII (hence, “postwar”) cycles are defined solely from nominal price data for commodities,

crude materials, and financial instruments, subsequent differences in cyclical properties between

the pre-WWI (hence, “prewar”) and postwar periods appear small. Furthermore, Romer (1994)

demonstrated that, contrary to modern NBER guidelines, the monthly peaks and troughs between

1884 and 1927 were derived from detrended data that tend to date prewar peaks earlier and

troughs later vis-à-vis postwar turning points derived from data in levels.

    These important studies have raised additional questions regarding what we think we know

about the earliest U.S. business cycles. Do the systematic dating errors that Romer documents for

the post-1884 NBER chronology afflict earlier peaks and troughs, as some historians have long


discriminating “periods of dull business” from the less obvious effects of financial panics during the nineteenth
century.

suspected? How reliably could early NBER researchers judge if and when a recession occurred

before the Civil War if they only had access to scattered press reports and their listings of

commodity prices? Did persistent deflationary episodes lead the nineteenth-century NBER

chronology to mistake declines in nominal aggregates for falls in real output? While researchers

have long questioned the reliability of several prewar recessions, a resolution has remained

elusive because of the lack of reliable time-series data. Indeed, Thorp’s qualitative assessment of

business conditions during the antebellum period have not been as rigorously examined as they

have been for the postbellum period, primarily because reliable annual output data for the

antebellum period have been unavailable.

   This paper expands upon the research of Watson (1994), Romer (1994), and others whom

have argued that the NBER’s postbellum chronology is systematically flawed by reexamining

both the antebellum and postbellum cycles. Specifically, we construct an alternative set of annual

peaks and troughs between 1796 and 1914 from a simple mapping of the absolute peaks and

troughs in Davis’ (2004) annual index of U.S. industrial production.

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section I discusses the data employed to construct an

alternative set of prewar peak and trough years. I then turn my attention to the limitations of

employing a single annual index (as opposed to many monthly series) that is less comprehensive

than GDP in establishing an alternative set of industrial cycles. Section I ends with a focus on the

differences between the new and old prewar chronologies. Section II statistically examines the

differences in the characteristics between the NBER dates and alternative chronology developed

in this paper. Given the marked differences between the peak-trough sets, Section II then

investigates the potential implications of these revisions when compared to similarly-constructed

annual peaks and troughs for the postwar period. Section III contains some concluding remarks.

I.      Reevaluating the prewar NBER business-cycle chronology



        a. New dates from new data

     As a basis for evaluating the reliability of Thorp’s annual business cycles, I have constructed

an alternative set of annual peaks and troughs for the 1796–1915 period. The basis for the

alternative chronology is a single metric: an entirely new annual dataset on U.S. industrial

production as described in Davis (2002) and finalized in Davis (2004).

     Using a methodology similar to the Federal Reserve Board’s present-day industrial

production series, the Davis index assembles 43 annual components in the manufacturing and

mining industries that are consistently defined from 1790 until WWI.3 The Davis index is a

comprehensive industrial output measure in that its components indirectly represent close to 90

percent of the value added produced by the U.S. industrial sector during the nineteenth century.

The primary attribute of the industrial production index is that it is devoid of nominal data, so

that index changes reflect purely fluctuations in real output.

     I adopted the dating algorithm of Romer (1994) in developing an alternative prewar

chronology of annual peaks and troughs for the U.S. industrial sector. Since I consult annual data

to date peaks and troughs, the methodology is quite simple: A year immediately preceding an

absolute decline in the aggregate level of Davis’ industrial production index defines a peak, and

the last consecutive decline following a peak is a trough.4

     The new, alternative prewar chronology is listed in the middle columns of Table 1.


3
  The relative importance of the 43 components in the Davis index changes over time by using two separate base
years (1850 and 1880) and linking the overlapping series in chronological segments. The index possesses complete
industry coverage after 1826, with moderate attrition back through 1790. The attribution of annual fluctuations in
the aggregate index to any single component series may vary from year to year based upon additional factors,
including data attrition and the emergence of new products. See Davis (2004) for complete details.
4
  I had to exclude the long U.S. expansion from 1790 through 1796 from the analysis because the validity of Thorp’s
1790 trough cannot be addressed without an index that spans the 1780s.
                                                                                               6




       b. Limitations of approach

   This simple approach in establishing peaks and troughs possesses at least four shortcomings

compared to how the NBER currently identifies turning points. First, the present study consults

one annual series to date prewar cycles. By comparison, the modern NBER dates (including the

annual ones) are based on a vast database of monthly series that gauge consumer and business

activity across an array of manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. It is important to

note, however, that the Federal Reserve Board’s (FRB) index of industrial production remains

among the most important coincident indicators of U.S. business cycles.

   This raises a second potential shortcoming: the Davis index for 1790–1915 may not be as

reliable as a cyclical measure as is the FRB index, which begins in 1919. Conceptually, the two

indexes attempt to measure the same fundamentals, namely the level of physical production in

the nation’s manufacturing and mining industries. However, the FRB index has a larger set of

underlying components, ranging from 60 series in 1919 to more than 200 series by the 1950’s

(U.S. Board of Governors 1986, 63, table 5.1). Since there is no period of overlap between the

two series, there is no direct evidence that the Davis index is more or less cyclically sensitive

than the FRB index.

   However, we can loosely gauge the relative cyclical sensitivities of the two series by

regressing logarithmic growth rates in each index on a third industrial production index that

partially spans both the Davis and FRB index. This is appropriate if we consult the Miron and

Romer (1990) industrial production index for the 1884–1940 period, since all three indexes are

defined fairly consistently over their respective periods of overlap. Regression analysis shows

that the annual fluctuations in the Davis index (for the 1885–1915 period) and those in the FRB
                                                                                                                   7




index (for the 1920–1940 period) are each less sensitive to the cyclical swings represented in the

Miron-Romer index.5 The coefficients on the log differences in the Miron-Romer series are

similar for the two indexes, suggesting that the Davis index is a reasonable coincident indicator.

    A third limitation of the present study is that it relies on industrial production rather than a

more comprehensive output measure such as U.S. GDP. This choice was made on grounds of

reliability and consistency. While improved estimates of postbellum U.S. GDP are available

(e.g., Balke and Gordon 1989), similarly reliable estimates for the antebellum period are not. In

the 1960s, Robert Gallman did compile annual gross output estimates for the 1834–1859 period.

Yet while Gallman’s GNP series is more comprehensive than the Davis industrial production

index, it is very likely that the Davis index is more reliable in pinpointing turning points in

industrial output. One reason is that the intercensal observations in Gallman’s commodity output

series (the primary cyclical component of the GNP estimates) were interpolated on a hodge-

podge of spliced annual sources. It is primarily for this reason that Gallman was never

sufficiently confident of the reliability of his annual estimates to publish them, and chastised

researchers who attempted to use them in an analysis of early American business cycles.6

    That said, it is likely that peaks and troughs in the Davis index are indicative of absolute

peaks and troughs in broader economic conditions because the industrial sector has historically

derived demand directly from non-industrial occupations, particularly farmers, merchants, and

the construction trades. This synchronous relationship between non-industrial and industrial

sectors is precisely why even today the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index is

5
  For the FRB index, the beta coefficient on log differences in the Miron–Romer index is 0.82, with a t-statistic of
7.14 and an adjusted R2 of 0.82. For the Davis index, the beta coefficient is 0.73, with a t-statistic of 7.72 and an
adjusted R2 of 0.59. The smaller beta for the Davis index is likely due, in part, to the over-representation of raw
materials among the 13 components in the Miron-Romer index.
6
  See Rhode (2002) and Davis (2002, 2004) for details. Rhode (2002, 12) points out that a 1963 mimeograph from
Robert Gallman containing the annual data circulated with the following disclaimer: “NOTE: These figures should
                                                                                                               8




classified as a coincident indicator of U.S. business cycles even though the industrial sector

presently accounts for roughly the same share of U.S. GDP as it did in 1840.

    A fourth possible limitation of this study is the exclusive use of annual data to isolate cyclical

turning points. While it is true that Burns and Mitchell set the lower bound of a business cycle to

last at least one year, they also noted that setting turning points from annual data may lead to

measurement problems because yearly changes can obfuscate a minor cycle. For example, a

small recession in the middle of a year may just show up in annual data as a year of weak

growth, not as an actual decline. While the present study’s revised chronology does capture the

brief prewar downturns of 1812 and 1861, other peaks and troughs could be distorted if the

turning point occurred toward the middle of a calendar year.



        c. Spurious NBER cycles

    Table 1 reveals important similarities and differences between the NBER reference years and

those peaks and troughs derived from physical-output data. For one, the new industrial

production index does not generate any “false signals” by furnishing a cycle that has not

previously been identified by NBER economists. Rather, the 21 cycles in the revised chronology

unanimously correspond with the incidence of NBER cycles.

    The revised business-cycle dates, however, are notably more selective in isolating genuine

contractions. As long suspected, the nineteenth-century NBER chronology recognizes several

growth cycles as genuine contractions. Specifically, the quantitative evidence dismisses 8 out of

the 29 prewar NBER recessions as either growth cycles or entirely spurious selections.7 The



not be regarded as reliable, annual estimates. They were derived for the purpose of computing decade averages and
are supplied to interested technicians for testing, not for analysis as annual series.”
7
  By convention I differentiate a growth cycle from a spurious one simply by examining whether the trend-adjusted
series is falling. The index was detrended using a band-pass filter.
                                                                                                      9




revised chronology removes four cycles from both the antebellum and postbellum period, an

indication that our identification of spurious cycles is not the result of time-series data that reflect

the continued industrialization of the prewar American economy.

    This paper is not the first to question the validity of several postbellum downturns. The

elimination of the four NBER postbellum recessions (1869–1870, 1887–1888, 1890–1891, and

1899–1900) is consistent with other postbellum output measures that suggest that these NBER

recessions should be reclassified as growth cycles. The identification of the spurious recessions

above will certainly not surprise many economic historians. Burns and Mitchell (1946, 403) rank

the 1887–1888 contraction as the mildest of the prewar period. Fels (1959, 142) goes further in

stating that “the only difference of opinion to be found in the literature is whether it should be

recognized as a cyclical contraction at all.” Similar contentions have been long voiced with

respect to the apparently minor 1869–1870, 1890–1891, and 1899–1900 recessions (Hull 1911;

Fels 1959; Mishkin 1991; Romer 1994; Temin 1998). Indeed, Thorp affixes the word “brief” in

front of each of these three contractions.

    The alternative chronology in Table 1 also identifies four spurious recessions for the

antebellum period: 1825–1826, 1845–1846, 1847–1848, and 1853–1855. According to Davis’

industrial production index, the NBER reference cycles for 1826 and 1855 are, in fact, growth

cycles. While the output from certain commodity-producing industries in the Davis data set is

stagnant in 1854 and 1855, many durable goods manufacturers posted tremendous growth. This

is particularly the case for merchant shipbuilding, where the construction boom in clipper ships

resulted in the highest gross tonnage built at any time during the nineteenth century.

    The former pair of recessions for 1845–1846 and 1847–1848 appear even more dubious than

the growth cycles of 1826 and 1855. Expansion in industrial activity during the purported NBER
                                                                                                10




troughs of 1846 and 1848 was robust and widespread, as indicated by growth rates in the Davis

index of 15.0% and 8.3%, respectively. Such industrial strength confirms what numerous studies

have previously suspected regarding these questionable dates adjoining the Mexican War.

Lightner (1922, 139) notes that the cycles of the late 1840s were “short and not so thorough and

widespread in its effects,” while Ayres (1939, 11) argues that there was “no real depression”

during the period. Zarnowitz (1992, chap. 7, 220–23) examines closely the scant statistics

available for the mid-1840s and 1850s and concludes “it is possible that in terms of production,

all that happened was a phase of below-average growth rather than an actual decline of cyclical

proportions.”



       d. A robustness check: Breadth versus depth

   Although absolute rises and falls in an aggregate output measure constitute a necessary first

step toward locating cyclical turning points, Burns and Mitchell (1946) also emphasized that

future business cycles should consider the breadth of changes in economic activity. The word

“future” is emphasized because Romer (1994) finds that volatile movements in only one or two

component series often drove the fluctuations in many nineteenth-century nominal business

condition measures. In order to examine whether this phenomenon plagues our new prewar

chronology, we can compare the year-to-year changes in the Davis index (i.e., “depth”) with the

net percentage of component series in the Davis index that are rising in a given year (i.e.,

“breadth”). The scatter plot in Figure 1 presents the growth and diffusion measures for each

prewar year beginning in 1800.

   Figure 1 reveals an important regularity: the diffusion index is never negative when the Davis

industrial production index rises. The close correspondence in Figure 1 is reassuring because it is
                                                                                                                11




consistent with the modern-day concept of an NBER recession. Indeed, the diffusion index rises

significantly above zero during an industrial depression in only one instance—the Embargo of

1808. The Jeffersonian embargo had a dichotomous impact on the American manufacturing

sector, stimulating import-competing “infant” industries while hammering trade-dependent

industries (Davis and Irwin 2003).



        e. Accurate peaks and inaccurate troughs: Possible factors

    Closer inspection of the NBER and alternative reference years reveals systematic differences

between the common cycles. The characteristics of the revisions in the officially measured peaks

and troughs can be seen in the summary data of Table 2. The most salient feature of the revised

chronology is that troughs are consistently dated earlier than those inferred from the Business

Annals. Of the 21 common troughs, the revised chronology predates 8 troughs and never

generates a later bottom. Conversely, the revised peaks proposed by the Davis index agree with

20 of the 21 peaks shared by the NBER reference set.

    Since such turning-point asymmetry exists before and after the Civil War, Thorp’s Business

Annals is the likely source of the historical dating biases. But why the bias? Table 2 supports the

contention that the popular and trade press of the prewar period were more prone to accurately

pinpoint the beginning of economic downturns, than they were upturns from subsequent

bottoms.8 In an era devoid of routine government economic reports, significant declines in

production were easier for the casual observer to detect. Conversely, the annals were less


8
  Other researchers examining the contemporaneous commentary of nineteenth-century business cycles have made
similar observations. Zarnowitz (1992, 219) suggests that “after a strong expansion, a mild decline (or even only a
slowdown, if sufficiently long and diffused) may cause as much discomfort and alarm as a larger decline coming
from a weaker expansion. Hence it is possible that observers would tend to overstate the dimension of some
movements in the former category, perhaps even mistaking at times a major retardation for a business contraction.”
Indeed, Mitchell (1927, 421-22) suggests that press reports tended to devote “less attention to the upward than the
downward turning points of business cycles.”
                                                                                                               12




successful in isolating troughs in industrial activity primarily because contemporary newspapers

tended to portray business conditions as “still weak” following a downturn. The prevailing

evidence suggests that Thorp tended to interpret such cryptic narratives as a “revival” from an

economic bottom in his top-line conditions, even though they often seem (in retrospect) to have

referred to a return-to-peak “revival” in business conditions. This may help explain why

recessions appear more drawn out in the early chronology.

    Another contributing factor to the systematic peak-trough revisions could stem from

Mitchell’s strict interpretation of Thorp’s annual inflection points. It is not entirely clear, for

instance, whether Thorp’s notion of “revival” was to be interpreted as a bottom in economic

activity, or in a phase rebounding from a bottom. Since the two interpretations may not always

agree in an annual setting, Mitchell may have introduced biases in the mapping that may have

tended to elongate prewar annual recessions.

    Another potential bias is the strong influence that fluctuations in wholesale and commodity

prices apparently had on the affirmation of turning points in the Business Annals. Thorp

consulted a limited number of economic statistics available during the 1790-1925 period to

confirm his descriptive assessments. Thorp makes repeated reference to movements in wholesale

commodity prices in his analysis, and in fact thanks Walter Smith, co-author of the seminal 1935

volume Fluctuations in American Business, 1790–1860, for providing him the price data.9

    But were rises and declines in an aggregate wholesale price indexes for the nineteenth

century, such as Warren and Pearson’s, a reliable gauge of the state of the nation’s business

conditions? Over the 1790–1915 period, annual fluctuations in wholesale prices and industrial

production are positively correlated, although the correlation coefficient is only approximately


9
 See p. 105 of Thorp’s prefatory note, which, incidentally, is mistyped. Thorp thanks Smith for providing him with
monthly wholesale price data for the period 1805–1824; the correct period is 1805–1924.

0.4. One explanation for why the correlation was not higher may be the stark differences in the

prewar trends of the price and output indexes. For instance, one can show that the Warren-

Pearson wholesale price index is stationary over the nineteenth century.10 In fact, the average

U.S. price level in 1800 was slightly above that observed in 1900. Since Thorp closely tracked

the local commentary on commodity prices, persistent price deflation during long stretches of the

1800s likely exacerbated the Annals’ tendency to elongate recessions. Figure 2 demonstrates that

years characterized by vigorous industrial output growth (declines) were generally accompanied

by inflation (deflation). Yet the fact that a nonparametric fit of Figure 2’s scatter plot crosses

below the origin underscores an inherent bias in the prewar NBER chronology: periods of

modest albeit positive real output growth (i.e, growth cycles) tended to be accompanied by price

deflation.

       One could even argue that the biases that generated drawn-out prewar recessions in the

NBER chronology were largely reinforcing. Since price quotations for various basic

commodities (i.e., cotton, flour, iron) were widely circulated in nineteenth-century newspapers

but traded quantities were not, it is probable that press reports were heavily influenced by price

movements, particularly for farm products. The fact that Thorp consulted the same wholesale-

price data in identifying prewar cycles—coupled with the fact that Mitchell often consulted

indexes of business conditions heavily skewed with price components to “check” Thorp’s

assessments—suggests that prices played a key secondary role in setting nineteenth-century peak

and trough years.

II.      Implications of the revised pre-WWI chronology



         a. General implications

      The new chronology contributes to our understanding of the characteristics of early

American business cycles. Broadly, the prewar chronology alters (by either dropping or re-

dating) roughly 40% (25 of 58) of the prewar NBER peaks and troughs. The new set of industrial

cycles may also change the conventional view on specific nineteenth-century business cycles.

The largest changes in the duration of cycles shared by the new and NBER chronologies involve

periods when wholesale prices dropped dramatically and persistently, such as following the War

of 1812 and the financial panics of 1837 and 1873. The quantity-based production data display

shorter contractions and shallower losses following those crises than that portrayed in the

popular and trade press. One plausible explanation for the disparity may be that the media

confused commercial crises with financial ones, because the latter were better characterized by

falling commodity and security prices, rather than declines in real industrial activity (Temin

1969; Kindleberger 2000).



         b. Antebellum-postbellum comparisons

      This paper’s chronology alters the summary statistics of prewar industrial expansions and

contractions. To further examine whether their characteristics changed significantly before and

after the Civil War, Table 3 presents the average frequency and duration of American business

cycles. Specifically, we can employ nonparametric tests to explore whether the mean phase and

whole-cycle duration changed between the Civil War under both the old and new chronologies.11


11
  Following Diebold and Rudebusch (1992), the hypothesis of whether the mean duration of expansions, recessions,
or entire peak-to-peak cycles are equal between two samples can be formally tested using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
                                                                                                 15




The critical result of Table 3 is that, under either peak-trough chronology, there is no appreciable

change in the frequency or duration of prewar American cycles when one treats the Civil War as

the sample break. Thus, the Wilcoxon tests confirm the conventional view that the frequency and

duration of antebellum and postbellum business cycles were analogous. Since the spurious

prewar NBER cycles removed here are equally distributed between the antebellum and

postbellum eras, sample differences in prewar business cycles remain statistically unimportant.

This result is consistent with the consonant business-cycle volatility in the two period, as

reported in Davis (2004).

   Another salient feature of Table 3 is that the new annual peaks and troughs reduce the

average frequency of prewar recessions from nearly every other year in the NBER set, to a more

plausible one out of five years.12 By removing dating inconsistencies from the conventional

scale, the new peaks and troughs systematically double the mean duration of prewar expansions,

while they truncate the average length of contractions by one-third.



       c. Prewar versus postwar cycles: Tentative comparisons

   As it stands today, the NBER chronology suggests that the U.S. business cycle has

significantly “stabilized” or “moderated” following WWII. This is clearly evident in the first row

(entitled “NBER”) of the prewar-postwar comparisons in Table 4.

   Yet, as is obvious from Figure 3, the extensive modifications to the annual prewar

chronology could significantly alter historical comparisons made between prewar and postwar

cycles. How does one (if at all) compare the new prewar cycles to a postwar NBER chronology

that is undoubtedly based on more comprehensive information?
                                                                                                                  16




     Perhaps the most valid comparison would be to build an annual postwar chronology in a

manner similar to how the alternative prewar chronology was established. Consequently, I have

constructed an alternative annual postwar chronology simply by mapping to absolute peaks and

troughs in the annual values of the FRB monthly industrial production index.13 Table 4

recalculates the average frequency and mean expansion, contraction, and peak-to-peak whole-

cycle durations for both the prewar period (1796–1914) and the postwar period (1946–2000)

using the Davis and FRB indexes, respectively. Note that, unlike for the case of the NBER

prewar-postwar chronologies, Table 4 does not explicitly test the null hypothesis that prewar-

postwar differences are zero. As we have discussed, this is because we cannot speak to the long-

run comparability between the Davis and FRB indexes (Davis 2004, 1191–1192).

     That said, it is surely appropriate to qualitatively compare the summary statistics of the

prewar and postwar cycles under the alternative (IP-based) chronology. The prewar-postwar

comparisons based solely on annual industrial production data are quite striking: the proportion

of time that the U.S. industrial sector has spent in recession has remained fairly constant over

the past two centuries. The characteristics of industrial contractions, expansions, and peak-to-

peak cycles appear largely unchanged among the pre-Civil War, Civil War to WWI, and post-

WWII periods, a result that differs somewhat from those previously documented in Diebold and

Rudebusch (1992) and Romer (1994).




12
   More accurately, the revised chronology demonstrates that the U.S. industrial sector was in recession in 26 out of
the 118 years (22% of the time) over the 1796–1914 period. Under the NBER chronology, the U.S. economy spent
54 of the 118 years in recession, or 46% of the time.
13
   It is worth noting that our alternative postwar chronology possesses a slightly lower frequency of recession and
slightly longer expansions than had we followed an approach of “annualizing” the monthly turning points. This is
because the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index expanded marginally in 1961, whereas the NBER
determined that the recession officially ended in February of that year. As a result, our alternative postwar
chronology should be more inclined to find “stabilization” in the U.S. business cycle when compared to its prewar
counterpart than had we used the actual NBER monthly turning points for the postwar period
                                                                                              17




III.      Conclusion



       The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the NBER’s annual business cycle turning points

for the entire pre-WWI period, which were determined almost entirely on the basis of Willard

Thorp’s Business Annals (1926). Thorp relied mainly on qualitative descriptions of economic

conditions from the business press; quantitative information from the business press and from the

behavior of wholesale prices also played some role. These dates have the remarkable implication

that the U.S. economy spent close to one-half of the 1796-1914 period in recession. Of course,

researchers have long questioned the validity of the early set of American business-cycle dates.

Watson (1994), Romer (1994), and others have suggested that the NBER’s chronology for the

late 19th century and early 20th century appears to be a growth-cycle chronology.

       This study broadens the scope of previous research by constructing an alternative set of

turning points between 1796 and 1914 using Davis’ (2004) annual index of U.S. industrial

production for the 1790-1915 period. In doing so, this study contributes to our understanding of

the characteristics of early American business cycles. Overall, the alternative prewar chronology

alters (by either dropping or re-dating) roughly 40% of the annual prewar NBER peaks and

troughs. As long suspected, the nineteenth-century NBER chronology recognizes several growth

cycles as genuine contractions. Since the revised chronology removes spurious recessions that

interrupted genuinely long booms (e.g., the 1820s, 1840s, and 1880s), the average phase duration

of prewar expansions doubles and the length of full cycles rises one-half. The revised prewar

peaks correspond closely with existing NBER peaks, but the new troughs are dated
                                                                                            18




systematically earlier. I hypothesize on potential explanations for such systematic bias in the

dating errors.

   The new chronology also suggests avenues for future research. For instance, while Figure 3

suggests that much of the 1800s looks similar to the post–1945 period, the period 1890 through

1940 looks noticeably more volatile. The era 1890–1930, which several authors have used as the

prewar era, continues to have more frequent cycles than the postwar era even when the new dates

are used. What factors caused the increased volatility during this period?

   Taking a longer view, the paper’s extensive revisions to the prewar chronology tempers the

widespread conventional view that, as early as WWII, U.S. recessions have occurred less

frequently and U.S. expansions last longer. While the paper’s comparison between pre-WWI and

post-WWII cycles is limited by its reliance on a single annual index (as opposed to many

monthly series) of industrial production (as opposed to a more comprehensive GDP measure), it

does suggest that the most ardent proponents of U.S. macroeconomic stabilization should

embrace a broader historical perspective before claiming decisive victory over the business

cycle.

Notes and sources: All reference dates are calendar-year cycles. Bolded text reflects deviation from current NBER
record. No recession* indicates a “growth recession,” or a slowdown in the rate of economic growth based upon
detrended values of the industrial production index. Victor Zarnowitz summarized the annual NBER peak-trough
chronology from 1790 in Glasner ed. (1997, 731–33, tables 1–2). For the pre-WWI era, the annual chronology
ultimately corresponds to Thorp’s verbal assessment (1926, 113–45) later summarized in Burns and Mitchell (1946,
78, table 16) and Moore and Zarnowitz (1986, 746, table A.2). The only change I made to the NBER chronology is
that I have assigned 1811 (rather than 1812) as the peak year for the 1812 recession.

Notes: Mean durations and Wilcoxon statistics are given in years. The two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test
   statistic is the sum of the ranks for the observations in the first (i.e., antebellum) sample. If the data are tied,
   average ranks are used. One-sided p- values relate to the null hypothesis of no mean-duration stabilization.
   Results are similar for trough-to-trough cycles.
