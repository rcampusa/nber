                                             ABSTRACT

Case studies suggest that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be effective tools for fishery management.
This study uses global datasets of MPAs and stock assessments to estimate the strength and robustness
of their benefits. We apply multiple models, including a treatment-control pairing, a logistic model
estimated with fixed-effects, and a regression tree to identify key characteristics. We find that regions
with significant MPA designations increased their yearly yield by 17e3 MT/yr while those without
experienced a loss of 20e3 MT/yr. On average, a 1% increase in protected area results in an increase
in the growth rate of fish populations by about 1%. Considering only IUCN classified protected areas,
and only marine portions of MPAs, growth rates increase 2% per percent area protected. MPA size
is a key parameter which determines their per-area effectiveness. Using these results, we produce an
estimate of the economic benefits of protected areas, relative to their costs. About 60% of country
regions currently have insufficient protected areas to generate economic benefits, where the average
break-even point for economic benefits of MPAs is at 8.5% of marine area.

       Abstract. Case studies suggest that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be effective tools
       for fishery management. This study uses global datasets of MPAs and stock assessments to
       estimate the strength and robustness of their benefits. We apply multiple models, including
       a treatment-control pairing, a logistic model estimated with fixed-effects, and a regression
       tree to identify key characteristics. We find that regions with significant MPA designations
       increased their yearly yield by 17e3 MT/yr while those without experienced a loss of 20e3
       MT/yr. On average, a 1% increase in protected area results in an increase in the growth
       rate of fish populations by about 1%. Considering only IUCN classified protected areas,
       and only marine portions of MPAs, growth rates increase 2% per percent area protected.
       MPA size is a key parameter which determines their per-area effectiveness. Using these
       results, we produce an estimate of the economic benefits of protected areas, relative to their
       costs. About 60% of country regions currently have insufficient protected areas to generate
       economic benefits, where the average break-even point for economic benefits of MPAs is at
       8.5% of marine area.



Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be very powerful tools for conservation. Within many
MPA boundaries, fish biomass, density, average size, and species richness increase drastically
(Lester et al., 2009). MPAs also have the potential to benefit adjacent fisheries. These effects
have been studied as “benefits over boundaries”, in which increased fish biomass diffuses
into exploited areas (Gell and Roberts, 2003), and as “savings accounts”, able to buffer
fluctuations and support resilience (Grafton et al., 2010).


Theoretical models (Polacheck, 1990, Holland and Brazee, 1996, Tuck and Possingham, 2000)
and computational models (Walters et al., 1999) have explored the potential for MPAs to
benefit exploited fisheries, but previous empirical studies have focused only on specific regions
and species (e.g., Sluka et al., 1997, Murawski et al., 2000, Roberts et al., 2001, McClanahan,
                                                     1

2010). This study is the first global analysis of the benefits of MPAs for harvested fish stocks.
We exploit temporal and spatial variation in protected areas as predictors of stock surplus, as
new areas are designated as MPAs within the management boundaries of exploited stocks.
The designation of new MPAs amounts to a natural experiment whose consequences we
study.

The first section describes our dataset, which combines global databases of MPAs, stock
assessments, catch time-series, and sea surface temperatures. In the second section, we
perform a set of treatment-and-control analyses, by comparing stock assessments in regions
that had a concentrated growth of protected areas to those which did not. The third section
constructs an extensive model with stock-specific parameters, based on the logistic growth
equation. We treat MPAs as mechanisms for enhancing the growth rate parameter of a stock,
and explore a number of model formulations. The fourth section displays a regression tree of
the stock-specific MPA effects, as a way of identifying which stock and region characteristics
drive positive results. The fifth section considers the expected economic benefits of MPAs,
and identifies which countries are currently benefiting from their protected area coverage
and which could benefit under more coverage.


                                               Data


The MPA Global database (Wood, 2007) includes 4383 MPAs, along with their designation
date, location, IUCN category, and area (often specifying the marine portion and no-take
portion).1 Figures 1 and 2 summarize this data.

We use stock assessments from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database (Ricard et al.,
2011). The RAM database contains 336 assessments, with an average of 5 time-series of 46
years per assessment. The assessments vary considerably in the variables they include, but
of these, 285 assessments contain yearly values which can be interpreted in terms of metric
tons (MT) for both the stock and species catch, for an average of 36 years.

 MPA regions can include segments of land, such as islands and shoreline. The marine area of an MPA is
excludes this area.

       Figure 1. Left: Summary statistics for the MPA Global database. The
       “Marine” column corresponds to the green and blue dots in the map; the
       “No Take” column corresponds to only the blue dots. The “% of Ocean” row
       shows the portion of the full ocean area included in the MPAs. However, the
       denominator for calculating this value in the “All” column is inaccurate, since
       the total protected area sometimes includes non-marine area. Right: Map of
       MPAs in the MPA Global database. Red dots denote MPAs with only total
       protected area information available; green dots denote MPAs with non-zero
       “marine” areas; and blue dots denote MPAs with non-zero “no take” areas.
       Blue circles around blue dots show the relative sizes of the no take MPAs (but
       are not to-scale with the geography).


We approximated bounding regions for these assessments, using FAO and country manage-
ment region shapefiles (see 1). Of the assessment regions in the RAM database, 274 had
additional MPAs designated within them during the years when stocks were assessed. Figure
3 shows the spatial distribution of these assessments.

In addition, catches, landed values, and shelf areas by country and distinct sub-country
regions were collected from the Sea Around Us Project (Sea Around Us, 2007).

Temperature provides a further key parameter. Changes in sea surface temperatures can
have effects throughout the food web, although the effects can vary by species and region.
Along the west coast of South America, warm temperatures can signal a shutting-off of
nutrient-rich cold water upwelling due to El Nino conditions. In some other stocks, warmer
temperatures increase growth rates (Hartnoll, 2001). Long-term temperature changes are
also shifting stock ranges producing more complicated impacts (Cheung et al., 2013).

We calculate the average SST anomaly for each region and year, using the Extended Recon-
structed SST dataset from NOAA (Smith et al., 2008).

             MPAs and total MPA area by region. Regions designations are from the
             Sea Around Us project, which divides some countries into smaller regions
             (for example, Japan is divided into two coasts). Countries have taken very
             different approaches to designating protected areas, and the regions with the
             greatest number of MPAs do not always have the greatest area protected. For
             example, while Sweden has the second most MPAs, it is ranked 27th by total
             area protected.

                          Treatment and Control Analysis


We first divide assessments into “treated” and “control” assessments. Treated regions are
those which had a period of very little change in their MPA portion, followed by a short
period in which large areas were protected, followed by another stable period. Control regions
are those for which, over the entire timeseries, the MPA region never increased beyond a
threshold. Formally, a regions is categorized as a treated region if

                                 M P A(t1 ) − M P A(t0 )

                                                         <x
                                     RegionSize




and a control region if
                                 M P A(t3 ) − M P A(t0 )
                                                         < 2x
                                     RegionSize


We use x = .15% and y = 1.5%, which produces 84 treated regions and 93 control regions.
Normalized time-series of these two collections show a strong effect (see figure 4), which we
analyze more concretely below.

A difference-in-difference regression suggests a similar result. The model is as follows:

                                         Logistic Results


The logistic growth model is used to estimate the growth of fish over time, given stock and
harvest levels. While logistic growth models are unnaturally simplistic, they are appropriate
in situations when age class and ecosystem information is missing. The Gompertz model
is also appropriate in these context, and the following analysis is done for it in supplement
4.


For each stock i, we define the surplus or recruitment (which we treat as equivalent) as the
change in stock level from one year to the next, plus the catch in that year. Under logistic
growth, this is expressed as:


                                                    !               "
                                                           Si,t−1                     r 2
                  Sit − Si,t−1 + Ci,t−1 = rSi,t−1       1−              = rSi,t−1 −    S
                                                            K                         K i,t−1
Sit − Si,t−1 + Ci,t−1 (the change in stock, plus the catch) is the recruitment for stock i in year
t. Catch includes discards where the data is available.


We hypothesize that the effect of MPAs is a function of the portion of the total assessed region
that is protected. We find that the most robust model (reported below) is one in which the
protected portion produces additional surplus through changes to the logistic growth rate, r,
                  r
while the ratio   K
                      remains constant. An increase in r provides an immediate benefit to fishers
by providing a greater yearly surplus production. In addition, under these assumptions, if
the new growth rate is expressed as a factor increase over the old value, r1 = ar0 , then the
new maximum sustainable yield increases by an even greater amount:

                                          r 1 K1   ar0 aK0
                               M SY1 =           =         = a2 M SY0
                                             4        4


By combining the stock assessment time series with the area protection history, the marginal
benefit of protecting an additional portion of stock’s range can be estimated directly. We use
a linear model, estimated by least squares regression with robust standard errors clustered

at the assessment level:
                              !                                             "

  Sit − Si,t−1 + Ci,t−1 =         αi + β         + γ1,i Ti,t−1 + γ2,i Ti,t−2 Si,t−1 + κi Si,t−1 + δi + ǫit

                                                                                        2
The logistic function is represented here through coefficients estimated on Si,t−1 and Si,t−1 ,
and estimated independently for each stock. The marginal change in growth rate, β, is
parameter of interest, and M P Ai,t−1 is the area protected within the stock assessment region,
Areai . The two previous years’ average temperature anomalies are included (Ti,t−1 and Ti,t−2 )
as controls on the growth rate.2 δi is a stock fixed effect. ǫit is a normally distributed error
term. In addition, we include time as regressors in some formulations.

The results are shown in table 2, for total protected areas, and for marine-only portions of
protected areas, where the data is available.

MPAs often include non-marine regions, such as islands and shoreline, and the marine-
only regressions only include the portion of each MPA that is specified as marine. Results
for marine-only MPAs tend to be less significant but numerically greater. This is expected,
since these regressions represent include only the half of the globally designated MPAs which
specify the marine portion of their area (see figure 1). The observations are at the assessment-
year level, so the number of observations does not change between the total and marine-only
MPA data, even though less MPA area and fewer MPAs are counted in the marine-only
results. These results suggest that marine protection is more beneficial to fish stocks than
protection of their adjoining land.

To put these values in perspective, the distribution of growth rates is shown in figure 5.
For the histogram, we estimate growth rates after accounting for the global MPA effect,
constraining them to be positive. The median growth rate is 0.34. According to the fourth
column (time FE) above model, increasing the protected area range by 10% would increase
this median growth rate by 35% and the MSY by 83%. The distribution of these percentage

increase in growth rate per percent increase in protected area is also shown in the lower-right
graph of figure 5.

The spatial distribution of positive and negative estimated benefits from MPAs is displayed
in figure 6.

These estimates rely on variation in the MPA area over time. Forms of fishery management
that operate through catch restrictions (e.g., ITQs, season restrictions, horsepower limits)
are captured by changes in the observed catch. Gear restrictions which can allow catch to be
more selective, however, are not accounted for and could explain some of the benefits here
attributed to MPAs if these restrictions were implemented simultaneously. A great number
of additional factors are missing from this model: environmental forcings, species interaction,

                             model shows much more consistent benefits from MPAs, it does not account
                             for inherent stock-level growth dynamics like the linear model.

and other anthropogenic effects. However, these are unlikely to correlate either strongly or
positively with MPA designation.

This analysis does not distinguish between the benefits that accrue only to the exploited
region, separately from the protected region. However, most assessed regions have a small
fraction of their area protected (the median protected portion is 1.4%; see figure 5), so that
if the assessment regions describe the natural range of a stock, the surplus would quickly
become available to all fishers.




IUCN Results. IUCN categorization can be used as a indicator of management regime.
Of the 4259 MPAs in our data set, 3545 have IUCN classification, as shown in table 3.

Accounting for the total area designed accross all IUCN classified MPAs, the coefficient β is
1.2017 ± 0.3593***, under the time FE model. Accounting only for the marine area, where
available, the coefficient is 1.3207 ± 1.4715. The significance decreases considerably due to
the half of the MPA observations which are dropped due to missing marine-portion data. A
10% increase in protected area increases the median growth rate by 35%. The results are
comparable to the total sample results.

The estimates of effects by IUCN category vary greatly, but estimates for classifications with
more data tend to approach the general model. The results suggest that Habitat/Species
Management Area are amongst the most effective IUCN classifications. The significance
of this result may simply reflect the larger set of available data, representing almost twice
the MPAs of any other IUCN catagory. However, it may also derive from the concerted
management practices behind IUCN category IV regions. Protected Landscape/Seascape
MPAs, which seek to secure the long-term capacity for human interaction, do worst. The
low performance of String Nature Reserves is at odds with regression results that include all
no-take reserve areas, which are positive, but both are highly insignificant due to the lack of
data. In general, the variance

                                              Regression Tree


To determine what factors most influence the effectiveness of MPAs, we estimate the MPA
effect for each assessment individually, and build a regression tree with a wide variety of
factors, shown in table 4. These include both region and fish characteristics.

Regression trees identify the natural divisions that associate coefficient estimates and input
parameters (Breiman et al., 1984). Each decision branch of the tree is a division in the data
or a subset of the data, and is characterized by an average coefficient estimate and a number
of observations. Note that the highest-level node, representing the average coefficient across
all data when estimated independently, is negative.

       Figure 7. A regression tree to explain stock-specific estimates of the benefits
       of MPAs, according to the logistic model.



The first branch of the regression tree is determined by the potential size of the stock, which
also relates to its range. Large stocks (left branch) typically are not benefited by protected
areas unless the protected areas are large and the stock is very productive. For smaller
stocks, all branches show positive effects from MPAs, with the largest effects from large
MPAs within even larger assessment regions. High latitude stocks also show large benefits
from MPAs, probably due to successful management in Alaska and northern Europe.
                      GLOBAL BENEFITS OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS                               14

A few missing parameters are notable. In particular, the country is not a top-level predictor.
Age only shows up on the lower left branch (age for estimating biomass), suggesting that both
long- and short-lived species benefit. Finally, habitat type is not a top-level predictor.



                                      Economic Analysis


To translate these effects into economic benefits, we use the Sea Around Us landed catch
values. The additional value attributable to protecting a given area of ocean is,

                                                 MP A #
                                V (M P A) = β           pk S̄k
                                                 Area i

where S̄k is the steady-state stock for species k, and pk is that species the landing price per
MT. The steady-state stock is difficult to estimate, so we take the catch as a lower bound
on the stock and produce a conservative estimate of the benefits.

Balmford et al. (2004) estimated global marginal costs of maintaining MPAs as

                                     cost
                             log10        = 5.02 − .8 log10 (M P A)
                                     MP A


We combine these to produce a profit function, and find its root, which is the point at
which estimated economic benefits exceed estimated costs. Of 234 countries or large marine
regions, 71 have enough area protected to have a net economic benefit, 141 currently have a
net loss, and 22 generate too little rent for any amount of protected area to generate surplus
sufficient for an economic gain. The mean portion to protect to generate an economic surplus
is 8.5%, while the current protected region, averaged by country as a portion of EEZs, is
2%. A table of these countries and their key parameters is listed in appendix 5.



                                          Conclusions


There are a number of caveats to the results presented here. It is likely that less than a third
of MPAs are effectively managed and protected (Kelleher, 1996, Pauly et al., 2002). This

suggests that our results are conservative and that well-protected MPAs may have greater
benefits. However, the RAM database is also biased toward developed countries, due to the
dearth of scientific assessments in developing countries. The true global average benefit,
and potential average benefit for MPAs may be outside of the confidence intervals of our
estimate.

This analysis provides a new entry point for exploring a wide variety of topics, including
the institutional features that support effective MPAs (Charles and Wilson, 2009) and the
role of fish mobility (Hilborn et al., 2004) and growth rates (Roberts et al., 2001) on MPA
effectiveness.

The utility of closed areas for fishers results from the mobility and dispersal of fish: while
fish stocks can benefit from MPAs directly by gaining higher levels of biomass and yearly
recruitment, fishers only benefit when a portion of this greater stock reaches exploited ar-
eas.

Our results corroborate evidence from Guidetti and Claudet (2010) that CPUE within MPAs
can be twice that of surrounding areas. This suggests that MPAs can be amongst the most
effective forms of fishery management, and future work needs to explore the conditions that
affect the distribution of benefits.
