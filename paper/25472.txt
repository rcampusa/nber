An Extra Year to Learn English? Early Grade Retention and the Human Capital Development

                                          ABSTRACT

In this study, we use microdata from 12 Florida county-level school districts and a regression
discontinuity design to examine the effects of early grade retention on the short-, medium-, and
long-term outcomes of English learners. We find that retention in the third-grade substantially
improves the English skills of these students, reducing the time to proficiency by half and
decreasing the likelihood of taking a remedial English course in middle school by one-third.
Grade retention also roughly doubles the likelihood of taking an advanced course in math and
science in middle school, and more than triples the likelihood of taking college credit-bearing
courses in high school for English learners. We also find that these benefits are larger for foreign
born students, students with higher latent human capital in third grade as proxied by their math
scores, students whose first language is Spanish, and students in lower-poverty elementary
schools.

      An Extra Year to Learn English? Early Grade Retention and the Human Capital

                                     Development of English Learners

1. Introduction

         The United States is in the midst of the second largest wave of immigration in its history,

and immigrant integration remains to be a major point of contention in political debates. A

number of studies have examined the extent to which the educational and economic outcomes of

these recent immigrants converge to those of natives across generations.1 An overarching

conclusion of this extant literature is that attaining English proficiency early in life, especially

before middle school when students are exposed to more challenging course content, is a major

predictor of future success for immigrants. As such, reducing the time to English proficiency for

English learners 2—students who come from homes where a language other than English is

mainly spoken and who need additional instructional support to access the mainstream

curriculum—is a top education policy priority.

         This study addresses whether a commonly implemented strategy—early grade retention

for English learners who have not mastered basic English literacy skills by third grade—is an

effective policy lever to improve the English skills of English learners, reduce the time to

proficiency, and improve their human capital accumulation in middle and high school. While

grade retention has non-trivial costs—an additional year of school costs, one fewer year of

potential earnings, and possibly increased probabilities of high school dropout—a grade retention

2
  A number of studies have shown that it takes many English learners 4 to 10 years or more to attain proficiency, and
this path is even longer for Spanish-speaking English learners and English learners from disadvantaged backgrounds
(Conger, 2010; Grissom, 2004; Hakuta, Butler, & Witt, 2000; Parrish et al., 2006; Salazar, 2007; Slama, 2014;
Thompson, 2012).

                                                         3
strategy might be worth it if it leads to accelerated English language proficiency and heightened

human capital accumulation.

       Specifically, we investigate the causal effects of Florida’s early grade retention policy,

which requires students who fail to score above the lowest achievement level on the third-grade

reading test to be retained, on the English skills of English learners as measured by their reading

test scores, their time to proficiency (as indicated by reclassification out of English learner

status) and human capital accumulation as proxied by advanced course-taking in middle and high

school using regression discontinuity (RD) design. Given the recent evidence showing the

significant benefits of advanced courses in high school on postsecondary access and completion

(Smith et al., 2017), taking advanced courses in middle and high school could be regarded as an

early indicator of postsecondary success, and subsequent labor market gains.

       Reducing the time to English proficiency is important for at least two reasons. First, the

long-term adverse effects of English deficiencies while in school are expected to be more

pronounced in later grades as English learners attempt to develop academic English and learn

more challenging course content simultaneously. For instance, Figlio and Ozek (forthcoming)

show that first-generation immigrants who enter the public school system in Florida in later

grades are significantly less likely to graduate from high school, and even when they graduate,

are less likely to be college-ready than observationally similar first-generation immigrants who

enter in earlier grades, and these gaps are mostly explained by differences in English proficiency

in later grades. Similarly, Huang et al. (2016) find that long-term English learners (students who

are classified as an English learner in elementary school and fail to attain proficiency by middle

school) in Arizona are almost half as likely to graduate from high school in four years compared




                                                  4
to students who have never been classified as an English learner, even after controlling for

demographic and socioeconomic differences.

         Second, educating English learners is costly. In the four states with the largest English

learner populations (California, Texas, Florida, and New York), per-pupil spending for English

learners is 10 (in Texas) to 50 percent (in New York) higher than the average native English

speaker (Millard, 2015).3 And these costs are expected to grow rapidly, given that English

learners currently account for 10 percent of all public school students in the United States (and

more than 20 percent in high-immigration districts such as Los Angeles Unified and Miami-

Dade), and represent the fastest growing student population over the past two decades.4

Therefore, reducing the time to proficiency even by one year translates into significant cost

savings for many states and school districts.

         Early grade retention policies have become increasingly popular in the United States over

the last two decades as a general tool for student accountability (and not specifically targeted at

English learners), with 16 states and the District of Columbia currently requiring the retention of

third-grade students who do not meet grade-level expectations in reading. The promise of early

grade retention policies for English learners is that they provide additional time for these students

to acquire the necessary English skills before they are exposed to more challenging course

content. Furthermore, as we describe below, Florida’s third-grade retention policy might be

particularly beneficial for English learners to attain proficiency earlier as it provides substantial




3
  In the 34 states that use the state’s funding formula to fund English learner education, the average pupil spending
for ELLs is 30 percent higher than non-English natives.
4
  In 2014, English learners constituted roughly 10 percent of all public school students in the United States. While it
is difficult to find historical numbers for English learners in the U.S. due to differences in ELL definitions across
agencies, Ballantyne et al. (2008) has shown that the English learner population nationwide has grown by almost 57
percent between 1995 and 2005, whereas non-English learners grew by 3.7 percent during the same time frame.

                                                           5
instructional support in reading for retained students, including at least 90 minutes of reading

instruction each day using effective instruction strategies and high-performing teachers.

       There exists extensive literature examining the effects of grade retention on student

outcomes, yet very little is known about their effects on English learners. Recent studies using

quasi-experimental designs to identify the causal effect of retention find significant academic

benefits of grade retention, especially in early grades in the short term (Roderick & Nagaoka,

2005; Jacob & Lefgren, 2004; Jacob & Lefgren, 2009; Greene & Winters, 2007; Greene &

Winters, 2012; Schwerdt et al., 2017). For instance, in an RD framework, Jacob and Lefgren

(2004, 2009) find that retention and mandatory summer school had a small positive effect on

achievement in the short term for third graders but not for sixth graders in Chicago.

       There are several studies to date that examine the effects of the third-grade retention

policy in Florida, on which we focus in this study. For instance, Schwerdt et al. (2017) find that

although retained students outperform their same-age peers in the short term, these achievement

gains fade out entirely after 6 years. However, retained students under Florida’s retention policy

significantly outperform their promoted peers when they reach the same grade level (Greene &

Winters, 2007; Greene & Winters, 2012; and Schwerdt et al., 2017). Retained students are also

less likely to be retained in a later grade and no more or less likely to graduate from high school

(Schwerdt et al., 2017). That said, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study to date that

examines the causal effects of test-based early grade retention on English learners.

       We find significant benefits of early grade retention on English learners. In particular, we

find significant effects of retention on the reading scores of English learners that persist through

middle school, reducing the time to proficiency by about a year, decreasing the likelihood of

taking a remedial English course in middle school by one-third, almost doubling the likelihood



                                                  6
of taking an advanced course in math and science in middle school, and more than tripling the

likelihood of taking college credit-bearing courses in high school. These benefits are larger for

foreign born English learners, English learners with higher latent human capital in third grade as

proxied by their math scores, English learners attending lower-poverty elementary schools, and

Spanish-speaking English learners.



2. Third-Grade Retention Policy in Florida

       Since 2002, all third-grade students in Florida are required to meet the Level 2

benchmark or higher (the second lowest of five achievement levels) on the statewide reading test

in order to be promoted to fourth grade. The main objective of this policy, which was part of the

broader “Just Read, Florida!” initiative, is to ensure that all students meet the reading

benchmarks described in Florida’s Sunshine State Standards before they reach the fourth grade,

when students traditionally begin to “read to learn” rather than “learn to read.” The legislation

requires that schools provide development strategies for retained students. These include proven-

effective teaching strategies, assigning retained students to high-performing teachers,

participation in summer reading camps, and at least 90 minutes of reading instruction each day.

If the retained student can demonstrate the required reading level before the beginning of the

following school year or during the school year, he/she might be eligible for mid-year grade

promotion.

       There are a number of “good cause exemptions” that allow students to be promoted to the

fourth grade despite failing to score at the Level 2 benchmark or above. The most relevant

exemption for the purposes of this study is the English learner exemption, which allows students

to be promoted to fourth grade if they have been in the English learner program for less than two



                                                  7
years. As such, the third-grade retention policy impacts only “long term” English learners who

have not been able to attain proficiency in at least 3 years. Students are also eligible for a good-

cause exemption if they have certain disabilities, or have received intensive reading remediation

for two years and have already been retained twice between kindergarten and third grade.

Additionally, students are able to obtain an exemption by demonstrating that they are reading at a

level equal to or above a Level 2 on the FCAT by performing at an acceptable level on an

alternative standardized reading assessment approved by the State Board of Education, or by

demonstrating proficiency through a teacher-developed portfolio.

3. Data

       In our analysis, we make use of detailed longitudinal, student-level administrative data

that cover school years between 2000–01 and 2011–12 from 12 anonymous, county-level school

districts in Florida. In particular, the student-level administrative data contain FCAT reading and

math scores for all students between grades three and ten in these districts during that time frame

along with a wealth of student characteristics including student demographics (e.g.,

race/ethnicity, gender), whether the student is eligible for subsidized meals, measures of English

proficiency (limited English proficiency status indicator and language spoken at home), country

of birth, and special education status. We are also able to link these student-level administrative

data with course enrollment data that provide detailed information about courses taken and

course type (e.g., subject; remedial, regular, or advanced) in middle and high school.

       In our analysis, we focus on four cohorts of English learner students who enter third

grade for the first time between 2002–03 (the first year of the grade retention policy) and 2005–

06 school years, and follow them until the 2011–12 school year when the retained students in our

youngest cohort reach the eighth grade. Roughly 65 percent of these students had been in the



                                                  8
English learner program for at least 2 years when they first entered the third grade and hence

were not eligible for the good-cause exemption. Table 1 compares the students in our sample

with their non-English native peers in the same cohorts. English learner students have

significantly lower reading and math scores in the third grade, are almost three times more likely

to score below the retention cutoff, and twice as likely to be retained at the end of the third grade

compared to non-English native students. Furthermore, English learner students are significantly

more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds: 80 percent of them are classified as

eligible for subsidized meals (compared to 52 percent among non-English native students), are

more than three times more likely to be Hispanic, and are roughly seven times more likely to be

foreign born.

       The main challenge with obtaining rigorous evidence on the causal effects of grade

retention on student outcomes is that the students to be retained are not selected randomly.

Therefore, regression-adjusted differences based on observable student attributes between

promoted and retained students are likely to yield biased inferences. Table 2 illustrates these

differences between English learner students who were retained and English learner students

who were promoted at the end of the third grade, and shows that, compared to promoted English

learner students, English learner students who were retained at the end of the third grade had

significantly lower test scores in third grade, were significantly more likely to come from

disadvantaged backgrounds, and more likely to be special education students. To deal with this

selection issue, we utilize the non-linearity created by the retention policy and compare students

who scored right below and right above the promotion cutoff in an RD framework. In what

follows, we detail this empirical approach.

4. Empirical Framework



                                                  9
       In our analysis, we rely on RD design using the student-level treatment cutoffs based on

the third-grade reading scores of students. Let 𝑆 denote the difference between the score of

student i in the third-grade reading test and the retention cutoff—with negative values indicating

scores below cutoff—and 𝑇 denote an indicator for retained students. A common regression

model representation of this evaluation problem would then become:

                                             𝑌        𝛼    𝛽𝑇       𝜖                             (1)

       where 𝑌 is the outcome of interest (e.g., test scores, time to proficiency, advanced or

remedial course-taking). Since students on both sides of the retention cutoff can be promoted or

retained under the Florida policy, we utilize a fuzzy RD design where the effect of the treatment

on the treated is given by:

                                                 ↑    𝑌𝑆        ↓       𝑌𝑆
                                    𝛽                                      .                      (2)
                                                 ↑    𝑇𝑆        ↓       𝑇𝑆

       There are several ways to estimate 𝛽 in this context. The first is to estimate Equation (2)

non-parametrically using kernel-weighted local polynomial smoothing. However, when the

selection variable is discrete—as in this case—the non-parametric estimator might lead to biased

estimates, since it is not feasible to compare averages within arbitrarily small neighborhoods

around the cutoff (Lee and Card, 2008). Therefore, following Lee and Card (2008), we estimate

𝛽 parametrically using the following two-stage least squares (2SLS) framework:

                                    𝑇    𝛾       𝛿𝐵       𝑘 𝑆       𝑘 𝑆 ∗𝐵     𝜐                  (3)

and the fitted value of T is used in a second stage:

                                    𝑌    𝜌       𝜏𝑇       𝑘 𝑆       𝑘 𝑆 ∗𝑇     𝜀.                 (4)

       where 𝑘 𝑆 is a polynomial function of the relative test score, and 𝐵 is an indicator for

students below cutoff. We estimate this model using the linear polynomial specification and

different bandwidths (i.e., restrict the estimation sample to students within different score ranges)

                                                      10
to check the robustness of our findings, and two-way cluster the standard errors at the relative

test score and school levels (Lee and Card, 2008).

       In this empirical framework, 𝜏 will yield unbiased estimates of the causal effect of the

treatment if (a) there is a significant discontinuity in treatment at the cutoff (large denominator in

Equation (2)); and (b) all other student attributes are smooth around the cutoff. Figure 1

empirically checks to make sure that the first condition is satisfied, and presents the percentage

of retained English learners by their relative third-grade reading score. This figure shows that

while the retention rate declines as we approach the cutoff from the left, English learners whose

reading scores fell just below the retention cutoff were still approximately 25 percentage points

more likely to be retained compared to students right above the cutoff.

       While the second condition cannot be definitively proven, we conduct several tests. First,

we examine if the observable characteristics of students are continuous by estimating the

following models:

                                    𝑋    𝛼    𝛽𝐵        𝑘 𝑆   𝑘 𝑆 ∗𝐷     𝜀                         (5)

       where 𝑋 represents baseline student characteristics including third-grade math scores. In

Table 3, we present falsification tests where each row represents a separate regression using the

identified variable as the dependent variable estimated using a bandwidth of 10 and 20 points

and the linear polynomial specification, and the estimated coefficient indicates the size of the

discontinuity. Figure 2 presents further evidence plotting the mean value of observable student

characteristics against reading scores in third grade close to the cutoff. Consistent with our

identification assumption, we observe no significant discontinuity at the cutoff.

       Third, we check for the possibility of selection variable manipulation as noted in

McCrary (2008), even though this is very unlikely in this context since FCAT scores are assessed


                                                   11
without any teacher, student, or principal involvement. Figure 3 presents the distribution of

students around the retention cutoff, and shows that the number of students in each bin seems to

be increasing as the retention cutoff falls on the left tail of the normally distributed reading

scores, but the results present no unusual discontinuity at the cutoff and hence no evidence of

strategic sorting around the cutoff. We reject the hypothesis on discontinuity in the density of the

distribution at the cutoff, with a p-value of 0.993 (Frandsen, forthcoming).



5. Results

   5.1. Estimated Effects on Reading Achievement in Elementary and Middle School

       We first examine the effects of early grade retention on English learners’ English skills as

proxied by their reading test scores in elementary and middle school. Similar to Schwerdt et al.

(2017), we conduct (1) same-age analysis, comparing the test scores of students around the

retention cutoff in the years following the first time these students enter third grade, and

(2) same-grade analysis, comparing their reading achievement when both retained and promoted

students reach the same grade level. In both analysis, we use vertically aligned developmental

test scores that are comparable across grades. We present the 2SLS results of the same-age

analysis in the top panel of Table 4 using the linear polynomial specification and bandwidths of

10 and 20 points, whereas the top panel of Figure 4 provides a visual inspection of the

discontinuity in reading scores in the years following third grade at the retention cutoff using

local linear smoothing with a bandwidth of 20 points. The results suggest large benefits of

retention on the reading scores of English learners in the short run, starting with 26 to 30 percent

of the standard deviation in the first year, peaking at roughly 0.6σ within two years, and

reverting back to 0.35σ to 0.4σ within three years. These benefits dissipate quickly when the



                                                  12
retained students enter middle school, with fourth-year effects of 0.08σ to 0.17σ, and fifth-year

effects of 0.05σ to 0.10σ. While three out of the four estimates in years 4 and 5 are no longer

statistically different than zero at conventional levels, they still represent meaningful-magnitude

estimated gains in reading achievement in middle school. Middle school students in our data

typically gain about 30 percent of a standard deviation per year on the current-year reading test,

so these effect sizes, at minimum, represent gains comparable to about a month of instruction.5

        The bottom panels of Table 4 and Figure 4 repeat the same analysis, this time comparing

the developmental test scores of English learners around the retention cutoff when they reach the

same grade level. We find sizable effects on reading scores that persist through eighth grade,

with effect sizes of roughly 0.5σ in eighth grade, providing evidence that just-retained students

are better prepared for more challenging course content in middle school than their just-

promoted peers. These test-score findings for English learners are mostly in line with—and, in

some cases, slightly larger than—the overall effects reported in Schwerdt et al. (2017).



    5.2. Estimated Effects on Time to Proficiency

        There are two important implications of improved English skills for retained English

learners. First, these students could attain English proficiency and leave the English learner

program earlier than their promoted peers. The top panel of Table 5 presents the 2SLS estimates

where the dependent variable is the number of years between the first time an English learner

enters the third grade and his/her reclassification out of English learner status, and Figure 5

presents the local linear smoothing of the years-to-proficiency variable on the relative reading

 Based on authors’ calculations using vertically aligned developmental reading scores for middle school students in
our sample. Specifically, we calculated the average year-to-year change (difference between year t+1 and year t) in
developmental reading scores for sixth and seventh graders in terms of the standard deviation of the current year
(year t) reading test scores.

                                                        13
score, calculated separately for each side of the cutoff using the triangle kernel and the

bandwidth of 20 points, with the solid circles representing the averaged outcome variable for

each test score. The results indicate that retention reduces time to proficiency by a year for

English learners. Given that English learners whose third-grade reading scores fell right above

the cutoff spend an additional 2 years in the English learner program, this effect size implies that

grade retention reduces additional time spent in English learner program by half.

       The second panel of Table 5 and the middle panel of Figure 5 repeat the same analysis,

replacing the time-to-proficiency variable with a series of English learner indicators in the years

following the first time students enter the third grade. The findings indicate that retention reduces

the likelihood of being identified as an English learner by 7 to 20 percentage points in the first

year (or 10 to 30 percent of the control mean), by 15 to 18 percentage points within 2 years (or

31 to 38 percent of the control mean), and by 21 to 22 percentage points (or roughly 64 percent

of the control mean) in the third year. These benefits also persist in middle school even though

the estimated effects are not as precisely estimated in some cases—retention reduces the

likelihood of being identified as an English learner in the fourth year by almost 70 percent of the

control mean. The results of the same-grade analysis, reported in the third panel of Table 5 and

the bottom panel of Figure 5, reveal similar findings and show that retention significantly

increases the likelihood of exiting the English learner program by the time English learners enter

middle school.



   5.3. Estimated Effects on Middle and High School Course-Taking

       Another potential benefit of Florida’s early grade retention policy for English learners is

that it might reduce the need for future remediation by helping these students acquire the



                                                 14
necessary English skills for more challenging course content. For example, during the time frame

we examine in our study, Florida required middle and high school students who scored in the

lowest two achievement levels on prior-year reading tests to take remedial reading courses.6

Therefore, early grade retention could reduce the likelihood of taking remedial reading courses in

middle school due to the aforementioned positive effects of retention on the reading scores of

English learners. The first row of Table 6 presents the estimated effects of grade retention on the

likelihood of taking at least one remedial reading course in middle school (we present graphical

evidence in the first panel of Figure 6).7 The results indicate that early grade retention leads to a

decline in remedial course-taking in middle school by 15 to 25 percentage points, roughly

equivalent to a 20 to 35 percent reduction relative to the control mean at the cutoff.

         The reduced need for English remediation could also free up time and allow these

students to take more advanced courses in middle school.8 We explore this possibility in rows

(II) to (IV) of Table 6 and panels (B) to (D) of Figure 6, where we examine the effects of early

grade retention on whether the student (I) took an advanced language arts course in middle

school, (II) took an advanced math course in middle school, and (III) took an advanced science

course in middle school. These findings point to significant effects of grade retention on the

middle school course-taking behavior among English learners. In particular, we find that grade

retention increases the likelihood of taking an advanced language arts course by 55 to 68 percent,

  This is similar to many other college readiness initiatives recently implemented nationwide, which require students
that are deemed not on track based on their standardized test scores to take remedial courses. For example, under the
Targeted Interventions Program in Kentucky, one of the earliest adopters of college- and career-readiness
benchmarks, performance standards have been established for students in grades 8, 10, and 11 using standardized
tests, and students deemed not on track to meet subsequent college readiness indicators are required by law to take
transitional courses before they exit high school.

  We identify remedial courses as those that are labeled “Remedial” in the Florida Department of Education’s course
code directory.

  Advanced courses in middle school are those labeled level-3 courses (the most advanced out of three categories)
in the Florida Department of Education’s Course Code Directory (CCD) for years between 2005–06 and 2011–12.

roughly doubles the likelihood of taking an advanced math course, and increases the likelihood

of taking an advanced science course by 69 to 90 percent among English learners.

         These effects on middle school course-taking behavior could better prepare English

learners for high school courses and lead them to take college credit-bearing courses in high

school such as Advanced Placement9 or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, potentially

better preparing them for college.10 While we are unable to observe course-taking behavior

throughout high school for any of our cohorts, we examine the effects of grade retention in third

grade on the likelihood of taking an AP or IB course before the 12th grade for our oldest cohort

(students who entered third grade for the first time in 2002).11 Once again, our results point to a

sizable effect of early grade retention on course-taking among English learners—the estimates,

presented in the last row of Table 6 (graphical inspection provided in the last panel of Figure 6)

reveal that early grade retention increases the likelihood of taking college credit-bearing courses

in high school for English learners by 31 to 44 percentage points, more than tripling the

probability of taking these courses compared to a control mean of 15 percent at the cutoff.



    5.4. Subgroup Analysis

         Do certain English learner subgroups benefit more from grade retention compared to

others? While we do not have sufficient power to statistically distinguish the estimated effects of

   Florida offers a wide array of high school acceleration programs for students to earn college credit while in high
school, including Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced International Certificate of
Education (AICE), and dual enrollment (DE) courses. In our main analysis, we focus on AP, IB, and AICE course-
taking in math, science, English, and social studies because these courses are offered in the K-12 system and hence
included in our data.
11
   That said, taking at least one AP/IB course by the end of 11th grade is a good predictor of the likelihood of taking
one of these courses in high school. For example, when we examine the earlier high school cohorts in our sample
(those that entered third grade before Florida’s grade retention policy), less than 10 percent of students who did not
take at least one AP/IB course by the end of 11th grade took one of these courses in 12th grade.

                                                          16
retention across different English learner groups, panels (A) through (J) in Figure 7 present the

results of an exploratory analysis providing the 2SLS estimates (along with their 95% confidence

intervals) for different student groups of interest.

       For instance, Florida’s grade retention policy could be more effective in improving the

outcomes of immigrant students who recently relocated to the U.S. and might simply need more

time to learn English before facing more challenging course content. In contrast, the academic

struggles of native-born English learners might be driven by factors beyond English deficiencies.

The first set of bars in each figure presents the breakdown by student nativity. While the short-

term effects of retention on reading scores are comparable for U.S. born and immigrant English

learners, the longer-term benefits are much larger for the latter group and are statistically

distinguishable from zero. The effects on remedial English course-taking in middle school and

AP/IB course-taking in high school are also larger for foreign born English learners, yet the

effects are comparable for all other outcomes of interest.

       One of the overarching conclusions of the extant literature on English learners is that

their pathways to proficiency vary significantly by their native language (e.g., Conger, 2010;

Slama, 2014; Thompson, 2012). The second set of bars in each figure compares the estimated

effects for Spanish speakers (who constitute roughly 70 percent of all English learners in our

sample) with speakers of other languages. The benefits of retention are slightly larger for the

former group in many cases, with the exception of the effects on remedial English-taking in

middle school and AP/IB course-taking in high school, where we observe significantly larger

effect sizes for Spanish-speaking English learners that are statistically distinct from zero.

       Finally, the effects of grade retention could be larger for English learners with larger

latent human capital in third grade as proxied by their third-grade math scores, or for students in



                                                  17
elementary schools in more affluent neighborhoods (as measured by the percentage of students

who are eligible for subsidized meals) that could have more resources to provide the instructional

support for retained students. The third and fourth set of bars investigate whether the estimated

effects of retention on English learners are different based on the student’s third-grade math

proficiency or the poverty of the school the student attended in third grade. The results provide

strong evidence that the benefits of grade retention are higher for English learners with larger

latent human capital. For instance, we find that students with higher math scores in third grade

experience a decline of 1.5 years (or almost an 80 percent drop compared to the control mean at

the cutoff) in time to proficiency because of retention (compared to a decline of 0.6 years for

students who were not proficient in math in third grade). The results also suggest that the

benefits of retention are substantially larger for English learners in schools serving more affluent

students. For example, retention leads to considerably larger increases in reading test scores for

these students who persist longer, reduces time to proficiency by 1 year (compared to 0.6 years

for students in high-poverty schools), and leads to a much larger increase in the likelihood of

taking advanced courses in high school.



   5.5. Robustness Checks

       Figure 8 checks the sensitivity of our main findings to bandwidth selection and provides

the effects (and the 95% confidence intervals) of retention estimated using different bandwidths

and the linear polynomial specification. For all of our outcomes, the estimated discontinuities at

the cutoff are extremely robust to bandwidth selection, and our previous conclusions remain

unchanged.




                                                 18
       Another potential challenge to identification in this context is the possibility that students

whose third-grade reading test scores fall in the lowest achievement level are subject to other

interventions targeting low-performing students. This might imply, for instance, that the

observed differences between students around the cutoff are driven by other student-level

policies instead of grade retention. To test this hypothesis, we constructed “pseudo” cutoffs using

earlier cohorts who were not subject to the retention policy (English learners who first entered

third grade in 2001–02) and checked the discontinuities in outcomes. Figure 9 presents these

findings using the linear specification and different bandwidths, and shows that there are no

statistically significant discontinuities in our main outcome variables at these pseudo-cutoffs.

These findings provide further evidence that the observed differences in outcomes between

students around the retention cutoff are indeed driven by the retention policy.

       Finally, differential attrition might lead to biased estimates if retained students leave the

sample at higher rates than their promoted peers. To test this possibility, Figure 10 checks the

discontinuities in attrition rates around the cutoff in the 5 years following the first time students

enter the third grade, and by the time students enter 11th grade (for the 2002 cohort only). We

find no significant discontinuities in these attrition rates around the cutoff, providing evidence

that our results are not driven by differential attrition around the retention cutoff.



6. Concluding Remarks

       English learners represent the fastest growing student group in the United States. As

such, the achievement gaps between English learners and non-English natives have been well

documented in the literature (Genesee et al., 2005; Hakuta, 2011; Mitchell, 2015; Saunders and

Marcelletti, 2013; and Huang, 2016). An overarching conclusion of this literature is that these



                                                  19
gaps are significantly larger between long-term English learners (students who are classified as

English learners in elementary school and fail to attain proficiency by middle school) and their

English-proficient peers. Therefore, in order to close English learner achievement gaps, it is

crucial to reduce the time to proficiency among these students.

       In this study, we examine the effects of Florida’s third-grade retention policy on English

learners. This policy is particularly relevant for English learners as the retention decision is

mainly based on student achievement on reading tests, and because the retained students receive

substantial instructional support in reading (including at least 90 minutes of reading instruction

each day using effective instruction strategies and high-performing teachers). We find that early

grade retention significantly improves the English skills as proxied by reading test scores and

reduces time to proficiency among English learners. Furthermore, it reduces the need for future

remediation in middle school and increases the likelihood of taking advanced courses in middle

and high school, potentially better preparing English learners for college. We also find that these

benefits are larger for recent immigrants who were born in another country and relocated to the

United States, for students with higher latent human capital in third grade as proxied by their

third-grade math scores, and for students in lower-poverty schools.

       How about cost effectiveness? The main argument against grade retention policies is that

they are costly to taxpayers. For example, Warren et al. (2014) estimate that roughly 1.5 percent

of the 50 million public school students were retained in 2009–10. With average per-pupil

spending of approximately $12,000, the estimated cost of retention to taxpayers in 2009–10 was

$9 billion and affected about 750,000 children nationwide. This estimate ignores two additional

costs. First, grade retention may impose private costs, such as the delay of entry into the labor

force. Eide and Goldhaber (2005) estimate that being retained in the third grade in the 1990s cost



                                                  20
the average student $22,251 to $35,475 due to foregone wages, depending on the educational

attainment of the student. Furthermore, grade retention might impose a significant emotional

burden on students because they are stigmatized as failing and they face the challenges of

adjusting to new peers, which might in turn lead to student disengagement from schooling.

       That said, these costs could be justified if grade retention policies increase student

achievement and human capital, which in turn could lead to school districts/states spending less

on remedial education for vulnerable student populations (e.g., if fewer students take remedial

courses in middle or high school, or if grade retention leads to English learners being reclassified

out of English learner programs sooner), and/or lead to higher wages in the long run because of

higher human capital accumulation. We find evidence supporting this hypothesis. Therefore,

early grade retention policies with instructional support might be a cost-effective way to improve

the long-term outcomes of English learners. Our results also provide evidence that grade

retention for English learners could be more efficacious in cases where the second language is

still a dominant language (e.g., Spanish in the Florida context).
