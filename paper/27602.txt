Designing Disability Insurance Reforms: Tightening Eligibility Rules or Reducing Benefits

                                            ABSTRACT

We study the welfare effects of disability insurance (DI) and derive social-optimality conditions
for the two main DI policy parameters: (i) DI eligibility rules and (ii) DI benefits. Causal
evidence from two DI reforms in Austria generate fiscal multipliers (total over mechanical cost
reductions) of 2.0-2.5 for stricter DI eligibility rules and of 1.3-1.4 for lower DI benefits. Stricter
DI eligibility rules generate lower income losses (earnings + transfers), particularly at the lower
end of the income distribution. Our analysis suggests that the welfare cost of rolling back the
Austrian DI program is lower through tightening eligibility rules than through lowering benefits.
Applying our framework to the US DI system suggests that both loosening eligibility rules, and
increasing benefits, would be welfare increasing.

1 Introduction
    The number of disability insurance (DI) recipients has risen rapidly over the past decades in most OECD


countries despite generally improving health, higher material living standards, and less physically demanding


working conditions.
                         1 The increasing nancial burden of DI programs for taxpayers has led many governments to

implement DI reforms aiming explicitly at reducing the DI program inow and DI expenditures. While restrictive


DI reforms reduce the scal burden for taxpayers, they also impose utility losses on individuals suering from


a disability. The welfare consequences ultimately depend on how DI reforms address this incentive-insurance


trade-o.


    In this paper, we pursue the sucient-statistics approach of policy evaluation to shed light on the welfare


eects of DI reforms; an approach that has been extensively applied to optimal unemployment insurance (UI).


DI programs dier from UI programs in two key dimensions.                         DI receipt is typically permanent, implying


that a key behavioral margin are DI applications driving program                   inow,    and the assessment of DI eligibility


requires a medical test, implying that DI reforms need to address the incentive-insurance trade-o of                       two policy
instruments: DI eligibility rules and DI benets.
                                                              2 Indeed, proponents of rolling back the DI program argue

that DI benets are not only too generous but also too easy to obtain. Our paper is the rst to analyze in a


comprehensive way the welfare eects of both DI policy instruments using sucient statistics.


    Our analysis comes in three steps.          First, we set up a general theoretical framework to study how DI aects
individuals' choices. We derive social-optimality formulas that characterize the incentive-insurance trade-o in


DI under general economic environments. The incentive costs  both for DI eligibility rules and DI benets  can


be expressed in terms of a        scal multiplier.     The scal multiplier measures the total cost savings of a DI reform


relative to the mechanical scal eect, the scal cost savings in the absence of any behavioral responses. The


scal multiplier is a key benchmark for welfare analysis: A DI reform is welfare enhancing if the scal multiplier


is larger than the associated insurance losses. Put dierently, a DI reform generating a scal multiplier of                          x   is


welfare enhancing if one dollar in the hands of a marginal DI recipient has a lower social value than                        x   dollars


in public funds.


    In the    second step    of our analysis, we provide a causal analysis of two DI reforms that were implemented


in Austria in 2003 and 2013.             The 2003 reform implemented changes to the pension formula reducing DI



   1 In   the US, 2.6 percent of individuals in the age group of 20 to 64 were receiving DI benets in 1992, but by 2012 this fraction
had risen to 5.3 percent.    Many European countries have also experienced signicant growth of their DI programs, particularly
Scandinavian countries. In 2015, public spending on disabilility insurance (incapacity) programs amounted to an OECD-average
of 1.9% of GDP, with substantial variation across countries: 1.3% in the US, 1.7% in France, 1.9% in the UK, 2.1% in Austria and
Germany, and more than 4% in Sweden, Norway and Denmark (OECD, 2020).
   2 In   contrast, UI receipt is typcially temporary and assessing UI eligibility is straightforward. Moreover, the relevant behavioral
margin in UI (job-search eort) aects the program      outow, which is primarily driven by the generosity of a single policy instrument:
the UI benet level. Baily (1978) has pioneered the theoretical analysis of optimal UI and Chetty (2006) has developed the sucient-
statistics approach in the UI context. More recent applications of the sucient statistic approach for optimal UI include Shimer
and Werning (2007), Chetty (2008), Kroft (2008), Schmieder et al. (2012), Landais (2015), Kroft and Notowidigdo (2016), Landais
et al. (2018) and Kolsrud et al. (2018). See the article by Chetty and Finkelstein (2013) for a detailed discussion of this literature.




                                                                    1
benet levels substantially for some individuals but less so for others.                    The quasi-experimental variation in


DI benets over time and across individuals allows us to identify the causal eect of DI benets.                              The 2013


reform implemented stricter DI eligibility rules by increasing the relaxed screening age (RSA), the age at


which vocational factors in the DI determination process increase DI award rates substantially.                           Because of


a staggered increase in the RSA, we can compare adjacent cohorts to identify the causal eect of stricter


DI eligibility rules. Using population data from the Austrian social security register (ASSD) merged with the


universe of DI applications (provided by the Austrian Ministry of Social Aairs, BMASK), we nd that stricter


DI eligibility rules and lower DI benets in the Austrian DI reforms generated behavioral responses, which


lowered DI program costs substantially.
                                                3

    The    third step   of our analysis explores the welfare eects of the Austrian DI reforms. To estimate the scal


multiplier, we can draw on our reduced-form estimate of the total scal eect (the numerator), but we still


have to estimate the mechanical scal cost savings in the absence of behavioral responses (the denominator).


In the case of    lower DI benets, the mechanical scal eect of a one-percent reduction in DI benets is simply
one percent of the pre-reform mean of DI expenditures, which yields a scal multiplier between 1.3 and 1.4.


Estimating the mechanical scal eect of              stricter DI eligibility rules    is less straightforward, because we need to


know who is an always applicant (who does not abstain from applying even under stricter DI eligibility rules).


Unfortunately, we cannot observe in the data who is an always applicant and who is a marginal applicant (who


abstains from applying under stricter eligibility rules).
                                                                     4 We argue (and provide supportive evidence) that the

mechanical scal eect can be inferred from the re-application behavior of previously rejected DI applicants.


Based on this strategy, we estimate a scal multiplier between 2.0 and 2.5.


    Taken together, the relative size of scal multipliers suggests that stricter DI eligibility rules are more eective


than lower DI benets in reducing program expenditures. But to assess the relative welfare eects, we also need


to compare the insurance losses of the two policy instruments. While we lack the necessary data (on health,


wealth, and consumption) to estimate the insurance losses directly, we nd that income losses (earnings plus


transfers) associated with stricter DI eligibility rules are smaller than those associated with lower DI benets,


particularly in the lowest quintile of the income distribution. Through the lens of our theoretical framework,


this pattern suggests lower insurance losses of stricter DI eligibility rules compared to lower DI benets. Hence,



   3 The   linked social security and DI applications data provide us with a unique data set in the sense that we observe not only all
DI applications but also all workers (applicants    and   non-applicants) covered in the ASSD (about 80% of the Austrian population).
Observing applicants and non-applicnts allow us to study in detail individuals' DI application behavior.         Staubli (2011) studies
the labor market eects of an earlier increase in the RSA in 1996, but he has no application data and cannot study application
behavior, which is important in the present context, since individuals' application behavior is a key driver of the welfare eects of
DI reforms.
   4 If always applicants and marginal applicants had identical (observed and unobserved) characteristics, the mechanical scal eect
of stricter DI eligibility rules could be estimated simply by applying lower DI award rates to the   average   pre-reform DI applicant.
We conduct a complier analysis (Imbens and Rubin 1997; Abadie 2003) which shows that always applicants and marginal applicants
dier signicantly with respect to a number of observed characteristics. Hence, approximating the mechanical eect (the scal cost
savings of always applicants) by the cost savings of average applicants (a mixture of always applicants and marginal applicants) is
misleading.




                                                                     2
to roll-back the Austrian DI program, our results conclude that the welfare cost of stricter eligibility rules would


be smaller than that of benet cuts.
                                             5

    While we think our paper makes progress using the sucient-statistics approach for optimal DI, we need


to keep in mind the limitations of this approach. First, the welfare implications are drawn from reduced-form


estimates, which apply only locally to the particular Austrian context. However, our analysis is of more general


interest, since many DI programs feature eligibility rules similar to Austria that are based on vocational factors


such as age or work history.          For example, in the US DI system applicants older than age 55 are evaluated


based on more lenient eligibility standards than applicants between ages 50 and 55, who are subject to more


lenient standards than applicants below age 50.
                                                            6 Dierent from what we nd for Austria, Chen and van der

Klaauw (2008) and Deshpande et al. (forthcoming) do not nd sorting of applications around these age cutos,


suggesting no behavioral response and a scal multiplier of DI eligibility rules of 1.
                                                                                                          7 Previous US estimates

on the behavioral responses to changes in DI benet levels result in a scal multiplier very similar to the one


we estimate for Austria. For example, Low and Pistaferri (2015) estimate an elasticity of DI applications with


respect to benet levels of 0.62. Together with a DI award rate of 0.67 (French and Song, 2014), this elasticity


suggests a scal multiplier of lower DI benets of 1.3-1.4 for the US.


    A second limitation of the sucient-statistics approach is that it applies only to marginal (innitesimally


small) policy changes, while in reality we are interested in non-marginal policy changes (Kleven, forthcoming).


We address this issue by deriving social optimality conditions for non-marginal DI policy changes and show


that our analysis of the scal multiplier, a core concept of our framework, is also valid with non-marginal policy


changes. We further show, for non-marginal policy changes, how income losses (along the income distribution)


can be used to bound insurance losses and how these bounds are useful for ranking the two DI policy instruments.


    A third limitation of the sucient-statistics approach is that, without restrictions on preferences and the


economic environment, one typically ends up with a large number of elasticities to be estimated. Our concept


of the scal multiplier (with its focus on overall program costs) is useful, because it permits welfare analysis


without making specic restrictions to reduce the number of elasticities. In this respect, our framework is similar


to Lee et al. (forthcoming) and Hendren and Sprung-Keyser (2020).
                                                                                    8

   5 While   our analysis cannot put a number on the absolute insurance losses, a tentative analysis (based on CRRA preferences
and hand-to-mouth consumers) suggests that insurance losses and scal gains of lower DI benets are of similar size (i.e.                DI
benets are optimal), while insurance losses fall short of scal gains of tighter DI eligibility rules (i.e. tightening eligibility rules is
welfare-enhancing).
   6 There   are consideration of revising the US vocational factors. In 2012 the Congressional Budget Oce proposed to increase
the age cutos of the relaxed eligibility rules (Mann et al., 2014).
   7 Appendix   Figure D.25 contrasts the US application behavior to the Austrian application behavior. In Austria, there is a large
spike in DI applications exactly at the RSA. In the US, there is no spike in DI applications at the age cutos but a discontinuous
jump in award rates.
   8 Lee   et al. (forthcoming) estimate the scal externality of UI benet reforms.       The scal externality is the behavioral scal
eect relative to the mechanical scal eect. Hence, what we refer to as the scal multiplier is 1+scal externality. Hendren and
Sprung-Keyser (2020) use the concept of the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF) to evaluate 133 historical policy changes in
the US. The MVPF is the willingness to pay for a policy divided by the net cost to the government. In our application, the MVPF
corresponds to the insurance value divided by the scal multiplier. We separate the two eects. In the case of DI, determining
the insurance value is not straightforward (and to some degree a judgment call), while the scal multiplier can be estimated with




                                                                    3
   An interesting aspect of our approach relates more specically to the impact of DI eligibility rules.      One


might have thought that a welfare analysis of tighter DI rules requires pinning down type-I and type-II errors


(false rejections and false acceptances).   However, we show that it suces to estimate the mechanical scal


eect, which is an advantage, because it substantially reduces the data requirements and the complexity of the


analysis. The disadvantage is that we cannot address the accuracy of the screening process  an important open


question in DI research. Instead, a more structural approach, such as the one of Low and Pistaferri (2015), is


able to directly estimate the type-I and type-II errors. Benitez-Silva et al. (2004) and Low and Pistaferri (2019)


provide further evidence on the classication errors of the DI screening process.


   This paper contributes to an active literature on the labor market and welfare eects of disability insurance


programs (for reviews, see Bound and Burkhauser, 1999; Low and Pistaferri, forthcoming). Our paper comple-


ments the strand of literature that evaluates the incentive-insurance trade-o in DI programs using structural


models. Most closely related are the US studies of Bound et al. (2004) and Low and Pistaferri (2015). Bound


et al. (2004) simulate the benets and costs of changes in disability benet levels and nd that the implicit price


of providing an additional dollar of income to DI recipients  what we call the scal multiplier of DI benets 


is 1.5, very similar to our estimate. Low and Pistaferri (2015) assess DI eligibility criteria and DI benet levels


in the US and conclude that social welfare could be raised by loosening eligibility criteria and raising benets.


We reach the same conclusion by applying our framework to existing US estimates.


   Bound et al. (2010) specify a structural model to study the interplay between health and labor force partic-


ipation. They nd that removing the DI program entirely would have little eect on individuals in good health


but would hurt individuals in bad health. Autor et al. (2019) use a judge leniency instrumental variable design


and a structural model to estimate the consumption and welfare eects of DI in Norway. They show that DI


increases household income and consumption for singles but not for married individuals. Their results point,


like ours, to the importance of benet substitution.


   Our paper also contributes to the theoretical literature on optimal disability insurance.      We extend the


model of Diamond and Sheshinski (1995) by expressing the social optimality conditions of DI eligibility rules


and DI benet levels as a function of sucient statistics, which we can estimate empirically using program


evaluation methods. We also generalize their setup to a dynamic environment with rich heterogeneity across


agents. Also related are the US studies of Meyer and Mok (2019) and Deshpande et al. (forthcoming) who apply


the Bailey-Chetty formula for optimal UI benets to DI and estimate the eect of receiving DI on consumption


and nancial outcomes. Similarly, Ball and Low (2014) estimate the eect of DI on consumption in the UK


to infer the insurance value of DI benets. We go beyond these papers by studying the welfare eects of DI


eligibility rules and comparing them to the welfare eects of DI benets. Understanding the eects of eligibility




reduced-form methods.

rules is important as the discussion about DI reforms focuses on whether individuals are truly eligible for DI


benets.


    Our paper also relates to the strand of literature that estimates the impact of DI on applications, DI take-up,


and labor supply using reduced-form methods without considering welfare eects.
                                                                                                    9 Autor and Duggan (2003)

nd that relaxed eligibility rules and increases in the DI replacement rates explain the stark growth of DI rolls


in the US and lead to a lower unemployment rate.
                                                                10 Parsons (1991) and Gruber and Kubik (1997) exploit

variation in DI rejection rates across US states over time and nd that an increase rejection rates reduces DI


applications and increases labor force participation. We nd similar evidence for self-screening in response to


stricter eligibility rules, i.e. a decline in applications, and also show that stricter eligibility rules target healthier


individuals via our complier analysis.
                                              11 Our paper also relates to studies that explore the eects of DI benet

levels for application behavior and labor supply (Gruber, 2000; Campolieti, 2004; Mullen and Staubli, 2016).


We build on these papers by estimating the eects of DI benets on benet substitution and scal costs, which


are key for assessing the welfare eects of lower DI benets.


    The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a model of disability insurance and formulas


for optimal disability eligibility and benets.             Section 3 describes the data and institutional background in


Austria. Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical results on stricter DI eligibility rules and lower DI benet levels,


respectively. Section 6 estimates the scal multipliers of these two policy instruments and discusses how our


estimates can be used for welfare evaluation.              Section 7 applies our framework to the US disability system.


Section 8 concludes.




2 Theoretical Framework
    In this section, we explore how the two main DI policy parameters  the strictness of DI eligibility rules and


the level of DI benets  aect social welfare, as well as labor supply and application behavior of potential DI


claimants.
             12 Section 2.1 starts with the static framework of Diamond and Sheshinski (1995) and Section 2.2

   9 Another    important strand of the literature studies the impact of DI receipt on labor force participation by comparing accepted
and rejected DI applicants (Bound, 1989; von Wachter et al., 2011), by exploting variation in eligibility rules (Chen and van der
Klaauw, 2008), and by exploiting the random assignment of DI applicants to examiners and administrative law judges (Maestas
et al., 2013; French and Song, 2014). We do not directly contribute to this literature, but changes in labor force participation are
reected in our program cost estimates. We also do not study outow from DI (Campolieti and Riddell, 2012, Borghans et al.,
2014, Moore, 2015) or earnings of DI recipients (Kostol and Mogstad, 2014, Gelber et al., 2017, Ruh and Staubli, 2019 and Kostøl
and Myhre, 2020), but these responses enter the scal multiplier as well.
  10 Autor   and Duggan (2006) discuss potential DI reforms to counteract the cost explosion of the DI program in the US. They
point out that there are three ways to reduce the size of DI programs: (i) tightening the screening process (eligibility rules), (ii)
reducing the incentives to seek benets (lower DI benets) and (iii) encouraging faster exit.       Our framework sheds light on the
welfare eects of options (i) and (ii).
  11 de   Jong et al. (2011) and Godard et al. (2019) nd that another aspect of the application process, more intense screening of
applicants, also reduces DI applications and improves targeting to more deserving applicants. In contrast, Deshpande and Li (2019)
show that higher application costs have adverse targeting eects by inducing individuals who would have qualied for DI to no
longer apply.
  12 By   increasing the strictness of disability eligibility rules we mean any policy making it more dicult that a DI application
 with a given degree of disability  gets accepted. This is what Low and Pistaferri (2015) and Diamond and Sheshinski (1995)
call, respectively, strictness of screening and disability standard. The terms disability rules, disability standard, and disability




                                                                   5
extends the analysis to a dynamic setting.




2.1 A Static Model of Optimal DI
Setup.        Consider an agent living for two periods.                  In the rst period, she works, earns a wage                     w,   pays a


lump-sum tax            (which nances the DI program) and enjoys utility                         u(w -  ).    There are no savings nor any


other choices in the rst period.
                                          13 In the second period, the agent suers a disability shock                           ,   modelled as a


random draw from a continuous distribution                     F ().   If       is small (= the disability not very severe), the agent


continues working and enjoys second-period utility                   u(w) - .     If    is suciently large (= the disability severe), the

agent applies for DI benets. A DI application causes disutility                          ,   capturing the extensive medical checks, the


bureaucratic hassle, etc. associated with the DI assessment process. The xed application cost                                       is important in


the present context as it ensures that DI application choices depend on the eligibility rules of the DI system.
                                                                                                                                                  14

With probability        p()     the application is accepted, where               p () > 0.15       When the application is accepted, the


agent withdraws from work, claims DI benets                     b   and gets second-period utility           v (b) -  .   When the application


is rejected, the applicant either resumes work and gets second-period utility                          u(w) -  -  ; or claims social welfare

z<b    and gets second-period utility          v (z ) -  .      (No disutility or uncertainty are associated with claiming social


welfare.) Appendix Figure A.1 illustrates the sequence of events and agent's choices in the second period.




DI Applications and Labor Supply.                          Let us now look at the DI application choice and the labor supply


decision.      An individual prefers working over claiming social welfare benets if her disability is                                   < R 

u(w) - v (z ) > 0,       i.e.   if the utility of claiming social welfare falls short of the utility of working.                        Hence,   R

denotes the marginal social welfare claimant.                       Consider an agent whose disability is not extremely severe,


 < R .          (This implies she goes back to work in case her DI application gets rejected.)                                   Her application


choice compares the utility when staying employed,                      u(w) - ,         to the expected utility when applying for DI,


p () v (b) + [1 - p ()] (u(w) - ) -  .             The marginal applicant, the agent who is indierent between ling a DI


application and remaining employed, has disability



                                                                                         
                                                          A = u(w) - v (b) +                 .                                                   (1)
                                                                                       p(A )

It follows that agents with disability           A          apply for DI, while agents with disability                 < A     remain employed.


Figure 1, Panel (a) characterizes the outcome of agents' DI application choices.                                 It draws the probability of

screening are used interchangeably. The formal denition of strictness is discussed in detail in section 2.1.
  13 The     setup follows Chetty (2006) who reconsiders Baily's (1978) formula of optimal unemployment insurance (UI). The stylized
two-period framework - tax payments but no DI application choices in the rst period, while no tax payments but DI application
choices in the second period - simplies the formula without changing the substance of the argument.
  14 Here    we deviate from Diamond and Sheshinski (1995) who do not consider application costs. Recent empirical studies support
the idea that application costs are important drivers of DI applications, e.g. Deshpande and Li (2019) and Godard et al. (2019).
  15 Below,    we will analyze a situation where the government has control over the                p()-function.    By adopting stricter eligibility
rules, the   p()-function   shifts down, so that   p   takes a lower value for any given         (and vice versa).




                                                                            6
DI award      p()   against      and indicates the disability cuto-levels           A   and   R .   Agents with a disability         A

apply for DI; if rejected, those with disability           A , R         return to work, while those with           R       go on social


welfare.


    Equation (1), and its graphical representation in Figure 1, applies when                    A < R ,     i.e. a marginal applicant


returns to work in case her DI application is rejected. We discuss in Appendix A.1 the formal conditions under


which     A < R     holds. Note that this is not a critical assumption and we do not impose it in the general model.


Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that this is a natural assumption in the present context. With                           A < R          the


model predicts that DI policy parameters aect labor supply decisions. Distortionary labor supply eects of DI


programs are supported by a large body of empirical evidence.
                                                                              16



DI Policy Instruments.              We now assess the welfare eects of two policy instruments that characterize any


DI system: the level of DI benets and the strictness of DI eligibility rules.                       While the role of DI benets             b

is straightforward and poses no major conceptual problems, the role of DI eligibility rules                               needs further


discussion. The inherent problem of the DI assessment process is that the true disability                        is the agent's private


information. For this reason, a DI applicant has to undergo a disability assessment process, which delivers an


estimate of her disability to the government. Formally, the government observes                      s =  + e(),    where    s is a   noisy


signal,       is the applicant's true disability and       e()   is the noise.
                                                                                   17 The strictness of DI eligibility rules  the

policy parameter under direct control of the government  can be captured by a critical value of                            s,   call it    ,

such that a DI application with        s        is accepted, while an application with          s <       is rejected. The acceptance


probability can then be written as           p(;  ).18    In what follows, we consider the case where the government can


change         but takes the signal as given.       This is the context of our empirical analysis below, which exploits


quasi-experimental variation in the relaxed screening age (RSA) at which DI eligibility rules become more


lenient. In our notation, the strictness of DI eligibility equals           = H         before the RSA and falls to      L < H        after


the RSA. An increase in the RSA from age              R   to some higher age        R + ,     implies that, during the age window


[R, R + ],      the treated cohort is subject to the strict DI eligibility standard                 H ,   while the control cohort is


subject to the lenient standard        L .   If cohorts are otherwise similar (in productivity, health, preferences, etc.),


a plausible assumption for adjacent cohorts, comparing treated to control cohorts identies the causal eect




  16 A    number of papers provide direct evidence on the work behavior of rejected DI applicants.          These ndings are perfectly
consistent with the predictions of the model with   A < R .    Bound (1989); von Wachter et al. (2011); Maestas et al. (2013); French
and Song (2014) use rejected DI applicants as a control group for accepted applicants to study the impact of DI on labor supply.
For instance,von Wachter et al. (2011) report that, in 69.6% of rejected DI applicants aged 30-44 in the US report positive yearly
earnings two years after the DI application and 57.4% report earnings higher than three months of full-time employment at the
minimum wage in 2000. The corresponding numbers are 52.6% and 42.7% for rejected DI applicants aged 45-64. In the Norwegian
study by Kostol and Mogstad (2014), about 30 percent of rejected DI applicants aged 18-49 are participating on the labor market.
  17 The variance of the noise is likely to vary with the severity of the disability as very severe and perhaps also very weak disabilities
are more easy to assess than intermediate cases.
  18 In   the following we assume that the DI assessment process is informative, i.e. we assume       p(;  )/  0.       This implies that
in an applicant pool with a more severe disability a smaller fraction of DI assessments fall short of an arbitrary cuto            and will
ensure that on average the award probability is increasing in the severity of the disability.

Welfare Eects of DI Reforms.                  We follow the literature assuming society's objective can be represented


by a utilitarian social welfare function. Assuming a population of mass unity and abstracting from discounting,


the social welfare function is given by


                                      ´ A                 ´ R
                 W ( , b) = u(w -  ) + 0 (u(w) - )dF () + A (1 - p(;  ))(u(w) - )dF ()+
                                                                                                                                     (2)
                               ´                   ´                           ´

The right-hand-side terms sum up the welfare levels of the various agents: rst-period workers, all of whom are


working and paying taxes (rst term on the right-hand-side); the working healthy (second term), the rejected DI


applicants resuming work (third term); the DI recipients (fourth term); and the social-welfare recipients (fth


term). The last term takes account of the aggregate welfare losses associated with DI application costs. When


designing the optimal DI program, the government needs to take into account agents' behavioral responses


to changes in DI policy parameters.              Furthermore, the social planner is constrained by a balanced-budget


requirement: DI and social welfare benet payments have to be covered by the taxes raised in the rst period,

In what follows, we discuss the welfare eects of DI reforms. We rst look at the eects of implementing more


stringent DI eligibility rules, before we turn to the eects of reducing DI benets.                     The discussion is framed


in terms of implementing a more restrictive DI system, because most policy debates center around reducing


the nancial burden of the DI program.               Of course, analogous arguments hold for reforms that increase the


generosity of the DI system.




Stricter DI Eligibility Rules: Marginal Increase in                        .    The utilitarian government sets DI eligibility


rules      to maximize social welfare       W,    taking into account the balanced-budget requirement and agents' DI


application responses. In Appendix A.1, we show that the welfare eect of increasing                        is




  19 The   government could, in principle, take measures other than varying       to manipulate the DI award probability   p(;  ).   For
instance, the goal of a DI reform could be to increase the precision of DI screening, to avoid type-I and type-II errors (= false
acceptances and false rejections) of an imperfectly functioning DI assessment system. This could be done through more extensive
medical checks, better equipment, monitoring of DI applicants, etc.. Such measures would reduce the variance of the noise        e().
However, unlike changing     ,   changing the precision of the signal requires resources and welfare calculations need to take into
account society's willingness to pay for improved DI screening.       While such policies are clearly relevant in practice, we do not
analyze their welfare implications here, mainly because we cannot address them empirically with our data. However, we consider
this a potentially interesting direction for future research. Low and Pistaferri (2015) and Low and Pistaferri (2019) make progress
in this direction by estimating type-I and type-II errors in the US award process.

Condition (4) highlights the two opposing eects of stricter DI eligibility rules                                      on social welfare. On the one


hand, a higher            raises social welfare because it saves taxpayers' money (scal cost reduction). On the other


hand, a higher             reduces social welfare, because fewer agents are awarded DI when hit by a severe disability


shock (insurance losses).


      The scal cost reduction consist of two components: the behavioral scal eect                                            B ( )   and the mechani-


cal scal eect        M ( ).       The behavioral scal eect measures the reduction in DI expenditures due to fewer


DI applications.          The mechanical scal eect                  M ( )     comes from fewer DI applications getting accepted.                            To


see the behavioral and mechanical eects more clearly, note that the DI inow probability is the product of


two factors: the probability of ling an application times the probability that the application gets accepted,


P r(DI) = P r(Apply)  P r(Accept|Apply).                       In the above notation, the application probability is                          P r(Apply) =
                                                                                                        ´

                                                                                                              p(;  )dF () / 1 - F (A )                .    The


derivative of the application probability with respect to                            yields the average agent's change in application be-

plicant resuming work saves the amount                    b    to the taxpayer (recall that, in the second period, workers do not


pay taxes), while each rejected applicant substituting DI for social welfare saves                                  b-z > 0       to the taxpayer. The


mechanical    scal        eect is therefore     M ( )  MW · b + MZ · (b - z ).                  Since scal savings are used to reduce taxes,


the total scal gain,         B ( ) + M ( ),       is valued at the marginal utility of consumption of the taxpayer                                  u (w -  )

in equation (4).


      Adopting stricter DI eligibility rules               does not only save money to taxpayers, it also reduces the insurance


value of the DI system.            The lower DI acceptance probability corresponds to a higher probability that a DI


applicant eventually has to resume work,                   MW ,      or has to claim social welfare,               MZ .    The average utility loss of

                      (a) Illustration of Model                                        (b) Eects of Stricter Eligibility Rules




Notes: Panel (a) illustrates the basic setup. Individuals are characterized by disability level  and can choose whether to work, apply to
DI or leave the labor force and consume social welfare benets. The award process to DI is noisy and individuals are awarded DI with
probability p(). We assume that p() is weakly increasing in . This captures that (i) it is dicult to assess the true disability level of an
individual and (ii) the assessment contains nonetheless some valuable information on the true disability level. The marginal DI applicant
is denoted by A and individuals with   A apply to DI. The marginal welfare benets type is denoted by R and individuals with
   R will go on welfare benets if they are rejected. Panel (b) illustrates the eects of stricter eligibility criteria. Stricter criteria
shift down the award probability curve. The area between the two award probability curves is the mechanical eect. A fraction of the
mechanically rejected applicants returns to work (gray area). The other fraction substitutes DI benets with welfare benets (blue area).
Stricter eligibility criteria also shift the marginal applicant to the right. The change in the marginal applicant times the award probability
of the marginal applicant is the behavioral eect (red area).


on the mechanical eect but not on the behavioral eect. This is a direct implication of the Envelope theorem.
                                                                                                                                           21

Intuitively, only marginal applicants react to a marginal change in the strictness of eligibility rules. Marginal


applicants are indierent between applying and not applying. Hence, if a marginal increase in                                 induces them


not to le an application, their welfare is not directly aected. However, fewer applications reduce the nancial


burden of the DI system, thus they generate a positive scal eect that benets taxpayers.


     The optimal strictness of eligibility rules              balances the trade-o between insurance loss and scal gain,


where (4) is set to zero. For later use, we rewrite this condition as



                                         W                        B ( )           LW + LZ
                                                  0  1 +                                      ,                                           (5)
                                                                  M ( )        u (w -  )M ( )

where   LW  [v (b) - (u(w) - ~)]MW > 0                and   LZ  [v (b) - v (z )] MZ > 0         are the aggregate utility losses suf-


fered by the additionally rejected applicants resuming work (LW ) and claiming social welfare (LZ ), respectively.


The two sides of the inequality have an intuitive interpretation.                      The left-hand-side is the scal multiplier,


1 + B ( )/M ( ),       and measures the reduction in the nancial burden for the taxpayer per                         mechanically      saved


dollar (= hypothetical scal gain when application behavior remains unchanged). The right-hand-side is the


  21 While   the decision to apply is discrete the envelope theorem applies because we have a marginal change in the policy parameter
 .   In Appendix A.1 we show this formally and also discuss how the welfare evaluation changes in case of a discrete (non-marginal)
change of    .


                                                                     10
corresponding reduction of the insurance value in monetary units.                         Dividing by the marginal utility of con-


sumption of the taxpayer          u (w -  )M ( )       yields the insurance loss (in monetary terms) per mechanically saved


dollar.




Stricter DI Eligibility Rules: Discrete Increase in  .                             The welfare implications of stricter DI eligibility


rules, as summarized in condition (5) hold true for a marginal increase in                      .   In our empirical implementation,


however, we study an RSA increase from age                 R   to some higher age       R + ,    which implies a discrete increase in


the DI eligibility standard from an initially lenient standard                 L    to a strict standard   H   during the age window


[R, R + ].       In Appendix A.1 we show that, for a discrete increase in                  ,   condition (5) needs to be rewritten as



                                                       B ( )          LW  + LZ         LM A
                               W        0  1 +                                  +            ,
                                                       M ( )         u (w -  )M   u (w -  )M

where the subscript             highlights that the corresponding eect has been generated by a discrete change in


 .22      The main takeaway is that scal cost reductions (the left-hand-side of the social welfare condition) can


be measured by the scal multiplier               1 + B/M .      However, the insurance losses of marginal applicants (those


abstaining from a DI application under the now stricter rules) can no longer be ignored. These welfare losses


are captured by the second term on the right-hand-side of the adjusted welfare condition.




Lower DI Benets.                The second key DI policy parameter is the level of DI benets                   b.   It is straightforward


to show (see Appendix A.1) that the condition for a socially optimal DI benet level is



                                              W                            B (b)        v (b)
                                                         0  1 +                                .                                        (6)
                                               (-b)                        M (b)     u (w -  )

Similar to condition (5) above, condition (6) tells us that a reduction in DI benets                     b is welfare-improving if the

scal gains to taxpayers exceeds the insurance loss suered by disabled workers. On the one hand, a lower                                   b

reduces the nancial burden of the DI system because fewer agents apply for DI. In condition (6), this is captured


by the scal multiplier,         1+ B (b)/M (b).    On the other hand, a lower         b reduces the consumption smoothing benet,

because it reduces the consumption possibilities when hit by a disability shock. This is captured by the ratio of


the marginal utility of a DI benet recipient relative to the marginal utility of a taxpayer.


       The behavioral scal eect is          B (b)  - A /b p(A )f (A ) · b               and the mechanical scal eects is          M (b)

       p()dF ().      The ratio of behavioral over mechanical scal eect corresponds to the DI inow elasticity,
                                                                      ´
i.e.    = (DI/b)(b/DI ) = - A /b p(A )f (A )b/                          A
                                                                             p()dF () = B (b)/M (b).        This yields an interesting


analogy of the optimal DI formula to the famous Baily (1978) formula for optimal unemployment insurance



   22 
          is the (discrete) reduction in taxes made possible by the (discrete) increase in strictness of DI eligibility rules, so as to keep
the government DI (+ social welfare) budget balanced.




                                                                      11
(UI). Both in the case of UI and in the case of DI, the condition for the socially optimal benet level can be


written as    1 +  = v (b)/u (w -  ).            In the Baily (1978) model of optimal UI,            is the elasticity of unemployment


duration with respect to the UI benet level; in the above model of optimal DI,                           = ,    the elasticity of the DI


inow with respect to the DI benet level. In other words, the relevant moral-hazard margin in the case of DI


is the program     inow, while the relevant margin in the case of UI is the program outow.23
    So far, we have derived conditions for social optimality for each single DI policy parameter, holding the


other policy parameter xed. A natural question is how a DI reform should optimally combine these two policy


parameters. More precisely: how strongly  and in which direction  should DI eligibility rules                              be changed per


unit change of DI benets           b?    In Appendix A.1 we discuss how the formulas for optimal benets and eligibility


rules are informative for the optimal policy mix.




2.2 The General Model
    The above model highlights the basic trade-os of DI policy reforms but misses two ingredients that are


crucial in designing and evaluating DI reforms: heterogeneity across individuals and intertemporal choices. In


the model of section 2.1, agents dier only in                    and all actions happen within one period. In what follows, we


allow for multiple sources of heterogeneity (such as wages and other factors) and we extend the model to multiple


periods. This latter extension allows us to capture the intertemporal nature of the DI application choice. In the


context of our empirical analysis below  which exploits an RSA increase from                          R   to some higher age       R+       


it is obvious, that the question When should I apply? becomes crucial. To address the DI application timing


in a meaningful way, a dynamic framework is needed.




Agents' Choices and Social Welfare.                          Assume that the agent's time horizon consists of               T   periods, in-


dexed by     t = 0, . . . , T - 1.       Denote by     i,t    the disability shock, by      i,t   a vector of other shocks (such as


wages/productivity and other factors) inuencing the DI application choice, and by                            Ai,t   the level of nancial


assets available at the beginning of period              t.   Once the state vector       Xi,t = (i,t , Ai,t , i,t )   is revealed, agent   i

decides whether to apply for DI, and if rejected, whether to resume work or claim social welfare. The appli-


cation and work decisions are based on knowledge of                    Xi,t   and expectations about future realizations of         Xi,t+s ,

s = t + 1, . . . , T - 1.   Simultaneously with the DI application choice, the agent decides how much to consume


and save in period        t.24   The decisions in period         t   determine   Ai,t+1   and, together with realizations        i,t+1   and


i,t+1 ,   form the state vector         Xt+1 ,   on the basis of which the agent makes her           t+1   choices, and so on.


  23 The   implicit assumption here is that DI generosity does neither aect the intensive margin of labor supply (DI recipients do
not work on the labor market) nor the outow from DI (DI is an absorbing state, no DI spell ever terminates to a regular job or
any other destination).
  24 The   within-period sequence of work and DI-application choices is just like the one of the static model, captured in Figure A.1.
However, the general model also admits the possibility that           A  R ,     so that equation (A.1) is violated.    This might occur for
agents with low wage realization and low DI acceptance probabilities.




                                                                       12

values up until age        R-1      and falls to lower values from age                     R   onward. If the relaxed screening age is increased

      Notice the similarity of the social optimality condition (10) to the social optimality condition (5) of the

                                                            27 A key dierence between the static and the general model is that

                     
an increase in       s    stricter DI eligibility rules at some age                             s    does not only aect the DI inow at that age

                                                                                                                               
s,   but also at other ages. The behavioral scal eect of an increase in                                              s , E [B (s )],   can occur in all periods,


even before age        s,   as forward-looking individuals might change their behavior already at younger ages.                                               The

                                       
mechanical scal eect,            E [M (s )],         persists at older ages because DI is an absorbing state. If many applicants

                                                                                                                                                             
are screened out today, more applicants will reapply tomorrow. As a result, the mechanical eect                                                        E [M (s )]

spreads out over the age window                 [s, T - 1].      In Section 6 we will decompose the estimated scal cost reductions


into its behavioral and mechanical components, and provide direct evidence on the persistence of the mechanical


scal eect.




Discrete versus Marginal Increase in  .                                   As mentioned above, the policy change that allows us to study


the impact of an increase in the strictness of DI eligibility rules is an RSA increase, which is associated with a


discrete (rather than marginal) increase in                      .   In Appendix A.2 we show this leaves the left-hand-side of social


optimality condition unchanged. However, the right-hand-side needs to take into account the insurance losses of


the marginal applicants. In other words, the exact same logic that we discussed in the static framework above,


applies to the general model.




Lower DI Benets.                 Alternatively, the DI reform may implement lower DI benets. So, let us consider the


welfare eects of a reduction in the DI benet                              bs    (while leaving DI benets unchanged at all other ages). In

model. Our empirical implementation of the scal multiplier is robust to non-marginal changes. Kleven (forthcoming) discusses
the issues when studying discrete rather than marginal changes in benet levels.

     27 The   optimal DI formulas (10) and (11) let us calculate the welfare gains of DI reforms in a broad set of stochastic dynamic
environments, such as investments in health or human capital (that might accommodate the disability and productivity shocks),
borrowing constraints, spousal labor supply, home production, etc. In this respect, the analysis of optimal DI is analogous to the
analysis of optimal UI studied in Chetty (2006a).

where     E [B (bs )]   and   E [M (bs )]   are the behavioral and mechanical scal eects of a marginal reduction of                 bs .

Again, this looks very similar to the static model. Just like before, behavioral responses to a reduction of                        bs

occur in all periods. Mechanical responses occur at age                 s    only (because we consider lower benets paid out at


age   s   but unchanged benets at all other ages).




3 Institutional Background and Data
3.1 Institutional Background
      Like in many developed countries, Austria has three transfer programs that provide income replacement


for economic or health reasons: disability insurance (DI), sickness insurance (SI), and unemployment insurance


(UI). The DI program is nanced by a payroll tax on earned income and provides partial earnings replacement


to workers below the full retirement age with at least 5 insurance years within the last 10 years.
                                                                                                                       28 DI applicants

must submit their application to the local DI oce. Employees at the DI oce rst check whether the applicant


meets the formal requirements for DI receipt. Importantly, and dierent from the U.S, DI applicants are not


required to stop working. Then a team of disability examiners and physicians assesses the severity of the medical


impairment and the applicant's residual earnings capacity. An impairment is considered to be severe if it lasts


at least six months and limits the applicant's mental or physical ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.




DI Eligibility Rules.              The assessment of the applicant's residual earnings capacity depends on work experi-


ence and whether his or her age is below or above a              relaxed screening age (RSA) threshold, currently set at age
60. Applicants below the RSA are awarded DI benets if the earnings capacity has been reduced to less 50%


of the earnings capacity of a healthy person in             any reasonable           occupation the individual could be expected to


carry out.
              29 Applicants above the RSA (who have worked for at least 10 years within the last 15 years) need

to have an earnings capacity of less than 50% in a              similar      occupation.
                                                                                           30 The RSA was 57 until the end of 2012

and was increased in three one-year steps to age 60 by 2017. We exploit the variation in the RSA to identify


  28 Insurance     years include both contribution years (periods of employment, including sick leave and maternity leave) and non-
contribution years (periods of unemployment, military service, or secondary education). The required insurance years increase by
one month for every two months above age 50 up to a maximum of 15 insurance years.The insurance years requirement does not
apply if the disability is job-related; for each occupation there exists an explicit list of qualifying impairments.
  29 Eligibility   standards are less strict for semi-skilled and skilled applicants below the RSA threshold, whose set of reasonable
occupations is more limited. To be classied as semi-skilled or skilled, an applicant must have worked in a semi-skilled or skilled
occupation for 7.5 years or more in the most recent 15 years.
  30 Access   to disability insurance is also relaxed in other countries at older ages, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Sweden
until 1997 (Karlström et al., 2008), and the United States (Chen and van der Klaauw, 2008).




                                                                       15
the labor market eects of stricter DI eligibility rules (section 4). Once benets are awarded, DI beneciaries


receive monthly payments until their return to work, medical recovery or death. DI benets can be granted for


a temporary period, but less than 4 percent of claimants ever leave the DI rolls.




DI Benets.         DI benets are subject to income and payroll taxation and replace approximately 70 percent of


pre-disability net earnings up to a maximum of about          e4,500   per month. The level of DI benets is calculated


by multiplying a pension coecient, which varies by age and insurance years, with an assessment basis, which


is the average indexed capped earnings over a given period of time (e.g., the best 16 years in 2004 at the


beginning of our study period). Younger applicants with limited work experience qualify for a special increment


to supplement their benets.         DI beneciaries may continue work, but those earning more than an exempt


threshold lose up to 50 percent of their benets.
                                                        31 A pension reform in 2004 gradually decreased the benet

levels for most workers, providing exogenous variation we use to identify the labor market eects of changes in


benet levels (section 5).




SI and UI Benets.            In case of a temporary illness, employers continue to pay 100% of earnings for up to


12 weeks. Once the right to full benets paid by the employer has expired, individuals may claim SI benets


which are taxed and replace approximately 65% of the last net wage up to the same maximum that applies to


DI benets. SI benet duration is 52 (26) weeks for individuals who have worked at least (less than) 6 months


in the previous 12 months.        UI benets replace 55 percent of the previous wage subject to a minimum and


maximum.       The maximum UI benet duration 39 weeks of regular UI benets for workers below 50 and 52


weeks for workers above 50 (provided they have paid UI contributions for at least 9 years in the last 15 years).


Job losers who exhaust the regular UI benets can apply for unemployment assistance.                    These means-tested


transfers last for an indenite period and are about 70 percent of regular UI benets.




3.2 Data
   We merge data from two administrative registers.             First, the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD)


contains detailed longitudinal information for the universe of workers in Austria between 1972 and 2018. The


ASSD records all employment, unemployment, disability, sick leave, and retirement spells as well as a limited set


of background characteristics (gender, month and year of birth, blue- or white-collar status). Spells before 1972


are available for individuals who have claimed a public pension by the end of 2008. The ASSD also contains


some rm-specic information: geographic region, industry aliation, and rm identiers that allow us to link


both individuals and rms.         See Zweimüller et al. (2009) for a detailed description of the data.           Second, we



  31 Ruh   and Staubli, 2019 show that this policy induces DI beneciaries to keep their earnings below the exempt threshold in
order to retain benets.




                                                              16
use data on all DI applications, which cover the period 2004 to 2017 and contain detailed information on the


date of the application, the date of the decision, the decision itself (i.e. reject or accept), the reported medical


impairment of the applicant, and the stage of the application (i.e. rst application, re-application, or appeal).


    Starting from the population data set, we impose three restrictions. First, we exclude women because their


eligibility age for an old age pension gradually increased from age 56 to age 60 during our observation window,


making it dicult to disentangle the eect of DI reforms from the eect of increasing the retirement age.
                                                                                                                                      32

Second, we exclude self-employed and civil service workers, because they are covered by a dierent pension


system than private-sector workers.         Third, we exclude observations in which individuals are over age 62, at


which point many become eligible for an old age pension. Our sample covers more than three quarters of all


active labor market participants in Austria. Since we observe complete work histories, we can precisely calculate


how much DI benets individuals would get at any point in time and whether individuals have sucient work


experience to apply for DI benets under the relaxed eligibility criteria above the RSA.


    Table B.1 in Appendix B shows summary statistics for the sample we use to study the eects of stricter


DI eligibility rules. To capture changes in labor market behavior around the RSA, we limit the sample to men


between age 54 and age 62 with at least 10 employment years in the past 15 years (measured at age 56). These


men are considered eligible for relaxed DI eligibility, while men with less than 10 employment years in the past


15 years are considered ineligible.
                                        33 We will use the sample of ineligibles for placebo tests. Since our empirical

strategy exploits increases in the RSA from 57 to 58 and from 58 to 59, we distinguish between three cohorts


of men: RSA 57, RSA 58, and RSA 59 who qualify for relaxed DI eligibility at age 57, age 58, and age 59,


respectively. We observe individuals on a quarterly basis.


    Our rst set of outcome variables focus on DI application behavior.                     DI application ever       is an indicator


for whether an individual has ever applied for DI benets.                DI application yearly       is an indicator for whether


an individual has applied for DI benets at a particular age.               We also distinguish yearly applications by the


underlying health impairment (mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and other disorders) and whether


the applications is a re-application, meaning that the applicant has applied for DI before. Our second set of


outcome variables focus on labor market outcomes.            DI benet receip t is an indicator for whether an individual
is receiving DI benets,      employment    is indicator for whether an individual is employed, and              other benet receipt
is an indicator for whether the individual is receiving UI or SI benets.
                                                                                        34 In the empirical analysis, we also

calculate the benet and earnings streams associated with each labor market status, allowing us to study the

  32 Staubli and Zweimüller (2013) show that this increase had sizeable employment      and unemployment eects.
  33 Note that only individuals who worked in a similar occupation for 10 of the last   15 years are eligible for relaxed DI eligibility,
while our denition is based on whether somebody has worked in       any occupation   for 10 years of the last 15 years because we can
only observe industry aliation and not occupation. This implies that the eligible sample will include some individuals who are
in fact not eligible for relaxed screening, but this number is likely small because what constitutes a similar occupation is dened
broadly.
  34 DI    spells are back-dated in the ASSD to the date the claim was led, so an individual who applied for DI benets late in
the calendar year and was awarded benets in the next calendar year is observed to claim benets in the calendar year when the
application was led.




                                                               17
scal eects of stricter DI eligibility rules.


   Table B.2 in Appendix B shows summary statistics for the sample, we use to study the eects of changes


in DI benet levels. Following Mullen and Staubli (2016), we dene a reference date, January 1, and obtain


all information to compute potential DI benets and other relevant individuals characteristics as of this date


for each year an individual is not receiving DI benets. We estimate the eects separately for the age groups


30-56 and 57-60, which is also the age group of interest when studying the eects of stricter DI eligibility rules.


Our main outcome variables of interest are indicators for whether, within a year, individuals apply for DI (                DI
application ), are awarded DI benets (DI inow ), exit employment (employment outow ), or stop receiving UI
or SI benets (      other benet outo w).


4 The Eect of Tighter DI Eligibility Rules
4.1 The 2013 DI Reform
   In April 2012, the Austrian government announced the 2. Stability Act (2. Stabilitätsgesetz), which became


eective on January 1, 2013. The Act had two objectives: reduce expenditures in the public pension systems


and foster employment among older workers. The only change to the DI program was a stepwise increase in the


RSA threshold from age 57 to age 60. Up until December 2012 the RSA was age 57. The RSA was increased


to age 58 in January 2013, followed by further increases to age 59 in January 2015 and age 60 in January 2017.


Individuals who had not worked in a similar occupation for 10 years in the last 15 years were not aected by


the increases as they were not eligible for relaxed DI eligiblity rules. We focus on the increases in the RSA to


58 and 59, because the available data preclude the analysis of the increase in the RSA to 60.


   The RSA increases create variation in the tightness of DI eligibility rules at certain ages across birth cohorts.


For example, the RSA is 58 for men who turn 57 between December 2012 and November 2013 (those born


after November 1955 and before December 1956).
                                                          35 We label this birth cohort the RSA-58 cohort. Conversely,

the RSA is 57 for men born before December 1955 and we label this cohort the RSA-57 cohort. Men in the


RSA-58 cohort, compared to men in the RSA-57 cohort, face stricter disability screening at age 57. The RSA


is 59 for men born after November 1956 and we label this cohort the RSA-59 cohort.                       Men in the RSA-59


cohort, compared to men in the RSA-57 cohort, face stricter DI eligibility rules at ages 57 and 58. Figure B.5


in Appendix B illustrates the step-wise increase graphically.


   Figure B.6 in Appendix B provides descriptive evidence on the labor market eects of the RSA increases.


Trends in labor market outcomes across birth cohorts are remarkably similar until age 57  the relaxed screening


age for the RSA-57 cohort. At this age, the DI recipient rate rises sharply in the RSA-57 cohort. The percent

  35 Applications   are assessed using the rules in the month after ling.   Therefore, if someone turns 57 in December 2012 and
applies to DI his application is evaluated in January 2013, when the new RSA of 58 applies.




                                                               18
of DI applicants also increases, suggesting that individuals are aware of the RSA and time their DI application


to this age. Conversely, the percent of men who are employed or receive other benets drops at age 57, pointing


to the role of DI as a substitute for UI or SI. We observe similar breaks in trends when the RSA-58 and RSA-


59 cohorts reach their RSA. Interestingly, cohorts with a higher RSA never catch up to cohorts with a lower


RSA. To capture these persistence (and also potential anticipation) eects, our empirical strategy is designed


to identify the entire age prole of the RSA increase.




4.2 Estimation Strategy
   We exploit the exogenous variation in the RSA threshold across birth cohorts in a dierence-in-dierences


design. Control (= older) birth cohorts are eligible to the more lenient DI eligibility rules already at age 57


(RSA=57), while treated (= younger) birth cohorts are eligible only at age 58 or age 59 (RSA=58 or 59) . Thus,


we can identify the eect of stricter DI eligibility rules by comparing the age proles of younger and older birth


cohorts. This comparison can be implemented by estimating regressions of the following type:



                                                                              61
                                    yict =  + a +  c + t +                              k I [age = k ] + Xict  + ict ,                          (12)
                                                                           k=54\56

where   i   denotes individual,           c   denotes birth cohort, and             t   denotes year-quarter;   yict   is the outcome variable of


interest (such as an indicator for receiving DI benets),                       a        are dummies for age in years to control for age-specic


levels in the outcome variable,               c are dummies for year-month of birth to capture time-constant dierences across

birth cohorts,      t   are dummies for year and quarter to capture common time shocks and seasonal eects, and


Xict   represent individual or region specic characteristics to control for any observable dierences that might


confound the analysis.
                               36 We cluster standard errors at the year-month of birth.

   The key variables of interest are the indicators                         I [age = k ],     which are equal to one if an individual's age is


equal to     k,   where   k   runs from        54   to   61   using   k = 56       as the reference age. Each      k -coecient          measures the


average causal eect of an RSA increase at age                         k.   To obtain the average eect of an RSA increase over a wider

                                                                                                                          61
age interval, we can simply take the average of dierent                            k -coecients.      For example,        k=57   k /5   measures the


average change in the outcome variable at each age in the age interval 57 to 61.


   We estimate the eects of the RSA-58 and RSA-59 change separately, using always the RSA-57 cohort as


the control group. This way we can directly compare the eects of a one-year and a two-year RSA increase.


Another reason to estimate the eects separately is that, compared to the RSA-58 cohort, men in the RSA-59


cohort have more time to adjust to the reform. They just turned 55 years old when the reform was announced,


while men in the RSA-58 cohort were almost 57 years old. Having more time to adjust increases the scope for


  36 The    xed eects     a , c ,   and   t   are not collinear, because each age-in-year and year-quarter cell contains cohorts with dierent
year-month of birth.




                                                                               19
anticipation eect: changes in behavior even before age 57.


    The identication assumption is that, absent the increase in the RSA, the change in                     yict   at a certain age


would have been comparable between treated birth cohorts (RSA=58 or 59) and control cohorts (RSA=57).


A potential concern is that age-specic trends in the outcome variable could change across birth cohorts for


reasons unrelated to the RSA increases. The estimated                k -coecients     for   k < 57   provide placebo checks for


spurious trends.     They should not be statistically signicant if the identication assumption holds, although


they could also pick up anticipation eects. As an additional placebo check, we estimate equation (12) for men


who never become eligible for to the lenient DI eligibility rules because they have worked less than 10 years in


the past 15 years. They should not respond to the changes in the RSA.




4.3 Empirical Results
    Figure 2 shows the estimated       k -coecients from equation (12) for the RSA-58 and the RSA-59 increases for

four key outcomes: DI benet receipt, DI application ever, employment, and other benets. The shaded area


denotes the 95 percent condence interval. In all graphs, we see that the estimates before age 57, the pre-reform


RSA, are close to zero and statistically insignicant, providing evidence that the estimates are not confounded


by dierential trends across birth cohorts.


    As panel (a) shows, because of the RSA increases, fewer men receive DI benets between ages 57 and age


61. DI recipiency rates drop by about 4 percentage points at age 57. For the RSA-58 cohort, DI recipiency


rate remains lower after age 57, even though DI eligibility rules have become more lenient.                       For the RSA-59


cohort, the DI recipiency rate declines further at age 58 and is still lower at age 59 when this cohort qualies


for relaxed DI eligibility rules.      If applying for DI imposes utility costs, we would expect that fewer people


apply when eligibility criteria are strict. Indeed, panel (b) shows that DI application rates for the RSA-58 and


RSA-59 cohorts drop at all ages above 56.
                                                  37 Panels (c) and (d) show that stricter DI eligibility rules increase

employment and other benet receipt above age 56.
                                                             38 The expansion in employment persists until the last age

we can observe in the data, and is about twice as large for the RSA-59 cohort compared to the RSA-58 cohort.


While the rise in other benet receipt is temporary for the RSA-58 cohort, it persists up to the last age for the


RSA-59 cohort.


    It is interesting to look at the timing and dynamics of the estimates in Figure 2. First, we nd no evidence


for anticipation eects, which is less surprising for the RSA-58 cohort, because they learned about the reform



  37 Appendix   Figure B.11 decomposes DI application ever by impairment type.        It shows that fewer individuals apply with
musculoskeletal and other impairments, but the same number of individuals apply with mental impairments.
  38 Appendix   Figure B.12 shows that the expansion in employment is primarily driven by individuals who are already employed
and who stay employed longer, rather than by individuals who are on other bene receipt and who start working when the RSA
increases. Similarly, Appendix Figure B.13 shows that the increase in other benet receipt is primarily driven by individuals who are
already reciving other benets and now receive other benets longer until they reach the new RSA, at which point many transition
to the DI program.

just a couple months before turning 57. The RSA-59 cohort knew about the reform two years before turning


57 and had time to adjust, but all estimates before age 57 are close to zero and insignicant. Second, the DI


application rate falls at age 57, implying that individuals are aware of the RSA and adjust their behavior. If the


estimated eects were purely mechanical, applications at age 57 should not react. Third, the estimated eects


are highly persistent and show up at ages beyond the RSA. This is consistent with persistent mechanical eects


as discussed in section 2.2 above. The strength of mechanical and behavioral eects is of crucial importance as


their relative size determines the eect of tightening DI eligibility rules on social welfare. We discuss welfare


eects in Section 6, where we propose an empirical strategy to directly estimate the mechanical eect, allowing


us to split up the total eect of the interesting outcomes into its behavioral and mechanical component.


    In Figure B.7 in Appendix B, we plot the estimated              k -coecients      from equation (12) for men with too


little work experience to be eligible for the lenient DI eligibility rules. For this placebo groups, we nd that


DI benet receipt, DI application ever, employment and other benet receipt do not dier signicantly across


birth cohorts, even after age 56. This provides strong support that our main estimates are not confounded by


dierential trends across birth cohorts.


    A useful way to summarize the eects of tighter DI eligibility rules is by taking the average of the                     k -

coecients after age 56 (since point estimates are insignicant before age 57).                  We report these estimates in


Table 1, distinguishing between men who are and those who are not eligible for relaxed DI eligibility rules. The


estimates capture the average eect between age 57 and age 61 for the RSA-58 increase and between age 57 and


age 60 for the RSA-59 increase.
                                     39 The exception are DI application ever, which we observe for one year less.

    Concerning the labor market eects (Panel A), we nd that the share of men in the RSA-58 cohort receiving


DI benets declines by 2.54 percentage points, or about 14 percent relative to the mean above the RSA. Men in


the RSA-58 cohort are also less likely to apply for DI, but the decline is only half as large as the decline in DI


benet receipt. Most men who do not qualify for DI anymore continue to work: the average employment rate


increases by 1.85 percentage points. But benet substitution is also important: other benet receipt increases


by 0.94 percentage points. The labor market eects for the RSA-59 cohort are qualitatively similar but about


twice as large compared to the RSA-58 cohort. On the other hand, men not eligible to the RSA (the placebo


group) barely change their labor market behavior. The DI recipiency rate declines for non-eligible men in the


RSA-59 cohort, but the reduction is about ve times smaller relative to eligible men and likely reects that


some non-eligible men qualify for relaxed DI eligibility as they get older.


    Panel B reports the scal eect of the RSA increases, which are crucial for assessing the welfare eects of


stricter DI eligibility rules. We focus on four outcomes: DI benets, tax revenue, other benets, and the total

  39 While   the eects are still visible at age 61 for RSA 58 and age 60 for RSA 59, these eects should disappear at age 62 when
most men in Austria retire (see Figure B.8 in the Appendix). We can estimate the eect of RSA 58 and RSA 59 up to age 62
if we assume that the RSA increases have the same eect until age 62 as at the last age, we currently observe in the data. This
assumption is reasonable because the eects stabilize after age 58 as Figure 2 shows. Appendix Table B.3 shows the corresponding
average eects up to age 62. They are statistically indistinguishable from the estimates in Table 1.

Notes: The table reports the average eect of the RSA for the ages above age 56. The estimates are constructed by taking the average of
the k -coecients from equation (12) for k  57. The eligible -sample comprises men who, at age 56, have worked for at least 10 years in
the last 15 years. The non-eligible -sample comprises men who, at age 56, have worked less than 10 years in the last 15 years. Mean denotes
the mean above the RSA for the RSA-57 cohort. Fiscal eects are reported in 2018 Euro. Standard errors clustered at the year-month of
birth level are reported in parentheses. Levels of signicance: 1%, 5%, and        1%.


scal eect, which is the sum of benets received minus taxes paid. We calculate the outcomes on an individual


basis, multiplying at each age the number of days an individual spends in a given labor market state times the


daily benet received or taxes paid in that state. We then estimate equation (12) for each outcome separately


and average the      k -coecients      above age 56. Appendix Figure B.14 plots the estimated                   k -coecients.       They


are close to zero and statistically insignicant before age 57 and statistically dierent from zero after age 56.


    Tighter DI eligibility rules (RSA=58 or 59) lessen spending on DI benets and raise tax revenues from


increased work activity, but they also raise spending on other benets because of benet substitution.                                   The


reduction in DI benets in the RSA-58 cohort is 884 Euro per individual and year, which in absolute value is


about three times larger than the increase in tax revenue (263 euro) and ve times larger than the increase in


other benets (172 euro). Overall, total scal costs at each age above 56 declines by 976 Euro per individual


and year.     The estimates for eligible men in the RSA-59 cohort are about twice as large compared to the


RSA-58 cohort. The estimates for men who are not eligible for an RSA (placebo group) are small and mostly


insignicant.

5 Impact of Benet Generosity
    The ideal experiment to analyze the impact of a change DI benets would be to randomize the level of DI


benets across individuals. We emulate this ideal experiment with a quasi-experimental research design that


exploits variation in DI benets from a large pension reform. Our approach follows Mullen and Staubli (2016)


who estimate the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benet generosity using variation in DI benets in


Austria from several reforms between 1987 and 2010. We dier from their study in two aspects. First, we update


their estimates for a more recent time period (2004 to 2017). This period is characterized by lower replacement


rates and stricter disability screening compared to the 1980s and 1990s, which could aect the responsiveness


of DI claiming and applications to benet levels. Second, we study the eect of benet generosity on a novel


set of outcomes, including employment, other benet receipt, and scal costs, which are key for assessing the


welfare eects of a change in benet generosity.




5.1 The 2003 Pension Reform
    In January 2004, the Austrian government implemented several changes to the calculation of DI benets


as part of a larger reform (Pensionsreform 2003). These changes reduced the potential benet level for most


individuals, although individuals with limited work history experienced an increase in the potential benet


level. Before the reform, they would qualify for a special supplement to their benets if they were below age


56. The reform gradually increased the age limit for the special supplement to age 60 between 2004 and 2010.


Over the same time, the reform phased in a reduction in the pension coecient and an increase in the penalty


for claiming benets before the normal retirement age (age 65 for men and age 60 for women).
                                                                                                               40 The reform

also gradually increased the length of the assessment basis from 16 years to 40 years by 2028. The large scale


reduction in benets was heavily criticized by the public. In response to the backlash, the Austrian government


passed legislation in 2005, limiting the maximum benet reduction to ve percent of the projected pre-reform


benets. The maximum benet reduction was then increased by 0.25 percent each year; in 2017 it was equal to


8.25 percent of pre-reform benets.


    Figure B.9 in Appendix B illustrates the eect of the reform by showing the distribution of changes in


potential DI benets between 2004 and 2017.              We plot separate gures for men ages 30 to 56 and men ages


57 to 60, which is the age group we focus on when studying stricter eligibility criteria. The reform produced


potential winners and losers. About 90 percent of 57-60 year old men experienced a loss in potential DI benets


of up to 10 percent. The remaining 10 percent gained from the increase in age limit for the special increment


  40 Before   the reform each insurance year increased the pension coecient by 2 percentage points, while each year of claiming
before the normal retirement age reduced the pension coecient by 3 percentage points (capped at a maximum of 10.5 percentage
points or 15 percent of the pre-penalty pension coecient, whichever is lower). The reform gradually reduced the pension coecient
adjustment for each insurance year from 2 to 1.78 percentage points between 2004 and 2009 and changed the penalty for each year
of early claiming to 4.2 percent of the pension coecient (capped at 15 percent of the full pension).




                                                               24
and experienced a rise in potential DI benets. The share of losers and winners are similar among 30-56 year


old men, although the losses are more unevenly distributed. About 40 percent experienced a loss in potential


DI benets of at least 5 percent, while 20 percent experienced almost no loss.




5.2 Estimation Strategy
      We exploit the variation in DI benet levels stemming from the 2003 pension reform to estimate the causal


impact of changes in benet levels on labor market and scal outcomes. We are interested in estimating the


following regression:




                                                      yit =  + Xit  + bit (Zit ) + t + it ,                                                             (13)



      where     i   denotes individual,        t   denotes year,    yit   is the outcome variable of interest such as applying for DI,


Xit      is a vector of demographic and labor market characteristics,                           bt (Zit )   are log potential DI benets which are


a function of labor market characteristics                 Zit  Xit        (age, insurance years, and the assessment basis),                    t   are year


xed eects, and           it   are any unobserved factors aecting the outcome such as taste for work. The parameter of


interest is      ,   which measures the average eect of a change in benet levels on the outcome variable.


      As Mullen and Staubli (2016) discuss, if                 b   is a linear function of          Zit ,   we cannot separately identify              and   

because no variation is left in            b   after controlling for          Zit .   If      is a non-linear function of     Zit ,   we can identify        

as long as sucient residual variation is left in                     b    after controlling for        Zit .41     A drawback of this identication


strategy is that it relies heavily on functional form, creating bias in                               if the direct eect     Zit   of   yit   is incorrectly


specied (Bound, 1989). This problem can be solved by exploiting the 2003 reform, because it creates variation


in   b   that is independent from          Zit .     Intuitively, with the policy reform we observe individuals with similar                              Zit

but dierent potential benets                b.     This approach is akin to a dierence-in-dierences estimation strategy, where


identication is obtained by relating individuals' dierential response to their dierential change in benet levels


stemming from the policy reform.


      Mullen and Staubli (2016) show that the policy-induced variation in                                      b   can be isolated by including the


individual-specic (log) hypothetical benets under each policy regime as additional controls in equation (13).
                                                                                                                                                             42

Because of the phased-in nature of the 2003 policy reform, we have 14 dierent hypothetical benets for each


year from 2004 to 2017:




     41 For   example, if we control for   Zit     in a very exible way by including polynomials or other transformations of                  Zit ,   may not
be identied because potential benets are collinear with               Zit .
     42 This   approach has also been used by Fevang et al. (2017) to estimate the eect of temporary disability insurance benets on
the duration of temporary disability insurance spells using policy variation in Norway and by Nielsen et al. (2010) to estimate the
response of college enrollment to changes in student aid using a Danish reform.

                                                                 2017

where   br (Zit )   denotes hypothetical DI benets under the policy regime           r.   By controlling for hypothetical DI


benets, we ensure that actual potential benets are uncorrelated with any unobservable factors aecting the


outcome variable, so that        identies the causal eect of DI benets. We assess the quality of our prediction of


hypothetical DI benets under dierent policy regimes by comparing predicted DI benets to actual DI benets


for the subsample of beneciaries who received benets in 2004 or who began receiving benets after 2004.


Appendix Figure B.15 plots mean matched DI benets against mean predicted DI benets.                          Actual benets


track our predicted benets very closely. We cluster standard errors at the year-month of birth.


   The identication assumption necessary for consistency of our estimates is the standard common trends


assumption, which in this case requires that absent the 2003 reform the outcome variable would have evolved


similarly across groups with dierential change in benet levels. To test the appropriateness of our identication


strategy, we estimate 1,000 placebo regressions in which we randomly assign individuals within each cell dened


by year, insurance-year decile, and assessment decile potential benets               br (Zit )   from a dierent year.   If our


empirical strategy isolates the policy-induced variation in DI benets, then we expect the placebo estimates to


be clustered around zero.




5.3 Empirical Results
   Table 2 summarizes our main results with Panel A providing estimates of equation (14) for labor market


outcomes and Panel B providing analogous estimates for scal outcomes, which serve as inputs for the scal


multiplier. We nd that a point percent increase in DI benets increase the propensity to apply for DI benets


by 0.171 percentage points for the age group 57-60 and by 0.014 percentage points for the age group 30-56.


These estimates correspond to a 0.64 percent and 0.84 percent increase in the application level. We also observe


DI inow increases by 0.093 percentage points for the age group 57-60 and by 0.003 percentage points for the


age group 30-56.       Taken together, these estimates imply an award rate of 54 percent (=0.093/0.171) for the


marginal applicant in the age group 57-60, and a lower award rate of 21 percent for a marginal applicant in the


age group 30-56. The higher award rate for 57-60 year old individuals highlights the signicant relaxation in


eligibility criteria above the RSA. An increase in benet levels has no eect on employment but signicantly


increases outow from other benets, suggesting that marginal enrollees were receiving other benets before


being awarded DI benets.


   Concerning the scal eects, we observe that one percent increase in DI benets expands spending on DI


benets and lowers tax revenue, but also lessens spending on other benets because of benet substitution. The


increase in annual DI spending for a one percent increase in benets amounts to 36.95 Euro for a 57-60 year

old individual and to 2.26 Euro for a 30-56 year old individual. About half of the additional DI spending is


compensated with lower spending on other benets, while the loss in tax revenue is quantitatively small. Overall,


we nd that the behavioral responses to a one percent increase in DI benets raise annual scal spending by


18.69 Euro per 57-60 year individual and by 1.18 Euro per 30-56 year old individual.

lative distribution of the 1,000 placebo estimates together with the true estimate for each outcome in Panel A


of Table 2. The gures conrm that true increases in benet generosity lead to unusually large increases in DI


inow, DI applications, and other benet outow (but have no eect on employment outow). In contrast, the


placebo increases in benet generosity lead to estimates that are close to zero.




6 Estimating the Fiscal Multiplier of DI Reforms
    The main purpose of this section is to estimate scal multipliers of DI policy reforms. There are two main


reasons why this is of primary interest. First, scal multipliers provide us with an important benchmark for


welfare analysis: A DI reform generating a scal multiplier of, say, 2 is welfare enhancing, if taking away one


dollar from DI recipients yields an insurance loss of less than two dollars, or, put dierently, if one dollar in the




                                                                    27
hands of a marginal DI recipient has a lower social value as two dollars in the hands of the government.
                                                                                                                                  43 Fiscal

multipliers of stricter DI eligibility rules and lower DI benets provide us with estimates of the left-hand-side


of the social optimality conditions (10) and (11).             Because we cannot estimate the right-hand-side of these


conditions  due to lack of data on the dynamics of consumption, assets and health  we can only provide


speculative estimates for the involved insurance losses.
                                                                 44 The second reason for the crucial importance of scal

multipliers is that they allow us to compare the eectiveness of alternative DI policy instruments. For instance,


if stricter DI eligibility rules generate a scal multiplier substantially larger than the multiplier of reducing DI


benets, then a DI reform aecting the same group of agents should implement stricter DI eligibility rules.


    In what follows, we rst estimate the scal multiplier generated by the Austrian DI reforms, separately for


tightening DI eligibility rules and reducing DI benets. We then compare the eectiveness of the two DI policy


instruments, taking account of who is mainly aected by them. We also provide a tentative assessment of the


welfare eects of DI policies in the US, using previous empirical estimates of the impact on the DI inow of


(age discontinuities in) the DI eligibility criteria and of DI benet changes.




6.1 The Fiscal Multiplier of Stricter DI Eligibility Rules
    In the notation of our theoretical model, an increase in the RSA from age                    R   to age     R+1       corresponds to


stricter DI eligibility rules during the age window
                                                                                                                   
                                                          [R, R + 1], which leads to total scal cost savings E [ G(R )].45

In Section 4 we have explored the eects of increasing the RSA and came up with an estimate of total scal cost


savings. However, this does not yet allow us to put a number on the scal multiplier. To be able to do that,

                                                                                                                                       
we need to decompose the total scal cost savings into its behavioral and mechanical components,                                   E[B (R )]
           
and   E[M (R )].    This decomposition poses a challenge to the researcher, because these two quantities cannot be


directly estimated from the data. The problem is that we cannot directly observe who is a marginal applicant


and who is an always applicant. However, this information is essential since the behavioral eect is driven by


marginal applicants and the mechanical eect is driven by always applicants.


    To make progress, we proceed in two steps.              First, we characterize marginal and always applicants using


the complier analysis method for dierence-in-dierences settings (Imbens and Rubin, 1997; Abadie, 2003;


De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille, 2018; Jäger et al., 2019).                 The complier analysis shows that marginal


and always applicants are dierent on a number of characteristics. Hence, decomposing the total scal eects

  43 Taking    away one dollar from DI recipients here means taking     mechanically   away one dollar, i.e. not taking into account
possible behavioral responses. This corresponds to the thought experiment underlying the optimal DI policy formulas (10) and (11)
which are normalized by mechanically saved dollars.
  44 For   instance, insurance losses can be calculated, if one is willing assume that DI recipients (i) are hand-to-mouth consumers
and (ii) have identical CRRA preferences. Such a procedure is often implemented when data for a direct estimation of insurance
losses are not available. In Appendix D we show that, under those assumptions, we can calculate upper and lower bounds of the
insurance losses resulting from stricter DI eligibility rules. We also show that insurance losses from reduced DI benet generosity
can be calculated in a straightforward way. Notice that the assumption of hand-to-mouth consumers assumes away self-insurance.
Hence, these tentative estimates should be considered an upper bound of the true insurance losses.
  45 In   the above empirical analysis, we studied the increase in the RSA from age    57   to both age   58   and age   59.   Of course, the
exact same logic applies if the RSA is increased by two years rather than only one year.




                                                                 28
into its mechanical and behavioral component based on the average DI applicant (a mix of marginal- and


always-applicants) is misleading.
                                        46 In a second step, we therefore propose an empirical strategy estimating the

mechanical scal eect based on a group that is arguably similar to always applicants in the whole population.


We argue  and provide supporting evidence  that the subpopulation of previously rejected DI applicants

                                                                                                                            
provides such a group. The mechanical scal eect in the whole population can then be calculated as                      E[M (R )] =
          
 AA  E[M (R ) |pre-57],        where    AA   is the share of always applicants in the whole population, estimated in

                                                       
the reduced-form/complier analysis; and           E[M (R ) |pre-57]    is the mechanical scal eect of the typical always


applicant, estimated from the subsample of previously rejected (pre-57) DI applicants. With an estimate of

                                        
the mechanical scal eect,          E[M (R )],   the behavioral scal eect is then just the residual of total scal costs

                                                                               
savings and the mechanical scal eect,            E[B (R )] = E [ G(R )] - E[M (R )].


Always- versus Marginal Applicants: A Complier Analysis.                            Using the complier-analysis method for


dierence-in-dierences settings, we compare the characteristics of DI applicants when DI eligibility rules are


lenient to the characteristics of DI applicants when rules are strict.              Any dierences in these characteristics


uncover how marginal applicants (who apply only under lenient rules) dier from always applicants (who apply


even when rules are strict), and also from those of never applicants. The exact same contrast as for DI applicants


can also be done for DI enrollees (those DI applicants whose application gets eventually accepted).
                                                                                                                           47

     Table 3 shows the population shares and average characteristics of marginal applicants and enrollees, always


applicants and enrollees, and never applicants and enrollees for the RSA-58 change.                         We estimate a share


always applicants        AA = 0.070    (among individuals aged 57). The shares of marginal and never applicants are


 M A = 0.014      and    N A = 0.916.    Marginal applicants are less likely to be on sick leave at age 56 than always


applicants. This is important in the present context because being on sick leave is a good proxy for underlying


health problems. Marginal and always applicants have similar average earnings in the best 15 years, though at


age 56 the labor market attachment of marginal applicants is stronger than the one of always applicants: 73


% of marginal applicants are employed at age 56, compared to 60 % of always applicants and 87 % of never


applicants. Marginal applicants are more likely to be blue-collar workers and are more likely to apply with a


musculoskeletal impairment, consistent with low-skilled/manual workers experiencing the largest relaxation in


disability eligibility when reaching the RSA. Table 3 also reports the same contrast as for DI                       applicants      for


DI   enrollees   (accepted DI applicants) and shows similar patterns. The only major dierence occurs at age 56


when marginal enrollees are less likely to be employed. This highlights that relaxed DI eligibility increases the



  46 Notice   that the complication does not arise in the case of lower DI benets, because a benet reduction aects   all   DI recipients.
The mechanical scal eect (= the scal cost reduction with DI application behavior unchanged) can be readily calculated from DI
benet reductions that accrue in the pre-reform control group. In contrast, the mechanical scal eect of tightening DI eligibility
rules is driven only by the subgroup of always applicants: individuals who  despite the stricter rules  do not abstain from applying
to DI.

                                                                                                                                 48



Pre-57 Applicants: Representative for Always Applicants?                            We argue that the mechanical scal eect


can be estimated from the subpopulation of individuals who led a DI application during ages 50-56. In what


follows, we refer to this subpopulation as         pre-57 applicants.49    This raises the question whether pre-57 applicants


 who re-apply at age 57  are indeed representative for the always applicants of the whole population. Notice


rst that pre-57 applicants qualify as always applicants in the sense that they have applied under the strict DI


eligibility rules (which apply to applications below the RSA). Using pre-57 applicants as our study group, we


can perform the exact same evaluation exercise that we performed in Section 4 on the whole population. Just


like the whole population, pre-57 applicants can be divided into a treated group (subject to RSA=58) and a


control group (RSA=57), and the comparison of the two groups is informative on the causal impact of the RSA


increase on pre-57 applicants. Clearly, any eect that emerges at age 57 (or later) can only be identied from


agents who have not yet entered DI before they turned 57, i.e. individuals whose previous DI application got


rejected, and who re-apply at age 57.
                                              50

    The comparison of treated and control groups among pre-57 applicants delivers an unbiased estimate for the


mechanical scal eect for the always applicants in the whole population, if the distribution of health shocks (and


other relevant characteristics) among pre-57 applicants is identical to the distribution of these characteristics


among always-applicants in the whole population. While this identifying assumption is per se fundamentally


untestable, we provide several pieces of evidence consistent with that assumption.


    First, we look at the (re-)application behavior of pre-57 applicants in the treated and control groups: (i)


before age 57, (ii) at age 57, and (iii) after age 57.       Before age 57, the two groups are subject to the same (strict)
DI eligibility rules and we would therefore not expect any (mechanical) dierence among them.
                                                                                                                    51   At age 57, the
treated group is subject to strict eligibility rules (RSA=58), while the control group is already subject to the


lenient rules (RSA=57). However, if the application behavior of pre-57 applicants is indeed representative for a


group of always-applicants, a change in the strictness of DI eligibility rules should                  not   change their application


behavior.     After age 57, however, we expect re-applications to be dierent between treated and control groups.
As discussed in Section 2.2, the mechanical eect persists at older age, because DI is an absorbing state.                              If


many applicants are screened out today, more applicants will reapply tomorrow. As a result, the mechanical


  48 The    analogous results for the RSA-59 change resemble qualitatively the results for the RSA-58 change.            This is shown in
Appendix Table C.5.
  49 Appendix    Table D.6 shows summary statistics for the pre-57 applicant sample.
  50 When the    study group is the whole population (as in Section 4), individuals contributing to the identication of an RSA-eect
at age 57 (or later) are those who did not yet apply for DI; and those who have previously applied but whose application got
rejected. In contrast, the subpopulation of pre-57 applicants, individuals contributing to identication comprise, by construction,
only of previously rejected DI applicants.
  51 In   priniciple, pre-57 applicants in the treated group could change their application behavior   before age 57    anticipating that
their RSA will be larger than the one of the control groups and hence apply more frequently than the control group. If we see such
behavioral eects, this would invalidate our assumption that pre-57 applicants are a study group that consists of always applicants
only.

    Figure 3 plots the coecients of the same di-in-di strategy as in Section 4 among the subpopulation of


pre-57 applicants, with panels (a) and (b) focusing on DI application yearly and DI inow, respectively. The


dierences in DI application yearly and DI inow between treated and control groups line up almost perfectly


with those expected from always applicants, both for treated cohorts with RSA=58 (left gure) and RSA=59


(right gure). Before age 57, there are no dierences between treated and control groups. At age 57  when


DI application yearly of the treated (but not those of controls) are evaluated under strict DI eligibility rules 


there is no (or only a weak) dierences in DI application yearly but a large downward spike in DI inow. This


is exactly what one would expect among always applicants: no dierences in applications but more rejected


applications among the treated. After age 57, we see a signicant increase both in DI application yearly and in


DI inow among the treated cohorts.

    While the DI application behavior of pre-57 applicants is very similar to what one would expect from a


group of always applicants, this does necessarily mean that the mechanical scal eect estimated from the

Notes: The gure compares trends in DI benet receipt (panel a) and the net scal eect (panel b) for applicants at age 57 (always
applicants) and pre-57 applicants. Always applicants are individuals who apply for DI at age 57 in the treatment group under the strict
rules. Pre-57 applicants comprise individuals who applied for DI between age 50 and age 56 and re-apply for DI at age 57. The comparison
shows that the two groups are very similar in outcomes after their application at age 57.


subpopulation of pre-57 is representative for the mechanical scal eect generated by the always applicants in


the whole population. This is because the distribution of characteristics among pre-57 applicants could be very


dierent from the always applicants in the whole population.
                                                                                                                                               53 In Figure 4, panels (a) and (b), we compare, for

treated cohorts (RSA=58 and RSA=59), DI benet receipt and net scal expenditures of (i) age-57 applicants


in the whole population (blue line) to (ii) age-57 re-applicants in the subpopulation of pre-57 applicants (red


line).   After date 0, the application date at age 57 (measured in quarters), DI benet receipt and net scal


expenditures of the two groups are very similar and 3 quarters after the application the two lines are no longer


statistically signicantly dierent from each other. Notice also that, before date 0, the subpopulation of pre-57


applicants looks dierent from the whole population. This should come to no surprise because pre-57 applicants,


  53 For   instance, imagine that rejected pre-57 applicants re-appyling at age 57 have, on average, low incomes, while always appli-
cants in the whole population applying at age 57 have, on average, higher incomes. Then we will estimate a small mechanical scal
eect among the subpopulation of pre-57 applicants, while indeed the true mechanical scal eect  the response of always appli-
cants in the whole population  is large. In that case the inference of the mechanical scal eect estimated from the subpopulation
of pre-57 applicants to the whole population is invalid. The inference would also be invalid if the distribution of health shocks                                                                                              is
dierent between the two populations. For example, it could be that pre-57 applicants are, on average, more healthy than always
applicants in the whole population. This would mean that, while                                                             of each individual is above                              A    (meaning the individuals in both
populations are always-applicants), the distribution of the                                               's   is more skewed to the right among always applicants in the whole
population as compared the distribution of the                                          's   among pre-57 applicants. In that case, the inference is invalid, because based on
the subpopulation of pre-57 applicants we underestimate the DI award probability of always applicants in the whole population.
As a consequence, we underestimate the DI inow and hence the mechanical scal eect.




                                                                                                                 33

for always applicants in the whole population.

Estimating the Fiscal Multiplier.                  We perform the same di-in-di evaluation analysis among pre-57 ap-


plicants that we performed in Section 4 among the whole population. Figure 5 plots the di-in-di estimates by


age for labor market outcomes and the net scal eect. Figure 5 provides empirical evidence on the persistence


of the mechanical eect (as theoretically discussed in Section 2.2). For the RSA-58 cohort, DI benet receipt


signicantly drops at age 57 and then steadily catches up and is at age 59/60 back to the level of the cohort


with lenient DI eligibility at age 57. Interestingly, always applicants have a small employment eect at age 57


that vanishes afterwards, the benet substitution eect is large. This implies that the permanent changes in


employment and disability receipt in the population in Figure 2 must be driven by behavioral changes and are


not due to a persistent mechanical eect. We see similar patterns for the RSA-59 cohort, where the mechanical


eect persists for two years and then starts to disappear, as one would expect.


    We are now ready to decompose the total scal cost savings into its mechanical and behavioral component and


calculate the scal multiplier of tightening DI eligibility rules. Table 4 presents the decomposition of the scal


eect into behavioral and mechanical scal eect. A one year increase in the RSA generates a net scal eect


for always applicants of
                                   
                              E [G(R )|pre-57] = 5, 585 Euro.55            If our identifying assumption is satised, we have

                                             
E [G(R )|pre-57] = E [M (R )|pre-57] = E [M (R )] / AA , where the rst equality says that the total scal eect

of pre-57 applicants is purely mechanical and the second equality says that pre-57 applicants are representative


for always applicants in the whole population.
                                                          56 The mechanical scal eect in the whole population can then

                          
be calculated as    E [M (R )] = 5, 585 Euro  0.070 = 391 Euro where  AA = 0.070 is the share of always applicants

from Table 3.       The behavioral scal eect is calculated as the dierence between the scal cost eect from

                                                         
Table 1 and the mechanical scal eect,              E [B (R )] = 976 - 391 = 585 Euro.        This decomposition implies a scal


multiplier of    2.50.   For the RSA increase from 57 to 59 we nd a multiplier of                2.05   as displayed in Table 4.


    The multiplier has to be compared to the insurance value to assess the welfare eect of the reform. The


insurance value measures the social value of one dollar in the hands of DI applicants who are mechanically


screened out under the stricter DI eligibility rules. Hence, increasing the RSA by one year (two years) is welfare


  54 In   Appendix Figures D.17-D.18 we explore the respresentativeness of pre-57 further.        In Figure D.17 we show that pre-57
applicants award rates and application behavior (at and after age 57) that are very similar the those of all applicants at age 57.
Appendix Figure D.18 shows that pre-57 and applicants at age 57 are also comparable in terms of employment and other benet
receipt after their age-57 application.
  55 Notice that E [G|pre-57] is dened as the net scal savings among pre-57 applicants who       reapply at age 57.   To obtain this eect
we proceed as follows. We rst estimate the net scal eect among all individuals belonging to the subpopulation of pre-57 applicants,
irrespective of whether they led a re-application at age 57.        This yields an estimate of   E [G|pre-57]  P r(re-apply at 57) =
1, 167 Euro. We then need to rescale      by the probability that a pre-57 applicant reapplies at age 57,P (reapply at 57) = 0.209 to
obtain E [G|pre-57] = 5, 585 Euro.

                                                               E M (R     comprises the total (mechanical) cost savings per individual
in the whole population, i.e. unconditional on a DI application, while    E [G|pre-57]   conditions on an application at age 57.

Notes: Table presents estimates of the scal multiplier for stricter eligibility rules and more generous DI benets. The scal multiplier of
stricter eligibility is constructed as follows. The total scal eect is taken from Table 1 (with opposite sign). The mechanical scal eect is
estimated using the sample of pre 57 applicants and then re-scaled by the population share of always applicants (see text for details). The
behavioral scal eect is the total scal eect minus the mechanical scal eect.
The scal multiplier of benet generosity is constructed as follows. The behavioral scal eect is taken from Table 2. The mechanical scal
eect captures a 1%-increase in DI benets for all DI beneciaries in 2004. It is obtained by multiplying the mean DI benets in Table 2
with 0.01. The total scal eect is the sum of the mechanical and behavioral scal eects.


increasing if 1 dollar in the hands of aected DI recipients has a social value of less than 2.50 dollars (2.05


dollars).    The scal multiplier therefore is the evaluation benchmark for the insurance value.                           Due to lack of


data on consumption and assets, we cannot directly estimate the insurance losses, the right-hand-side of the


social optimality condition (10). Nevertheless, we also discuss in Appendix D.2 how we can put a number on


the insurance value by assuming hand-to-mouth consumers with identical CRRA preferences.                                    We nd that


increasing the RSA by one (two) years is welfare improving if risk aversion is below 2.8 (2.2).
                                                                                                                     57




6.2 The Fiscal Multiplier of Lower DI Benets
    While estimating the scal multiplier of stricter DI eligibility rules is complicated, estimating the scal


multiplier of the second important DI policy instrument, DI benets, is rather straightforward. In section 5,


we have directly estimated         E [B (bs )],   the behavioral scal eect of a DI benet reduction. According to our


estimates in Table 2, the behavioral scal eect is                 18.69    Euros per year for a 1% DI benet cut during ages


57-60 (and     1.18 Euros per year for a 1% DI benet cut during ages 30-56).                To determine the scal multiplier, we


additionally need the mechanical scal eect,                 E [M (bs )]    which is simply one percent of the pre-reform mean


of DI benet expenditures. From Table 2, panel B column 2, a DI benet cut for the 57-60 year old population


yields a mechanical scal eect of           0.01 · 4, 516 = 45.16     Euro per year (and      0.01 · 324 = 3.24    Euro per year for a


DI benet cut during ages 30-56, see column 4). The total scal eect  the sum of behavioral and mechanical


scal eects  is then        63.85 Euro (benet cut during ages 57-60) and 4.42 Euro per year (ages 30-56).                          The scal


multipliers of reducing DI benets is           1.41   for a DI benet cut during the age group 57-60 (and                  1.36   for the age


group 30-56). Table 4 summarizes our results.


    To assess the overall welfare consequences of a DI benet cut, the scal multiplier needs to be compared to


the associated insurance losses. As mentioned above, we lack the necessary data to perform a comprehensive


  57 To   the extent that DI recipients are self-insured through own savings, the insurance loss of a DI reform is smaller. The critical
level of risk aversion above which makes a DI reform welfare-reducing is then correspondingly higher.




                                                                     36
welfare analysis.
                         58 Nevertheless, the scal multiplier provides us with an interesting benchmark: Cutting DI

benets by 1 % is welfare increasing if 1 dollar in the hands of DI recipients has a social value of less than                        1.41

dollars.




6.3 Tightening DI Eligibility Rules or Reducing DI Benets?
    Using our results from Austrian DI reforms, we nally explore the                    relative   performance of the two DI policy


instruments in terms of economic welfare. The above analysis has shown that the scal multiplier of stricter DI


eligibility rules is signicantly larger than the scal multiplier of reducing DI benets. A mechanical one-dollar


reduction of the DI budget reduces the overall expenditures                    1.8   times (=   2.50/1.41)   more strongly when the


reduction is due to stricter DI eligibility rules (RSA increase to age 58) rather than due to lower DI benets.


Put dierently, if the insurance losses associated with stricter DI eligibility rules and lower DI benets were


equally large, policy makers should tighten eligibility rather than cutting benets.
                                                                                                       59

    Clearly, insurance losses of the two policy instruments are not identical. Comparing the right-hand-sides of


the social optimality conditions (10) and (11) shows that stricter DI eligibility rules aect only the additionally


screened-out DI applicants, while lower DI benets aect all DI recipients alike. While we lack the necessary


data (on consumption, wealth and health conditions) to put a number on the absolute value of the insurance


losses, we can make progress comparing the insurance losses associated with the two DI policy instruments.


    We proceed in two steps. We rst use our theoretical framework developed in section 2.2 to derive a condition


comparing the insurance loss of tighter DI rules with the loss of lower DI benets. Then we implement this


condition empirically and show that the insurance loss associated with tighter DI eligibility rules is, in all

    In Appendix D.5, we show that a sucient condition for the insurance loss of stricter DI eligibility rules


being smaller than the insurance loss of lower DI benets is

The left-hand-side of condition (15) is an upper bound of the insurance loss associated with tighter DI eligibility



  58 Just   like in the case of stricter DI eligibility rules, we quantify the possible insurance losses associated with DI benet cut
under the assumption of hand-to-mouth consumers with identical CRRA preferences. This yields a critical value of relative risk
aversion of   1.1   (for a DI benet cut during ages 57-60), above which the reduction of DI benets was actually welfare-     reducing.   We
show this in Appendix D.3.
  59 This holds if insurance losses are smaller   than the scal gains for both policy instruments, i.e. it is optimal to cut the generosity
of the DI program. If, instead, the insurance loss was     larger   than the scal multiplier (for both instruments), a DI reform should
implement higher DI benets rather than relaxed DI eligibility rules (given the insurance gains are equal)  the lower multiplier of
DI benets means that increasing benets is less costly to taxpayers. We focus here on the relative performance of the two policy
instruments if a policy maker wants to cut DI program costs.




                                                                      37
rules which comes from additionally rejected DI applicants (indicated by                    Di,t = 1).60          The right-hand-side of


the condition shows a lower bound of the insurance loss associated with cutting DI benets. This insurance


loss equals the utility loss of DI recipients (indicated by            Di,t = 1)   all of whom are aected by lower DI benets.


Notice that condition (15) splits the insurance loss into a (bounded) income loss and a welfare weight,                                v (cD
                                                                                                                                           i,t )/.

An obvious advantage is that income losses can be estimated directly from the data. Clearly, comparing income


losses of the    average   individual is of limited interest, because the two DI policy instruments aect dierent


individuals (who have dierent welfare weights that we cannot estimate).                           However, we can make progress


by looking at income losses of individuals at dierent positions in the earnings distribution. If income losses


associated with tighter DI eligibility rules were falling short of those associated with lower DI benets                                    at all
income levels      roughly speaking, at all levels of         cD    then the above condition would be satised. In that case,


we would conclude that tightening DI eligibility rules does not only generate a larger scal multiplier but also


a smaller insurance loss than cutting DI benets.


    The second (empirical) step is to implement condition (15). For the left-hand-side of (15) we estimate the


bounds on income losses, separately for each income quintile, using the empirical model (12) and individuals'


income (= labor earnings net of payroll taxes + DI benets + UI benets + SI benets) as a dependent variable.


We x the income quintile of an individual at age 55 and convert the estimated treatment-coecients into an


average yearly income loss during ages 57-61.                 For rejected DI applicants resuming work we implement the


bound on income loss (bi,t      - zi,t )   by replacing their labor earnings with their potential social welfare benets.
                                                                                                                                               61

                                                                                                              H        L
For the right-hand-side of (15) we can directly calculate the reduction in DI benets (bi,t - bi,t ) of DI recipients.


Following condition (15), we normalize the absolute income losses by the mechanical scal eect of the respective


DI policy instrument from Table 4. This normalized income loss measures, separately for each quintile, the


average (bounded) income reduction associated with a 1 Euro mechanical reduction in scal spending of the


respective policy instrument.
                                   62

    Figure 6 shows the normalized (bounded) income losses by income quintiles. In the lowest income quintile,


stricter DI eligibility rules (blue lines in Figure 6) generate signicantly lower income losses than lower DI


benets (red line in Figure 6), while the opposite is true for the third quintile. In contrast, the income losses


are almost identical for the second, fourth and fth quintile. In terms of magnitudes, the income-loss dierence


is high in the lowest income quintile  tighter DI rules generate normalized income losses that are about 1.50


Euros lower than the income losses generated by lower DI benets. The income-loss dierence is smaller in the


middle of the income distribution  normalized income losses are 0.20-0.40 Euro higher with tighter DI rules

  60 The   left-hand-side calculates the hypothetical insurance loss if all rejected DI applicants get social welfare benets. In fact,
many rejected DI applicants go back to work earning a higher income (but suering from impaired health). The condition takes
advantage of the fact that, for rejected DI applicants resuming work, we have      v (zi,t ) < u(wi,t ) - .   Using   v (zi,t )   as a lower bound
for the utility of this group leads to the above condition.
  61 We    construct the potential social welfare benets as a weighted mix of UI and SI benets (weighted by the relative share of
UI and SI benets recipients). This leads to an average replacement rate of 59 percent of previous earnings.
  62 Figures   D.22 and D.23 show the income losses by income source (including labor earnings).

Notes: The gure implements the relative comparison of the insurance losses of stricter eligibility rules and reduced DI benets from
condition (15). The Figure plots the bounds on the normalized income losses in each income quintile for the RSA increases and a reduction
in benet generosity. In the lowest income quintile, stricter DI eligibility rules (blue lines) generate signicantly lower income losses than
lower DI benets (red line), while the opposite is true for the third quintile. The income losses are almost identical for the second, fourth
and fth quintile. In terms of magnitudes, the income-loss dierence is high in the lowest income quintile  tighter DI rules generate
normalized income losses that are about 1.50 Euros lower than the income losses generated by lower DI benets. The income-loss dierence
is smaller in the middle of the income distribution  normalized income losses are 0.40 Euro higher with tighter DI rules compared with
lower DI benets. Roughly speaking, the insurance loss of stricter eligibility rules is smaller than the insurance loss of reduced DI benets
(=condition (15) holds) if a 40 cents reduction in income in the third income quintile does not generate a higher utility loss than a 1.50
Euro reduction in income in the lowest income quintile.


compared with lower DI benets.                                         Roughly speaking, condition (15) holds if a 40 cents reduction in income


in the third income quintile does not generate a higher utility loss than a 1.50 Euro reduction in income in


the lowest income quintile.
                                  63 Naturally, we would expect the welfare weight of the lowest income quintile to

be larger than the welfare weight of the third income quintile. We therefore conclude that the insurance loss


associated with stricter DI eligibility is smaller than the insurance loss associated with reducing DI benets.


    In sum, our analysis of the Austrian DI reforms lead to the conclusion that scal multiplier of stricter DI


eligibility rules are substantially larger than scal multipliers of cutting DI benets.                                       Moreover, we nd that


the overall insurance loss of tighter DI eligibility rules is, in all likelihood, smaller than the average insurance


loss resulting from lower DI benets. In the Austrian context, our estimates suggest that the welfare cost of


tightening DI eligibility is smaller than that of cutting DI benets. The next section applies our framework to


the US context, which has similar age specic eligibility criteria as the Austrian RSA.




7 Application to the US Disability System
    The US DI eligibility criteria are also subject to vocational factors similar to the RSA in Austria.                                     This


medical-vocational grid introduces sharp discontinuities in initial award rates by age. Chen and van der Klaauw


(2008) use these discontinuities to estimate the labor supply eects of DI benet receipt. We use their estimates


for our framework to discuss the welfare eects of abolishing/shifting these age cutos in the US. In contrast



  63 Of   course, this statement holds only approximately, since there is heterogeneity within the income quintiles.




                                                                                        39
to Austria the US age cutos do not seem to aect application behavior.                           There is no strategic bunching of


applications at these ages as shown by Figure 6 in Chen and van der Klaauw (2008). Chen and van der Klaauw


(2008) argue that the rules are not well-known among DI applicants and therefore there is no systematic sorting


around the age cutos in the US. Appendix Figure D.25 contrasts the US application behavior to the Austrian


application behavior and reveals that the Austrian rules are well known as there is large spike of applications


exactly at the RSA. In contrast the US evidence suggests no behavioral response with respect to the age-

                                               
dependent eligibility criteria (E [B (U S )]          = 0)   and a scal multiplier of unity in the US context.              Therefore,


tighter DI eligibility rules at these age cutos in the US are welfare reducing  provided that one dollar in the


hands of DI recipients has a social value of at least one dollar. Notice that this is almost certainly the case (to


the extent that DI applicants are, on average, more deserving than the whole population).


      There is no direct reduced-form estimate of the scal multiplier of DI benet generosity in the US. In the


simple static model from section 2.1 the benet take-up elasticity                     is a sucient statistic (the scal multiplier


is simply   1 +  ).    Bound and Burkhauser (1999) provide a literature review and report take-up elasticities in the


range of 0.3-0.4. Low and Pistaferri (2015)'s structural model implies an application benet elasticity of 0.62.


Multiplied with the average award rate of 0.67 from French and Song (2014) this implies a take-up elasticity


of    = 0.41.     Hence, the US evidence would imply a scal multiplier of 1.3-1.4. With this back of the envelope


calculation we nd a very similar scal multiplier in the US as in Austria. The DI replacement rates in the


US are lower than in Austria and hence the insurance value in the US should be higher than in Austria. This


implies that benets in the US might to be too low. Bound et al. 2004 study the welfare eects of more generous


DI benets in the US in a structural model. Interestingly, they estimate a scal multiplier of 1.5 for DI benet


generosity, which is similar in magnitude as our back of the envelope calculation based on elasticities only.
                                                                                                                                   64

      It is worth noting that our ndings are closely in line with the conclusions of Low and Pistaferri (2015) who


nd that US DI reforms  which increase DI benets and/or relax DI eligibility rules  are welfare improving.


Low and Pistaferri (2015) reach this conclusion after setting up and estimating a structural life-cycle model.


This is quite dierent from our methodology which is based on the sucient-statistics approach and focuses on


the local eect after age 55-60. Despite these methodological dierences, conducting similar policy experiments


lead to very similar conclusions.




8 Conclusion
      In this paper, we provide a framework to analyze the welfare eects of stricter DI eligibility criteria versus


lower DI benets by developing sucient-statistics formulas. We show that the scal multiplier is crucial for



     64 Bound   et al. 2004 estimate the average implicit price of providing an additional dollar of income to recipients in the presence
of moral hazard. This is the same concept as we refer to as the scal multiplier.




                                                                    40
evaluation of the eectiveness of DI policies and estimate scal multipliers of stricter DI eligibility rules and


lower DI benets in the context of Austria.


   To estimate the eects of stricter DI eligibility rules, we exploit variation in DI eligibility strictness that


is generated by a policy reform.    Prior to 2013 DI eligibility standards were signicantly relaxed for workers


above age 57 relative to those below age 57. A 2013 pension reform increased the relaxed screening age (RSA)


threshold from age 57 to age 58, followed by further increases to age 59 in 2015 and age 60 in 2017.         These


step-wise increases generate quasi-experimental variation in the strictness of DI eligibility at a certain age by


date of birth. To examine the impacts of changes in DI benet levels, we exploit a large pension reform that


reduced potential benet levels for most individuals, although pension levels increased for some individuals with


limited work experience.


   We nd that stricter eligibility creates scal multipliers of 2-2.5 and reducing benet generosity has scal


multipliers of 1.3-1.4.   This implies that by tightening eligibility criteria the policy maker can induce larger


behavioral changes and generate greater cost reductions compared to reducing DI benets. Hence, on the cost


side stricter eligibility criteria are more eective.   Reducing benet generosity is only preferable to stricter


eligibility criteria if the insurance loss of reducing benets was more than 1.1 dollars smaller than the insurance


loss of stricter eligibility criteria. Our analysis of income losses along the income distribution suggests that the


insurance loss of lower DI benets is larger than the insurance loss of tighter eligibility rules.

A Theory
A.1 Static Model
Condition Under Which A < R Holds.                       The discussion of the model in the main text  and the decision


sequence in Figure A.1  assume that            A < R .    This means that the social welfare program is a safety net to


which an agent only applies after a DI application is rejected. Here we derive the condition under which this


holds true.


   The utility of claiming social welfare falls short of the utility of working if the agent's disability is                 < R 

u(w) - v (z ) > 0.   Hence,   R      is the marginal social welfare claimant. If         R      the agent prefers social welfare


over working and vice versa. An agent with              R     applies to DI if     v (z ) < p () v (b) + [1 - p ()] v (z ) -      (the


utility on social welfare falls short of the expected utility of applying to DI). If this latter condition holds for


 = R ,   it also holds for     > R ,     because   p () > 0   and   b > z.   Thus, no agent will claim social welfare benets


unless a previous DI application has been rejected, if




                                                     < p(R ) [(v (b) - v (z )] .                                                (A.1)




The condition is intuitive: if the DI program is generous (low           ,    high   p()   and high   b)   and/or the social welfare


program restrictive (low      z ),   an agent with a severe disability rst tries to get on DI, and claims social welfare


only if her DI application gets denied. In the basic model, we assume condition (A.1) is satised.


   Condition (A.1) also implies         A < R ,    i.e. a marginal applicant returns to work in case her DI application is


rejected. To see this, assume to the contrary, that         A  R .      Then the marginal applicant is indierent between


applying for DI and claiming social welfare,         p(^A )]v (b) + [1 - p(^A )]v (z ) -  = v (z )     or    = p(^A ) [v (b) - v (z )],

where   ^A
             is the corresponding threshold disability. However, this latter equality  together with                  p(^A )  p(R )

 implies that condition (A.1) is violated. In other words, while this alternative scenario is possible in principle,


it is ruled out under the maintained parameter constellation. The intuition is similar as before: if the DI system


is generous and/or social welfare restrictive, the rejected marginal applicant goes back to employment.




                                                                45
                                         Figure A.1: DI Application Model: Decision Tree




Note: The gure shows the decision tree of the second period in the static model. If the disability level  is small, the agent continues
working and enjoys utility u(w) - . If the disability is severe an agent applies to DI and is accepted with probability p(). Second period
utility is v (b) -  in case of acceptance into DI. If the agent's application is rejected, she needs to decide whether to return to work (with
utility u(w) -  -  ) or consume other social welfare benets (with utility v (z ) -  ).

of eligibility rules increase from       L   to   H > L .   This implies that the award probability falls        p(; H ) < p(; L )
                                    A   A  A
and fewer individuals apply         H > L (L          denotes the marginal applicant with the lenient criteria             L   and
                                                                                                                                     A
                                                                                                                                     H

denotes the marginal applicant with the high standard                H ).   Note   R    is still independent of the eligibility rules.


    Figure A.2 illustrates the eects of a non-marginal change in strictness of eligibility rules. If rules become


stricter, the award probability curve shifts down from                 p(; L )    to   p(; H ).    As a response fewer individuals

                                   A                                                                                        A A
apply.    Individuals with       < H         no longer apply under the stricter rules.              Individuals with        L , H

are therefore marginal applicants as they only apply under the lenient rules.                           The share of these marginal


applicants is     M A = F (H
                           A        A
                             ) - F (L ).           The behavioral eect is the area under the old award curve of these

                                                                             A
marginal applicants. Individuals with a disability level above               H   continue to apply. These are always applicants


and their share is      AA = 1 - F (H
                                    A
                                      ).           The dierence between the old and new award curve for these always


applicants corresponds to the mechanical eect. Some of these mechanically screened out individuals return to


work (gray area) and some substitute to welfare benets (blue area). Hence, we have the same eects as in the


marginal case, but these eects are slightly dierently dened.

The rst line of (A.5) captures the gain for the taxpayer (the scal cost reduction), the second line is the loss in


insurance value for the always applicants (mechanically screened out). The third line is the insurance loss that


marginal applicants experience and is the key dierence to the marginal case. The Envelope theorem does not

In summary, the scal multiplier is still key for evaluating welfare eects. Moreover, we show later on that our


empirical method to estimate the multiplier is robust to non-marginal changes; and that the insurance value is


the discrete analog of the marginal change with the additional term                             LM A .

Optimal Policy Mix.                   So far, we have derived conditions for social optimality for each single DI policy


parameter, holding the other policy parameter xed. However, a natural question is how a DI reform should


optimally combine these two policy parameters. More precisely: how strongly  and in which direction  should


DI eligibility rules          be changed per unit change of DI benets                      b?

      The slope of the gradient answers this question of the optimal policy mix. Figure A.3 illustrates the idea

                                                                               
of the optimal policy mix. It depicts the current policy                      (0 , b0 ).    The dotted curve indicates the combinations


of   ( , b)   that generate the same level of social welfare. Consider the eect of a DI reform starting from the

                                  
pre-reform DI policy is          (0 , b0 ).   The vertical (horizontal) arrow shows how                     (resp.   b)   needs to be changed


to increase welfare.          In Figure A.3 the vertical arrow points up and the horizontal arrow points to the left,


indicating that a welfare-enhancing DI reform implement lower benets and stricter eligibility rules.
                                                                                                                                     66    The


length of the arrows correspond to the eciency gains associated with the respective policy instrument.                                       In


Figure A.3 the horizontal arrow is short, while the vertical arrow is long, suggesting that the DI reform should


strongly increase            per unit reduction of        b.   The slope of the gradient  the arrow pointing to the northwest 

     66 Alternatively,   if the horizontal arrow points to the right and the vertical arrow points up, the existing DI system is too
restrictive in both dimensions and a welfare reform increasing DI benets and implementing more lenient DI eligibility rules is
welfare improving. Of course, all other permutations are possible.

Similarly, the sign of          determines the direction of adjustment in       (if     0  W/  0    0).

   and       determine the direction of welfare-enhancing adjustments in        b   and    ,   while the ratio   /     determines


the optimal DI policy mix,         ( /b)opt . b   and      have dierent units. Hence, for a meaningful interpretation


of the optimal direction we normalize by the respective mechanical scal eects of a one unit change in                        b   and


   respectively. This means that the optimal direction is expressed in terms of a mechanical 1 dollar change in


scal costs: For a mechanical one-dollar reduction in scal costs due to lower DI benets, DI eligibility rules


should be adjusted such that scal costs are mechanically reduced by             /     dollars.


    In the empirical implementation we focus on the relative comparison of the two instruments (reducing


benets or tightening eligibility rules). The implementation of the optimal policy mix requires estimating the


insurance value. We lack the data on consumption, wealth and health to do this without strong assumptions.


The relative comparison is more robust as we can use income losses and the estimated scal multipliers to rank


the two policies as we show later on.




A.2 General Model
DI Applications and Labor Supply.                 We proceed in a similar way as the discussion of the static model in


the main text. The setup mirrors the static model but extends it in two important dimensions. First, we extend


the model to        T   periods, so agents need to make inter-temporal decisions. Second, we allow               (and as well as


other state variables) evolve stochastically over the agent's relevant time horizon. Let                Xi,t = {i,t , Ai,t , i,t }

Notes: The gure illustrates the idea of the optimal policy mix. It shows the gradient in case DI eligibility should be stricter and benets
should be less generous. The dashed line is the indierence curve of the welfare function of the current benet level and strictness of DI

she either resumes work or claims social welfare, whatever yields higher utility.

   67 The assumption that DI is an absorbing state,      is supported by the empirically observed negligibly low outow rates, particularly
among older workers.

   Optimal Policy Mix: Gradient.                   Just like the static framework, we can also study the optimal policy


mix. It turns out that the result is analogous to the static model. It directly derives from conditions (10) and

Proofs.
Proof.    Proposition 1


    The proof is a direct application of the Envelope Theorem. To derive conditions (A.23) and (A.29) we apply


the dierentiable sandwich lemma from Clausen and Strub (2020). Clausen and Strub (2020) establish that if


a function     F (c)   is sandwiched at some point          c   between two dierentiable functions (upper and lower support


functions     U (c)    and   L(c)),   then this function    F    is dierentiable at this point         c.   Moreover, the derivative of


the sandwiched function           F    equals the derivative of the upper and lower support functions at this point, i.e.


F (c) = U (c) = L (c).           Figure A.4 illustrates this idea nicely. The proof here therefore identies dierentiable


upper and lower support functions of the welfare function                    W (P ).

      For the lower support function we use the idea of the lazy decision maker who does not take into account


agents' behavioral responses to the policy change. Let                      ¯i (P )
                                                                            V         denote the agent's indirect utility if she sticks to


her behavior that is optimal for policy                 ¯

policies    P   the agent does not adjust her behavior. Therefore,                    ¯i (P )  Vi (P ).

Proof.    Proposition 2.


      We apply the same logic to the optimal DI benet policy as in the previous proof. We have



                                                        L(P )                            G(P )

                                                                  i,s Di,s = E  v (ci,s )Di,s          . Dene the mechanical scal eect

                                        -s
as   E [M (bs )] = E (1 + rs )               (Di,s )   and the behavioral scal eect is again dened as the dierence between


total scal eect and mechanical scal eect                       E [B (bs )] = -G(P )/bs - E [M (bs )].            We again have     W (P )/bs =

L(P )/bs = U (P )/bs = 0.                      It is then straightforward to rearrange (A.37) to obtain (A.29).

the application behavior and potential other changes in behavior (which might aect the whole state distribution

we follow the same strategy by estimating the total scal eect and the mechanical scal eect and then calculate


the behavioral scal eect as the residual.

B.2 Stricter DI Eligibility Rules: The 2013 Reform
    Figure B.5 illustrates the step-wise increase in the RSA from age 57 to age 60 graphically. The RSA increased


from age 57 to age 58 on January 1, 2013, followed by further increases to age 59 on January 1, 2015 and to


age 60 on January 1, 2017. All changes were announced in November 2012.


    Figure B.6 provides descriptive evidence on the labor market eects of the RSA increases.                         We plot, by


birth cohort, the percentage of males aged 54-61 receiving DI benets, having ever applied for DI, working, and


receiving other benets. For each variable, trends across birth cohorts are remarkably similar until age 57 


the relaxed screening age for the RSA-57 cohort. At this age, the DI recipient rate rises sharply in the RSA-57


cohort. The percentage males having ever applied for DI also increases, suggesting that many are aware of the

RSA and time their DI application to this age. Conversely, the percentage males of the RSA-57 cohort who are


employed or receive other benets drops at age 57, pointing to the role of DI as a substitute for UI or SI.


    We observe similar breaks in trends when the RSA-58 and RSA-59 cohorts reach their RSA, but interestingly


cohorts with a higher RSA never catch up to cohorts with a lower RSA. For example, the DI recipiency rate


rises sharply at age 58 for the RSA-58 cohort, but it never reaches the level of the RSA-57 cohort. A one year


increase in the RSA changes labor market dynamics not only at the age where disability eligibility becomes

RSA Eect Among Non-eligible Males.                              In Figure B.7, we plot the estimated                   k -coecients from equation

(12) for men with too little work experience to be eligible for DI under relaxed eligibility rules. We nd that DI


benet receipt, DI application ever, employment and other benet receipt do not dier signicantly across birth


cohorts, even after age 56, providing strong support for the absence of dierential trends across birth cohorts.

eect up to the last age, we can observe treated cohorts in the data (age 61 for the RSA-58 cohort and age 60


for the RSA-59 cohort). A natural question is whether these eects would continue even beyond the last age, we


currently observe in the data? A simple way to shed light on this question is by looking at an older cohort, men


born in 1954, whom we can track until age 63. We would expect that the eects of the RSA increases disappear


at age 62. At this age most men in Austria retire, because they become eligible for retirement benets. Indeed,


if we plot age trends in labor market outcomes and DI application ever for men born in 1954 (Figure B.8), at


age 62 we observe sharp drops in the precent of men receiving DI benets, being employed, or receiving other


benets.

    We can estimate the eect of the RSA increases up to age 62 if we assume that the                                                    k -coecient     estimates


in equation (12) are unchanged between the last age, we currently observe in the data, and age 62.                                                            This

Notes: The tabe reports the average eect of the RSA for the ages between above age 56 and below age 62. The estimates are constructed
by taking the average of the k -coecients from equation (12) for k  57. The eligible -sample comprises men who, at age 56, have worked
for at least 10 years in the last 15 years. The non-eligible -sample comprises men who, at age 56, have worked less than 10 years in the
last 15 years. Mean denotes the mean above the RSA for the RSA-57 cohort. Fiscal eects are reported in 2018 Euro. Standard errors
clustered at the year-month of birth level are reported in parentheses. Levels of signicance: 1%, 5%, and      1%.


observe labor market outcomes up to age 61. Thus, the only estimate that changes compared to Table 1 is the


estimate on DI application ever, which we observe only until age 60. We nd that the application rate declines


by 1.17 percentage points on average, which is almost identical to the estimate in Table 1 (-1.19 percentage


points). We nd equally small dierences when comparing the estimates for the RSA-59 cohort.

Placebo Estimates Benet Generosity.                             To test the appropriateness of our strategy to identify the eect


of DI benets, we estimate 1,000 placebo regressions, in which we randomly assign individuals within each


cell dened by year, insurance-year decile, and assessment decile potential benets                               br (Zit ) from a dierent year.

Appendix Figure B.10 plots the empirical cumulative distribution of the placebo estimates together with the true


estimate for each outcome in Panel A of Table 2. The gures conrm that true increases in benet generosity


lead to unusually large increases in DI inow, DI applications, and other benet outow, but have no eect on


employment outow.

B.4 DI Application Eects by Medical Impairment
     Our main results indicate that stricter DI eligibility rules and lower DI benets reduce the propensity to


apply for DI benets. Here we examine the application eect on the type of impairments with which individuals


apply, separately for each DI policy instrument. Figure B.11 plots the estimated                                                      k -coecients                 from equation


(12) for increases in the RSA to 58 and 59. As outcome variables we use whether individuals have ever applied


with a mental impariment, a musculoskeletal impairment, or an other impairment. The shaded area denotes the


95 percent condence interval. The estimates suggest that an increase in the RSA reduces mainly applications


with musculoskeletal and other impairments, while applications with mental impairments do not change.

     Table B.4 shows how changes in benet generosity aect the type of impairment with which individuals


apply for DI. Similar to stricter DI eligibility rules, we nd no signicant eect on the number of applications


with a mental impairment, but signifcant increase in the number of applications with a musculoskeletal or any


other impairment. The absence of an eect on applications with a mental impairment is interesting, because a


mental illness is often considered a dicult-to-verify disorder (see, e.g., Autor and Duggan, 2006) and one would


expect it to be responsive to changes in DI policy, but our ndings do not provide support for this intuition.

B.5 The Eect of DI Reforms on Labor Market Transitions
Our estimates show that stricter DI eligibility rules increases employment and other benet receipt among


treated cohorts. The increases can result either from changes in the inow into employment or other benet


receipt, or changes in the persistences in employment or other benet receipt. To shed light on the importance


of these two eects, Figures B.12 and B.13 plots the estimated                                                              k -coecients              from equation (12) using as


outcome variable transitions from and persistence in employment and other benet receipt.

The rst colum of gure B.12 shows a drop in transitions from employment to DI at the ages where DI


eligibility rules become stricter but not at other ages. The middle column shows that stricter DI eligibility


rules induce indivdiuals who already employed to stay employed longer. The last column shows an increase in


ransitions from employment to other benet receipt, but the magnitude of the eect is only about half as big


as the increase in employment persistence. Similarly, the rst colum of gure B.13 shows a drop in transitions


from other benets to DI at the ages where DI eligibility rules become stricter, but we also see an increase in


transitions into DI as soon as a cohort reaches its RSA, suggesting that some individuals receive other benets


longer until they reach the new RSA. Consistent with this idea, the third column of B.13 shows a sharp

increase in persistence in other benets at the ages where DI eligibility rules become stricter followed by a


drop as soon as DI eligiblity rules are relaxed again. Transitions from other benets to employment also


increase after age 56, but the magnitude of the eect is smaller than the increase in persistence in other


benets (second column of Figure B.13)

C Characterizing Compliers
C.1 Framework for Complier Analysis
      In this section, we describe the complier analysis for dierence-in-dierences settings, as outlined in


De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2018); Jäger et al. (2019), to study the characteristics of marginal,


always, and never applicants. (We follow the same steps to study the characterististcs of marginal, always, and


never enrollees.) For the RSA-58 change, we focus on the ages 56 and 57 and compare the RSA-58 cohort to the


RSA-57 cohort. The RSA-57 cohort faces relaxed DI eligibility standards at age 57, while eligibility standards


for the RSA-58 cohort are strict at both ages.                  For the RSA-59 increase, we focus on the ages 55 to 58 and


compare the RSA-59 cohort to the RSA-57 cohort. The RSA-57 cohort faces relaxed DI eligibility standards at


age 57 and age 58, while eligibility standards for the RSA-59 cohort are strict at any age between 55 and 58.


      We denote by      a   the age window. It can take two values:              a = A57   is the age window above 56 and            a = B 57

is the age window below 57. We denote by                  c   the cohort;      c=T   is the RSA-57 cohort (the treatment cohort)


and    c = C     is the RSA-58 cohort (the control cohort).                   For the RSA-59 change,         c = C    denotes the RSA-59


cohort. We have a binary instrument              Z , equal to one if DI eligibility is relaxed and zero otherwise, that is Z = 1

for   (T, A57)    and   Z=0     for   (T, B 57), (C, A57),    and   (C, B 57). AP    is an indicator whether an individual applies


for DI benets. Following the potential outcomes framework,                         AP   can take two potential values:           AP0   is the


potential value of      AP    for   Z=0    and   AP1   is the potential value of     AP    for   Z = 1.   We can now distinguish three


groups of applicants: always applicants (AP0                  = AP1 = 1),       never applicants (AP0        = AP1 = 0),      and marginal


applicants who only apply when DI eligibility standards are relaxed (AP0                          =0      and   AP1 = 1).     We dene the


dierent groups of enrollees in the same way basend on an indicator                      DI , which is one if an individual is awarded

DI benets and zero otherwise.             DI0    and   DI1 denote     the potential values of     DI   for   Z=0      and   Z = 1.

      Estimating the expected value of a characteristic              X   for never applicants is straightforward. All individuals in


(T, A57)      who do not apply for DI are never applicants if we assume                 AP1 - AP0  0,           the standard monotonicity


assumption in the instrumental variables literature.
                                                                    72 We can estimate the conditional value of a never applicant

                                                                                                1

                                                                                             NT           i (T,A57)   Xi · I(APi = 0),where
                                                                                                ,A57

                             na
i   is individual and       NT,A 57   is the number of people in          (T, A57)   who do not apply for DI and              I(APi = 0)   is


equal to one if an individual has not applied for DI and zero otherwise. We use the same logic to estimate the


expected value of a characteristic for a never enrollee.


      Estimating the expected value of a characteristic for marginal and always applicants is more challenging


and requires additional assumptions (Jäger et al., 2019).                        The key insight is that the expected value of a


characteristic      X   for all applicants in     (T, A57)     is a weighted average of the expected value for marginal and


    72 The   monotonicity assumption rules out defying applicants who would apply when DI eligibility rules are strict but not when
DI eligibility rules are relaxed.




                                                                         73
always applicants, where the weights represent the share of marginal applicants and always applicants among


all applicants. We can re-arrange the weighted average to get an expression for the expected value of a marginal


applicant characteristic:




                                                  ma +  aa                             aa
 E (X |AP0 = 0, AP1 = 1, T, A57) =                   ma
                                                           · E (X |AP1 = 1, T, A57) - ma · E (X |AP0 = 1, T, A57)                       (C.46)
                                                                                     

where        ma = NT,A
                   ma
                       57 /NT,A57         and
                                                       aa
                                                 aa = NT,A 57 /NT,A57     are the shares of marginal and always applicants in


(T, A57).

      We can estimate each term of the right-hand side of equation (C.46) empirically. We estimate the shares of


each group of applicants with the following regression:




                                                  APiac =  + a + c +  Zac + iac ,                                                       (C.47)




where       a   is a xed eect for the age window           a = A57      and   c   is a xed eect for the cohort              c = T.      If   Z   is


independent from        AP     and application trends in the absence of relaxed DI eligibility are parallel across cohorts,


then       aa =  +  +             is the share of always applicants,        ma =           is the share of marginal applicants, and


 na = 1 -  aa -  ma              is the share of never applicants (De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2018); Jäger


et al. (2019)).
                    73 We estimate the share of always enrollees ( ae ), marginal enrollees ( me ) and never enrollees

     ne
(         ) in the same way, but simply use          DI   as the dependent variable in equation (C.47).                   We estimate the


conditional value of an applicant characteristic              E (X |AP1 = 1, T, A57)            by the corresponding sample mean

    a                                                   a
(1/NT,A 57 ) ·       i (T,A57)   Xi · I(APi = 1),where NT,A 57   is the number of applicants in            (T, A57)      and   I(APi = 1)        is


one if an individual has applied for DI.


      Calculating     E (X |AP0 = 1, AP1 = 1, T, A57) is more dicult, because we never get to see whether applicants

in   (T, A57) would have applied if eligibility standards were strict, that is we never observe the potential outcome

AP0 .      But because of monotonicity we know that individuals who apply when eligibility standards are strict also


apply when eligibility standards are relaxed, allowing us to write                E (X |AP0 = 1, AP1 = 1, T, A57) = E (X |AP0 =

1, T, A57).     If trends in     X   are parallel across cohorts under strict eligibility standards and           Z    is independent from


AP    and     X,   we can estimate      E (X |AP0 = 1, T, A57)   using the change in applications for cohort                C , E (X |AP0 =

1, T, A57) = E (X |AP0 = 1, T, B 57) + E (X |AP0 = 1, C, A57) - E (X |AP0 = 1, C, B 57).                                  We can estimate

                                                                                                     a
each element on the right-hand side by the corresponding sample mean:                            (1/NT,B 57 ) ·       i (T,B 57)   Xi · I(APi =
         a                                                   a
1) + (1/NC,A 57 ) ·       i (C,A57)    Xi · I(APi = 1) - (1/NC,B 57 ) ·       i (C,B 57)   Xi · I(APi = 1).


   73 Formaly, the independence assumption is equal to AP , AP  Z | a, c                   and the parallel trend assumption is equal to
                                                                  0     1
E (AP0 |A57, T )-E (AP0 |B 57, T ) = E (AP0 |A57, C ) - E (AP0 |B 57, C ).


                                                                   74
C.2 Complier Analysis for the RSA-59 Increase
Table C.5 shows the population shares and average characteristics of marginal applicants and enrollees, always


applicants and enrollees, and never applicants and enrollees for the RSA-59 change. The dierences between


the various groups of applicants and enrollees mirror the patterns for the RSA-58 change (Table 3). Marginal


applicants and enrollees, compared to always applicants and enrollees, are in better health (proxied by sick


leave absence at age 56), are more likely to be employed at age 56, are more likely to work in blue-collar jobs


and are more likely to apply with a musculoskeletal impairment. Overall, these dierences provide evidence


consistent with marginal applicants and enrollees having a higher work capacity than always applicants and


enrollees (but a lower work capacity than never applicants and enrollees).

D.1 Comparing Pre-57 Applicants to Always Applicants in the Treatment Group
   Table D.6 presents summary statistics for the pre-57 applicants sample, which we use to estimate the


mechanical eect of stricter eligibility rules.       Around 50 percent of the pre-57 applicants are already on DI


by age 57. Around 40 percent of the remaining individuals reapply at age 57. 60 to 77 percent of all pre-57


applicants are on DI benets by age 60. In total we have around 6000 pre-57 applicants in the control group


(RSA 57) and around 3000 individuals in each of the two treatment groups (RSA 58 and RSA 59). In terms of


labor market characteristics before age 57 the treatment and control groups are very comparable.

Notes: The table reports summary statistics for men between age 54 and age 62 who have applied for DI during ages 50-56 (pre-57
applicants). The RSA-57 cohort comprises men born between December 1953 and November 1955, the RSA-58 cohort comprises men born
between December 1955 and November 1956, and the RSA-59 cohort comprises men born between December 1956 and November 1957.
Earnings are reported in 2018 Euro. Sample standard deviations for continuous variables are reported in parentheses.


   The DI applicants at age 57 in the whole population consist of (i) DI applicants who le an application for the


rst time and (ii) DI re-applicants whose pre-57 application got rejected (= those in the subpopulation of pre-57


applicants whose previous DI application was rejected and who re-apply at age 57).                    Hence, our comparison


of pre-57 applicants who re-apply at age 57 to applicants at age 57 in the whole population boils down to


comparing group (ii) to the sum of groups (i) and (ii). The share of pre-57 applicants among all applicants at


age 57 in the RSA-58 sample is 35 percent, the share of group of pre-57 applicants in the RSA-59 sample is 37



                                                              77
percent. Hence, around one third of all applicants at age 57 already led an application before age 57 and two


thirds are rst-time applicants.


    Figure 4, Panel (a) in the main text shows that these two groups have very similar DI benet receipt rates.


Figure D.17 decomposes DI benet receipt further into application rates and award rates and shows that the


two groups are almost identical in these dimensions as well.                                                         The very similar award rates indicate that the


pre-57 applicants seem to be representative for applicants at age 57.

Notes: The gure compares trends in DI application rates (panel a) and the DI award rates (panel b) for applicants at age 57 (always
applicants) and pre-57 applicants in the treatment groups. Always applicants are individuals who apply for for DI at age 57. Pre-57
applicants comprise individuals who applied for DI between age 50 and age 56 and re-apply for DI at age 57. The comparison shows that
the two groups are very similar in outcomes after their application at age 57.



    Figure D.18 compares the two groups with respect to employment, other benet receipt, social security


contributions and other benet payments. The two groups show a similar pattern after their application at 57


but they are not identical. Applicants at age 57 have slightly higher employment and a lower chance to receive


other welfare benets than pre-57 applicants. This arises because rst time applicants at age 57 have a higher


employment probability than pre-57 applicants. The dierences are, however, not large.

D.2 Insurance Loss of Stricter DI Eligibility Rules
   Implementing the insurance value (the rhs of (10)) is associated with several challenges.                                      In contrast to


the sucient statistics literature on UI, the utility loss is expressed in dierences in utility levels rather than


in marginal utilities. Moreover, the insurance value also depends on the abstract quantity                                   .   We tackle this


challenges by deriving bounds of the insurance value that do not depend on the unobserved disability level                                        .
                                                                                                                1-
                                                                                                                c     -1
Furthermore, we assume utility is state-independent and CRRA, i.e.                      v (c) = u(c) =              1- , and that we have

hand-to-mouth consumers.
                               74 In the following we discuss the derivation of the bounds and the implications of

our assumptions. For this dene the insurance value as


                                  T -1
                     1
          V              )]
                            E             t MWi,t v (cD          W
                                                      i,t ) - u(ci,t ) - i,t          + MZi,t v (cD           Z
                                                                                                  i,t ) - v (ci,t )                           (D.48)
                  E [M (s          t=s


In the following we derive lower and upper bounds on this insurance value                     V .


Upper Bound Insurance Value.                  The social welfare benets act as safety net. An agent cannot do worse


than being on social welfare benets in all periods. The insurance loss can therefore not be larger than


                                                      T -1
                                      1
                           V              )]
                                             E                t MWi,t + MZi,t         v (cD           Z
                                                                                          i,t ) - v (ci,t )         .                         (D.49)
                                   E [M (s            t=s


This bound assumes that individuals who are screened out are all on social welfare benets. Individuals who


decide to work at some points can only do better than being on social welfare benets in all periods and hence


experience a lower insurance loss than assumed by this bound.




Lower Bound Insurance Value.                 Since   MWi,t v (cD          W
                                                               i,t ) - u(ci,t ) - i,t          0      we have



                                                             T -1
                                             1
                                V                )]
                                                    E                t MZi,t v (cD           Z
                                                                                 i,t ) - v (ci,t )          .                                 (D.50)
                                          E [M (s            t=s


This lower bound simply assumes that individuals who are screened out and then return to work have no loss


in insurance value, i.e. they are indierent between working and receiving DI benets.




Implementation.          To implement (D.49) we make four assumptions.                     First, we measure the insurance loss

                                                                                                     T -1

                                                                                                                   i,t )      where    cW
                                                                                                                                        i,t   is the


consumption level of working individuals).            This is the standard to measure the insurance value in the UI

                                                                                                                            c1- -1

                                                                                                                    D

                                                                                                                                  i,t = zi,t , ci,t =

wi,t - i,t ).   We assume this because we cannot observe consumption in our data. This assumption provides an


upper bound on the insurance value. If individuals can self-insure through savings the insurance loss is smaller


than if they were hand-to-mouth and simply consumed their income. Hence, in our implementation we tend to


overestimate the insurance loss. Fourth, we assume no discounting                                             = (1 + r) = 1.           All eects are within a 5


years horizon and hence discounting does not play a major role.


    With these assumptions we have

only depends on the mechanical eect. We therefore use the same pre-57 applicants strategy as in the main


text to estimate the mechanical scal eect. Here we just apply this strategy to a dierent outcome. For each


individual we create a variable                    qi,t   which is equal to the DI benets                            bi,t   if this individual is on DI benets


and equal to the individuals (hypothetical) social welfare benets                                            zi,t   if this individual is not on DI benets.


This ensures that an individual who returns to work experiences a utility loss as if she was on social welfare

                                                                                                                      1        1-

on this outcome variable                vi,t .   Analogously to the mechanical scal eect this identies the mechanical utility

to the actual DI benet                  bi,t     if this individual is on DI, and equal to the hypothetical DI benet                                       bi,t   if the


individual is employed (= the DI benet the individual would receive in case of a DI reward); and li,t is equal


to the individual social welfare benets                          zi,t   if this individual is on social welfare benets.                         This ensures that


an individual experiences no utility loss if she returns to work after being screened out (i.e.                                                       there is only a

insurance loss if       MZi,t = 1).         We then calculate for a given risk aversion                                the utility   ui,t =   1- (li,t )   and run


our DiD strategy on this outcome variable                          ui,t .

    Using this approach we estimate the upper and lower bound of the insurance loss for dierent values of


risk aversion and plot the two bounds in Figure D.19. We nd that shifting the RSA by one year is welfare-


improving if risk aversion                < 2.8           and it is welfare-reducing if                 > 3.1.              Increasing the RSA by two years is




                                                                                         81
welfare-improving if risk aversion        < 2.2.    Estimates from the literature suggest that the coecient of relative


risk aversion is below 2, Chetty (2006b) nds an upper bound of                           1.78.              Hence, our implementation implies


that the increase in the RSA was welfare-improving for reasonable values of risk aversion.

Notes: Figure plots the LHS and the upper and lower bounds of the RHS of inequality (10) for the one year increase in the RSA
from 57 to 58 in panel (a) and two year increase in RSA in panel (b) against dierent levels of risk aversion. If risk aversion is lower
than the point where the solid gray line crosses the red line, then the reform is welfare improving. If risk aversion is higher than
the point where the dashed gray line crosses the red line, then increasing the RSA is welfare reducing. For levels of risk aversion
between these two points our sucient statistics condition do not allow for a welfare statement.




D.3 Insurance Loss of Lower DI Benets
    The eect we estimate empirically is a benet reduction from age                                s   to    T - 1.   For the welfare eect this


simply implies that we need to sum up the welfare eects of changing benets in each period. To implement


the welfare eects we impose the same four assumptions as in the above implementation for stricter eligibility


rules. This yields for the insurance value
                                                              T -1         -
                                                        E     t=s    (bi,s )
                                                                                   .                                                     (D.53)
                                                              T -1       -
                                                       E      t=0 (wi,t )


We can directly calculate this for dierent values of risk aversion based on the pre-reform benet levels. Figure


D.20 plots the scal multiplier and the insurance value for dierent values of risk aversion. We nd that for risk


aversion around      = 1.1    the benet levels are optimal for the age group 57-60. Younger individuals have lower


multipliers with similar insurance values and hence a lower critical risk aversion level of around                              = 0.6.   Hence,


benet generosity is optimal for reasonable values of risk aversion.

Notes: Figure plots the LHS and RHS of inequality (11) for men aged 57-60 in panel (a) and 30-56 in panel (b) against dierent
levels of risk aversion. If risk aversion is higher than the point where the gray line crosses the red line, then it is welfare improving
to increase benet generosity. If risk aversion is lower than this point, it is welfare improving to reduce benet generosity.




D.4 Optimal Policy Mix
    For the gradient we can use the implementation from above to express                                  and          from equation (A.35) as a


function of risk aversion. For             we use the upper and lower bounds and therefore get a range of optimal directions
                                                                           
for a given level of risk aversion. The optimal direction
                                                                            measures the direction in units of mechanical cost

reductions.      Intuitively, the gradient says that for a one dollar mechanical reduction in scal costs due to

                                                                            
lower benets, eligibility rules should be stricter such that
                                                                             dollars are saved mechanically. Figure D.21 plots

the gradient for dierent values of risk aversion. Panel (a) plots the optimal combination of changing benet


generosity and eligibility rules at age 57. For risk aversion below 1.15 benets should be reduced and eligibility


rules should be stricter. For instance with risk aversion of 0.5 the optimal combination reduces spending through


stricter eligibility rules by 4 dollars for a one dollar reduction in spending due to lower benets. Hence, at this


level of risk aversion DI eligibility is optimally tightened more than benets. For levels of risk aversion above


2.8, benets should be increased and eligibility rules should be less strict. In this region it is more eective to

                                                                                                              d 
increase benets than making eligibility less strict (optimal direction of around
                                                                                                               db   0.1-0.2).    For risk aversion


between 1.15 and 2.8 eligibility criteria should be tightened but benets more generous. Panel (b) plots the


optimal direction for the adjustment of eligibility between 57 and 59. This gradient looks qualitatively similar

disability to other welfare benets, respectively. This change in disability status can arise because individual                                                                                        i is

costs of individual           i    due to changing her application decision in period                                                t.    Other behavioral changes, such as


adaption of consumption and savings decision in anticipation of the stricter eligibility rules, would reduce the

account for the mechanical changes. In this sense, our relative comparison of the insurance losses is robust to

(D.59) uses that the consumption drop cannot be larger than the income drop (savings dampen the income


loss).

In Figure 6 we estimate the bounds of the normalized income loss by income quintile. The income quintiles can


be thought of as an approximation of the welfare weight in the above inequality.

Inequality (D.62) holds because changes in behavior lead to additional utility losses for non-marginal changes


in DI benets. As a lower bound for the insurance loss of reducing benets we have

Comparing Insurance Loss of DI Eligibility Rules and DI Benets.                                    From (D.60) and (D.63) follows

holds. Figure 6 implements this inequality empirically by estimating the bounds of the income losses by income


quintiles and we discuss the implications in the main text.




Income Losses of DI Eligibility Rules and DI Benets.                             As an additional interesting exercise we also


look at the (unbounded) income losses of the two policy instruments taking labor earnings into account for


stricter eligibility and behavioral changes (like lower DI take-up) for the reduction in DI benets. Figure D.22


displays the results of this exercise by income sources for the RSA-58 and RSA-59 increases. Panel (a) shows


that mostly individuals in the lower three income quintiles are aected by stricter eligibility rules.                        For the


RSA-58 increase, the lowest three quintiles loose on average around 1000 Euros in DI benets between age 57


and 61. The DI benet loss is similarly distributed for the two year increase to RSA 59 with an approximately


twice as large magnitude. This loss in DI benets is to some degree oset with higher labor income (Panel (b))


and more income from other benets (Panel (c)). Panel (d) presents the net eect on total income. The higher


income quintiles can oset their DI income loss to a large degree with higher labor income. Only the lowest


quintile experiences a substantial loss. We do the same exercise for lower DI benets in D.23. We nd that for


the income losses associated with lower DI benets are more pronounced at the lower quintiles. These losses are


only weakly compensated by other transfers, while labor earnings are not aected. There are also some losses


due to lower DI income in the second and third income quintile though these losses are substantially smaller,


while other income sources are largely unaected by the the DI benet cut.


   In Figure D.24 we present the normalized income losses in each income quintile for the RSA increases and


benet generosity from the unbounded income losses from Figures D.22 and D.23.
                                                                                                      75 Figure D.24 shows that for

the (unbounded) income losses the conclusion is even clearer as for the bounded income losses. The normalized


income loss of benet generosity is for all quintiles larger than that of stricter eligibility rules (the red line is


above the blue line, except for the third quintile where the losses are very similar).


   If the objective function of the planner would not take disutility of work into account, i.e.                     i,t   would not

  75 The   normalized income loss is simply the the total income loss by quintile in Panel (d) in Figures D.22 and D.23 divided by
the respective mechanical scal eect from Table 4.

This bound corresponds to Figure D.24 where we estimate the normalized income loss (taking actual labor


earnings into account instead of potential benets as in (D.60)) by income quintile. Hence, a policy maker who


is mainly concerned about income replacement therefore nds stricter eligibility rules less costly than reducing


DI benets (irrespective of distributional preferences). Such a policy maker clearly prefers tightening eligibility


rules over reducing benet generosity as it has lower costs (lower income losses across the income distribution)


while it creates a higher scal cost reduction (higher multiplier).

Notes: The Figure plots the estimated income losses in each income quintile for the RSA increases by income source. In contrast to Figure
6 we do not implement the bounds on the income loss here. That is, we do not replace labor earnings with potential welfare benets for
individuals resuming to work. Higher labor earnings oset a large part of the DI income loss for the upper four quintiles.

Notes: The Figure plots the estimated income losses in each income quintile for reduced benet generosity by income source. In contrast
to Figure 6 we do not implement the bounds on the income loss here. That means we also consider changes in behavior, like reduced DI
take-up, that trigger changes in income.

Notes: The gure plots the normalized income losses in each income quintile for the RSA increases and a reduction in benet generosity.
Income quintiles are measured at age 55. The normalized income loss is simply the total income loss by quintile in Panel (d) in Figures
D.22 and D.23 divided by the respective mechanical scal eect from Table 4. The normalized income loss measures the quintile's income
reduction for a 1 Euro mechanical reduction in scal spending.

Notes: Panel (a) contrasts the US application behavior to the Austrian application behavior around the age cutos of relaxed eligibility
rules. In Austria there is large spike of DI applications exactly at the RSA. In the US, there is no strategic bunching of DI applications at
the age cutos. Panel (b) shows that in both countries there is a discontinuous jump in award rates at the age cutos.
