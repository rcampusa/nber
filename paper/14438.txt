                                             ABSTRACT

We ask whether Poland is at risk of the boom-bust problem that has afflicted economies around the
time of euro adoption. Our answer, inevitably, is mixed. On the one hand the fact that Poland is an
outlier, credit-growth wise, accentuates the danger of a boom if one believes in mean reversion. Our
econometrics indicate that the fall in interest rates that will flow from expectations of euro adoption
will further feed that boom. On the other hand the fact that interest rates have already converged part
way to euro-area levels (and more extensively than in earlier adopters that experienced a sharp fall
in rates and a pronounced credit boom), especially in the case of lending to firms, suggests that this
shock may be less intense in Poland. And it is certainly conceivable that the same policies and country
characteristics (not always visible to the econometrician) that have restrained credit growth in the past
may continue to do so in the future. The broader literature also points to two set of factors, the first
of which makes the danger of an unsustainable credit boom more immediate, the second of which
makes it more remote. In the first category are the continuing limitations of the supervisory framework
and the weakness of the finance minister in the budget-making process. In the second are a record
of rigorous prudential supervision and the existence of relatively competitive labor markets.

Is Poland at Risk of a Boom-and-Bust Cycle in the Run-Up to Euro Adoption?

    1.   Introduction

         This paper takes as a given that Poland will adopt the euro and asks how it should

manage the transition.2 It considers the boom-bust problem that has afflicted economies around

the time of euro adoption. It analyzes why those boom-bust cycles occurred. It explores the

consequences. It asks what might have ensured superior outcomes.

         Poland is not Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia. It is

important, in other words, to avoid mechanical comparisons. Compared to other countries that

did or are experiencing credit booms in the run-up to euro adoption, the growth of credit to the

private sector has been relatively subdued.3 The increase in housing prices has been relatively

limited. Residential mortgage debt as a percent of GDP remains relatively low.4 The challenge is

that it is not always clear in which direction the differences point. On the one hand, that Poland

has not displayed similar excesses could mean that it has the problem of booming bank lending,

excessive wage growth, and housing-market speculation under control. Firm supervision and

regulation, cautious monetary and fiscal policies, and competitive product and factor markets

may mean that Poland is at less risk of these excesses than its predecessors. On the other hand, it

could simply be that euro adoption has remained sufficiently remote that there has been little

reason to expect signs of its effects. But not long from now, as euro adoption draws near, the

same dynamics evident in the early adopters may develop. Indeed, insofar as there is still scope

for movements in prices and quantities, a displacement of Polish markets may occur.

        This is not the first paper to consider the credit-boom problem in the run-up to euro

adoption.5 Nor is it the first to consider strategies for managing the transition in Central and

Eastern Europe.6 But it differs from its predecessors in several ways. It does not focus just on

member states that experienced pronounced booms in the run-up to euro adoption; it seeks to

avoid the problem of selection bias by considering the population of relevant countries. And it

looks more closely at Poland’s situation, taking as its focus the structure of its financial markets

and the organization of supervision and regulation.

        Section 2 describes the now familiar boom-and-bust scenario. Section 3 then reviews the

experience of other catch-up economies that have adopted the euro. While highlighting the

credit-boom-and-bust cycle experienced in some such countries, it also emphasizes the existence

of heterogeneity within this subset of EU member states and points to the absence of

destabilizing dynamics in some members. This then leads to a discussion of why experience has

varied so widely.

        Section 4 through 6 then take a closer look at Poland. Section 4 looks more closely at

credit market and real estate developments. Sections 5 and 6 then ask whether Poland can avoid

the kind of boom-bust cycle that has afflicted other catch-up economies adopting the euro.

Section 5 analyzes Poland’s susceptibility to a credit boom by estimating credit-market dynamics

in a large sample of emerging market economies and using that model to forecast the evolution

of private credit. But forecasting exercises only being as reliable as the assumptions that go into

them, some uncertainty about the country’s susceptibility nonetheless remains. Section 6

suggests that the outcome will turn on four issues. First, how sharply will interest rates come

down? Second, how effectively will wage discipline be maintained? Third, will the government

be able to resist pressures for increased spending? Fourth, will bank regulators effectively

restrain the impulse for an unsustainable credit boom?

   Section 7 summarizes the implications of the preceding analysis.



   2.   The Boom-Bust Scenario

        The standard boom-bust scenario for catch-up economies focuses on real interest rates.

Prior to the adoption of the euro, real and nominal interest rates are high, reflecting capital

scarcity and imperfect policy credibility. As accession to the euro area approaches, inflation and

nominal interest rates converge toward euro-area levels. Short rates are driven to equality by

capital mobility and the ECB’s practice of assigning the short-term sovereign debt instruments of

all euro-area member governments to the same liquidity category, implying the same haircut

when accepting them as collateral. Convergence of inflation tends to be slower: there is more

inertia in product and labor markets, and catch-up economies continue to be characterized by

relatively high inflation owing to the Balassa-Samuelson effect.

        The consequent decline in real interest rates will stimulate consumption and investment

spending. Households and firms will demand additional credit to finance their spending, and the

financial system will respond. The decline in real interest rates will put upward pressure on asset

prices, including the price of real estate. Strong demand will make for a buoyant labor market,

encouraging workers to escalate their wage demands. With investment up and savings down, the




                                                  3
current account deficit will widen. Debt service costs having declined, the government will be

tempted to increase spending.

       But if the strong growth of real wages persists, international competitiveness will

deteriorate. Export growth will slow, and import competition will intensify. As profits are

squeezed, firms will cut back on investment, and as growth slows, households will curtail their

consumption. As demand falls off, unemployment will rise, and the country will discover that it

is saddled with a real overvaluation that can be eliminated only through years of grinding

deflation. There will be little scope for using stabilizing policy, since the country lacks monetary

independence and the government will have accumulated a substantial debt. The party will be

over. The souvenirs will be the memories and the hangover.

       A few observations about this story may be helpful. First, the impact effect will depend

on the extent of the drop in real interest rates, which will in turn depend on the change in

nominal rates and on how far above euro-area levels they were prior to the transition. It will

depend on the continuing inflation differential and on how far behind the euro area the country is

in per-capita-income terms. We should not expect the same real interest rate effect in all cases.

       Second, the reaction of households and firms is not entirely irrational. Lower real interest

rates mean positive wealth effects for net foreign debtors. A lower cost of capital will mean

faster growth for capital-scarce economies. It thus makes sense for firms to invest more. It

makes sense for households to increase their consumption in anticipation of higher future

incomes. One would expect to see faster growth in the short run as the economy traverses to a




                                                 4
higher capital/output ratio.7 One would expect to see transitional current account deficits since

the increase in consumption precedes the increase in income.

         Third, it is necessary to add disequilibrium dynamics for this temporary acceleration to

become an unsustainable boom followed by an extended recession. Real wages have to rise by

more than is justified by the increase in the capital stock. Households have to boost their

consumption by more than is justified by higher future incomes. The financial system has to

increase credit to the public sector by more than is prudent given the fundamentals. The

government has to increase its spending by more than is warranted by the decline in debt-

servicing costs.8

         Putting the point this way not meant to deny these possibilities. To the contrary, it is

natural for agents, never having seen this adjustment before, to extrapolate from the present. It is

not surprising that they overreact. But there is no reason to expect an equally severe

overreaction in all times and places. The extent to which real wages rise and competitiveness

deteriorates will depend on the structure of the labor market. The extent of the credit boom will

depend on the structure of the financial system and on how it is regulated. Whether fiscal policy

is a problem or a solution will depend on the political circumstances of the government. The

extent to which everyone extrapolates the present and overreacts will depend on how many other

give rise to what is known in EU parlance as “convergence” – that is, to closing the gap between per capita incomes
in the poorer and richer member stats.

  Not simply because, like other agents, it gets carried away by the boom but also because it may have been forced
to contract public spending or raise taxes by more than is politically sustainable in the period when it was seeking to
quality for admission to the euro area, creating a tendency to relax fiscal discipline immediately thereafter –
something that the Stability and Growth Pact is designed to address but has not always succeeded in doing in
practice.

catch-up economies have experienced such problems previously and how successfully lessons

are drawn from their experience.9



    3.    Comparative Experience

         Figure 1 shows the behavior of real interest rates in catch-up economies adopting the euro,

other recent entrants to the euro area, and Poland. A sharp drop in real rates (constructed here as

the government bond rate adjusted for concurrent CPI inflation) is evident in Greece, Ireland,

Portugal and Spain. Rates drop from more than five per cent to the neighborhood of zero in all

four cases before moving back up.10 That there has been some reversal is not surprising: zero is

not an equilibrium level for real interest rates. In all four cases the decline in real interest rates

began several years before adoption of the euro. In four cases it persisted for several years

following the change-over.11

         It is harder to generalize about the remaining cases. In Slovenia real interest rates had

already declined to low levels in 2003, and with the country’s high income there was relatively

little Balassa-Samuelson inflation. It is thus not surprising that there is not much evidence of a

real interest rate decline as euro adoption drew near. Malta and Cyprus similarly have relatively

high incomes and well-developed financial systems. Evidently their relatively small and

specialized economies make for volatile real interest rates, complicating inference. In Poland

9
  Another way of understanding these points is in the context of exchange-rate-based stabilizations, which are close
cousins to euro adoptions. These are episodes where countries bring down inflation by pegging the exchange rate
and—hopefully—using that space to implement complementary policies. The decline in inflation is likely to be
gradual (though how gradual is a matter of dispute; see Sargent 1986). Interest rates will come down faster. There
will be a large capital account surplus and current account deficit as investment surges and flight capital is
repatriated. Households will go on a spending spree. Unless fiscal policy is tightened or other measures are taken to
damp down demand, there will be an erosion of competitiveness, and eventually boom will turn to bust. This can be
thought of as a more extreme version of the same phenomenon considered here. Models of the process include
Calvo and Vegh (1999) and Antolia and Buffie (2006).
10
   It is not surprising that the timing and, indeed, the shape of this reversal is different in Ireland, given that
country’s distinctive industry structure and sensitivity to global high-tech activity.
11
   In Portugal the trend was interrupted in 1999-2000.


                                                         6
real interest rates measured on the same basis as in the other countries have already come down

from 6 per cent to less than 4 per cent – that is, half way to a reasonable equilibrium level of 2

per cent. This would seem to imply that the need for a further adjustment and the danger of the

associated dislocations, while still there, are less than in the first four cases.

        The figures that follow consider the experience of these same countries in the two years

prior to euro adoption, in the two years following the changeover, and the two years after that

(see Figures 2 to 4).12 For Poland we use the two most recent years of data at time of writing.

        Growth and inflation trajectories are heterogeneous, not surprisingly given that these

variables are affected by myriad other influences in addition to euro adoption.13 Portugal

appears unusual in that its growth rate already slowed in its first two years under the euro, a

pattern that is not evident elsewhere. Either the competitiveness problem was unusually quick to

develop in Portugal, or something else in addition to euro adoption was working to depress

growth.14

        One explanation suggested by Blanchard (2006) is that Portugal’s exports have a

relatively low technology content, placing the country squarely in the sights of China.

According to the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks (2005),

some 60 per cent of Portugal’s exports are relatively low tech, compared to 30 per cent for the

euro area. Sustaining output and employment growth thus would have required a decline in unit

labor costs relative to other euro area members, where Portugal saw a substantial rise. This

explains why Portugal’s experience differed from Ireland’s and Spain’s, but it does not explain

why it differed from Greece’s. According to ESCB (2005), Greece had an even higher share of

low-tech goods in its exports than Portugal—67 versus 61 per cent—in 2000-1. (In contrast,

14
   Or both.


                                                       7
Spain had 41 per cent, Ireland 14 per cent.) Evidently, something else was at work in addition to

the technology content of exports.

        Another possibility is that real wages surged ahead even more strongly than in other

catch-up economies, both before and after euro adoption, owing not to market behavior but to

public-sector settlements. Comparing public- and private-sector wages shows that it was the

former that led the increase. In Portugal spending ministries did not face hard budget constraints

owing to the decentralized nature of fiscal policy making. The education ministry could agree to

generous increases in teachers’ pay (teachers being among their constituents) without having to

worry about how to fund them.15 Hallerberg and Wolff (2006) show Portugal as having weaker

budgetary institutions than Ireland and Spain according to their measures of procedural

centralization and agenda-setting power of the finance minister. And with public-sector wages

surging ahead, private-sector salaries followed.

        A related hypothesis is that Portugal entered the period with relatively large fiscal deficits

as a result of weak budgetary institutions.16 Even member states with relatively large deficits in

the late 1990s could become founding members of the euro area because they had the ability to

prevent the project from going forward, something that is not true of new EU members seeking

to join the euro area subsequently. And as a relatively small country, Portugal was then subject

to stringent application of the Stability and Growth Pact, its deficit/GDP ratio having risen

further to 4.2 per cent by 2001.17 That member states now seeking to adopt the euro will have to

show greater fiscal discipline in the two preceding years (since they lack leverage to block the

Industrial Relations Observatory (2007).
16
   The decentralization of budgetary procedures and the lack of agenda-setting power of the finance minister allowed
primary expenditure as a share of GDP to rise from 34 per cent of GDP in 1990-92 to 37 per cent in 1993-5, 38 per
cent in 1996-8 and nearly 41 per cent in 1999-2001. Data from Braga de Macedo (2007).

   Application has become somewhat less stringent as the country’s doldrums have deepened, allowing the budget
deficit to widen again.

process) is reassuring from this point of view. That they may similarly be subject to stringent

application of the Stability and Growth Pact is not unless one is sure that there would otherwise

be a tendency for fiscal policy to run out of control.



     4. A Closer Look at Credit and Real Estate Market Developments in Poland

        In this section we take a closer look at developments in Poland. Our focus is on credit

aggregates and developments in the real estate market.

        Since 2003, credit has grown more slowly in Poland than in any other Central and

Eastern European country.18 Figure 5 shows that credit to households and firms followed a

broadly similar pattern in Poland and in Central and Eastern Europe as a whole in the 1990s but

diverged thereafter. To be sure, even before 2000 there were differences between Poland and the

rest of the region: in Poland credit to firms grew unusually fast in 1998; credit to households

continued to increase until 2000 whereas it slowed down in the group of comparator countries.

But the most persistent and visible divergences are after the turn of the century. In the CEE-10 as

a group, credit to households expanded at rates in excess of 30 per cent per annum and peaking

in 2004 at a growth rate of nearly 60 per cent. In Poland, in contrast, the growth of credit to

households has remained relatively subdued, hovering between 10 and 20 per cent per annum

prior to 2006, when its growth rate reached 30 per cent. Even then, this credit aggregate was

growing at a slower path than the CEE-10 average. One explanation for this is that the

classification of bank loans as nonperforming was relatively rigorous and stringent in Poland (at

least through 2003). Having to classify a relatively large number of loans as nonperforming left

Polish banks cash strapped (Breuss, Fink and Haiss 2004). See also Figure 6. Subsequently,


18
 Throughout our comparison group is the CEE-10 made up of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Bulgaria.


                                                     9
loans previously classified as substandard were reclassified as satisfactory, and credit to

households took off (National Bank of Poland 2004).

          Credit to firms has grown more slowly both in Poland and the region as a whole. But the

contrast between Poland and the CEE-10 is equally dramatic. In Poland, credit to firms trended

downward in the first half of the present decade, actually shrinking in 2004-5. This is in contrast

to the CEE-10, where the growth rate was not only positive and significantly higher than in

Poland but also trending upward.19 Investment by Polish firms was therefore relatively subdued.

Firms used a significant portion of their retained earnings to pay off foreign-currency-

denominated liabilities. Possible explanations include the fact that demand growth was not as

buoyant as in CEE-10 as a whole, the relatively strict classification of loans as nonperforming,

which constrained lending to firms by Polish banks (as described above) and political uncertainty

(including some discussion of the possibility of reversing earlier privatizations). As with credit

to households, there are signs (in the data for 2006-7) that the period of very slow growth of

credit to firms may now be over. Still, experience to date is rather different than in the rest of the

region.

          Figure 7 disaggregates not by type of borrower but by currency of denomination. Again,

broadly similar movements (punctuated by temporary divergences like the rapid growth of

foreign-currency denominated credit in Poland in 1998) give way to persistent divergences after

the turn of the century. Between 2002 and 2007, both the domestic-and foreign-currency

components of credit to the private sector grow more slowly in Poland than in the rest of the




19
  The Czech and Slovak Republics also experienced negative growth rates of credit to firms at the beginning of the
decade, but those growth rates recovered fast.


                                                        10
region.20 Again, there are hints that the period of relatively subdued credit growth may be

coming to an end. In particular the growth of foreign-currency-denominated credit shoots up in

2006 at the same time that its growth is decelerating in the rest of the region. In 2007, Poland

follows the trend of the comparator group with a decrease in foreign currency credit. The

majority of Polish foreign currency loans are denominated in Swiss francs, but there are also

foreign currency loans in euros and U.S. dollars. The bulk of these foreign currency loans are

housing loans secured by mortgages.21 This suggests where risks may be concentrated going

forward.22

        The prices associated with these quantities can be seen in Figures 8-9. Figure 8 does not

point to big differences between Poland and the rest of the region in the cost of domestic- and

foreign-currency-denominated borrowing.23 Figure 9, which again distinguishes households and

firms, is more suggestive. The main change in recent years has been the significant decline in

the cost of loans to Polish firms, which was concentrated in the period 2001-2003. This may

have been due to growing competition from foreign banks, whose presence in the Polish market

increased significantly in this period. The cost of borrowing has also declined for households,

but less dramatically. The result is that borrowing costs for Polish firms are now

indistinguishable from those of firms in the euro area. Polish households, in contrast, continue to

face significantly higher costs than their euro-area counterparts. This suggests that if there is

going to be a further drop in interest rates with euro adoption, this will be mainly evident in loans




20
   While private credit in foreign currency in CEE-10 increased by 23 percentage points between 2002 and 2005, it
declined from 19 percent in 2002 to -3 percent in 2005 in Poland. The only other country besides Poland where the
growth of private credit was consistently negative in this period was the Czech Republic.

   We will have more to say about the Polish housing market below.

   See Luca and Petrova (2007) for an analysis of drivers of foreign currency credit to firms in CEECs.


                                                       11
to households, including those for housing-related purposes. Evidently, this is where concerns

over the credit-boom-and-bust phenomenon need to focus.

     Finally, the real estate market has behaved differently in Poland than the rest of the region

(see Figure 10). In the five years ending in 2007, housing prices rose by less than 2 per cent per

annum, slower than anywhere else in Central and Eastern Europe (Egert and Mihaljek 2007).

The behavior of rents is consistent with the relatively subdued behavior of prices: since the turn

of the century rents on cooperatively owned properties have essentially been flat in nominal

terms, while rents on privately and communally owned properties have risen by about 6 per cent

per annum, this in a period when CPI inflation has been averaging 3.5 per cent. But house prices

as a share of disposable income are the lowest of any EU country. The share of housing loans in

total commercial bank lending to households was lower than in any country but the Czech

Republic.24 The ratio of mortgage debt to GDP as of the end of 2006 was lower than anywhere

in the European Union except Romania and Slovenia. The rate of growth of that ratio from 2002

through 2006 was slower than anywhere but Slovenia. Mortgage debt per capita is lower than

anywhere but Romania. Loan-to-value ratios on typical new mortgages are as low or lower than

anywhere in the EU but Hungary.25 All this said, real estate prices have been frothy in the center

of Warsaw, and the fastest growing component of credit to households has been for housing.26

Roughly 40 per cent of those loans are foreign-currency denominated. Again this points to the

likely location of risks in the not-too-distant future.

     The fact that bank credit to the private sector as a share of GDP remains low—at 30 per cent

in 2006 considerably lower than in most of the comparator countries—similarly suggests that

there may be scope for a lending surge. In Ireland, Portugal and Spain the ratio of private credit

to GDP was in the range of 45 per cent to 75 per cent prior to the adoption of the euro and rose to

more than 100 per cent subsequently. Using earlier data, Cottarelli, Dell’Ariccia and Vladkova-

Hollar (2003) estimated an equilibrium ratio of bank credit to the private sector to GDP for a

country with Poland’s characteristics on the order of 70 per cent. Their estimate should now

probably be regarded as a lower bound.27 The size of the disequilibrium thus points to the non-

negligible possibility of a credit boom.



     5. An Econometric Analysis of Credit Market Dynamics

        One way of addressing the question of whether Poland is likely to experience a credit

boom is to build a model of the determinants of private credit (as a share of GDP) and to

extrapolate on the basis of forecasts of the independent variables. We use a balanced panel of

annual data for 50 middle-income countries including Poland and covering the period 1996-

2006.28 We estimate a model which includes factors driving demand and supply for credit

(building on previous studies such as Cottarelli, Dell’Ariccia and Vladkova-Hollar 2005):

                                  -         +          -        +


                 PCGDP = ƒ (INTR, RGDPC, INFL, INDX)                                   (1)


where PCGDP is the ratio of private credit to GDP, INTR is the average nominal interest rate,

RGDPC is GDP per capita in constant prices, INFL is the year-on-year CPI inflation rate, and

INDX is a financial openness index measuring the absence of capital controls. (LN in the table

below indicates that a variable is expressed in logs.) Specification tests tell us that the data
27
   The estimates in Egert, Backe and Zumer (2006) point to somewhat higher equilibrium levels, although the
authors emphasize the uncertainty surrounding their estimates. Those in Kiss, Nagy and Vonnak (2006) suggest
somewhat lower equilibrium levels. Details are in Appendix A.
28
   The sample is based on the World Trade Organization of middle-income countries. The Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Trinidad and Tobago graduated to the high-income category into 2006 according
to the WTO, as did Slovenia in 1997 and Singapore somewhat earlier. The country list and other information related
to estimation are in Appendix B.


                                                       13
should be entered in logs rather than levels; in the one case where this is not clear (that of capital

account openness), we enter the variable both ways. We also include country dummies where

these are needed to pick up shifts in the structural relationship.29

         Expected signs of the variables are indicated above where they appear in eqn. 1. We

expect the interest rate to enter negatively: as interest rates come down, whether for reasons of

euro adoption, because of unrelated capital inflows or otherwise, we expect private credit to

boom. Higher levels of per capita income are indicative of economic and financial development

and stability conducive to the growth of credit markets and the demand for credit. Low and

stable inflation should similarly be conducive to the development of credit markets. Finally we

expect a more open capital account (a higher value of INDX) to be associated with a higher

private credit ratio insofar as this is indicative of a more liberalized financial environment.

         Results are in Table 4. The “a” columns show the estimates when we control for country

fixed effects. (The two variants differ by whether capital account openness is entered in levels or

logs.) All coefficients are statistically significant and enter with their expected signs; the r-

squared is relatively high, and the Hausman test accepts the use of country fixed effects.

Estimates including time-fixed effects (not reported) differ in that the coefficient on INDX is not

significantly different from zero, but this version has a relatively low r-squared and, in any case,

the Hausman test rejects the use of time fixed-effects in favor of period-random effects. We

therefore report instead estimates using period random effects in the “b” columns. The Hausman

test accepts this specification, the distribution of residuals is normal, and the coefficients are all

significant. The one anomaly here, for which we don’t have an explanation, is the negative

29
   Most of these are quite intuitive. The list of retained country dummies is Brazil starting in 1998 (currency crisis
and inflation stabilization), Colombia starting in 2000 (new reporting system for data), the Dominican Republic
starting in 2003 (banking crisis), Indonesia starting in 1999 (currency and financial crisis), Suriname starting in 2002
(new data reporting system), Ukraine starting in 1998 (new and improved data reporting system) and Guyana
(reason for the structural break not clear to us).


                                                          14
coefficient on the capital account openness variable. Finally in the “c” columns we include both

country fixed and time random effects.30 The coefficients are all significant and have the

expected signs. We take this as the preferred specification.31

         Using this model we can ask whether Poland is a significant outlier. We construct the

fitted value of private credit to GDP for Poland for 2006 and compare it with the actual value.

As expected, the actual value of private credit as a share of GDP (33.3 per cent) is well below the

fitted values shown in Table 5. Our preferred specification in column 2c suggests that the

credit/GDP ratio in 2006 should have been 10 percentage points higher than its actual value.

(The country-fixed-effects-based estimates point to slightly smaller discrepancies but are

basically compatible. The time random effects estimates, with their anomalous coefficients on

the openness index among other things, point to much larger discrepancies.)

          Say that the discrepancy disappeared in two years (that the credit/GDP ratio rose by 5

percentage points in each year). With nominal GDP growing at 5 per cent, private credit in

nominal terms would have to be expanding at almost 10 per cent a year.32 This suggests that

there is scope for at least a modest credit boom if Poland converges to predicted levels of credit

in a relatively short period of time. That said, annual rates of growth of nominal credit of 10 per

cent are not as alarming as those seen in some other euro-adopting countries. And a ratio to



30
   We also considered a variety of other estimators, such as country random effects and two way random effects, all
of which yielded broadly compatible results but none of which were obviously preferred on the basis of the standard
specification tests.
31
   We also conducted a number of sensitivity analyses of the results. Most of the results were robust to estimating
the equation in first differences; only the coefficient on the interest rate showed instability. Estimating the equation
for the Central and Eastern European countries again produced similar results, although a smaller sample meant
lower levels of precision. In addition, limiting the sample to Central and Easern Europe allowed us to enter a
measure of nonperforming loans (as a share of GDP) – data that we do not have for other regions – which turned out
to be statistically significant as well. We did some exploration with other explanatory variables – the ratio of public
debt to GDP and a measure of corruption/transparency were statistically significant in some specifications. But we
stuck with our initial specification for purposes of counterfactual simulation so as to limit the danger of data mining.
32
   There are of course second-round effects: the rise in the denominator of the credit/GDP will raise credit growth a
bit more according to our estimates.


                                                          15
GDP of 43 per cent is not as alarming as the ratios in excess of 80 per cent in countries like

Estonia and Latvia in 2006.

           A more speculative way of using this model is to assume forecasts for the independent

variables for 2010 and to compute the predicted value of the dependent variable. We extrapolate

the independent variables linearly on the basis of recent growth rates. We then extrapolate the

dependent variable, asking what the credit ratio will look like in 2010 if things continue

unchanged.

           If the situation in 2005-06 persists, extrapolation suggests a credit/GDP of 58 per cent, up

from 33 per cent in 2006. Again this points to an annual rate of growth of nominal credit slightly

in excess of 10 per cent.33 If we extrapolate all the independent variables and use our preferred

model (column 2c), we get a predicted ratio for 2010 of 52 per cent. This suggests an annual

average rate of nominal credit growth on the order of 8 ½-9 per cent.



           6. Is There a Boom-Bust Cycle in Poland’s Future?

           How much at risk is Poland of the kind of boom-bust cycle that has afflicted other catch-

up economies adopting the euro? The answer turns, in our view, on four issues. First, how

dramatically will interest rates come down? Second, will wage discipline be maintained? Third,

will the government be able to resist pressure for increased public spending? Fourth and finally,

will bank regulators effectively restrain the impulse for an unsustainable credit boom? Our

answer to the first question, “not that dramatically,” is somewhat reassuring. Our answers to the

second, third and fourth questions, alas, are maybe, maybe and maybe.

           a) How dramatically will interest rates come down?



33
     Again assuming nominal GDP growth of 5 per cent per annum.


                                                       16
       Poland’s real interest rates have already come down half-way from typical catch-up-

economy levels to post-euro-adoption levels, as noted above, both because nominal interest rates

are relatively low and because growth is five per cent, lower than in cases like Ireland in the

1990s. This suggests that the financial impulse will be less than in earlier catch-up economies

adopting the euro. However, as shown in Figure 15, interest rates on loans to households are still

much higher in Poland than in the euro area. The decline in interest rates has been due mainly to

the decline in rates on credit to firms which still leaves scope for a significant impulse from

declining rates on credit to households.

       b) Will wage discipline be maintained?

       A key question is how labor market institutions will respond. As interest rates come

down with the adoption of the euro and spending increases, will the pressure of demand pass

through into wage settlements, eroding the competitiveness of exports? Evidence on what kind

of labor market arrangements encourage appropriate adjustments and which ones are conducive

to the kind of problems alluded to in the preceding sentence is notoriously fragile. For what it is

worth the hump-shaped hypothesis of Calmfors and Driffill (1988) suggests that both highly

decentralized and highly centralized/coordinated systems are likely to work relatively well in this

context. In highly centralized and coordinated labor markets, social pacts can be negotiated to

restrain the growth of wages in the boom period. In relatively atomistic markets, wages will be

free to adjust downward when the boom ends. In intermediate systems where union membership

and bargaining coverage are extensive but not encompassing or well coordinated, these happy

outcomes are less likely. Different sectoral unions will not internalize the implications of their

wage setting for wage setting by other sectoral unions. Leapfrogging will occur. It will be

difficult to negotiate a social pact to restrain wage inflation. Similarly, when the boom ends,




                                                 17
there will be resistance to being the first union to agree to wage reductions. Insiders, who shape

union policy, will have different incentives than their unemployed brethren.

        Poland appears to be fairly far out in the direction of competitive labor markets.34 Union

density is low by EU standards (union coverage somewhat less so, reflecting the ability of the

government to extend agreements by employers to non-unionized workers in the same sector

when this is a “vital social interest”).35 Employment protection legislation is modest by the

standards of Greece, Spain and certainly Portugal (which had the most restrictive regulations at

the beginning of the present decade).36 Wages in different sectors appear to move differently

depending on the particular demand conditions facing them.37 There is a very large effective

number of unions, according to Visser (2004) the largest number of any EU country.

Historically, there has been a relatively low correlation between public sector wages and real

wage growth in Polish manufacturing, which militates against Portugal-style wage inflation

driven by public sector settlements.38

        All this is reassuring. Indeed, labor market developments in recent years have not been

too bad. While productivity growth and labor force participation may not be all that could be

hoped for, the growth of unit labor costs has been contained, and competitiveness has been

maintained.39 Through 2007 the unit-labor-cost-based real exchange rate was still below 2000




34
   Precise rankings differ. That of Visser for 2003 ranks only France and the UK head of Poland in terms of degree
of labor market decentralization. See Visser (2004).
35
   This is required under the terms of the Labour Code (OECD 2004).
36
   See OECD (2004) and Boeri and Garibaldi (2006).
37
   See Stockhammer and Onaran (2006).
38
   Boeri and Garibaldi (2006) find a lower correlation in Poland and Hungary than in any of the other Central and
Eastern European economies (they do not, however, consider the Baltics).
39
   This is consistent with the view of Boeri and Garibaldi (2006) that not too much should be made of the slow
growth of employment, which reflects the continuing efforts of firms to streamline and reduce labor hoarding.


                                                        18
levels, an evolution that compares favorably with that in Hungary, the Czech Republic and

(even) Slovakia.40

        Less reassuring are two additional observations. First, relatively competitive labor

markets are likely to be less good at restraining wage growth during the boom than facilitating

adjustment during the bust. The euro-adoption boom will be real: with lower interest rates,

spending will surge, and with additional demand for domestic goods, labor markets will tighten

and wages will surge. This suggests that Poland will not avoid the boom-bust cycle, although the

bust may be less painful than elsewhere. Second, there is less than full agreement on the hump-

shaped hypothesis. We may know less about how institutional arrangements translate into labor

market outcomes than the preceding discussion suggests.

        c) Will the government be able to resist pressure for increased spending?

        Among the sources of wage pressure in the boom period are permissive public-sector pay

policies. This is a specific instance of the general problem of inadequate fiscal discipline in

booms. Theory suggests what kind of fiscal institutions are conducive to the maintenance of

fiscal discipline. The budgetary process should be centralized and give the finance minister

agenda-setting powers. Parliament should have limited options for disregarding the minister’s

deficit target. There should be obstacles to legislative amendments to the budget in mid-year,

but the finance minister should have options for restoring balance if the deficit widens.

        Hallerberg and von Hagen (2006) consider Poland’s fiscal institutions in this light.41

They give the country poor marks for budget preparation. Although the finance minister has

agenda setting power—he circulates a document specifying the target deficit—spending


40

41
 A number of other studies undertake this exercise, including Ylaoutinen (2005), Gleich (2006), and Frabizio and
Mody (2006). The advantage of the Hallerberg and von Hagen study is that the authors trace the evolution of
Poland’s budgetary institutions over time.


                                                       19
ministers can respond to his circular with individual budget bids, and their response can lead to

changes in the budget balance figure. Importantly, the final decision on the government’s budget

proposal is made by the full cabinet, not the finance minister, creating common-pool problems of

a sort likely to result in excessive deficits. Poland does better at the legislative stage. Parliament

cannot change the deficit target submitted by the government. The government can call for new

elections if parliament fails to adopt a budget. Finally, the country scores high in terms of

implementation. Changing the budget in mid-course is difficult (a supplementary law is

required), transfers of expenditures across budgetary categories require the approval of the

finance minister, and the finance minister has the power to block expenditures when the deficit

widens unexpectedly. Weighing these considerations, Hallerberg and von Hagen rank Poland

slightly above the Central and Eastern European average, behind Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia

but ahead of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.42

         There is some reassurance in the fact that the three Central and Eastern Europeans

coming in ahead of Poland are all strong-currency countries. (One has already adopted the euro,

one has a currency board, and one operates within the narrow-band ERM-II.) Overall, Poland

comes close to matching their combination of budgetary discipline and flexibility.43 It falls short

mainly because of the weakness of the finance minister. Although the finance minister can veto

transfers of funds across spending categories and take steps to narrow the deficit when it widens,

as noted above, he requires the consent and support of his cabinet colleagues heading up the

various spending ministries when formulating the budget, which often results in his being at their

   The data for these other countries are for 2002, their indicators not having been updated subsequently. Timing
appears to explain why the estimates in different studies differ. Thus, there was a new constitution in 1997 and a
new Public Finance Act in 1998 that significantly strengthened budgeting institutions in Poland. There also have
been changes over time in the power of the finance minister (which was greater in 2001 than 2006), and there are
differences in assessment depending on whether indices are constructed on the basis of interviews with policy
makers or statutory provisions. See the discussion in Hallerberg and von Hagen (2006), p.36.
43
   According to this particular ranking.


                                                         20
mercy. Polish finance ministers have repeatedly resigned or been dismissed for failing to get

their cabinet colleagues to agree to spending limits. This does not provide reassurance for how

the government will respond to the pressure for public spending created by a euro-accession

boom. The picture, perhaps inevitably, is mixed.

        d) Will regulators restrain the impulse for an unsustainable credit boom?

        The question here is whether the financial system is well regulated, creating confidence

that boom-and-bust dynamics will continue to be avoided as euro adoption approaches. In

support of a positive answer is the fact that Polish banks are well capitalized.44 There is the fact

that the Polish Commission for Banking Supervision (the precursor of the current Financial

Supervisory Authority) promulgated a set of best practices for mortgage-related lending in 2006.

The hope is that this will encourage banks to carefully manage both the rate of growth and

composition of their mortgage lending.

        It may help to put these issues in context. Financial reform in Poland started with the

Balcerowicz plan in 1990. This plan combined liberalization with macroeconomic stabilization

and aimed at creating the legal, economic, financial and administrative conditions needed for

transformation to a functioning market economy. Excessive issuance of money was halted, and

interest rates were raised to contain inflation.45 The National Bank of Poland (NBP) was

prohibited by the parliament from extending long-term credits to the government. Cheap credits

and preferential lending by the central bank to state owned firms were curtailed. Supervision of

the lending business of commercial banks was reinforced.



44
  See e.g. Cottarelli, Dell’Ariccia and Vladkova-Hollar (2003).
45
  Among the main challenges was the establishment of a stable, convertible, national currency, the reduction of the
high government deficit and external debt burden. Establishment of a demand and supply driven price system,
privatization and the establishment of free trade were only some of the additional measures included in the
Balcerowicz plan. For more details see Sachs and Lipton (1990).


                                                        21
        Yet the volume of non-performing loans continued to rise during the transition recession

of 1991-2.46 Banks had little incentive to provision against potential loan losses and some had

not accumulated enough capital reserves. In 1992 supervision was intensified to prevent

gambling to survive. Tighter capital requirements were implemented and the NBP acquired the

legal power to enforce capital adequacy and loss provisioning standards. The law also imposed

limits on how much a bank could lend to a single borrower.47 Polish banks were twinned with

Western banks to increase their knowledge of modern banking techniques. Employees were

offered additional training.48 Foreign banks were asked to rehabilitate a private domestic bank in

financial distress when entering the Polish market.

       Despite these efforts, the quality of Polish banks’ credit portfolios remained poor (Barisitz

2007). An Enterprise and Bank Restructuring Program (EBRP) was therefore adopted in 1993 to

address the undercapitalization and bad loan problems. Specialized regional banks were obliged

to undergo credit evaluations to qualify for the program. For those who qualified, one-time

recapitalization based on the value of their non-performing loan portfolios at the end of 1991

followed. Banks were also obliged to work out restructuring agreements with bad debtors or

forced bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation of those debtors within a fixed period. This

approach strengthened financial discipline on firms and forced banks to develop and provide

adequate risk assessment capacities.49 Restructuring was extended to the cooperative banking

sector in 1994. Two cooperative banks (PKO BP and PEKAO SA) and the state agricultural

47
   No loan could be for more than 10 percent of capital and total loans to a single borrower could not exceed 15
percent of capital (Mondschean and Opiela 1997).
48
   The IMF and the World Bank supported this effort (Mondschean and Opiela 1997).
49
   At the same time, the restructuring agreements with bad debtors failed to achieve fundamental changes in the
management and operation of non-financial firms. The restructuring agreements which banks signed with debtors
dealt primarily with financial conditions and did not address fundamental management or operational changes on the
part of the debtor.


                                                       22
bank (BGZ), were recapitalized in a more centralized approach compared to the above

mentioned program (Barisitz 2007).50

       In the mid 1990s, new accounting principles were introduced and a general deposit

insurance scheme was implemented. Bank privatization continued, although the state treasury

retained significant stakes. As a result, unclear property rights hampered bank restructuring. In

1997, banking supervision was reorganized and management processes modernized. A new

Independent Commission for Banking Supervision responsible for identification and decision

making concerning the design of supervisory regulations was established. Executive power

remained with the NBP. Foreign owners meanwhile were allowed to control a majority of the

equity of banks and the last remaining stakes of the state treasury were sold to private owners.51

Competition in banking increased with foreign owned banks expanding domestic retail business.

       Harmonization with EU legislation accelerated with the run-up to EU accession. In 1999

the NBP set two pre-accession priorities within the National Program of Preparations for

Membership in the European Union (NBP, 1999): the adjustment of the NBP for operation

within the European System of Central Banks and the harmonization of Polish banking

regulations with Community legislation. In 2004, with Poland’s accession to the EU, European

legislation on banking, such as the single banking license which aims at facilitating the set-up of

branches in different European countries, was introduced in the Polish market. In 2005, banking

supervision was again enhanced with the implementation of risk-based consolidated supervision.

       In 2006, “Recommendation S” (issued by the Commission for Banking Supervision on

March 15th, 2006) was introduced with the goal of improving the banks’ practices concerning


50
   According to Reininger, Schardax and Summer (2001), costs of recapitalization in Poland were lower than in any
other CEE country .
51
   For more details on privatization and consolidation of the Polish banking sector, again see Mondschean and
Opiela (1997).


                                                       23
credit exposure and strengthening risk management and disclosure to comply with international

practices. The risk weight on housing loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 50 percent was

raised to 100 percent. Default risk assessments and regular stress tests for the banks’ mortgage

portfolios were recommended. More information is to be provided to customers to increase their

awareness of risks of foreign-currency borrowing. Banks were advised to offer zloty loans first.

They were instructed not to apply lower customer creditworthiness standards when extending

foreign currency loans. Regulators also warned that further steps to curb foreign currency

lending would be implemented as necessary. All this suggests that vigorous supervision and

regulation limit the danger of an unsustainable credit boom in the run-up to the euro.

       At the same time, there are weaknesses in the supervisory framework. Barisitz (2007)

identifies “the often arbitrary and inefficient application of new regulations in Poland which also

reflects lingering deficiencies of the court system. Attaching collateral can be costly.

Information systems on credit histories have room for improvement.” Due to the short lending

history in Poland, foreclosure practices remain largely untested. IMF (2007a, p.30) has observed

that attempts to clamp down on foreign currency and housing credit growth might simply drive

business into the nonbank sector, which would increase supervisory challenges without reducing

the associated risks.



   7. Conclusions and Recommendations

       Financial stability in Poland has rested in recent years on a combination of systematic and

idiosyncratic factors that have moderated the rate of credit growth. By systematic factors we

mean things like a relatively strict approach to loan classification and other prudential

regulations, especially before 2004. By idiosyncratic factors we mean things like the behavior of




                                                 24
housing prices.52 The result has been to leave credit aggregates below the levels in other Central

and Eastern European economies and below the levels one would expect on the basis of the

experience of emerging markets generally.

        This observation frames the question of whether Poland is at risk of a boom-and-bust-like

credit cycle in the run-up to euro adoption. On the one hand the fact that Poland is an outlier,

credit-growth wise, accentuates the danger of a boom if one believes in mean reversion. Our

econometrics indicate that the fall in interest rates that will flow from expectations of euro

adoption will further feed that boom. On the other hand the fact that interest rates have already

converged part way to euro-area levels (and more extensively than in earlier adopters that

experienced a sharp fall in rates and a pronounced credit boom), especially in the case of lending

to firms, suggests that this shock may be less intense in Poland. And it is certainly conceivable

that the same policies and country characteristics (not always visible to the econometrician) that

have restrained credit growth in the past may continue to do so in the future.

        The broader literature also points to two set of factors, the first of which makes the

danger of an unsustainable credit boom more immediate, the second of which makes it more

remote. In the first category are the continuing limitations of the supervisory framework and the

weakness of the finance minister in the budget-making process. In the second are a record of

rigorous prudential supervision and the existence of relatively competitive labor markets.

        Thus, while Poland is not doomed to follow other euro adopters that have experienced

disruptive boom-and-bust cycles in the run-up to the euro, neither should this risk be minimized.

Policy makers must remain vigilant as the date of euro adoption approaches, and they must then




52
   Housing price developments are of course a consequence as well as a determinant of credit-market developments,
although they are affected also by other factors.


                                                       25
act in response to movements in interest rates, wages, housing prices and credit aggregates

signaling the immanence of this danger.

       A final somewhat reassuring factor is that Poland’s transition to the euro is unlikely to

occur for several more years. By that time a number of additional catch-up economies

presumably will have made the move to the single currency. Polish officials are aware of the

danger of the credit-boom problem that can accompany entry (Rybinski 2007). The more

countries that suffer from it—and the more that demonstrate how it can be successfully

averted— the more likely Polish policy makers are to draw appropriate lessons.

Country sample:
23 Latin American countries: Argentina (AR), Belize (BZ), Bolivia (BO), Brazil (BR), Chile (CL),

Guatemala (GT), Guyana (GY), Honduras (HN), Jamaica (JM), Mexico (MX), Nicaragua (NI), Panama

6 South-, East-Asian countries: China P.R.: Mainland (CN), Indonesia (ID), Malaysia (MY), Singapore

21 Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries (CEECs):
Albania (AL), Belarus (BY), Bulgaria (BG), Croatia (HR), Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Hungary
(HU), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Moldova (MD), Republic of Montenegro, Poland (PL), Romania
(RO), Russia (RU), Slovak Republic (SK), Slovenia (Sl), Ukraine (UA), Turkey (TR)

Korea, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA), Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia and Turkey were
excluded from the sample in order to have a balanced panel.

Time span:
1996 - 2006
Although the short time span suggests using quarterly data, we apply annual data and follow Brzoza-
Brzezina (2005, 24) who argues that “since the new Member States have undergone a deep transformation
and their time series are not particularly long, models, especially based on quarterly data, are not always
of top quality.”
