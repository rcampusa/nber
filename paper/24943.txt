Transportation and Health in the Antebellum United States 1820-1847

NBER Working Paper No. 24943

                                         ABSTRACT

I study the impact of transportation on health in the rural US, 1820–1847. Measuring health by
average stature, I find that greater transportation linkage, as measured by market access, in a
cohort’s county-year of birth had an adverse impact on its health. A one-standard deviation
increase in market access reduced average stature by 0.14 inches, and rising market access over
the study period can explain 37 percent of the contemporaneous decline in average stature, known
as the Antebellum Puzzle. I find evidence that transportation affected health by increasing
population density, leading to a worse epidemiological environment.
