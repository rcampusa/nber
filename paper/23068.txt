Is American Health Care Uniquely Inefficient? Evidence from Prescription Drugs
Margaret Kyle and Heidi L. Williams
NBER Working Paper No. 23068
January 2017
JEL No. H51,I1,O3

                                         ABSTRACT

Alan Garber and Jonathan Skinner (2008) famously conjectured that the US health care system
was “uniquely inefficient” relative to other countries. We test this idea using cross-country data
on prescription drug sales newly linked with an arguably objective measure of relative therapeutic
benefits, or drug quality. Specifically, we investigate how higher and lower quality drugs diffuse
in the US relative to Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK. Our tabulations suggest that
lower quality drugs diffuse more in the US relative to high quality drugs, compared to each of our
four comparison countries –consistent with Garber and Skinner’s conjecture.
