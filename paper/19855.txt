How Durable are Social Norms? Immigrant Trust and Generosity in 132 Countries

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the global prevalence of social trust and generosity among immigrants. We combine
individual and national level data from immigrants and native-born respondents in more than 130 countries,
using seven waves of the Gallup World Poll (2005–2012). We find that migrants tend to make social
trust assessments that mainly reflect conditions in the country where they now live, but they also reveal
a significant influence from their countries of origin. The latter effect is one-third as important as the
effect of local conditions. We also find that the altruistic behavior of migrants, as measured by the
frequency of their donations in their new countries, is strongly determined by social norms in their
new countries, while also retaining some effect of the levels of generosity found in their birth countries.
To show that the durability of social norms is not simply due to a failure to recognize new circumstances,
we demonstrate that there are no footprint effects for immigrants’ confidence in political institutions.
Taken together, these findings support the notion that social norms are deeply rooted in long-standing
cultures, yet are nonetheless subject to adaptation when there are major changes in the surrounding
circumstances and environment.

1. Introduction
     The nature and quality of social norms are important determinants of how individuals
behave and how well societies work. Social norms determine how readily, and how
happily, people pay taxes, return lost wallets, trust neighbours and strangers, co-operate
with others on and off the job, and respect the environment. But there is still relatively
little known about the extent to which social norms are malleable, and how they change
in the face of population migration.
     There are theories and evidence supporting two quite different perspectives on the
sources and persistence of social norms. On the one hand a cultural perspective stresses
that social norms are a durable trait transmitted from one generation to the next through
parenting activities and other aspects of early socialization. Alternatively, an experiential
perspective emphasizes that such norms are mainly based on experience in the
environment in which one lives. Analyzing the attitudes of immigrants is an effective
way to examine the relative importance of the two perspectives, as the experiential
perspective predicts that immigrants’ attitudes will be highly affected by their current
surroundings in the destination country, while the cultural perspective predicts that
immigrants’ social norms will be highly correlated with those prevalent in their birth
countries. In this paper we examine the global footprints of two important social norms,
i.e. social trust1 and generosity to show the relative importance of culture and experience
in each case.
     Most previous studies of the footprint of imported trust have related to migrants to a
single country, with some more recent use of a number of European countries as
alternative destinations. Those studies are subject to the problem of lack of generality. To
be of broader relevance, judgments about the relative importance of imported trust need
to be assessed using data drawn from a fuller range of source and destination countries.
     We might expect to find migration footprint effects for generosity, just as has been
done for social trust. But would the footprint be likely to be higher or lower in the case of
generosity? In contrast to the large number of studies on the footprint effects of social
trust, there is no corresponding research base for generosity. Our research aims to
partially fill this gap.
     Current evidence seems to support that institutional trust differs significantly from
social norms in ways that make it less likely to have a significant carry-over from
conditions in the immigrant’s country of birth. Whether these patterns hold for the global
sample is not yet known. Thus there is room for using global samples to test footprint


1
  What we refer to in this paper as social trust is sometimes alternatively described as general
trust, generalized trust, or interpersonal trust.

                                               2
effects for institutional trust and to compare them with those for social trust and
generosity.
    We expect social norms to have larger footprints than those associated with
judgments about institutions that are expected to differ from one country to the next. If
we find that immigrants and the native-born share the same judgments about the quality
of institutions in the destination country, then we can thereby argue with greater
conviction that the footprints of social norms like social trust and generosity are not
simply due to failure to notice the current environment, since rapid adjustment will have
already been witnessed for the case of local and national institutions.
    We test the relative importance of culture versus experience by examining the
immigration footprints for social trust, for generosity and for confidence in specific
national institutions making use of a fully global sample involving migrants to more than
130 countries. These data from the Gallup World Poll enable us to establish the
generality of footprint effects for two social norms, and to see whether footprint effects
are, as expected, much smaller or non-existent for measures of institutional trust.2
    We find significant footprint effects from their birth countries, in the case of social
norms– social trust and generosity, although on average immigrants largely come to share
the social norms of their new countries. Moreover, the footprint effect is larger for social
trust than for generosity. To see whether the social norms themselves are durable, and not
just that all opinions adapt slowly to new circumstances, we also assess the judgments
that immigrants form about the quality of the public institutions in their new countries.
We find no evidence of footprint effects in these cases, thus increasing our confidence
that social norms are indeed different.
    The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. We first give a detailed literature
review in Section 2. We then describe our data and estimation methods in Section 3. We
present our results for social trust, and continue with our comparable results for
generosity, and then contrast our footprint results for social trust and generosity with our
results for confidence in domestic institutions in Section 4. We summarize our
conclusions in Section 5.

2. Literature Review
    In this section we review previous studies of the cultural versus experiential
determinants of social trust, generosity, and institutional trust respectively.

2
 All of these analyses are based on the binary immigration status (either an immigrant or non-
immigrant). Unfortunately, years of migration are not known from the Gallup data. Therefore we
are estimating an average effect for all the migrants (among them some may arrive many years
ago while others may just come within the last year).

                                              3
2.1. Social Trust
    It has long been held that social trust is essential to the success of group ventures, and
especially to democratic governance. The important roles of social trust in the economy
and society are shown by the empirical linkages between social trust and a variety of
outcomes ranging from economic growth (Helliwell and Putnam 1995, Fukuyama 1995,
Knack and Keefer 1997, Tabellini 2010, Algan and Cahuc 2010, 2014, Guiso et al. 2006),
government efficiency (La Porta et al. 1997, Bjørnskov 2003, 2010, 2011), health
outcomes (Kawachi et al., 2008), and happiness (Helliwell and Putnam 2004, Bjørnskov
2008, Chang 2009, Helliwell and Wang 2011) to deaths from traffic fatalities and
suicides (Helliwell and Wang 2011, Nagler 2013).
    Social trust has been found to be transmitted from one generation to the next in many
countries (Algan and Cahuc 2010, Bjørnskov 2012, Dohmen et al. 2012, Guiso et al.
2006, Rainer and Siedler 2009, Rice and Feldman 1997). The reasons for the stability are
hypothesized to be based on parental socialization during childhood (Fernández 2011).
For example, beliefs in the trustworthiness of strangers are largely formed in early
childhood and remain relatively stable over the life course, at least in the absence of
major negative shocks (Dohmen et al. 2012, Katz and Rotter 1969, Tabellini 2008). But
other studies also find that the current environment plays an important role in shaping an
individual’s social norms (Dinesen 2012a, Nannestad et al. 2014). Studies on the
determinants of social trust confirm the importance of the social characteristics of the
communities in which an individual is currently living (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002,
Bjørnskov 2007, Glaeser et al. 2000, Helliwell and Wang 2011, Kosfeld et al. 2005).
    The cultural perspective, wherein trust is part of an enduring political culture, implies
that the trust footprint of migration would be long-lasting, as suggested in Almond and
Verba (1963), Putnam (1993) and Uslaner (2002). A series of papers all find a strong
correlation between the social trust of Americans and national averages of answers to the
same questions in their ancestral countries (Algan and Cahuc 2010, Bjørnskov 2012,
Guiso et al. 2006, Rice and Feldman 1997, Uslaner 2008). Remarkably, Rice and
Feldman (1997) find the correlations to be just as high for those whose grand-parents,
rather than parents, were born in the ancestral country. A study on immigrants to Israel
finds that those from the United States were more trusting of others than were those
coming from Russia (Gitelman 1982).
    Studies examining the relative importance of cultural and experiential impacts seem
to yield different answers, based on different data samples. A group of studies find that
the cultural impact is larger than the experiential impact. Uslaner (2008) uses individual-
level US General Social Survey evidence to separate the effects of inherited trust from
the effects of living among others from high-trust backgrounds. He finds some evidence


                                              4
for both, but concludes that the effects of inherited trust are greater than those of the
current context of social trust. Dinesen (2013), by exploiting individual-level data for
migrants to a number of European destination countries, finds support for both cultural
and experiential perspectives, but a much larger effect from experience for immigrants
from Western countries. Dinesen (2012b) finds similar results. A study of the source-
country trust footprint of individual Canadian immigrants from many countries revealed a
significant impact from source-country trust, but found the footprint to be smaller and
less significant for those whose families had lived longer in Canada (Soroka et al. 2006).
Similarly, Dinesen and Hooghe (2010) find that immigrants to Western Europe adapt
more to local trust levels in the second generation than they do in the first generation after
immigration.
    Some others argue that experience is more important than culture. For example,
Dinesen (2012a) examines the immigrants from three low-trust countries of origin
(Turkey, Poland, and Italy) to high-trust countries in Northern Europe. He finds that the
destination-country context has a large impact on social trust of immigrants, who show
significantly higher levels of social trust than comparable respondents in their country of
origin. Similarly, Nannestad et al. (2014) find that the institutions in destination countries
rather than culture matter for social trust by analysing immigrants from several non-
western countries to Denmark.

2.2. Generosity
     Generosity, like social trust, is an important social norm (Leeds 1963, Siu et al.
2006). It varies among communities and nations, and has positive consequences for the
communities where it prevails. Indeed prosocial behaviour has been argued to be an
essential underpinning for the large-scale social cooperation that permitted early human
groups to thrive (Wilson 1975). Individuals involved in prosocial conduct tend to be
happier (Aknin et al. 2011, Aknin et al. 2012, Aknin et al. 2013, Dunn et al. 2008).
International differences in generosity (as measured by the donation question in the
Gallup World Poll) are large, and have been found to be pervasively linked, both within
and among societies, to average differences in subjective well-being (Aknin et al. 2013,
Helliwell and Wang 2013).
     Studies highlight the importance of social and contextual influences in cultivating
generosity, especially during early adolescence, e.g. parental impacts (de Guzman and
Carlo 2004, Eisenberg et al. 2006, Ljunge 2014), the role of peer groups (Carlo et al.
1999, de Guzman and Carlo 2004, Eisenberg et al. 2006, Krupka and Weber 2009, Siu et
al. 2006), and the impacts of other environmental sources (Carlo et al. 2011, Eisenberg et
al. 2006, Grusec et al. 2002). Ottoni-Wilhelm and Zhang (2011) argues that parents will


                                              5
intentionally transmit generosity to their children since they place importance on the
child’s identity including generosity.
    No previous studies that we could find have studied the immigrant footprint effect for
generosity.

2.3. Institutional Trust
    Previous research on institutional trust has tended to show the importance of the local
context as well as rapid adjustment to new circumstances, both types of result being in
accordance with our expectations. Institutional trust is indeed important, both by
providing support for government actions (Chanley et al. 2000), and as a source of
happiness (Bartolini et al. 2013, Helliwell and Huang 2008, Helliwell and Wang 2011).
In terms of its determinants, studies have shown the importance of the current social and
economic contexts: institutional trust is strongly affected by institutional and economic
performance (Zmerli and Hooghe 2011). Chanley et al. (2000) find that political scandals,
increasing public concerns about crime rates, and negative perceptions of economic
conditions lead to declining trust in U.S. government. Stevenson and Wolfers (2011) find
that countries having significantly increasing unemployment rates tend to have falling
trust in national governments. Some other studies find that political corruption has a
strong negative impact on institutional trust (Chang and Chu 2006, Morris and Klesner
2010).
    There is some evidence that institutional trust judgments respond quickly to the
current environment, and hence that, in this case, experience trumps culture. Mishler and
Rose (2001) find that confidence in institutions is strongly affected by institutional
performance and economic performance in post-communist societies, but find little
support for cultural impact. Heineck and Süssmuth (2013) and Rainer and Siedler (2009)
both find strong convergence of institutional trust in West and East Germany after
reunification.3
    But still there is some piece of evidence showing the footprint effect of institutional
trust, e.g. Becker et al. (2011) finds that historical affiliation with the Habsburg Empire, a
relatively well-functioning and respected bureaucracy in European history, increases
current trust in courts and police.


3
  They also find that social trust does not converge: East Germans have a persistent level of low
social trust even after 20 years of reunification. The pattern of contrasting social trust versus
institutional trust is similar to ours, but they attribute the persistence of low trust in East Germany
to negative economic conditions experienced by many East Germans in the post reunification
period, rather than the cultural legacy.

3. Data and Methods
     The data we use are from seven waves of the Gallup World Poll conducted in 2005-
2012 in 160 countries. It is a repeated cross-sectional data set containing 941,201
observations. For the key variable social trust, we unfortunately have a smaller sample,
about 200,000 observations. It is mainly surveyed in 2009-2010, with only a few
countries in 2011-2012. The survey question is “Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted or that you have to be careful in dealing with people?” This
and similar questions have also been widely asked in recent decades in the World Value
Surveys/European Value Surveys (WVS/EVS), various national social and Barometer
surveys, to gauge the levels of social trust. Within and across nations, answers to the
social trust question have been shown to be reliable estimates of trustworthiness, as
measured by their strong positive correlation, at the national level, with the frequency
with which money-bearing wallets were returned to their owners when dropped in major
cities in 14 different countries (Knack 2001).
     Generosity is derived from the question on charitable donations “Have you done any
of the following in the past month? How about donated money to a charity?” The answer
to the question is binary. Since richer people might be more likely to donate money, we
adjust people’s response to the donation question for differences in household income by
regressing the donation variable on log household income in a linear probability model.
We take the residual of the regression as our measure of generosity.
     We also examine the footprint effect of institutional trust, several variables regarding
the perception of government and society, such as confidence in judicial system and
courts, confidence in police, confidence in national government, perceived corruption in
government, perceived corruption in business, whether respondents trust their assets and
property to be safe at all times if starting a business, whether respondents trust the
government to allow their new businesses to thrive. The responses to those questions are
all binary with values 0 or 1. We summarize all the variables derived from survey
questions in Appendix Table 8.
     The set of control variables includes age, gender, marital status, educational
attainment, the natural logarithm of net household income, and social support. Social
support is a binary response to “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends
you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?” The summary statistics
of those variables for immigrants are shown in Table 1. There are in total 43,305
immigrant respondents, but only 28,907 of them answer the question about their country
of origin. For those immigrants with country of origin, we are able to construct measures
for the countries of birth.



                                             7
    Since we also want to see whether immigrants have higher or lower social trust
compared to non-immigrants, we run regressions for all respondents. The summary
statistics of social trust and those independent variables for both immigrants and non-
immigrants are presented in Table 2.
    To examine the footprint effects of social trust and to compare trust levels of
immigrants and non-immigrants, we estimate the following equation:
                                                                                    (1)
    The dependent variable Yij is the individual level of social trust of respondent i in
country j. RTj is the average social trust in the country where the respondent currently
lives. STi is the average social trust in the respondent’s birth country. For non-
immigrants, the values in their birth countries are the same as in their countries of current
residence. The national-level social trust in the 132 countries is shown in Appendix
Table 9. We can see the percentage of respondents answering “yes” to the trust question
“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you have to
be careful in dealing with people?” varies a lot across countries, from 6.7% in Lebanon,
the lowest, to 63.0% in Denmark, the highest. IMij is a dummy variable for immigrants.
The vector Xij has all other personal and demographic information including age, age
squared, gender, marital status, educational attainment, the natural logarithm of net
household income, and social support. uij is the error term.
    We then confirm the footprint effect of social trust in the regressions for immigrants
only. We also investigate the footprint effect of generosity and a set of variables
measuring trust in institutions, such as confidence in judicial system and courts,
confidence in police, confidence in national government, perceived corruption in
government, perceived corruption in business, whether respondents trust their assets and
property to be safe at all times if starting a business, whether respondents trust the
government to allow their new businesses to thrive, for immigrants only. The equation
we estimate for this purpose is:
                                                                                       (2)
     The dependent variable Yij is the individual level of trust measure of immigrant i in
country j. RTj is the average trust in the country the respondent currently lives in. STi is
the average trust in the source country for those immigrants. The vector Xij has the same
meaning as in Equation (1) except that in this case the sample only includes immigrants.
eij is the error term.

4. Results
4.1. The Footprint of Social Trust: Culture and Experience Both Matter



                                             8
    Table 3 shows our OLS regression results4 using both immigrant and non-immigrant
respondents following Equation (1). In column (1) we include variables for age, gender,
marital status, and education, and in column (2) we include two additional covariates, log
household income and social support. The two columns give similar results, as both show
that immigrants’ judgements about how much other people can, in general, be trusted are
significantly correlated with trust levels in their birth countries and in the countries where
they now live. 5 The coefficients on imported trust are just under one-third as large as for
trust in the current country of residence. 6 The larger coefficient on trust in the country of
residence, as found by Voicu (2012) with European data, suggests that the experiential
effect is larger than cultural effect in the global sample, and that migrants from a given
country are more likely to have high levels of social trust if they have moved to a higher
trust environment. But we shall show later that the footprint effect is larger for those
moving from a lower to a higher trust environment than vice versa.
    By including all respondents, rather than just immigrants, in our sample, we can see
whether, on average, immigrants have either greater or less social trust than do those
living in their countries of birth. 7 Tables 1 and 2 show that the average levels of social
trust are similar for the global sample of immigrants (0.230) as for the entire group of
respondents (0.238). In column (1) of Table 3 the negative migrant coefficient shows that
when we account for individual demography migrants are slightly less trusting than the
native-born. However, the other columns show that this effect becomes smaller and
insignificant when we allow for other determinants of social trust.8 There is a research


4
  We also perform probit regressions to confirm that they produce essentially the same results.
For simplicity and ease of interpretation, we show here only the OLS results.
5
  Immigrants are included in our calculations of national averages of social trust, generosity and
institutional trust in current and origin countries. For a robustness check, we did regressions using
national averages excluding immigrant respondents and found very similar results.
6
  This calculation uses the estimated coefficients in the Table, in order to show the relative sizes
of the effects. Because of our use of a symmetric global sample, the distributions of imported and
current-country trust are very similar, so that a comparison of standardized betas for imported
(0.068) and current-country (0.235) gives essentially the same answer. But note that immigrants
are a selected (but not randomly) sample of the population in their country of origin, we should be
cautious to generalize the estimated correlations.
7
  Dinesen (2011a) shows that general trust refers to the same phenomenon for both natives and
immigrants and thus we can safely compare levels, causes and consequences of trust for the two
groups.
8
  That social trust among immigrants is no lower than among the native born reflects successful
adaptation, since immigrants, especially recent ones, are presumably less likely to know their

                                                 9
literature showing that people are far more likely to trust others when they have lived
longer in their communities (Helliwell and Wang 2011, Putnam 2007), and will be less
trusting where people from differing backgrounds have not had long to make the repeated
personal connections that support interpersonal trust. Thus immigrants might, on average,
have lower levels of social trust, since they have had less long to plant roots in their
communities (de Vroome et al. 2013). Soroka et al. (2006, Table 5.3) found that
immigrants to Canada had significantly lower social trust than other Canadians, even
after adjusting for the quality of their social networks, education, and other key variables,
but that this effect was entirely eliminated if account was taken of the footprint effect of
the levels (on average lower) of social trust in their birth countries. Putnam (2007) found
that social trust is lower in communities with high percentages of immigrants. He was not
able to adjust for immigrant footprint effects, so it is not easy to tell whether his finding is
due to recent US immigrants coming from countries with lower average levels of social
trust, as was found for Canada. Hooghe et al. (2009, Table 1) find social trust to be lower
among immigrants than non-immigrants in Europe; it is not possible to tell whether and
how much this result is due to an unmeasured footprint effect. Our global data show more
symmetric migration among countries of differing trust levels, so that immigrant and
other respondents have the same average levels of social trust whether or not we take
account of the levels of social trust in their countries of birth.
     In Table 4 we estimate the same models as in Table 3, but this time our sample
includes only immigrants following Equation (2). The results in Table 4 are largely
consistent with those in Table 3, assuring us that the results in Table 3 are not materially
affected by the inclusion of the much larger non-immigrant population. For migrants, and
equally for the total population, higher education is a strong positive predictor of an
individual’s trust in others,9 while the log of household income has no effect.
     Across our whole global sample, those who have migrated from countries of lower
trust to places of higher trust are about 20% more numerous than those who have moved
from higher-trust to lower-trust countries (3,588 vs. 3,076), as shown in Table 5. In that
table we estimate our base model separately for these two groups of migrants in column
(1) and (2) respectively. In column (3) we estimate the base model for all migrants but
include a dummy for migrants from a lower-trust to a higher-trust country, and its
interaction with trust in country of origin. Since including other these variables makes



neighbours, which other research (e.g. Sturgis et al. 2011) has shown to be a strong predictor of
social trust.
9
  The positive linkage between higher education and social trust seems to be quite general and
robust, although the precise reasons remain speculative. See Helliwell and Putnam (2007).

                                               10
only a small difference to the coefficients on current-country and birth-country trust,10 we
use the simpler model in Table 5 to provide larger sample size.
    The sum of coefficients on birth-country and current-country trust is higher in model
(1) than in model (2) of Table 5. This is because the column (1) sample, covering those
moving to higher-trust countries, has been selected to include those for whom current-
country trust is higher than birth-country trust. The coefficients on both home-country
trust and birth-country trust are higher for immigrants who have moved from a lower-
trust to a higher-trust country. The coefficients on current-country trust are similar in the
two cases, while for source-country trust the coefficient is much higher for migrants born
in lower-trust countries. The test in column (3) shows the difference to be significant at
the 5.4% level. This suggests that people from low-trust environments remain more
affected by the low trust in their country of origin than are migrants from higher-trust to
lower-trust countries. This asymmetry, with migrants from high-trust environments being
less likely to bring the high trust from the country of origin to the current country of
residence,11 suggests that social trust is harder to build than to destroy.

4.2. Generosity: Evidence of Footprints for Prosocial Behaviour
    Since generosity and social trust are both important social norms, they are both likely
to be learned in youth and possibly relearned when times change or people migrate to a
new and different society. Thus we might expect that the migration footprint effects we
find for social trust have some echo in the data for generosity. The Gallup World Poll
asks respondents if they have given to a charity in the past 30 days. International averages
vary a lot, from below 10% in 15 countries to over two-thirds in eight countries.
    When people move from one country to another, is their generosity in their new
country of residence determined by the social norms where they now live, or is it also
determined in part by the prevalence of generosity in their countries of origin? Table 6
estimates Equation (2) using only immigrants, showing that migrants tend to adapt fairly
fully to the norms of generosity in their new countries. However, as we expected, there is
for all migrants taken together a significant footprint effect from the norms in their
countries of origin.12

10
   As can be seen by comparing columns (1) and (2) in Table 4.
11
   This is different from Ljunge (2014) who find that, among immigrants to Europe, very high
trust might be persistent even in low trusting environments through cultural transmission in the
family, however the low trusting environments in Europe may not be very low, compared to
many less developed countries included in our sample.
12
   We also tested to see if there was an asymmetry for the generosity footprint analogous to that
shown in Table 5 for social trust. The generosity footprint is higher (but insignificantly so) for

                                               11
4.3. Trust in National and Local Institutions: Experience Trumps Culture
    In this section we estimate the same model as in column (1) of Table 6 for various
measures of institutional trust, to see if there is any footprint effect. Our main
presumption is that the footprint from confidence in the same institutions in their birth
country will be much smaller than was the case for social trust, and may well not exist.
This is because institutions are more readily seen to differ among countries than is human
nature. Social trust assessments are more likely to depend on judgements about human
nature, while assessments about local institutions are likely to depend on their features
more than on those of the corresponding institutions in the immigrant’s country of birth.
Our results in Table 7 support this presumption, as they consistently show strong effects
from the current country but no footprint from similar judgments in the source country.
    There may be other reasons, beyond a footprint effect, for immigrants and others to
value institutions differently. For example, Maxwell (2010) finds evidence among
migrants to Europe that confidence in political institutions is higher among first-
generation immigrants than among the native-born, a result he attributes to optimism due
to their choice to move to the new environment in hopes of improving their lives (de la
Garza et al. 1996). There is some evidence of such an effect in our global sample. On
average, immigrants are slightly more likely to trust all local institutions than are the
native-born. When we allow for differing immigration shares, and compare immigrants’
trust assessments with those of the native-born in the same country, immigrants remain
more trusting than the native-born for trust in the judicial system and trust in the national
government.13

5. Conclusions
    Data from large samples of migrant and non-migrant respondents to the Gallup World
Poll have permitted us to establish some fairly general conclusions about the links
between immigration and social norms. First, we have generalized earlier findings that
migrants tend to make social trust assessments that mainly reflect conditions in the


those moving from more generous to less generous countries. In this case, the slight asymmetry
favours the idea that prosocial habits may be contagious, and hence easier to establish and
maintain than social trust.
13
   The first estimate uses the whole global sample of respondents, allowing only for wave effects.
The second includes fixed effects for each country, so that immigrant trust is being compared to
that of native-born in the same country. The remaining significant coefficients are +0.037
(se=0.008) for trust in the judicial system and +0.046 (se=0.010) for trust in the national
government.

country where they now live, but nonetheless show a significant footprint effect from
their countries of origin. For our sample of migrants to 132 different countries, the
average size of the footprint effect is about one-third that of the effect of local conditions.
We also found that the footprint effect seems to be smaller for those who move from
higher-trust to lower-trust nations, suggesting that social trust may be harder to create
than to destroy.
    Second, we found that for our global sample of migrants and non-migrants, their
average levels of social trust are the same, after adjusting for footprint effects and each
individual’s own personal trust-supporting circumstances.
    Third, we found that the altruistic behaviour of migrants, as measured by the
frequency of their donations in their new countries, is strongly determined by social
norms in their new countries, but also has significant footprint effects from their countries
of origin. These results are the first to investigate footprint effects for the altruistic
behaviour of immigrants.
    Finally, we found, as expected, that confidence in local institutions of several types is
influenced by the quality of these institutions (as measured by the assessments of others)
and not at all by the quality of the same institutions in their countries of origin.
    Our results appear to us to be mutually consistent. Taken together, they support the
notion that social norms are deeply rooted in long-standing cultures yet are nonetheless
subject to adaptation when there are major changes in the surrounding circumstances and
environment. Migration provides a strong test, as it takes individuals brought up in one
culture and transfers them to another. Although migrants tend to associate in their new
countries with others from the same source country, we find nonetheless that two
important social norms, as represented by social trust and generosity, adapt substantially
to the prevailing norms in their new countries of residence. Nonetheless, the continuing
importance of cultural and social norms established in earlier life is demonstrated by the
significant footprint effects that we find for both social trust and generosity.
    Our results showing no footprint effects for confidence in specific institutional
features of immigrants’ new countries confirm that our previous footprint results are not
simply evidence that people are slow to absorb the features of their new environment.
When asked specific questions about the institutional features of their new countries,
immigrants’ answers reflect the characteristics of those institutions, with no footprint
from the quality of the institutions in their countries of birth. Thus the footprint results for
trust and generosity have strong claims to reflect broader social norms, just as we and
others have argued.
