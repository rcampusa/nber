        This   paper carefully outlines a method for the calculation of

average marginal tax rates. The method is applied to Statistics of

Income data for dividend and interest income earned by U.S. households

from 1954 to 1980. To illustrate the effects these data can have in

empirical work, the tax rates are used in comparing the sample moments

of before and after—tax real yields on financial assets.

I. Introduction

      Numerous macroeconomic problems require an ajrer.ate measure of

the applicable marginal tax rate. In a microeconomic context, exact

marginal tax rates may be obtained. When macroeconomic data are used,

however, a single rate must be computed for each type of income. It is

the purpose of this paper to :   (i) provide a method for the calculation

of average marginal tax rates1 for dividend and interest income earned

by households, and (ii) present calculations of these rates for the

United States for the period from 1954 to 1980

       These rates will find applicability in several areas. For

example, in any portfolio problem involving the demand for real asset

balances, the relevant returns are presumably the real after-tax yields

on the assets (see, for example, Friedman(1983)) .   This   distinction

produces nontrivial changes for the important household sector, which

accounted for 71% of all US financial assets held as of year-end 1982.2

Marginal tax rates applicable to aggregate household data are not

readily available for recent years.3

      Another application involves providing empirical content to

theories of capital formation and taxation (see, for example, Feldstein




    1The term "average marginal rates" may sound hopelessly oxymoronic
     to some. Purists may replace it with the more careful "weighted
     averages of marginal rates."

    2Derived from Flow of Funds data: total household financial assets
     as a percentage of all financial assets (households, non— finan-
     cial business, foreign,U.S. governnient, and State and Local
     governments).

    3me last known attempt at carefully estimating interest and divi-
     dend income marginal rates seems to be Wright (1958). These esti-
     mates range only through the late 1950's. !ore recently, Barro
     and Sahasakul (NBER Working Paper 1060) have estimated overall
                                         -2-

(1976)). Finally, these rates might be used to compare actual tax rates

with those arising from optimal taxation norms.

          In section II, we outline the precise method of calculation.

Section III presents the calculated rates. section IV iIlutrites the

effect of applying average marginal tax rates to real financial asset

yields.


II. Method of Calculation

          All the data employed come from the 1954 through 1980 issues of

the IRS Statistics of Income for individual tax returns.4 Dividend and

interest income data are reported according to filing status and

adjusted gross income (AGI) class. Statutory marginal tax rates, also

reported by AGI class, are collected from the relevant tax rate schedu-

les for each year.5

          The essence of the method employed here is to calculate a

weighted average of the statutory marginal rates. The weight for each

income class is the amount of dividend or interest income in that

cla8s.6 Complications arise because the reported AGI classes used to




      average marginal income tax rates.

     4The most recent data available are the 1980 returns.

     5me filing statuses reported for tax rates and income categories
      varied from year to year. For a detailed listing of the filing
      status assumptions made in calculating the weighted average rates,
      see the appendix at the end of this paper.

     6Dividend and interest income are both taxed at the regular income
      rate. Only the difference in the distribution of interest and
      dividend holdings causes the weighted averages to differ.
                                             —-,—


present data for interest and dividend income are not the same as the
AGI classes for marginal rates; hence there is a inatchup problem. We

used the following scheme for weighting:

                (1) If AGI categories match, apply the (income) weight to

                      the (tax) rate.

                (2) If several rates correspond to one weight, divide up

                      the weight according to the spacing of the AGI cate-

                      gories for rates.

                (3)   If several weights correspond to one rate, apply the
                      rate to each weight.

We considered an alternative interpolative solution to the mismatch

problem:

                (1) Construct a histogram of the weights

                (2) Smooth the histogram by linearly connecting the mid-

                      points of the bars.7

                (3) Apply the weights implied by the areas under the

                      smoothed histogram to the rates.

The average rates calculated under this alternative method did not

differ appreciably from those of the first, and so we used the simpler

first method.

        For clarity, we present in Table 1 a hypothetical example which




    71n the descriptive statistics literature, this is called a
     "frequency polygon".
                                             —4—

illustrates precisely the method described.

                  Average Marginal Rate =     Total(7)/Total(2)   =    .4172



          Note in the table that income is reported for AGI classes 0-2000,

2—4000, 4—6000 and 6-10000, while rates are reported for 0—2000,

2-7000,7-9000 and 9—10000. Thus in this example we compute the weighted

rates as follows:

                 (1) In the first row, rate and weight categories match

                     and so we apply the rate (.2) to the weight (20,000)

                     for a numerator entry of 4000.

                 (2) The rate .4 applies to weight categories 2—4000 and

                     4—6000, and so we apply it to both.

                 (3) The rate .4 also applies to the 6—7000 weight cate—

                     gory. However, our weight data appear only for the

                     range 6—10000, and   so   we allocate the the 6-7000 por—

                  tion   of the weight according to the spacing of the

                  rate AGI categories: 6-7000 (25%), 7—9000 (50%) and

                  9-10000 (25%). Thus, 25% of 30,000 is multiplied by

                  .4, 50% by .6, and 25% by .9,   yielding   the entries in

                  column (7)


III. Average Marginal Tax Rates


        Table 2 presents the average marginal tax rates for household

interest and dividend income for 1954—1980. The 1964 tax cut has a pro-

nounced effect on both tax rates, while other tax measures seem to pro-

duce little noticeable changes. Since then, note that both interest and

dividend tax rates follow a general upward trend.

IV. An Example: Real Yields and Portfolio Effects


      Asset demand functions are typically assumed to result from an

agent's optimization process. Thus it is marginal, not average, tax

rates which are of primary interest. As an example of the effects of
                                         —7—

applying these rates, in Tables 3 and 4 we consider before and nfter—tax

quarterly returns on five assets: money, time deposits, short term

bonds, long term bonds, and equities. The nominal returns are,

respectively: zero; the regulated ceiling on small time deposits; the

4—6 month commercial paper rate; the BAA corporate bond rate plus the

annualized capital gains on these bonds (as calculated from the consol

approximation); the S&P 500 dividend—price ratio plus the annualized

capital gain on equities (from the S&P 500 stock price index). In each

case, the appropriate tax rate from Table 2 is applied to the interest

or dividend component of the yield. Then, the actual rate of inflation

in the CPI is subtracted to form a real yield. In addition, we use a

capital gains tax rate as calculated by Feldstein, Poterba and

Dicks—Mireaux

      Note in Table 3 that the inclusion of marginal tax rates changes

the sample mean of the return on short bonds from positive to negative.

In Table 4, the after tax variances are smaller for the returns on long

bonds and equities, but they are larger for the returns on time deposits

and short bonds. Such differences in both means and variances can bear

important implications for implied optimal portfolio behavior.
