1.       Introduction

         The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (hereafter TRA '86) significantly changed the tax environment faced

by U.S. firms with operations abroad. One interesting byproduct of the Act is its widening of the gap

between the treatment of income earned by financial service subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals and income

derived from manufacturing operations. Among other changes, the Act made it substantially more difficult

to defer U.S. taxes on overseas financial services income of U.S. firms. In this paper we investigate

whether this “tightening” of the anti-deferral rules affected the location of assets held abroad in U.S.

financial affiliates.

         Under U.S. tax law, income earned by U.S. firms in foreign jurisdictions is subject to U.S.

taxation.1 However, the active income from foreign operations that are organized as subsidiaries is not

subject to U.S. taxation until it is repatriated to the U.S. parent corporation. The ability to defer U.S. tax

liabilities on foreign-source income creates incentives for firms to locate operations in low-tax, or tax

haven, jurisdictions. The “Subpart F” provisions of the tax code, enacted in 1962, are designed to hamper

the ability of firms to avoid U.S. taxes on international income permanently by retaining it abroad in low-

tax countries.

         As we explain further below, changes made in 1986 to the Subpart F provisions essentially

eliminated deferral on active financial services income. These rule changes (which were recently modified

for the tax years 1998-2001) were not applied to other forms of active income. As a result, TRA'86

created an environment in which the tax incentive to locate operations in low-tax jurisdictions depends on

the “type” of active income the subsidiary is expected to generate. After TRA'86, there is still a tax

advantage to locating manufacturing operations in low-tax countries since these operations generate active

income that enjoys deferral. However, this tax incentive was greatly diminished for subsidiaries that

generate relatively large amounts of active financial services income.

. See Hines and Hubbard (1995) for a brief summary of U.S. tax policy towards multinational corporations.

                                                       1
         The policy changes in TRA'86 targeted at financial services income provide an opportunity to

examine how the location decisions of U.S. multinational corporations respond to taxation. In particular,

we use information from the tax returns of U.S. corporations for 1984, 1992, and 1994 to examine how

local taxes affect the allocation of assets held abroad in financial services firms before and after the Act.

We focus on the hypothesis that, by effectively eliminating deferral on active financial services income,

TRA'86 diminished any role played by host taxes in influencing the location decisions of U.S. firms with

financial subsidiaries abroad.2 Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. We find that, before the

Act, the location of assets in financial subsidiaries was responsive to differences in host country effective

tax rates across jurisdictions. However, since the Act, the location of assets in these subsidiaries is not

sensitive to variations in effective tax rates across countries. Host country effective tax rates no longer

explain the distribution of assets held in financial services subsidiaries.

         Our results for financial subsidiaries contrast with recent work by Altshuler, Grubert, and Newlon

(1998), hereafter AGN, on the mobility of capital in manufacturing subsidiaries. Those authors find that

capital in manufacturing subsidiaries has become more sensitive to tax rate differences across foreign

jurisdictions in recent years. Although we have a smaller sample than the one used in AGN, our results for

the manufacturing subsidiaries in our sample are qualitatively similar.3 We also find that capital held in

manufacturing subsidiaries has become more responsive to variations in effective tax rates across

countries.

         We estimate tax elasticities of assets that control for unmeasured country fixed effects. We find

that fixed country effects play a large role in explaining differences in the stock of assets in financial

services affiliates across jurisdictions. Our results suggest that policymakers should not rely solely on
2
 . Other provisions of TRA'86 also have the effect of decreasing the importance of local tax rates for the location of
assets in financial subsidiaries. These rule changes, which modify the calculation of the tax credit U.S. firms are
allowed against U.S. tax liabilities for taxes paid to host countries, are discussed in section two.
3
 . As we explain further below, our sample includes manufacturing affiliates of all U.S. parents. AGN focus on
manufacturing affiliates of manufacturing parents. We were unable to obtain this level of detail from the Internal
Revenue Service.

simple cross-sectional estimates of the responsiveness of financial assets to tax rate differences when

asking questions concerning the role of taxes in the location decisions of this industry.

         For the financial services industry, the changes embedded in TRA'86 moved the U.S. tax system

closer to one in which “capital export neutrality” is preserved for investments in low-tax countries. Capital

export neutrality holds when investors pay the same level of taxes on investment projects regardless of

where they are undertaken. Our results suggest that, as intended, TRA'86 decreased the importance of

local taxes in the location decisions of financial services firms. While manufacturing firms can continue to

exploit differences in effective tax rates to minimize tax liabilities, financial service firms have much less

latitude to do so.

         An open question is the extent to which TRA'86 has impacted the competitiveness of U.S. financial

service firms who must compete for international market share with subsidiaries of firms from countries in

which foreign-source income is exempt from taxation (“territorial” tax systems). Previous research on the

impact of TRA'86 on the operations of the financial services industry abroad has, for the most part,

focused on how the Act affects hypothetical U.S. firms (see Horst 1997; Dunahoo, Lyon, and Merrill,

1997; and PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1998).

         Horst (1997) calculates the effective tax rate in a low-tax country faced by a hypothetical

subsidiary in the property and casualty insurance business. He contrasts the effective tax rates faced by

subsidiaries with parents in the U.S. with effective tax rates that might be faced by subsidiaries with home

bases in other foreign countries.4 He finds effective rates of taxation for affiliates with U.S. parents that

are as much as 145 percent higher than those faced by affiliates from other countries.5 These higher
4
 . The countries are Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany,
France, Denmark, Sweden, and Canada. Horst points out none of these countries applies current taxation to the
active business income of subsidiaries in the financial services sector.
5
 . This calculation assumes that the affiliate is located in a host country with an effective tax rate of 14.3 percent.
The total tax on the affiliate depends on the size of the tax (if any) imposed by the resident country on the income
earned in the host country and when it is imposed. Prior to TRA'86, the U.S. affiliate would not have been liable
for any residual U.S. tax on (active) income until the income was repatriated. Under TRA'86, the U.S. affiliate is
taxed an additional 20.7 percent on the income earned in the host, regardless of whether it is repatriated. This
residual tax liability raises the U.S. tax burden to the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent (14.3 + 20.7). Of the eleven
                                                           3
effective tax rates are mainly the result of the 1986 changes to the Subpart F rules that eliminate deferral of

U.S. tax on active financial services income.

        Dunahoo, Lyon, and Merrill (1997) focus on the total tax burden of a hypothetical life insurance

subsidiary incorporated abroad. They also find that the Subpart F rules under which certain financial

services income is currently taxed may have important effects on the competitiveness of U.S. multinational

corporations.6 In their example, a life insurance subsidiary with a U.S. parent faces a total tax burden that

is 24.1 percent greater than an identical subsidiary with a French, German, Dutch, or British parent.

        While suggestive, this research has not uncovered whether the competitive position of U.S. firms in

the financial services industry has changed due to the Act.7 This is most likely because data on the market

share of U.S. and foreign financial services firms in host country markets (low-tax countries, in particular)

from before and after TRA'86 is necessary to address the competitiveness issue. We were unable to locate

a set of data rich enough to include market share information over the required time period for both U.S.

financial services affiliates and affiliates of parents incorporated in “territorial” countries (or any other

country that does not apply current taxation to active financial services income). Instead we focus on

whether moving the tax system towards capital export neutrality has had any impact on the role played by

taxes in the location of assets in financial services subsidiaries abroad.

        In this respect our work is similar to that of Desai and Hines (1999), who examine the impact of

TRA'86 on the joint venture activity of U.S. corporations. The Act made changes to the rules governing

the calculation of the foreign tax credit which reduced the attractiveness of investing in international joint

ventures, particularly those located in low-tax jurisdictions abroad. Desai and Hines provide evidence that

countries examined, the affiliates of four (France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Hong Kong) face no additional home
country tax. The remaining hypothetical affiliates face additional resident country taxes ranging from 1.4 percent
(in Sweden) to 6.6 percent (in Japan).
6
 . These calculations (and the ones in Horst, 1997) are made in the absence of the one-year exception from Subpart
F enacted in 1997 and extended (and modified) in 1998 and 1999. We discuss these new provisions below.
7
 . An exception is a study of the shipping industry by Price Waterhouse (1997). Under TRA'86, all foreign
shipping income is subject to current U.S. taxation (an exception for shipping income reinvested in qualified
shipping assets was available from 1975 to 1986). The Price Waterhouse study finds that the U.S. owned share of
the world’s shipping fleet declined from 26 percent in 1975, to 14 percent in 1986, to only five percent in 1996.
                                                        4
U.S. participation in joint venture abroad fell substantially after 1986. To test whether the pattern of joint

venture activity across countries was consistent with the tax incentives created by TRA'86, they compare

changes in measures of business activity in minority-owned U.S. affiliates abroad (joint ventures) before

and after the Act with similar data for majority-owned U.S. affiliates abroad.8 Majority-owned affiliates

are a natural comparison group for this policy experiment because the provisions in TRA'86 affecting the

foreign tax credit calculation of joint ventures did not apply to this organizational form. The results in

Desai and Hines, derived from U.S. Commerce Department data, provide strong evidence that the

organization of U.S. business abroad is sensitive to changes in the U.S. tax treatment of international

income.

          The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief legislative history of

the anti-deferral (Subpart F) regulations along with a discussion of other tax law changes in TRA'86

affecting the financial services sector. Section 3 discusses the methodology we use to measure the

sensitivity of location decisions to effective tax rates and describes the tax return data. Our results are

presented in section 4. The final section concludes and offers suggestions for future research.



2.        A Brief Legislative Review

          To place the provisions of the Tax Reform Act we study in context, we begin with a brief overview

of the pertinent U.S. tax rules. We start with the basics before moving on to the specific changes to the

Subpart F provision that are the focus of the paper. U.S. multinationals are taxed on income earned both

inside and outside the United States. To prevent income earned abroad from being taxed twice, the U.S.

 . Desai and Hines (1999) measure the impact of local tax rates on changes in equity holdings, royalty payments,
and leverage ratios in joint ventures and majority-owned affiliates between 1982 and 1989. The changes in the
rules for calculating foreign tax credits enacted with TRA'86 increased the cost of equity capital in joint ventures
relative to majority-owned affiliates and, consequently, increased the attractiveness of transferring technology and
debt to overseas affiliates particularly in low-tax jurisdictions. Consistent with the tax incentives created by
TRA'86, they find that local tax rates have a positive and significant effect on the difference in growth rates in
equity holdings between minority- and majority-owned affiliates, a negative and significant effect on the change in
royalty payments, and a negative and significant effect on the change in leverage ratios.

allows firms to claim foreign tax credits for income taxes paid to foreign governments. These tax credits

can be used to offset U.S. tax liability on foreign-source income. For example, suppose a multinational

corporation earns $100 in a country with a 25 percent tax on corporate profits while the current corporate

tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent. Under the foreign tax credit system, the multinational is allowed to credit

the $25 tax paid to the foreign government against the $35 owed to the U.S. government, leaving a residual

U.S. tax liability of $10 on the $100 of foreign-source income.

        A limitation on the credit prevents U.S. firms from using foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. tax

liabilities on income earned at home. The limit is the amount of tax that would be due if the foreign income

were earned in the U.S. Suppose now that the multinational earns $100 in a country with a tax rate of 45

percent. Since the U.S. tax rate is 35 percent, the foreign taxes paid ($45) exceed the U.S. tax liability

($35) on the $100 of foreign-source income. A firm in this situation is said to be in an "excess credit”

position because it has more foreign tax credits than can be claimed in the current year.9 The same firm

would be said to be in an “excess limitation” position if it had earned the $100 in a country with a tax rate

below the U.S. rate.

        In some situations, the foreign tax credit system allows firms to use excess credits from one source

of foreign income to offset U.S. tax payments on income from another source – a procedure known as

"cross-crediting" or “averaging.” To understand how cross-crediting works, we assume that the

multinational firm earns $100 in each country --- the low-tax country with a tax rate of 25 percent and the

high-tax country with a tax rate of 45 percent. Cross-crediting allows the U.S. parent corporation to offset

the $10 of U.S. tax liability on the $100 repatriated from the low-tax affiliate against the $10 of excess

credits on the $100 repatriated from the high-tax affiliate. As a result, no residual U.S. tax is due on the

$200 of foreign-source income. Firms may only average income of the same type of “basket” for the
9
 . Under current law, excess credits can be carried back to offset any U.S. tax payments on foreign-source income
made in the previous two years. Credits may also be carried forward without interest and used to offset U.S. tax
liability in the following five years.

purpose of the foreign tax credit; as we explain below, averaging is allowed within baskets, but not across

baskets.

           The time at which the U.S Treasury taxes foreign profits depends on how the multinational has

organized its foreign operations. If those operations are organized as subsidiaries (they are separately

incorporated in the foreign country), then the profits are not generally taxed until they are paid to the U.S.

parent corporation. The profits of foreign operations organized as branches (they are not separately

incorporated in the foreign country) are taxed upon accrual.

           Prior to the Revenue Act of 1962, multinationals enjoyed deferral on all classes of foreign-source

income earned by foreign subsidiaries (with the exception of income earned in foreign personal holding

companies). The Revenue Act created the Subpart F provisions in an effort to hamper the ability of firms

to avoid U.S. taxes on foreign income by retaining it abroad in low-tax jurisdictions.10 In general, these

"anti-tax avoidance" provisions deny deferred taxation on foreign subsidiary income that is considered

abusive. The original provisions impose accrual taxation on certain “passive” income such as that income

earned from investments in financial assets, foreign base company sales and services income, and income

derived from the insurance of U.S. risks. Income from active business investments abroad continued to

enjoy deferred taxation.

           Since the Subpart F provisions were enacted in 1962, Congress has expanded their scope to include

additional types of foreign subsidiary income. The Tax Reduction Act of 1975 disallowed deferral on

shipping income that was not reinvested in shipping assets.11 The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility of

1982 expanded Subpart F to include foreign oil-related income.
10
   . The Subpart F rules were the outcome of a debate on whether to entirely eliminate deferral. Congress
supported deferral, the administration supported accrual taxation. Since 1962 there have been numerous proposals
to end deferral. See Appendix A of Hufbauer (1992) for a short history of deferral in the U.S. tax system. See also
Hubbard (1995), National Foreign Trade Council (1999), and Hines (1999b) for a review of more recent policy
debates about deferral.
11
  . This act also eliminated deferral of passive income earned in tax haven countries by repealing the safe harbor
minimum distribution rules in Subpart F. Income from countries participating in Arab League boycotts was denied
deferral in 1976. See Hines (1995) for an analysis of the impact of the boycott provisions on U.S. operations in
Arab League countries.

        TRA'86 substantially eroded the ability of financial services firms to defer foreign-source income

by incorporating within Subpart F additional categories of both passive and active income. The Act's

provisions terminated deferral on dividends and interest earned by financial services subsidiaries regardless

of whether the income was generated from the conduct of active business, on third-party insurance income,

and on shipping income regardless of whether it was reinvested in shipping assets. To a large extent,

TRA'86 eliminated deferral on foreign financial services income. At the same time, U.S. multinationals

generating active (nonfinancial) income through manufacturing affiliates were not affected by the Act’s

expanded Subpart F provisions.

        The tightening of the anti-deferral rules led to a substantial increase in the amount of Subpart F

income reported. Latzy and Miller (1992) use tax return data to examine the growth of Subpart F income

claimed by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) of U.S. parent corporations between 1986 and 1988.12

They found that the largest 7,500 CFCs (in terms of asset size) reported Subpart F income of over $12

billion dollars in 1988, which represents an increase of almost $8 billion dollars over the 1986 level. In

addition, the number of large CFCs that recorded any Subpart F income nearly doubled (from 11 percent in

1986 to almost 22 percent in 1988). As a percentage of total (positive) earnings and profits, Subpart F

income increased from 10 percent to 19 percent over this time period which suggests that “…an increasing

amount of the undistributed earnings of CFCs are now subject to current U.S. taxation (page 64).”13

        TRA'86 represented a major overhaul to the U.S. tax system and, as such, included other important

provisions for the taxation of foreign-source income. The Act lowered the corporate tax rate from 46 to 34

percent and at the same time broadened the tax base through modifications of depreciation schedules and

the repeal of the investment tax credit. All else being equal, the lower corporate tax rate would be expected
12
  . A CFC is a foreign corporation that is at least 50 percent owned by a group of U.S. shareholders each of whom
have at least a 10 percent interest in the company.
13
  . The increase in Subpart F income, number of CFCs claiming Subpart F income, and Subpart F income as a
percentage of positive earnings and profits was not limited to CFCs incorporated in tax haven countries. See Latzy
and Miller (1992) for details.

to shift multinationals toward excess credit positions, leaving firms with no additional tax liabilities to the

U.S. Treasury on income repatriations from abroad. Interestingly, the United States did not become a

“low-tax” country; tax rates in many capital importing countries were lowered after the imposition of the

Act.14 Grubert, Randolph, and Rousslang (1996) find that in 1992 only 35 percent of foreign source

income was received by U.S. multinational corporations with excess credits which is comparable to the 33

percent of foreign source income received by such firms in 1984. Their analysis of Treasury tax return

data shows a substantial decrease in average effective tax rates on repatriated income that they conclude is

primarily due to reductions in country average tax rates.

         As with the modifications to the Subpart F rules, changes to the foreign tax credit limitation

embedded in TRA'86 impacted parent corporations with financial services subsidiaries and manufacturing

subsidiaries differentially. Prior to the Act, there were six separate foreign tax credit baskets: (1) passive

interest income, (2) domestic international sales corporation (DISC) dividend income, (3) foreign sales

corporations (FSC) dividend income, (4) foreign trade income of a foreign sales corporations, (5) oil and

gas extraction income, and (6) all other foreign-source income. The goal of the basket system is to separate

income that bears extremely high foreign taxes from income of a different type or category that bears little

or no foreign tax. TRA'86 expanded the number of baskets, decreasing the potential to average for the

purpose of the foreign tax credit, particularly so for financial income. 15 The new baskets include one for

high-withholding-tax interest income, an expanded passive income basket that captures passive income

generally (not just interest income), a separate basket for financial services income, a separate basket for
14
  . Along with lowering corporate tax rates, some countries have enacted CFC rules that subject certain foreign
source income to current taxation since the passage of TRA'86. Two examples are Australia and New Zealand.
For further discussion see OECD (1996), Grubert (1997), and National Foreign Trade Council (1999).
15
  . As explained in the Joint Committee on Taxation’s General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, “A
separate or special limitation generally is applied to a category of income for one of three reasons: the income’s
source (foreign or U.S.) can be manipulated; the income typically bears little or no foreign tax; or the income often
bears a rate of foreign tax that is abnormally high or in excess of rates on other types of income. Applying a
separate limitation to a category of income prevents the use of foreign taxes imposed on one category of income to
reduce the U.S. tax on other categories of income.” (page 856)

shipping income and a separate basket for the dividends of each noncontrolled (between 10 and 50 percent)

foreign corporation.16

          Why were financial services firms singled out by TRA'86? One theme in the Joint Committee on

Taxation’s General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is that foreign financial income is highly

mobile and consequently the choice of location is very sensitive to variation in tax rates. Congress believed

that the types of income targeted for inclusion in Subpart F “…could sometimes be earned through a

foreign corporation in a tax haven countries that bears limited substantive economic relation to the income

and that allowing continued deferral of U.S. tax on this type of income could encourage the movement of

the associated operations abroad at the U.S. Treasury’s expense (page 965).” The current taxation of this

foreign income is meant to move the tax system closer to one in which the multinational firm faces the same

effective rate of tax on its investment regardless or whether it is undertaken at home or abroad. The

availability of deferral for a much broader range of active income moves the tax system away from this

criterion (capital export neutrality) for manufacturing firms. Given the tax rule changes in TRA'86,

holding other things constant, the location of manufacturing capital should therefore be more sensitive to

differences in tax rates across foreign jurisdictions than the location of assets generating financial services

income.

          Our argument that TRA'86 moved the tax system closer to one in which capital export neutrality is

preserved for the financial services sector ignores the Act’s changes to the foreign tax credit limitation and

their impact on the ability of firms to cross-credit. As with the changes to the Subpart F rules, the increase

in baskets was motivated by a concern that income generated from financial assets could be easily shifted

and, in this case, used to absorb excess credits from unrelated highly taxed business operations. Congress

was also concerned that, on balance, cross-crediting created a situation in which foreign investment was
16
  . Recent legislation passed in 1997 eliminated the separate baskets for noncontrolled (between 10 and 50 percent)
corporations. Under the new law, which takes effect in 2003, parents will be able to average all dividend income
from noncontrolled ("10-50") corporations into one basket for the purpose of the foreign tax credit.


                                                        10
favored over U.S. investment.17 Allowing for cross-crediting can move the tax system closer to or further

from capital export neutrality depending on the foreign tax credit position of multinational corporations.18

Parent firms in excess limitation positions are indifferent between investments at home and in low-tax

countries abroad since (ignoring deferral) they face the same tax rate at home and abroad. Multinationals

in excess credit positions, however, prefer investments in low-tax locations over investments in high-tax

locations, since excess credits absorb any residual tax owed to the U.S. government on income repatriated

from low-tax jurisdictions.

         Increasing the number of separate limitation baskets makes cross-crediting more difficult and,

along with the changes to the Subpart F provisions, can move the tax system towards capital export

neutrality.19 To see this, consider two groups of parent corporations in the financial sector --- one group

with excess credits in the pre-TRA'86 basket that contained financial services income and one group in

excess limitation. Adding a separate basket for financial services income makes it difficult for the firm

with excess credits in the pre-TRA'86 basket to absorb residual tax liabilities from investments generating

lightly taxed income (investments in low-tax countries, for example). This is because after TRA'86, the

lightly taxed income would generally be in a separate basket and therefore cannot be averaged with high-

tax income to reduce U.S. tax liabilities. As a result, these parent firms will no longer favor low-tax

investments over investments at home or in high-tax countries. Parent firms in excess limitation face

capital export neutrality for low-tax investments both before and after TRA'86. Taken together, both the

  . See , for example, the discussion in Altshuler and Newlon (1993) and Cummins and Hubbard (1995).
19
  . As we noted earlier, Desai and Hines (1999) investigate whether the imposition of separate limitation baskets
for noncontrolled CFCs (10-50 corporations) affected the activities of U.S. multinationals in low-tax jurisdictions.
As is the case with the separate basket for financial services income, the separate baskets for 10-50 corporations
decrease the attractiveness of setting up operations in low-tax countries. Desai and Hines find that U.S.
participation in 10-50 corporations fell substantially after 1986, particularly in low-tax jurisdictions.

changes to the anti-deferral laws and the foreign tax credit arguably move the system closer to capital

export neutrality for the financial services sector.20

         Recent legislation has included some important changes to the Subpart F rules enacted in TRA'86.

The path to enactment for these new laws was a bit bumpy. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, as

originally passed by Congress, contained an exemption from Subpart F for the active financing income of

insurance companies, banks, and securities firms.21 President Clinton eliminated the exception from the tax

package by exercising his line-item veto authority. The provision was later reinstated after the Supreme

Court found the Line-Item Veto Act unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruling was made in June, only

days before the Joint Committee on Taxation published their list of extensions to the Taxpayer Relief Act

of 1997.22 Due to the timing of the decision, the one-year exception was included on the list and was

available for the 1998 taxable year. A new version of the temporary exemption was included in the

omnibus spending package of 1998. As before, the modified exception applies only for one year (the

taxable year beginning in 1999). Legislation passed in 1999 extended the exception for tax years beginning

before January 1, 2002. The latest incarnation of the Subpart F exception contains some different tests for

determining whether income derived from the active conduct of a financial services business qualifies for
20
   . To see this, divide parent firms into four groups depending on their foreign tax credit status (in the active
basket) before and after the Act. Firms in excess limitation before and after TRA’86 are discouraged from
investing in low-tax countries (relative to before the Act) since they can no longer defer active income there. Firms
that transit from excess credit to excess limitation positions move closer to capital-export neutrality since they lose
deferral and averaging opportunities. Firms in excess limitation before TRA’86 but in excess credit after TRA’86
may also face reduced incentives to invest in low-tax jurisdictions if income generated there ends up in new baskets
with other lightly taxed income. Finally, firms in excess credit before and after TRA’86 may also be discouraged
from investing in low-tax countries for the same reasons. Because the tax return data available publicly is
aggregated by country, we are unable to divide our analysis according to parents’ credit positions before and after
the Act. With parent-level data we could separately examine the first two sets of firms for which incentives to
invest in low-tax countries decreased the most.
21
  . The exception from Subpart F was for income that is derived in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or
similar business by a CFC that is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of such business. The exception
also applied to certain investment income of a qualifying insurance company with respect to risks located within
the CFCs country of creation or organization. The exception did not apply to investment income allocable to
contracts that insure related party risks or risks located in a country other than the country in which the qualifying
insurance company is created or organized.

deferral and more stringent anti-abuse rules. Whether these exceptions have any impact on the location

decisions or market share of U.S. financial service firms is a question for future evaluation.

        A growing body of research has investigated the extent to which multinational firms respond to

changes in the tax environment they face (see, e.g., the reviews in Hines 1997 and 1999a) and empirical

evidence supports the idea that tax policy plays an important role in the economic decisions of

multinational corporations. However, most of the previous research has not focused on the impact of

TRA'86 (or previous tax changes) on the behavior of financial services firms. The changes to Subpart F

for these firms were predicated on the belief that the activities and investments of these firms were highly

mobile and therefore very sensitive to tax differences across jurisdictions. A natural question to ask is

whether there is any evidence that differences in host country tax rates explain the distribution of assets of

financial services firms abroad. A more precise way of asking this question is to pose it in terms of a

measure of sensitivity: How responsive is the location of assets in financial services affiliates to differences

in host country tax rates?

        As we explained above, TRA'86 moved the system closer to capital export neutrality (with respect

to investments in low-tax locations) for financial services firms. As a result, if firms are sensitive to

differences in effective tax rates, we may explore whether this sensitivity has diminished after TRA'86. In

other words, has the location of assets in financial services firms become less responsive to host country

taxes? AGN address these questions in their analysis of the location of real capital held in the

manufacturing affiliates of U.S. manufacturing parent firms.23 We focus instead on firms in the financial

services sector.

        AGN use data from the U.S. Treasury tax return files for 1984 and 1992 to estimate the

responsiveness of direct investment abroad to after-tax rates of return. Unlike previous studies, these

researcher's access to more than one year of cross-sectional data allowed them to estimate tax elasticities
23
  . Grubert and Mutti (1991, 1997) and Hines and Rice (1994) also study the responsiveness of location decisions
to taxes, but not whether estimated tax elasticities have increased over time.
                                                       13
that control for fixed country effects. They focus on the allocation of real capital abroad by manufacturing

affiliates of U.S. manufacturing parents and find evidence that it has become more sensitive to differences

in effective tax rates across host countries over their sample period. Their estimates with country fixed

effects yield an elasticity of real capital to changes in after-tax rates of returns of 2.8 in 1992 and 1.5 in

1984.24,25 Both the point estimates and the difference between them are statistically significantly different

from zero at standard confidence levels. This work suggests that the influence of taxes on location

decisions has become more pronounced. To preview our results, using information from the same data

source as AGN, we find evidence that TRA'86 may have led to a decrease in the mobility of assets for

financial services firms.26



3.       The Data

         The data were provided to us by the Statistics of Income (SOI) division of the Internal Revenue

Service.27 SOI collects information from a number of tax and information forms filed by U.S. multinational

corporations. We requested information from the Form 5471, which reports on the activities of each CFC

of a U.S. parent. This form contains subsidiary level information on assets, taxes paid, earnings and

profits, and other information from balance sheets and income statements. We obtained information on

total CFC assets (cash, inventories, buildings and other depreciable assets, land, loans to stockholders and
24
  . Grubert and Mutti (1997) and AGN include a measure of trade restrictions as an explanatory variable in their
regression models so the elasticity estimates reported above are for countries with the most open trade regimes (for
which the trade restriction variable is zero). Adjusting the 1992 elasticity, for example, by trade regime (using
1992 real capital stocks as weights) gives a slightly lower tax elasticity of 2.64.
25
  . The 1992 open economy elasticity is similar in magnitude and significance to the estimates in Grubert and
Mutti (1997). Their study used both aggregate country-level data and firm specific data from the 1992 Treasury
tax files.
26
  . Neither this study nor AGN analyzes the effect of taxes on the choice of investing at home or abroad. Our
empirical models focus instead on the choice of investment locations across foreign jurisdictions.
27
  . The data were provided in response to a special data request that was necessary to obtain information by
industry.




                                                         14
related persons, investment in subsidiaries, and intangible assets), real CFC assets (inventories, buildings,

and other depreciable assets), earnings and profits before income taxes, and income taxes.28

        The data provided to us by SOI are aggregated across CFCs by country and are partitioned by the

industry of the CFC; we have separate data for CFCs in the finance, insurance, and real estate sector

(FIRE) and for CFCs in the manufacturing sector.29 This industry detail allows us to compare changes in

the sensitivity of location decisions to taxes of assets held in manufacturing and financial subsidiaries

abroad. We use data from the same years as AGN --- 1984 and 1992 --- and more recent tax return data

for 1994.30 We supplemented the data with information on gross domestic product from the International

Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics.31 Our dataset for financial CFCs of U.S. parents

contains complete information for 32 countries for the three years of analysis. Our dataset on

manufacturing CFCs of U.S. parents contains complete information for 40 countries.

        We use simple ordinary least squares to estimate the elasticity of assets to after-tax rates of return

as in Grubert and Mutti (1991) and other studies. The after-tax rate of return is simply (1-ETR), where

ETR equals the country average effective tax rate. The basic estimating equation is thus:

                             log(Assetsit) = αi + β1log(1-ETRit) + β2log(GDPit) + εit ,                          (1)
28
  . Corporations are required to report the historical book value of assets according to U.S. accounting principles.
As AGN notes, this reporting standard prevents the asset figures from being distorted by host country investment
incentives. However, host country inflation and exchange rates could affect the measures. Another problem with
the asset measures in the SOI data involves the actual location of the assets reported. CFCs report assets based on
their country of incorporation. However, the country of incorporation may not be where the capital is actually
located. Grubert and Mutti (1997) were able to use additional data, not available in our file, to classify the real
assets in their sample by the CFCs principal place of business (firm’s include this information on the Form 5471)
instead of by the CFC’s country of incorporation. The reclassification had little effect on their results (only 2
percent of real assets were affected).
29
  . The 1984 sample includes all U.S. parent corporations with at least one CFC and total assets greater than $250
million in assets. All U.S. corporations with at least $500 million in assets were included in the 1992 and 1994
samples. However, the 1992 and 1994 samples contain information only for the top 7,500 CFCs in terms of asset
size. These CFCs account for 94 percent of assets “controlled” by all CFCs of U.S. multinational corporations with
at least $500 million in assets in 1992 and 1994.
30
  . Information from the Form 5471 is compiled only in even years.
31
  . In a few cases information on GDP was not available from the IMF statistics. In these cases we used
information from the United Nations.



                                                        15
where i subscripts countries and t subscripts years, ETR is the country effective tax rate, and GDP is gross

domestic product. GDP can be interpreted as a “scale” variable that reflects the economic size of

countries. The estimated coefficient on the tax term, β1, gives the (constant) elasticity of assets to changes

in after-tax returns (for a given pre-tax return). This reduced-form relation between after-tax returns and

investment is consistent with a partial equilibrium model in which firms allocate assets abroad to maximize

after-tax returns to investment.

        A difficult issue in estimating this type of location equation involves the appropriate choice of local

tax rates. Researchers have debated the merits and drawbacks of using statutory corporate tax rates,

marginal local effective tax rates, average local effective tax rates, and effective tax rates that include the

impact of home country repatriation taxes to measure the incentive effect of taxes on location choices (see

the empirical studies of taxes and location decisions reviewed in Hines (1997), or more recently, see

Grubert and Mutti (1997) and AGN). We use country average effective tax rates in our empirical work for

a variety of reasons. First, even if appropriate, marginal effective tax rates on income generated in

financial and manufacturing operations abroad are not available for all of the years and countries in our

sample. Second, statutory rates are unlikely to reflect the tax treatment of investments in different

countries since they do not capture special incentives for different industries and/or different firms within

countries. Subsidiaries involved in manufacturing, for example, often receive tax incentives in the form of

tax holidays. These tax incentives may depend on the location of the subsidiary and may expire after some

years. Subsidiaries in the financial sector are also likely to face tax rules that result in tax burdens that do

not correspond to statutory tax rates. Calculating an average effective tax rate across all subsidiaries by

industry will take into account the special provisions and tax incentives faced by firms in the different

industries in each country. Finally, although our use of host country average effective tax rates ignores the

impact of home country repatriation taxes on location decisions, we feel the choice is an appropriate one



                                                       16
for our analysis. Our hypothesis is that after TRA'86, the location of assets in financial subsidiaries should

be less responsive to differences in host country tax rates across jurisdictions.

         We calculate country average effective tax rates for financial and manufacturing CFCs by dividing

total income taxes paid by total earnings and profits before income taxes. Only those CFCs with positive

earnings and profits before taxes are included in the calculation to prevent the tax rate measure from being

biased upwards. We do not include other taxes that may be imposed in host countries, such as property

and assets taxes, because this information is not available in our data.

         Tables 1 and 2 contain country average effective tax rates for the financial and manufacturing

subsidiaries in our sample, respectively. We present country effective tax rates for 1984 and for the early

1990s, calculated as the average of the 1992 and 1994 country effective tax rates. Effective tax rates have

declined significantly since 1984.32 Averaged over all countries, effective tax rates faced by both financial

and manufacturing subsidiaries abroad have fallen by more than 10 percentage points during the ten-year

period spanned by our study. As a percentage of the 1984 rate, effective tax rates fell more for financial

subsidiaries (47 percent) than for manufacturing subsidiaries (33 percent) between 1984 and the 1990s.

         Comparing effective tax rates across the two industries shows that financial subsidiaries generally

face lower rates than manufacturing subsidiaries. On average, the financial effective tax rates are about 80

percent of the manufacturing rates (87 percent in 1984, 63 percent in the 1990s).33 However, these

averages mask a substantial variation between the ratios of financial to manufacturing effective tax rates.

The standard deviation of the ratio ranges from between 80 percentage points in 1984 to 50 percentage

points in the 1990s.34 In each period effective tax rates for financial subsidiaries exceeded effective tax
32
  . This is consistent with the pattern shown in Table 1 of AGN, where estimated average effective tax rates for
manufacturing declined from 0.321 in 1980 to 0.234 in 1992.
33
  . The average of manufacturing effective tax rates as a percentage of financial effective tax rates for 1984 does
not include Argentina, which had an extremely low effective tax rate for manufacturing subsidiaries in that year.
34
  . The standard deviation of the ratio between financial and manufacturing effective tax rates is 80.5 percentage
points in 1984. These statistics are not reported in the tables.



                                                         17
rates for manufacturing subsidiaries in a small set of locations (five countries in 1984 and nine countries in

the 1990s).

        There are some drawbacks to using these average effective tax rates in our empirical analysis.

First, in some cases they are based on observations from a small number of subsidiaries. This likely adds

noise to our tax rate measures. In addition, at an individual firm level, these tax rates are endogenous to

investment decisions. Averaging across all CFCs in a country should diminish this relation to some

extent.35 However, we take some steps to investigate and ameliorate these problems in our empirical tests.

        Although the focus of previous studies has been on the location of real capital abroad, our

emphasis on the behavior of multinational corporations with financial subsidiaries suggests that we should

examine the relation between taxes and the placement of total, as opposed to real, assets. In Table 3 we

provide information on the ratio of real to total assets in our two groups of CFCs. Because these ratios

differed little over the sample period, we report the ratio, averaged over all three years, of real to total

assets for each country. Real assets account for a very small percentage of total assets in financial

affiliates (less than eight percent on average). Assets held in manufacturing affiliates of U.S. parents, on

the other hand, are comprised mainly of real assets (62 percent of total assets on average). These ratios

suggest that the appropriate measure of assets in the financial sector regressions should be total assets and

that real assets should be used in the manufacturing equations.



4.      Empirical Evidence on Tax Sensitivity

        Instead of running cross-sectional regressions on each of the three years of data, we start by

pooling the data. This allows us to test whether the tax elasticity (β1) has changed over time.36 To do this,
35
  . Simply using average effective tax rates over all subsidiaries in a country does not eliminate the endogeneity
problem. Effective tax rates may be low in a country in a given year because of an increase in investment
qualifying for tax incentives in that year.
36
  . We also tested whether the coefficient on log(GDP) should be constrained to be the same in the three years. An
F-test fails to reject the constrained model in both the pooled model (first column) and the fixed effects model
(second column).

we introduce additional terms (a year dummy and an interaction term) to equation (1) to produce separate

estimates of the tax coefficient for each sample year. In particular, we include the following variables to

the model in equation (1):

log(1-ETR)∗Year92, log(1-ETR)∗Year94, Year92, and Year94. Year92, for example, is an indicator

variable that equals one if the observation is from 1992, and equals zero otherwise. The coefficient on the

interaction term, log(1-ETR)∗Year92, estimates the difference between the 1984 elasticity and the 1992

elasticity.

         Our principal results for financial subsidiaries are reported in Table 4.37 The estimated tax

elasticities for each year are reported in the bottom panel of the table. 38 The first column presents the

estimation results for the pooled regression. These estimates suggest that total assets held in subsidiaries

are quite sensitive to differences in after-tax returns across jurisdictions. The tax elasticities for all of the

sample years are large and statistically significantly different than zero. Furthermore, neither the 1992 nor

the 1994 estimated elasticity is significantly different from the 1984 estimated elasticity (the coefficients on

the interaction terms, log(1-ETR)∗Year92 and log(1-ETR)∗Year94, are not statistically significantly

different from zero). Assets held in financial subsidiaries appear highly responsive to variations across

jurisdiction in effective tax rates both before and after TRA'86. The elasticity estimates suggest that a one

percent increase in after-tax returns leads to an increase in the total capital stock held by U.S. subsidiaries

of between six and eight percent.

         Cross-country variation in average effective tax rates may be correlated with unobserved

differences in countries that affect their attractiveness for investment. As a result, the estimated effect of

the tax term may reflect both tax and non-tax factors on investment decisions. One way of controlling for
37
  . See the Appendix table for means and standard deviations of the variables used in these regressions.
38
  . The tax elasticity estimates and standard errors for each year are estimated by running analogous regressions
with different year dummies and interaction terms. For instance, to estimate the 1992 elasticity in the second
column of Table 4, we replace the 1992 dummy with a dummy for 1984 (Year84) and the 1992 tax interaction
term with log(1-ETR) ∗Year84. The coefficient on log(1-ETR) in this new regression gives the estimated 1992 tax
elasticity and associated standard error.
                                                        19
persistent unobserved differences across countries is to add country dummy variables to the right-hand side

of equation (1).

        The results from this country fixed-effects specification are presented in the second column of

Table 4. These estimates suggest that, for financial subsidiaries, variation in effective tax rates across

countries is correlated with country characteristics. The tax coefficients are reduced in both size and

statistical significance. In fact, the estimated 1992 and 1994 tax elasticities shown in the lower panel are

negative in the second column and no longer statistically significantly different from zero. The coefficients

on the interaction terms are statistically significantly different from zero (at the 10 percent confidence

level), suggesting that assets have become less sensitive to differences in effective tax rates across locations

since 1984. The estimated 1984 tax elasticity is still statistically significantly different from zero at

conventional levels of significance, but the magnitude of the estimated coefficient is less than half of the

estimate from the first column.

        The statistically insignificant coefficients on the year dummies in the second column (as well as the

first column) indicate that it is not necessary to allow the intercept in our regression equation to vary across

years and an F-test accepts the exclusion of the year dummies. We present results that exclude the year

dummies from the country-fixed-effects regression in the third column of Table 4. Except for the estimated

coefficient on log(GDP), the estimates from the specifications in the second and third columns are similar.

However, dropping the year dummies does increase the magnitude of the coefficients on the tax and

interaction tax terms. In particular, the estimated 1984 tax elasticity and the difference between the 1984

and 1992 and 1994 estimated tax elasticities are statistically significantly different from zero at a two

percent confidence level.

        In model presented in the fourth column of Table 4, we constrain the 1992 and 1994 tax elasticities

to be equal (an F-test fails to reject the model that constrains them to be the same). This formulation

contains a new interaction term, log(1-ETR)*Year90s, where Year90s equals unity if the data are from the

                                                       20
years 1992 or 1994, and equals zero if the data are from 1984. The coefficient on the new interaction term

measures the difference between the 1984 tax elasticity (the pre-TRA'86 elasticity) and the tax elasticity for

the later sample years (the post-TRA'86 elasticity). We initially included the Year90 dummy variable, but

found that the estimated coefficient on this variable was not statistically significantly different from zero.

As was the case in our specification in the third column, an F-test could not reject the year dummy, so we

dropped this variable from the final specification.39 The estimates for the remaining coefficients are similar

to those in the third column. The estimated 1984 tax elasticity is about 3.5, and is still statistically

significantly different than zero at high levels of confidence; the post-TRA'86 tax elasticity is negative and

not statistically significantly different from zero.40 The difference between the elasticities is large (about

five) and is significant at the one percent level.

         Although our estimates suggest that the changes accompanying TRA'86 have affected the role

played by taxes in the location of assets in financial subsidiaries, it is possible that other factors are

responsible. One way of attempting to isolate the impact of the tax policy changes is to compare our

results to those for the manufacturing industry. As we explained above, the “tightening” of Subpart F

should be of much less importance to location of capital generating active manufacturing income (and the

results in AGN suggest that in contrast to the results in Table 4, manufacturing capital has become

significantly more responsive to effective tax rate differences across countries).


39
  . We also experimented with a specification that drops the GDP variable and includes the Year90 dummy. The
resulting tax elasticity estimates were smaller and less statistically significant (3.14 and statistically significant at a
six percent confidence level for 1984 and -0.84 and statistically insignificant for the 1990s). As in estimates in the
third and fourth columns of Table 4, the difference between the elasticities was large and statistically significantly
different from zero (the coefficient on the interaction term was 3.97, and statistically significantly different from
zero at a five percent confidence level). The coefficient on the Year90 dummy was 0.80 and was not statistically
different from zero at conventional levels. Finally, the adjusted R-squared was similar (0.83) to the specification in
the fourth column of Table 4.
40
   . Our estimates are the first of which we are aware to measure the responsiveness of capital held in financial
subsidiaries to local taxes. Although we have no reason to suspect any serious measurement problems, this makes
it difficult to determine whether our elasticity estimates are "reasonable." The estimates presented later in Tables 6
and 7 allow us to compare tax elasticities for total capital held in financial subsidiaries with analogous measures
for real capital held in manufacturing subsidiaries for our sample. We compare our elasticity measures for
manufacturing capital to others in the literature in our discussion of Table 6.
                                                            21
           Before discussing our results for the manufacturing affiliates in our sample, we explore some

alternative specifications to test the sensitivity of our results to the measurement of effective tax rates and

to the inclusion of countries that may be outliers. In first column of Table 5, for example, we remove

countries with small populations (under one million people) that may best be classified as tax havens for

financial affiliates. In particular, we deleted Bermuda and Luxembourg from the sample. These exclusions

had little impact on our results. The significance of the 1984 tax elasticity and the interaction term

decreases slightly but both remain statistically significant at conventional levels. A natural experiment

given our hypothesis would be to eliminate all countries which had effective tax rates higher than the U.S.

rate in 1992 and 1994. The tightening of the Subpart F rules should have no effect on the choice of

investment across high-tax countries. However, only one country in our sample had a higher tax rate than

the U.S. rate. 41    As a result, there is no need to partition the sample by effective tax rates to test our

hypothesis.

           The remaining experiments address various potential problems with our measure of effective tax

rates. One concern is that some of the country tax rates were calculated with data from few CFCs. To

explore the role played by these observations in our estimates, we eliminated countries with fewer than six

CFCs. These results appear in the second column of Table 5. The point estimate for the 1984 elasticity is

about 40 percent smaller and is no longer statistically significantly different than zero. As in our full-

sample estimates for this specification, however, the post-1984 elasticity is negative and statistically

insignificantly different from zero, and, further, the difference between the elasticities across the time

period is statistically significantly different from zero at conventional levels of significance. The results

continue to point to a diminished role over time for taxes in the location of assets held in financial

subsidiaries.




41
     . In 1992 the average effective tax rate in Denmark was 38.2 percent.
                                                          22
        A more difficult measurement problem to address in our sample is the possible endogeneity of

country average effective tax rates to current investment decisions. In the last two columns of Table 5, we

experiment with replacing current effective tax rates with their lagged and future values. These

experiments, however, require that we drop a third of our dataset (one year of data). In the third column,

we use the 1994 and 1984 data, but substitute 1992 effective tax rates for the 1994 rates. In the fourth

column of Table 5, we use the 1992 and 1984 data, but substitute 1994 rates for the 1992 effective tax

measures. Neither experiment leads to qualitative differences in our results. 42 At the same time, using the

future tax rates shows an even larger decline in the post-1984 tax elasticity and, unlike in our previous

results, the post-1984 elasticity is now statistically significantly different than zero.

        Our research strategy is to compare any changes in tax elasticities over our sample period across

financial and manufacturing affiliates. As discussed above, AGN provide strong evidence that the

allocation of real capital abroad in manufacturing affiliates of manufacturing parents has become more

sensitive to differences in host country tax rates. Comparing our results for financial subsidiaries to this

work suggests the changes in TRA'86, did, as expected have a differential impact on firms in the FIRE

industry. However, because we also have data on the location of real assets in manufacturing affiliates, we

can use it to compare more directly the tax elasticity estimates for the two industries over the same sample

years (recall that AGN uses data from 1984 and 1992) and model specification.

        Table 6 presents results which correct for country fixed effects for our sample of manufacturing

affiliates using the same specifications in Table 4.43, 44 Although our sample includes information for both

42
  . We also compared the results in third and fourth columns of Table 5 to specifications estimated with the same
years of data. In particular, we compared the third column estimates with the similar specification that uses only
the 1984 and 1992 data and the fourth column estimates with a regression run with the 1984 and 1994 data. The
tax elasticity and interaction terms estimated from these "comparison" models were similar in both magnitude and
statistical significance to the results reported in third and fourth columns of Table 5.
43
  . Correcting for country fixed effects generated similar results to those found in AGN. The significance of the
difference between the tax elasticities in 1984 and in 1992 and 1994 increased in the fixed-effects model. The
magnitude of the point estimates of the tax elasticities decreased, in contrast to AGN. However, similar to AGN,
our “no fixed effects” elasticities are not statistically different than our “fixed effects” elasticities.
44
  . The appendix table presents means and standard deviations of the variables used in these specifications.

1992 and 1994, and is composed of a different set of manufacturing affiliates (those associated with U.S.

parents in all industry classifications) and a smaller set of countries (40 versus 58), our results are

qualitatively similar to AGN.45 We find that the estimated tax elasticity for manufacturing capital has

increased over our time period and that the difference between the two estimates is about unity (and is

statistically significantly different from zero).

         Finally, Table 7 contains results that constrain the countries in our financial and manufacturing

samples to be the same. 46 This direct comparison reveals the same pattern: While the placement of

manufacturing assets has become more responsive to variations in effective tax rates across locations

during our time period, the allocation of assets in financial affiliates can no longer be explained by these

variations. The results suggest that moving the tax rules for multinational corporations toward capital

export neutrality reduces, as intended, the role played by taxes in the location of assets abroad. Further,

our estimates show that prior to the Act the total capital held in financial subsidiaries was substantially

more sensitive to differences in host country effective tax rates than the real capital held in manufacturing

subsidiaries.




45
  . For a variety of reasons, we leave out some of the explanatory variables used by AGN. Unlike AGN, we do not
include regional dummies. This is because we add country dummies instead of differencing the data to control for
fixed country effects. Including regional dummies in addition to the country dummies makes estimation difficult
due to the correlation between the variables. Finally, we do not include a variable to capture variations in trade
restrictions across countries. We did not find a measure that reflects changes in trade restrictions over our time
period. Our goal is not to reproduce the AGN estimates, but to use our data to compare tax elasticities for assets in
manufacturing and financial affiliates abroad. Our preferred estimates of the elasticity of real capital to tax rate
differences across jurisdictions are the ones presented in AGN (and Grubert and Mutti, 1997) because they use a
larger sample of CFCs and are better able to measure manufacturing capital.
46
   . The sample contains all of the countries in our financial sample (see Table 1) with the exception of
Uruguay which did not appear in the manufacturing data provided to us.

5.      Conclusions

        The provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which eliminated deferral of U.S. taxes on financial

services income earned abroad offer an opportunity to examine the extent to which anti-deferral rules

influence the location of assets held abroad in financial affiliates of U.S. firms. At least two questions are

of interest. First, did the 1986 rules decrease the sensitivity of asset location to variation in host-country

tax rates? Second, did the effective tax increase on U.S. financial services firms operating in low-tax

jurisdictions reduce the market share of U.S. firms in those jurisdictions? The first question addresses the

economic efficiency question of capital export neutrality; the second question is concerned more with

competitiveness.

        This paper focuses on the first question. Using data based on U.S. multinational firms’ tax returns

for 1984, 1992, and 1994, we find that, while assets of financial services subsidiaries were responsive to

cross-jurisdictional variation in effective tax rates prior to TRA'86, that responsiveness disappeared after

the passage of the Act. This stands in contrast to the pattern we (and others) estimate for the mobility of

capital in manufacturing subsidiaries. Our findings suggest that the Act’s provisions achieved the goal of

moving the tax treatment of financial services firms closer to capital export neutrality.

        Additional research is required to study the second question. The data requirements for such an

analysis are significant owing to the need to study market shares in a well-defined financial product or

service in a given country or set of countries by multinationals headquartered in the United States and

elsewhere. This research will shed light on the cost to U.S. financial services firms of the shift toward

capital export neutrality embraced in the 1986 Act.
