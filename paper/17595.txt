                                           ABSTRACT

The Recession of 1937-38 is often cited as illustrating the dangers of withdrawing fiscal and monetary
stimulus too early in a weak recovery. Yet our understanding of this severe downturn is incomplete:
existing studies find that changes in fiscal policy were small in comparison to the magnitude of the
downturn and that higher reserve requirements were not binding on banks. This paper focuses on
a neglected change in monetary policy, the sterilization of gold inflows during 1937, and finds that
it exerted a powerful contractionary force during this period. The transmission of this monetary shock
to the real economy appears to have worked through lower asset (equity) prices and higher interest
rates.

Introduction

        The Recession of 1937-38 was America’s second most severe economic downturn in the

twentieth century, the first being the Great Depression of 1929-33. Real GDP contracted 11

percent and industrial production plunged 30 percent between the second quarter of 1937 and the

first quarter of 1938. The civilian unemployment rate, still high in the aftermath of the Great

Depression, rose from 9.2 percent to 12.5 percent.1 Because this sharp downturn occurred when

recovery from the Depression was far from complete, it became known as the “recession within a

depression.” It set back the recovery from the Depression by two years.

        The recession is often blamed on the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies. In terms

of fiscal policy, the Roosevelt administration became concerned about large budget deficits and

began reducing the growth in government spending and increasing taxes.2 In terms of monetary

policy, the Federal Reserve and Treasury became concerned about the inflationary potential of

excess reserves in the banking system and large gold inflows and therefore decided to double

reserve requirements and sterilize gold inflows.

        Yet the evidence that these policy changes were responsible for the severe downturn is

underwhelming. Although Brown (1956) finds that the fiscal contraction amounted to a swing in

demand of 2.5 percent of GDP in 1938, Romer (1992, 766) finds a relatively small fiscal

  In 1936, over President Roosevelt’s veto, Congress enacted a large veterans bonus that was distributed in June
1936 and again (by half as much) in June 1937 and then not at all in 1938. Much of the reduction in spending was
simply the ending of the veterans bonus. In addition, in January 1937, the government began collecting social
security taxes (without equivalent payouts) and undistributed profits tax, although the amounts collected were
relatively small.

multiplier during this period and argues that “it would be very difficult” to attribute most of the

decline in output to fiscal policy.3 And while Friedman and Schwartz (1963) put great emphasis

on the contractionary impact of higher reserve requirements, subsequent studies have found little

support for this conclusion. For example, Calomiris, Mason, and Wheelock (2011) note that

banks held large excess reserves at the time, and that they did not increase their demand for

reserves after the new requirements took effect. The reserve requirements were not binding on

the banks and therefore they had little, if any, effect on the money multiplier and the supply of

money and credit.4

         If these factors cannot be blamed for the severity of the recession, might the big “policy

mistake” of the period have been the sterilization of gold inflows?5 Unfortunately, the

quantitative significance of the gold sterilization policy has never been fully assessed. Friedman

and Schwartz (1963, 544) maintained that “The combined impact of the rise in reserve

requirements and – no less important – the Treasury gold-sterilization program first sharply

reduced the rate of increase in the monetary stock and then converted it into a decline” (emphasis

added).6 Yet they did not provide any direct empirical evidence to support the conclusion that

the gold sterilization policy was “no less important” than the change in reserve requirements.7

         Though understudied by economists, the decision by the Treasury Department to sterilize

3
  Peppers (1973) later increased the Brown estimate to 3.4 percent of GDP.

  Other studies on the impact of the reserve requirement changes include Cole and Ohanian (1999), Telser (2001-
02), Stauffer (2002), and Hanes (2006).
5
  There could have been other factors behind the recession. Eggertsson and Pugsley (2006) develop a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices and rational expectations and argue that the recession was
due to an “exogenous shift in beliefs” about future policy by policymakers, i.e., statements by policymakers
reflecting concern about inflation. Yet it seems implausible to think that “animal spirits” could sink the economy as
much as occurred during 1937-38 in the absence of some tangible change in government policy or some real shock.
Hausman (2011) finds that unionization at General Motors and Chrysler led to anticipated price increases which
diverted a significant amount of auto sales from 1938 to 1937, abetting the later downturn.
6
  In fact, Friedman and Schwartz pay relatively little attention to the Treasury decision, while devoting several pages
to the change in reserve requirements.
7
  Beckworth and Hendrickson (2011) use a VAR model to examine the role of monetary shocks in great spending
crashes and conclude that money multiplier and monetary base shocks were important during this period, but that
the slowdown in the monetary base was more important.

gold inflows from December 1936 until February 1938 turns out to have been a very large

monetary shock. By preventing gold inflows from becoming part of the monetary base, this

policy brought to an abrupt halt to what had been a strong monetary expansion. After growing at

about a 17 percent annual rate from 1934-36, the monetary base ceased expanding in 1937. This

shift in policy was enormously important because, as Romer (1992) points out, the inflow of

gold from Europe - and the consequent expansion of the monetary base and money supply – was

the driving force behind the economic recovery from the Depression. The sterilization policy

severed the link between gold inflows and monetary expansion.

       This paper seeks to quantify the impact of the gold sterilization on the money supply and

to compare it to the monetary impact of the change in reserve requirements. The contributions of

each to the decline in the money supply can, in principle, be traced because the Treasury’s policy

of gold sterilization operates through the monetary base while the Federal Reserve’s policy of

higher reserve requirements operates through the money multiplier.

       This paper reports several findings. First, the change in the monetary base as a result of

sterilization was large. As much as a 10 percent increase in the monetary base in 1937 was

prevented as a consequence of the program. Second, the monetary base was a more important

source of change than the money multiplier in leading to the tighter monetary policy in the

period going into the recession. This suggests that, although the Federal Reserve is often blamed

for its poor policy choices during the Great Depression, the Treasury Department was largely

responsible for the policy tightening during this period. Third, the end of the sterilization

program and the resumption of large gold inflows coincide with the onset of the economic

recovery. By contrast, the hike in reserve requirements was only partially rolled back and does

not appear to have contributed to the relaxation of monetary conditions. Fourth, the sterilization



                                                  3
policy appears to have been transmitted to the real economy through lower asset prices and

slightly higher interest rates. Together, these findings suggest that monetary policy was a key

factor behind the 1937-38 recession.



Monetary Policy and the Recession

       The Roosevelt administration’s decision to take the United States off the gold standard in

April 1933 was the proximate cause of the end of the Great Depression and the start of the

economic recovery (Temin and Wigmore 1990, Eggertsson 2008). By freeing monetary policy

from the responsibility of maintaining a fixed dollar price of gold, the decision permitted a more

expansionary policy that ended the deflation, reduced nominal and real interest rates, allowed the

foreign exchange value of the dollar to depreciate, and thereby stimulated the economy.

       In January 1934, after a period of monetary instability, the United States fixed the price

of gold at $35 per ounce. While this did not constitute a formal return to the gold standard, the

United States shadowed the gold standard in that changes in gold reserves were reflected in

changes in the monetary base. Monetary policy was completely passive to these changes in gold

reserves and the Federal Reserve did not engage in any significant open market operations

(Friedman and Schwartz 1963, Meltzer 2003).

       The United States also began experiencing large gold inflows starting in 1934, something

that is often attributed to the revaluation of gold and political difficulties in Europe. This proved

to be the major source of monetary expansion over the next few years. As Romer (1992) argues,

expansionary monetary policy was a critical part of the recovery from the Great Depression.

Real GDP grew 11 percent a year, on average, between 1933 and 1936.




                                                  4
        With the economy operating with substantial excess capacity, this monetary expansion

did not lead to a problem with inflation. Wholesale prices were virtually unchanged during 1935

and into the first half of 1936. However, while consumer prices remained steady, wholesale

prices began to rise briskly in the second half of 1936. By December of that year, they were 4

percent higher than they had been a year before. Meanwhile, gold continued to pour in from

abroad and banks continued to accumulate large excess reserves, which Treasury and Federal

Reserve officials viewed as an increasing risk of inflation.

        With prices beginning to accelerate and gold inflows contributing to a rising stock

market, President Roosevelt also became concerned about overheating, even though

unemployment remained quite high. The president wanted to reduce speculative capital inflows

– “hot money,” he called it – without reducing domestic investment (Meltzer 2003, 505). The

debate over the proper response led to a dispute between Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau

and Federal Reserve Chairman Marriner Eccles. Eccles favored increasing reserve requirements,

which Morgenthau opposed for fear that it would reduce bank lending. Morgenthau advocated

sterilizing gold inflows, while Eccles equivocated.8

        Eventually, both policies were adopted. Without informing the Treasury, the Federal

Reserve increased reserve requirements for member banks from 13 percent to 19.5 percent in

August 1936. In December 1936 the Treasury announced that it would begin sterilizing all

changes to U.S. gold reserves, whether they arise from gold inflows or domestic production. In

January 1937, the Federal Reserve announced that reserve requirements would be further

increased in March and May of that year, to 22.75 percent and then to 26 percent. Thus, between

August 1936 and May 1937, reserve requirements for member banks were doubled.

8
 Eccles eventually supported the Treasury plan, with reservations because it made Treasury a major player in terms
of monetary policy. President Roosevelt ordered the program to begin. Meltzer (2003, 506ff) provides a good
overview of the debate.

                                                        5
           The U.S. economy reached a business cycle peak in mid-1937.9 As late as June 1937, the

Federal Open Market Committee still viewed gold inflows as the most important problem that it

faced. It was also concerned that the Treasury might end its sterilization program (Meltzer 2003,

523). In September, industrial production began to plummet. By October, after a stock market

crash and further bad economic news, government officials began to realize that they had a major

contraction on their hands.

           Policymakers were slow to respond to the sharp downturn in the economy. In February

1938, well into the recession, the Treasury announced that it would no longer sterilize changes in

gold reserves unless the change exceeded $100 million in any month. This effectively ended the

policy. In April, President Roosevelt officially terminated the sterilization program and the

Treasury began to de-sterilize the balance of gold in the inactive fund. (The next section

describes how the sterilization worked.) The president also announced that the Federal Reserve

would roll back the last increase in reserve requirements, reducing them from 26 percent to 22.75

percent.

           In June 1938, the trough of the downturn was reached, according to both the NBER and

Romer (1994). Thereafter, the economy began a swift recovery. Gold inflows surged in the fall

as European fears of war spread due to the crisis over Hitler’s territorial demands on

Czechoslovakia.



Treasury’s Gold Sterilization Program

           As noted earlier, fiscal policy is generally believed to have been a contributing factor to

the recession of 1937-38, but one that is far from being able to explain the severity of the

downturn. However, that the U.S. economy was hit by a pronounced monetary shock is beyond
9
    The business cycle peak was either in May (according to the NBER) or August (according to Romer 1994).

dispute.10 As Figure 1 shows, the M2 measure of the money supply grew at a fairly consistent 12

percent annual rate between 1934 and 1936. In early 1937, it abruptly ceased growing and

actually declined by the end of the year.

        As noted earlier, economists have failed to uncover convincing evidence that the

doubling of reserve requirements was responsible for this shift. Because banks held large excess

reserves, the increased reserve requirements were not binding and do not appear to have

constrained bank lending (Calomiris, Mason, and Wheelock 2011). Furthermore, banks did not

seek to build up their excess reserves to their previous level. This leaves the gold sterilization

policy as the potentially important monetary factor in the downturn, but one whose quantitative

significance has never been fully explored.




10
  Velde (2009) used a VAR model and found that monetary shocks dominated fiscal shocks in the recession of
1937-38, but he did not separate the impact of the gold sterilization program from the doubling of reserve
requirements.

                          How did the sterilization policy work? The Treasury Department purchased all gold

inflows at $35 per ounce with drafts from its balance at the Federal Reserve. Normally, it would

print gold certificates for the equivalent amount and deposit them in a Federal Reserve account

to replenish its balance. The certificate would then become part of the monetary base and could

be used to increase bank reserves. However, with sterilization, instead of replacing its

withdrawn balance with a gold certificate in equal amount, the Treasury kept the certificates in

an “inactive” account where it could not be used for the expansion of credit. It paid for the gold

out of its general fund, reducing its balances at the Federal Reserve, which would then have to be

replenished by issuing new debt or raising tax revenue.

                          Figure 2 shows monthly data on the changes in the gold stock (largely driven by gold

inflows from abroad) and the offsetting Treasury action. The program began at the end of


                                                                       8
December 1936. From January through August 1937, the Treasury offset dollar-for-dollar any

increase in its gold holdings. In Figure 2, this policy is reflected in a bar of equal and opposite

sign to the change in gold holdings. In September 1937, at the request of the Federal Reserve,

the Treasury desterilized $300 million to meet seasonal demand for currency, not to address the

economic downturn. It resumed sterilization in October.

        By this time, the U.S. economy was clearly in a recession, and financial markets became

suspicious that the Roosevelt administration might consider a devaluation of the dollar (an

increase in the dollar price of gold) to deal with the recession. This is exactly how the Roosevelt

administration dealt with the Great Depression when it took office, so there was clearly a

precedent for such an action. As a result, gold inflows into the United States came to an abrupt

halt. From November 1937 through January 1938, the United States actually lost a small amount

of gold, and sterilization worked in reverse: the loss of gold did not translate into a reduction in

the monetary base because it was offset by the Treasury’s release of gold from its inactive

account.

        The sterilization program was effectively ended in February 1938, when the Treasury

announced that it would no longer sterilize changes in gold reserves that were less than $100

million. In February and March 1938, gold inflows were extremely small and were not

sterilized.

        The Treasury program was formally terminated in April. The Treasury then shifted about

$1.3 billion from its cash holdings to deposits in Federal Reserve banks. However, this was just

an accounting change with no monetary effect; it was not until the Treasury spent the funds that

they were actually monetized.11 The Treasury’s exit strategy was to desterilize its inactive gold


11
    As Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 511) note: “Initially, the impact gold was simply moved from Treasury cash
to Treasury deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, and so had no immediate monetary effect. Effective desterilization

                                                        9
holdings gradually, although nearly half of the inactive gold was monetized within a month and a

half, that is, $670 million from mid-April to the end of June (Federal Reserve Bulletin, July

1938, 557).

         The release of the inactive gold allowed growth in the monetary base to resume. But

fears that the Roosevelt administration might address the recession by devaluing the dollar meant

that gold was still not flowing back to the United States. In the absence of gold inflows, and

once the inactive gold had been fully desterilized, the monetary base would stop growing again.

In June, President Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau firmly denied that they had any

plans to devalue the dollar. Yet gold inflows did not resume in significant amounts until the

crisis over Czechoslovakia in September led to fears of war and capital flight from Europe.




did not occur until more than a year after formal desterilization.” Similarly, the Federal Reserve noted “as the result
of the release of gold, funds in the amount of about $1,400,000,000 were added to Treasury deposits at the Federal
Reserve banks, and as these funds are expended by the Treasury they will correspondingly increase member bank
reserves” (Federal Reserve Bulletin, May 1938, 344).

                          The magnitude of the sterilization operation was enormous. Between December 1936

and August 1937, the Treasury sterilized all the increase in the domestic gold stock. At its peak,

in early September 1937, the Treasury had accumulated $1.4 billion in inactive gold reserves.

This amounts to 10 percent of the monetary base as of December 1936.

                          The relationship between gold reserves and the monetary base is shown in Figure 3.

Gold reserves constituted about 85 percent of the monetary base through this period, and

therefore changes in the gold stock had a pronounced impact on the monetary base. As the

figure shows, the gold stock and the monetary base rose together from 1934 to 1936. The gold

stock continued to increase in 1937, but the increase was sterilized and so the monetary base

remained flat. The flat “non-sterilized gold stock” line shows the amount of monetary gold in

the financial system. Then, in late 1937, gold stopped flowing into the country and the country’s

gold stock remained largely unchanged.

       To characterize the relationship between the two variables more formally, consider the

following simple regression of the change in the log of the monetary base on the change in the

log of the gold stock:

                         Δ log (monetary baset) = α + β Δ log (gold stockt) + εt

There should be a strong relationship between the change in the gold stock and the change in the

monetary base between 1934 and 1936, but not after that point if sterilization is not taken into

account. The potential for a structural break in the relationship can be tested by including a

dummy variable that represent the sterilization period (December 1936 through January 1938).

       The results in Table 1 simply confirm the pattern in Figure 3. Changes in the gold stock

explain changes in the monetary base very well, except during the period of sterilization. The

coefficient on the interaction between the change in the gold stock and a dummy variable

representing the sterilization period is nearly equal and opposite to the sign of the coefficient on

the change in the gold stock, reflecting the sterilization offset. By contrast, the relationship

between the monetary base and a measure of the monetized gold stock (adjust for sterilization)

shows no structural break during this period.

second regression includes a dummy variable for September 1938, as it is unclear how the small
remainder of the sterilized gold was desterilized.


       Furthermore, this equation can be estimated for the period through 1936 and then used to

generate an out of sample forecast of the monetary base using actual gold flows. This indicates

how the monetary base would have behaved without sterilization, given the actual changes in the

gold stock. This confirms the earlier conclusion that, by the fourth quarter of 1937, the monetary

base was 10 percent smaller than it would have been had gold not been sterilized.

       Such a forecast raises the question of whether the observed inflows of gold in 1937 can

be taken as given, or whether they were affected by the sterilization program. One argument is

that the observed gold flows between December 1936 and August 1937 were unaffected by the

sterilization program. The increase in the gold stock during the sterilization period was not out

of line with that previously observed. Gold inflows grew at a 15 percent average annual rate

between 1934 and 1936 and at a 15 percent annual rate in 1937 up to October of that year. The

ongoing fears of war in Europe might have ensured the continued flow of gold to the United

States in the absence of the sterilization program. It was only when fears of devaluation

                                                 14
emerged, in reaction to the economic downturn caused in part by the sterilization, that the gold

stopped flowing in. Indeed, to the extent that sterilization contributed to the sharp recession in

the second half of 1937, and led to fears of a devaluation, it clearly reduced gold inflows into the

United States.

         A counter argument is that the sterilization program led to additional gold inflows.

Hanes (2006) finds that interest rates rose slightly around the time that the sterilization program

was put into operation. This might have attracted gold to the United States that otherwise would

not have come. This would make the conclusion that sterilization reduced the monetary base by

10 percent an overestimate.



Reserve Requirements or Gold Sterilization?

         The gold sterilization program and the doubling of reserve requirements occurred at

roughly the same time, making it difficult to determine which was most responsible for change in

the money supply.12 Yet some assessment of the relative importance of the Federal Reserve’s

decision to increase reserve requirements and the Treasury’s decision to sterilize gold inflows is

necessary in order to reach a conclusion about the role of different economic policies during the

1930s.

         One way the two policies can be disentangled is to note that Treasury’s gold sterilization

affected the monetary base, whereas the Fed’s reserve requirement increases affected the money

multiplier (via the deposit-reserve ratio). We have already seen that the sterilization program

had a significant impact on the monetary base. Did changes in reserve requirements have a



12
  As noted earlier, Velde (2009) used a VAR model and found that monetary shocks dominated fiscal shocks in the
recession of 1937-38, but he did not separate the impact of the gold sterilization program from the doubling of
reserve requirements.

                                                      15
significant impact on the deposit-reserve ratio, and hence on the money multiplier and money

supply?

       Figure 4 shows the path of the deposit-reserve ratio from 1934 to 1939. The first three

vertical lines denote the increase in reserve requirements and the last the relaxation of reserve

requirements. If the change in reserve requirements had an immediate impact on monetary

conditions, we would expect to see a drop in the deposit-reserve ratio after an increase in the

requirements and a rise in the ratio after a decrease in the requirements. The deposit-reserve

ratio declines secularly over this period, but surprisingly, the ratio flattens out during the period

when the reserve requirements were increased. Not until the very end of 1937, in December,

well after the final increase in reserve requirements and the start of the recession, does the ratio

begin to decline, but then only in line with its previous trend rate of decline.

       This pattern is not consistent with the reserve requirements leading to tighter monetary

conditions. In addition, the relaxation of the reserve requirements does not lead to an increase in

the deposit-reserve ratio, as we might be expected. This makes it hard to attribute the easing of

monetary conditions, that is, the resumption of growth in the money supply in late 1938, to the

relaxation of reserve requirements. These patterns support the findings of Calomiris, Mason, and

Wheelock (2011) that the higher reserve requirements were not binding.

        To distinguish the contributions of sterilization and reserve requirements in terms of their

impact on the money supply, we can undertake a decomposition in the spirit of Cagan (1965).

The money stock M (measured by M2) is equal to




where H is high powered money (the monetary base), C is currency in the hands of the public, R

is reserves, and D is deposits. The change in the money supply can be decomposed into the

changes in these components:



                                                       17
               ∆ log        ∆ log           1        ∆              1        ∆




where the first component is the contribution of the monetary base, the second is the change in

the currency-money ratio, and the third is the change in the reserve-deposit ratio.

       Table 2 presents the results for six key periods. Two pre-sterilization periods are

considered, from February 1934 to November 1936 and the shorter six month period May-

November 1936. In the two years prior to the sterilization of gold, the gold stock and high

powered money (the monetary base) grew at an annual rate of 11.5 percent. Changes in the

currency-money ratio were relatively small, but the higher reserve-deposit ratio meant that M2

grew at only about 8 percent. In the six months prior to the implementation of the sterilization

program, gold reserves and high powered money increased at an annual rate of about 20 percent,

but M2 growth was still about 8 percent due to an increase in the reserve-deposit ratio.

       Over the nine months during which gold inflows were sterilized, from December 1936 to

August 1937, the gold stock increased at a 16 percent annual rate, but high powered money only

increased at about a 2 percent pace. During this period, the small changes in the reserve-deposit

and the currency-money ratios offset each other. Thus, the sharp slowdown in the growth of

high powered money was almost entirely responsible for the marked deceleration in the growth

of the money supply.

       During the gold scarcity period, August 1937 to February 1938, gold inflows largely

ceased, so that sterilization made little difference. Gold inflows increased only 4 percent, while

the monetary base increased by a greater amount because of the one-time desterilization of $300

million in September 1937. However, an increase in the reserve-deposit ratio offset the increase

in high powered money and M2 actually fell.

                                                18
       From February 1938 to August 1938, the Treasury desterilized its gold accumulation,

allowing high powered money to increase at nearly a 13 percent annual rate even though gold

inflows remained at a low level. However, this was not fully offset by a continued rise in the

reserve-deposit ratio and the money supply expanded.

       Finally, starting in August 1938 and the Czechoslovak crisis in Europe, gold inflows

resumed and, with the sterilization program having been abandoned, monetary growth as well.

Gold reserves increased at an annual rate of more than 24 percent in the six months after August,

allowing high powered money to grow more than 14 percent, with the offset coming from the

reserve-deposit ratio.

       There is no doubt that the increase in the reserve-deposit ratio generally acted as a break

on monetary expansion during this period. However, the changes in the reserve-deposit ratio are

not closely associated with the change in reserve requirements. In the period around the last two

increases in requirements in early 1937, the reserve-deposit ratio is largely unchanged. This is

not what we would expect if the changes in reserve requirements were binding on banks and an

important determinant of the reserve-deposit ratio. On the other hand, during the November

1936-August 1937 period, to judge by the increase in gold reserves, we would have expected the

monetary base to increase about 16 percent. Yet sterilization held it back to about 2 percent.

Thus, in the absence of sterilization, we would have expected the growth of the money supply to

continue at its previous pace instead of declining sharply.



The Monetary Transmission Mechanism

       The fact that gold sterilization produced a marked slowdown in the growth of the money

supply says nothing about the way this shock was transmitted to the real economy. This paper

deliberately stops short of examining the impact of these monetary changes on the real economy.

Economists who have studied the 1930s have broadly concluded that the monetary shocks of the

period were an important source of fluctuations in real economic activity (Romer and Romer

1989, McCallum 1990, Romer 1992, Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz 1995, Velde 2009,

Beckworth and Hendrickson 2011). Thus, it does not seem unreasonable to conclude that the

sterilization policy succeeded in squelching incipient inflationary pressures, but at the cost of a

major recession.

       However, it may still be useful to know how the monetary changes may have affected the

real economy. Changes in monetary conditions are transmitted to the economy through changes



                                                 21
in asset prices, interest rates, bank lending (credit channel), and exchange rates (Mishkin 1995).

Although standard VAR analysis that use monetary aggregates (such as Velde 2009) do not lend

insight into the transmission mechanism, this section presents data on each as a very informal

exploration of which transmission channels might be operational. In this episode, there is

evidence that the asset price and interest rate channels, and perhaps even the bank lending

channel, were all operative in reducing economic activity. There is little evidence that the

exchange rate was an important channel at this particular time.

       Asset prices as measured by the value of stocks moved significantly with the Treasury

action. Figure 5 shows that stock prices peaked in February 1937, just after the start of the

Treasury program. Stock prices fell 44 percent between February 1937 and April 1938, a slide in

stocks that was nearly as large in percentage terms as the stock market crash between early

September and early November1929. Stocks began to recover in April 1938 when the

sterilization program was officially terminated. This sharp decline in equity values would

adversely affect investment by reducing Tobin’s q (the market value of firms relative to the

replacement cost of capital) and adversely affect consumption by reducing financial wealth.

                    There is also evidence that interest rates responded to the sterilization program (Hanes

2006). Figure 6 presents the interest rate spread between commercial paper and Treasury bills.

The paper-bills spread widened about 30 basis points from the start of the sterilization program

until its termination. While interest rate on Treasury bills was largely unchanged during this

period, interest rates on prime commercial paper rose from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent in April

1937, about three months after the Treasury began sterilizing gold inflows. Prior to this uptick,

the rate had been about 0.75 for nearly more than two years. The rate remained at the higher

level until March 1938, one month after the Treasury ended its sterilization policy, when it

dropped down to 0.88 percent. It continued to fall to 0.69 percent by September as the Treasury

desterilized its gold holdings.

                        A third transmission channel is that through credit or bank loans. Data on new loans is

not available during this period, but the Federal Reserve Bulletin reported quarterly data on the

value of outstanding bank loans (with some missing observations). The value of bank loans is

not a good indicator of new lending because changes may be related to repayments or write

downs and defaults. That said, the value of outstanding loans fell 6 percent between the second

quarter of 1937 and the second quarter of 1938 (Bulletin, June 1939, 501). (No data were

reported for the third quarter of 1937.)

                        Finally, in terms of exchange rates, one might expect that tighter monetary conditions

would lead to an appreciation of the dollar, which would reduce net exports. Yet there is no

clear appreciation of the dollar during the period of gold sterilization. The dollar remained stable

against the Canadian dollar, appreciated somewhat against the French franc, and depreciated


                                                                24
against the British pound for most of 1937. With several countries managing their exchange

rates and intervening in foreign exchange markets, the exchange rate channel may have been less

important as a way of transmitting monetary shocks during this particular period.

       In sum, the period of gold sterilization is closely associated with significantly lower

equity prices and higher interest rates. The asset price and interest rate movements were likely to

have been the way that slower monetary growth affected consumption and investment decisions

and thereby reduced real GDP.



Conclusions

       The Recession of 1937-38 is often cited as illustrating the dangers of withdrawing fiscal

and monetary stimulus too early in a weak recovery (Romer 2009). This paper focuses on an

understudied change in monetary policy, the decision to sterilize gold inflows during 1937. This

decision was made by the Treasury Department rather than the Federal Reserve. The findings

presented here suggest that it largely stopped the growth of the monetary base in the period

leading into the recession. The monetary base had been growing at a 15 percent annual rate in

the months prior to sterilization, so the policy contributed to a significant slowdown in the

growth rate of the money supply. Conversely, when the sterilization program was reversed,

growth in the money supply resumed and the economy began to recover.
