The potential for rare macroeconomic disasters may explain an array of asset-pricing puzzles. Our
empirical studies of these extreme events rely on long-term data now covering 28 countries for consumption
and 40 for GDP. A baseline model calibrated with observed peak-to-trough disaster sizes accords
with the average equity premium with a reasonable coefficient of relative risk aversion. High stock-price
volatility can be explained by incorporating time-varying long-run growth rates and disaster probabilities.
Business-cycle models with shocks to disaster probability have implications for the cyclical behaviorRI
asset returns and corporate leverage, and international versions may explain the uncovered-interest-parity
puzzle. Richer models of disaster dynamics allow for transitions between normalcy and disaster, bring
in post-crisis recoveries, and use the full time series on consumption. Potential future research includes
applications to long-term economic growth and environmental economics and the use of stock-price
options and other variables to gauge time-varying disaster probabilities.

1. INTRODUCTION

       One side effect of the macroeconomic, financial, and sovereign-debt crises of 2008-2011

is that economists became more receptive to models of asset pricing and macroeconomic

dynamics that emphasize macroeconomic disasters. Theoretical and empirical research suggests

that rare-disaster models have explanatory power for an array of asset-pricing puzzles.

Moreover, time-varying disaster probabilities may be an important component of closed- and

open-economy models of business cycles.

       The probability and size distribution of macroeconomic disasters are difficult to quantify

empirically because the relevant events are rare and possibly absent in short samples. Thus, the

isolation of a substantial number of disasters requires long time series for numerous countries,

and the data cannot be missing during many key events, such as wars and major financial crises.

Fortunately, the status of long-term national-accounts data for 40 countries has been upgraded by

the data effort summarized in Ursúa (2011). The combination of this panel of national-accounts

data with expanded long-term information on asset returns facilitates research on rare

macroeconomic disasters. We begin with an overview of these data and then review theoretical

and empirical advances that use these and other data to study the macro-finance of rare disasters.

       Section 2, on measurement issues, emphasizes recent improvements in the long-term

national-accounts data, including annual series on real per capita consumer expenditure, C (the

main available proxy for consumption), and GDP. The long-term data on returns on stocks, bills,

and bonds are also discussed. The macroeconomic and financial data can be used to quantify the

frequency and size distribution of rare macroeconomic disasters and to study the interplay of

macroeconomic events with asset returns and prices.




                                                 1
       Statistical analysis of the time series shows that volatilities of annual growth rates of C

and GDP are similar. The data on rates of return exhibit a high equity premium (7%), a

substantial term premium between bonds and bills (1-1/2%), and high volatility of stock returns

(standard deviation of 32% per year). We stress the fat tails apparent in annual data on growth

rates of C and GDP and in the various rates of return.

       Section 3 introduces macro-finance models that incorporate rare disasters as a way to

explain asset-pricing puzzles. Section 4 presents a baseline model in which disasters have

instantaneous and permanent effects on levels of macroeconomic variables. This model yields

tractable, closed-form solutions for asset pricing under preference specifications that include the

Epstein-Zin-Weil recursive form, which separates risk aversion from the intertemporal elasticity

of substitution (IES) for consumption. We assess the baseline model empirically when disaster

frequencies and sizes are gauged from peak-to-trough methods using observed histograms

(Section 5) or estimated power-law distributions (Section 6). A key issue is whether the

coefficient of relative risk aversion required to match the observed average equity premium is

“reasonable.”

       Section 7 shows that the baseline model does not match the observed volatility of stock

prices. This deficiency can be remedied by incorporating shifting long-run growth rates, as in

the long-run-risks model considered in Section 8.

       An alternative explanation for stock-price volatility, studied in Section 9, allows for shifts

in disaster probability. This approach may explain an array of asset-pricing puzzles that extend

beyond the high equity premium, low risk-free rate, and high stock-price volatility. A number of

recent applications allow for time-varying disaster probability in business-cycle models. In an

international context, discussed in Section 10, the framework with time-varying disaster



                                                 2
probability has been applied to the uncovered-interest-parity (UIP) puzzle, which relates to the

surprisingly high returns delivered over some periods by carry-trade strategies.

       Section 11 considers richer models of the dynamics of disasters, allowing for stochastic

transitions between states of normalcy and disaster. In this setting, disasters arise of varying

lengths and intensities, and the subsequent recoveries feature abnormally high growth. The

allowance for recoveries means that disasters are less permanent than in the baseline model and,

hence, have smaller effects on the equity premium. Section 12 discusses the implications of

these richer models for the full time series of macroeconomic variables and rates of return.

Section 13 concludes by suggesting promising avenues for future research.



2. MEASURING EXTREME MACRO-FINANCIAL EVENTS

       From an empirical perspective, the lack of sufficient data on extreme macroeconomic

events has been an obstacle. Because these events occur infrequently, assessments of the impact

of actual and potential disasters require the pooling of information from many economies and

years. Moreover, the estimation of key statistical properties, such as frequency and size

distribution, requires the sample to be representative of a broader universe of economies.

       Rietz (1988) introduced rare disasters into an asset-pricing model and argued that his

extension helped to explain the now famous equity-premium puzzle of Mehra and Prescott

(1985). The Rietz idea met skepticism concerning the lack of evidence on the low-probability

depressions required by his theory. As Mehra and Prescott (1988, p. 135) argued: “Additional

historical evidence in support of Rietz’s hypothesis is needed for it to be taken seriously. … The

point is that to determine how useful this theory is, we must identify the possible small-

probability events and try to measure the magnitudes of their probability over time.”



                                                  3
           Barro (2006) renewed interest in Rietz’s insight by examining long-term data for many

countries; thereby including numerous realizations of disaster events. The initial application

relied on Maddison’s (2003) data on real per capita GDP. Unfortunately, these data are

problematic; partly because of flaws in construction, especially at times of disasters such as

wars, 1 and partly because asset-pricing models typically apply to consumption, not GDP. Barro

and Ursúa (2008) extended the data set to include estimates of per capita consumption, C (based

primarily on personal consumer expenditure) and to improve the measurement of GDP for many

countries. The annual data apply over periods extending back before World War I. These data,

now available for 40 countries and described in Ursúa (2011), are discussed next, together with a

review of historical information on asset returns.


      2.1. Recent Improvements in Data on National-Accounts Variables and Asset Returns

           The typical variables of interest in the macro-finance literature are growth rates of the

main macroeconomic aggregates, real per capita consumption, C, and GDP, and real rates of

return on financial assets, notably stocks and government bills. Gaps in the data hinder analyses

of rare disasters because of a sample-selection problem, whereby data are most likely missing

during the worst crises. Therefore, in a time-series context for a single country, it is important to

have estimates for the most difficult periods, often wars. Similarly, in a cross section, it is

important not to omit countries with the most difficult macroeconomic histories. Recent

extensions of the long-term data to include several challenging cases—China, Russia, and

Turkey—represent major improvements in this regard. The basic spirit of our empirical

approach to rare macroeconomic disasters is to pool information from the largest possible

number of countries and years. Particularly unsatisfactory in this regard is the tendency of


1
    Barro and Ursúa (2008, Table A1) provide a detailed analysis of these measurement problems.

                                                          4
researchers to rely on data for the United States, a practice that, even with the inclusion of the

recent Great Recession, puts far too much emphasis on a mostly tranquil macroeconomic history

aside from the Great Depression of the early 1930s.

           Until recently, the best macroeconomic panel data were the per capita GDP series

assembled by Angus Maddison. These series constitute a monumental contribution that has been

widely used, notably in works on historical macroeconomic and financial crises, such as Bordo,

Eichengreen, Klingebiel and Martinez-Peria (2001) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

Shortcomings of Maddison’s data include his tendency to fill in missing observations during

crisis periods by interpolating between benchmarks or using information from other countries.

Additional problems include lack of data on consumption and omission of major countries.

These considerations motivated Barro and Ursúa (2008) to construct the new data set described

in Ursúa (2011). The construction of these data was challenging, akin to macroeconomic

archaeology. The goal was to improve as much as possible on Maddison’s GDP series and to

build a comprehensive new panel for C. The sample-selection criterion was to assemble

continuous time series since at least before World War I, while retaining high quality standards.

Various methods were implemented to cover periods originally missing or inadequately covered

in standard sources.

           The macroeconomic data are publicly available 2 and are summarized in Table 1. The

information covers 42 countries, falling into five regional groups: Southeast Asia, Latin

America, Western Europe, Western Offshoots, and Others. Country starting dates vary, ranging

from the early 19th century to 1913. An asterisk indicates that the series has missing data points.

The present analysis applies to 40 countries for GDP (21 OECD, 19 non-OECD) and 28 for C

(18 OECD, 10 non-OECD). 3 The corresponding number of annual data points for growth rates

from 1870 to 2009 is 5242 for GDP and 3527 for C. Figure 1a shows level series for four major

countries (Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States), and Figure 1b show series for

four countries with newly available information (China, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey).

        Many applications require corresponding information on asset returns. For example,

Barro and Ursúa (2009) and Ursúa (2010) used data on real returns on stocks, bills, and bonds.

The major source of these data is Global Financial Data (Taylor, 2005), but the coverage was

expanded with additional sources, including Morningstar and other sources for Argentina, Brazil,

Japan, and Mexico. Table 1 describes the long-term data on these asset returns.


        2.2. Statistical Properties of Macroeconomic Growth Rates and Asset Returns

        Yearly growth rates and rates of returns are the basic units of measurement for studying

extreme macro-financial events over the long run for up to 40 countries. Table 2 shows statistics

for growth rates of real per capita GDP and personal consumer expenditure, C, and real rates of

return on stocks, bills, and bonds. The real rates of return are computed arithmetically based on

total returns and deflation by consumer price indexes. The table shows the mean, standard

deviation, and excess kurtosis for each variable for the full sample (starting as early as 1870 and

ending in 2009) and the post-WWII period (1948-2009). The statistics apply to countries with

data, broken down into the “world” (full set of countries), OECD, and non-OECD.

        Average growth rates of per capita C and GDP are around 2% per year for full samples

and somewhat higher—between 2.5% and 2.8%—in the post-WWII period. For OECD

3
 Our term “OECD” excludes Turkey and recent members. GDP data for Malaysia and Singapore are included in the
basic data set but excluded from our analysis because of missing data around WWII. Some of the analysis also
omits the Philippines for GDP because of a gap in data around WWII. Greece is included for our GDP analysis
despite a missing data point for 1944. We think that 42 countries (21 OECD) come close to those with potentially
useable long-term national-accounts data. Possibilities for extension include closing the gaps in GDP data around
WWII for Greece, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. A possible 43rd country is Ireland, but we have not yet
been successful. Maddison (2003) provides data since 1921, but figures for 1938-1946 come from interpolation.

                                                        6
countries, the standard deviations are around 3% in the post-WWII period but higher, nearly 6%,

in full samples. The main reason for this difference is that the full samples contain many

realizations of disasters between 1914 and 1946, a period featuring the two world wars, the Great

Depression, and the Great Influenza Pandemic. In contrast to observations for the post-WWII

United States (such as Campbell and Deaton [1989]), C growth in OECD countries is not

smoother than GDP growth—the standard deviations for these two variables are similar.

        For non-OECD countries, standard deviations are again higher in the full sample than in

the post-WWII period. These standard deviations are also higher in both samples than in the

OECD. In the non-OECD, the standard deviation for C growth exceeds that for GDP in both

samples. Part of this pattern can reflect poorer measurement for C than for GDP. However, C

tends also to decline more than GDP during wartime disasters, in which military spending rises

substantially.

        Excess kurtosis is positive in both samples for C and GDP growth. These results indicate

fat tails; that is, fatter than the normal density. The pattern of high excess kurtosis applies

especially to the full sample for OECD countries, likely reflecting the numerous disaster

realizations between 1914 and 1946. 4

        For asset returns, the means for the “world” over the full sample are 8.4% for stocks,

1.3% for bills, and 3.0% for bonds. Thus, these data reveal an average equity premium (stocks

versus bills) of 7.1%. However, this value reflects leverage in corporate financial structure; an

adjustment assuming a constant debt-equity ratio of 0.5 implies an average unlevered equity

premium around 5%. The average term premium (roughly 10-year bonds versus 3-month bills)

was 1.7%. The well-known volatility of stock returns shows up as a high standard deviation,


4
Ursúa (2011) shows from bootstrap methods that excess kurtosis is significantly positive for growth rates of C and
GDP over full samples. Skewness differs insignificantly from zero.

                                                         7
32%, for the world over full samples (25% for OECD, 44% for non-OECD). There is also

substantial volatility of bill returns (11% for the world over full samples) and bond returns

(13%). The high values of excess kurtosis signal fat tails for all of the rates of return. 5

         The new macroeconomic data allowed Ursúa (2011) to use power-law distributions to

gauge the fatness of the tails for C and GDP growth. Fat tails were important for negative and

positive outcomes, with the former representing disasters and the latter (“bonanzas”) reflecting

mainly recoveries from disasters. Tail fatness was stronger for OECD countries than for non-

OECD, consistent with the findings on excess kurtosis in Table 2. This pattern likely arises

because the biggest disasters associate particularly with WWII in OECD countries.



                                    2.3 Macroeconomic Disaster Events

         Barro and Ursúa (2008) followed Barro (2006) by using an NBER (National Bureau of

Economic Research)-style peak-to-trough measurement of the sizes of macroeconomic

contractions. Starting from the annual time series, proportionate decreases in C and GDP were

computed peak to trough over one or more years, and declines by 10% or greater were

considered. For the four countries in Figure 1a, the events isolated from this method were:

Germany 4 disasters each for C and GDP, Japan 2 disasters each for C and GDP, United

Kingdom 2 disasters each for C and GDP, and United States 2 C disasters and 5 GDP disasters.

The largest contractions in this group were the decline in Germany’s GDP by 74% with a trough

in 1946 and in its C by 41% with a trough in 1945, the fall in Japan’s C by 64% with a trough in

1945 and in its GDP by 50% with a trough in 1944. The worst U.S. contractions were for GDP

by 29% with a trough in 1933, for C by 21% with a trough in 1933, and for C by 16% with a

5
 Ursúa (2011) finds from bootstrap methods that excess kurtosis is significantly positive for the three rates of return
over full samples. Skewness is significantly positive for stock returns, significantly negative for bill returns, and
insignificantly different from zero for bond returns.

trough in 1921. The United Kingdom illustrates a pattern where C falls proportionately more

than GDP during wartime. The declines in C are 17% with a trough in 1918 and 17% with a

trough in 1943, but GDP disasters do not apply to U.K. GDP during the world wars.

        Table 3 shows results from the peak-to-trough technique applied to the four countries

with newly assembled macroeconomic data: China (long-term data for GDP only), Egypt,

Russia (including Soviet Union), and Turkey (including Ottoman Empire). 6 The disasters

isolated number 5 for China’s GDP, 5 for Egypt’s GDP and 6 for its C, 7 for Russia’s GDP and 6

for its C, and 8 for Turkey’s GDP and 6 for its C. Some of these events are among the largest

depressions ever witnessed: the declines for Russia’s C and GDP by 71% and 62%, respectively,

in WWI and the Russian Revolution/Civil War; the fall by 58% in Russian C during WWII; the

decline in China’s GDP by 50% from 1936 to 1946 (including WWII); the falls by 49% and 45%

in Turkey’s C and GDP, respectively, during WWI; and the decrease in Russia’s GDP by 48% in

the transition period 1989-1998.

        Figure 2 uses histograms to provide an overview of disaster events applying to 28

countries for C and 40 for GDP. (These samples end in 2006 and include countries with data

from before WWI.) The peak-to-trough method isolates 125 disasters for C and 183 for GDP.

The average disaster sizes, subject to the threshold of 10%, were similar for the two measures:

0.216 for C and 0.208 for GDP. The mean durations were also similar: 3.7 years for C and 3.6

for GDP.

        Table 4 relates the macroeconomic crises to major historical events. World War II is

prominent, featuring 21 crises for C (average size of 0.33) and 25 for GDP (average of 0.37).

World War I and the Great Depression also stand out. The period 1920-22 may reflect the Great

6
 Border changes were important for Russia and Turkey and also apply to other countries. See Ursúa (2011) on the
treatment of border changes—basically, the level series come from smooth pasting of the growth rates from before
and after each change.

                                                        9
Influenza Pandemic. The post-WWII period is comparatively tranquil, especially for the OECD,

and still appears this way if we extend the end of the sample from 2006 to 2009. 7

          A listing of disaster events—by country, timing, and size—is in Barro and Ursúa (2008,

Tables C1 and C2) and can be extended to incorporate Table 3. Barro and Ursúa (2008, Table 9)

show that there is no clear pattern on whether C or GDP reaches its trough first during crises;

59% of the events have the same trough year for C and GDP.

          Barro and Jin (2011) show that the frequency distribution for C and GDP disaster sizes

(Figure 2) can be characterized by power laws, thereby fitting with Gabaix’s (2009) discussion

of the many applications of power-law distributions in finance and other areas. If b is the

proportionate disaster size, the power law applies to the transformed variable, z ≡ 1/(1-b), which

is the ratio of normal to disaster C or GDP. The power law holds for b above some threshold,

taken to be 0.095, which translates into a threshold for z of 1.105. The single power-law density

is then

                                   f(z) = Az-(α+1) ,                                             (1)

for z ≥ 1.105, where A>0, α>0. The lower the exponent, α, the fatter the tail of large disasters.

Barro and Jin (2011, Table I) show that extending to a double power law substantially improves

the fit and that the upper-tail exponent is the key parameter for asset-pricing results. The

estimated exponent is 4.2 (s.e.=0.9) for C and 3.5 (s.e.=1.0) for GDP. We use these results later

when discussing the link between tail behavior and the coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ.




7
 If we extend to 2009 to include the recent Great Recession, we find many contractions but none in our samples that
reach the 10% threshold. For GDP, Iceland and Japan have declines by 9%, and Finland and Russia have declines
by 8%. For C, Spain has a decline by 9% and Mexico by 8%. Iceland has a decline in C by 25%, but it is not in our
28-country sample.

3. RARE DISASTERS AND MACRO-FINANCE MODELS

       Models in macro-finance with extreme events have emphasized the interplay between

rare disasters and asset-pricing puzzles. The earliest example is Rietz (1988), who introduced a

low-probability crash state to explain the equity-premium puzzle of Mehra and Prescott (1985).

Another example is Naik and Lee (1990), who developed a continuous-time version of Lucas’s

(1978) endowment-economy model to study the pricing of options when random jumps affect

the value of the underlying asset. During the 1990s, the literature focused on non-disaster

explanations for the equity-premium puzzle, such as the heterogeneous-consumers model of

Constantinides and Duffie (1996) and the habit-formation paradigm of Abel (1990) and

Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Constantinides (2002) reviews advances in these directions.

       In the mid 2000s, the literature returned to the asset-pricing implications of disasters.

Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004) stressed the sensitivity of cash flows to large economic shocks and

presented a calibrated model with substantially higher equity premia than in standard

frameworks. Bansal and Yaron (2004), in an approach now known as the long-run-risks model,

emphasized the persistence of changes in expected growth rates and variances of growth rates as

determinants of risk premia and the volatility of asset prices. Barro (2006) focused on rare

macroeconomic disasters of the short-run type, thereby reviving Rietz’s insight. This model’s

tractability and empirical success make it a good platform for understanding how the potential

for rare disasters may resolve various asset-pricing puzzles.




4. A BASELINE MODEL OF ASSET PRICING WITH RARE DISASTERS

       As developed in Barro (2006, 2009), the baseline model is a variant of Lucas’s (1978)

representative-agent, fruit-tree economy, with exogenous and stochastic production. The


                                                 11
economy is closed, government consumption is nil, and the number of trees is fixed. These

assumptions contribute to the model’s tractability but can be relaxed; for example, similar results

hold for an AK model with stochastic depreciation (destruction of trees) and endogenous

investment and growth.

       An important assumption in the baseline model is that disasters and other disturbances

amount to i.i.d. shocks to productivity. Hence, real per capita C and GDP evolve as random

walks with drift:

                       log(Ct+1) = log(Ct) + g + ut+1 + vt+1 .              (2)

The parameter 𝑔 ≥ 0 represents exogenous productivity growth. The first random term, 𝑢𝑡+1,

reflects “normal” macroeconomic fluctuations and is assumed to be i.i.d normal with zero mean

and constant variance, σ2. The second shock, 𝑣𝑡+1, picks up rare disastersevents in which

output contracts over a period by a fraction 𝑏, where 0 < 𝑏 < 1. These events occur with

constant probability 𝑝 ≥ 0 per period; hence,

                              probability 1 − 𝑝: 𝑣𝑡+1 = 0,

                              probability 𝑝: 𝑣𝑡+1 = log(1 − 𝑏).

The disaster size, b, is subject to some frequency distribution, such as the power-law density

discussed before. In this model, the expected growth rate of C and GDP is

                              g* = g + (1/2)σ2 – p·Eb .                             (3)

       The i.i.d. property implies that shocks have permanent effects on level variables. As

shown in Barro (2009), this property yields closed-form solutions for asset pricing under two

familiar specifications of preferences for the representative agent: power utility and the

recursive preferences developed by Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990), henceforth called

EZW preferences. The advantage of the more general EZW formulation is that it separates the


                                                 12
coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ, from the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution (IES), θ. 8 As stressed by Bansal and Yaron (2004), EZW preferences avoid

counterintuitive predictions from the power-utility case, γ=θ, in the context of sufficient risk

aversion (γ>1) for the model possibly to account for the equity premium. Power utility then

implies, implausibly, that a rise in the expected growth rate, g* in Eq. (3), lowers the stock price-

dividend ratio, whereas an increase in uncertainty (σ or p or an outward shift in the density for b)

raises this ratio.

         As mentioned, EZW preferences allow for a separation between γ and θ. Epstein and Zin

(1989) and Restoy and Weil (1998, p. 4) show that the first-order optimization condition for the

representative agent’s choices of consumption over time is 9

                                     𝐶𝑡


where β (0<β<1) is the one-period discount factor, Rw,t+1 is the gross return from t to t+1 on

overall wealth (corresponding to ownership rights on trees in the Lucas-tree model), and Rt+1 is

the gross return from t to t+1 on any asset. (The rate of time preference, ρ, equals [1-β]/β.)

Power utility corresponds to γ=θ and, therefore, to the familiar consumption-based asset-pricing

formula:

                                                  𝐶𝑡+1 −𝜃
                                      𝛽 ∙ 𝐸𝑡 �(       )     ∙ 𝑅𝑡+1 � = 1 .                             (5)
                                                   𝐶𝑡




8
  The formulation of Kreps and Porteus (1978) emphasized attitudes toward early versus late resolution of
uncertainty, and Epstein and Zin (1989) began with this perspective. The usual EZW preferences with γ>θ imply
that people prefer early resolution. This result is puzzling—why are risk aversion and intertemporal substitution
closely linked to preferences about early versus late resolution? The situation is reminiscent of the tight link
between risk aversion and intertemporal substitution under power utility. Perhaps an analogous extension can be
made to the EZW framework to eliminate the constraint that there are only two degrees of freedom among three
apparently distinct dimensions of preferences—risk aversion, intertemporal substitution, and early versus late
resolution of uncertainty.
9
  This analysis assumes that the representative agent’s relative risk aversion, γ, is constant. Empirical support for this
familiar specification appears in Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008) and Chiappori and Paiella (2008).

                                                              13
       Let Pt be the price of an unlevered equity claim on a Lucas tree. This asset is the only

one in positive aggregate net supply in this model. The dividend is the fruit, which equals Ct.

Therefore, the gross return on wealth is

where Vt ≡ Pt/Ct is the price-dividend ratio. Substitution into Eq. (4) yields:
                                                                      (𝜃−𝛾)
                           (1−𝛾)

       If the shocks to Ct+1/Ct (including disasters) are i.i.d., Vt+1 =Vt = V holds in Eq. (6), and

the condition again takes the usual form:

                                                     𝐶𝑡+1 −𝛾
                                       𝛽 ∗ ∙ 𝐸𝑡 �(       )     ∙ 𝑅𝑡+1 � = 1 ,                 (7)
                                                      𝐶𝑡


where β* is a constant that depends on all the underlying parameters. The two differences from

Eq. (5) are that the exponent on consumption growth is γ, not θ, and β*≠β. However, since β* is

constant, this last difference affects levels of rates of return but not differences between rates,

such as the equity premium.

       Barro (2009) used Eq. (7), along with the process for Ct in Eq. (2), to generate a formula

for the unlevered equity premium that applies when the period length approaches zero:

                                       re - rf = γσ2 + p·E{b·[(1-b)-γ-1]} ,                   (8)

where all terms are measured per unit of time (say per year), re is the expected rate of return on

unlevered equity, and rf is the risk-free rate. The first term on the right-hand side is the standard

one for normal business fluctuations, as in Mehra and Prescott (1985). As in their analysis, this

term is negligible for reasonable values of γ and σ. The second term involves rare disasters and




                                                                14
enters multiplicatively with p, the disaster probability. 10 This disaster term ends up doing almost

all the work in explaining the equity premium.

         The expression in curly brackets in Eq. (8) has a straightforward interpretation under

power utility, γ=θ. Then this term is the product of the proportionate decline in equity value

during a disaster, b, and the excess of marginal utility of consumption in a disaster state over that

in a normal state, (1-b)-γ-1. Note that, in the present (i.i.d.) setting, the proportionate fall in

equity value during a disaster, b, equals the proportionate fall in C and GDP during the disaster.

Equation (8) can be rewritten as

                            re - rf = γσ2 + p·[E(1-b)-γ – E(1-b)1-γ – Eb].                              (9)

Hence, the key properties of the distribution of b are the expectations of the variable 1/(1-b)

taken to the powers γ and γ-1. (The Eb term has a minor impact.)

         Equation (9) is best viewed as applying to short periods, approximating continuous time.

In the limit, disasters arise as downward jumps at an instant of time, and the disaster size, b, has

no time units. In contrast, the underlying data on C and GDP are annual flows. In relating the

data to the theory, there is no reason to identify disaster sizes, b, with large contractions in C or

GDP observed particularly from one year to the next. In fact, Figure 2 and Table 4 demonstrate

that the major disaster events—exemplified by the world wars and the Great Depression—

feature cumulative declines over several years, with durations of varying length. In Barro and

Ursúa (2008), the disaster jump sizes, b, in the continuous-time model were approximated

empirically by the peak-to-trough measures of cumulative, proportionate decline. We first




10
  The identification of the risk-free rate, rf, with the real return on government bills is an approximation, particularly
if governments sometimes default formally or through surprise inflation. If defaults occur only during disasters, for
which the probability of default is q and the default fraction is b, then p in Eq. (8) is replaced by p·(1-q). Therefore, a
higher q reduces the equity premium measured as the difference between stock and bill returns.

                                                            15
consider the explanatory power of this approach and then explore ways to improve on the peak-

to-trough measurement.



5. USING HISTOGRAMS FOR PEAK-TO-TROUGH DISASTERS

       Barro and Ursúa (2008) gauged the moments involving disaster sizes, b, in Eq. (9) by

histograms as in Figure 2, applying to disasters of size 10% or larger and using alternative values

of γ. The disaster probability, p, was estimated from the empirical frequency of entry into

disaster states as 3.6% per year for C and 3.7% for GDP. This methodology assumes that the

same process for generating macroeconomic disasters applies within countries over time and

across countries. Given this assumption—which provides enough disaster realizations to pin

down the relevant parameters with high precision—it is reasonable to use a rational-expectations

approach to estimate p and the size distribution of disasters. That is, agents’ expectations are

assumed to correspond to those generated by the true process (as estimated). We discuss later

models in which the disaster probability varies over time.

       A principal conclusion from Barro and Ursúa (2008, Tables 10 and 11) was that an

unlevered equity premium around 5% accorded with the data for C and GDP if γ was around 3.5.

Hence, the required risk aversion was substantial but not astronomical. The results were similar

for C and GDP, did not change greatly when only OECD data were used, and did not depend

much on whether the threshold for declaring a disaster was the assumed 10% value or something

higher, such as 15%. However, the results depended on the inclusion of the largest disaster

events, many of which associated with wars.

       The model’s equity premium in Eq. (9) does not depend on some parameters, such as the

expected growth rate g* in Eq. (3) and the rate of time preference, ρ (which equals [1-β]/β]).



                                                 16
However, levels of rates of return, including the risk-free rate, depend on these parameters. In

the calibration of the model, ρ was chosen—given the other parameter values—to accord with a

risk-free rate of 1%. 11 Therefore, while the fitted model is consistent with this low risk-free rate,

this fit does not constitute a test of the model.



6. USING POWER LAWS FOR DISASTER SIZES

        Barro and Jin (2011, Table 1) used the same underlying information on disaster events

but estimated the moments involving disaster sizes, b, from the estimated power-law distribution

discussed before, rather than histograms. The key parameter for the equity premium in this

parametric form is the exponent, α, applicable to the upper tail of the power-law density. The

form of Eq. (9) implies that the equity premium involves a race between γ—where a higher value

implies a larger equity premium—and the fatness of the upper tail for large disasters—where a

higher α implies a thinner tail and, therefore, a smaller equity premium. The equity premium is

finite only if γ<α. 12 Therefore, with a finite observed unlevered equity premium (about 5%) and

an estimated α around 4, the estimated γ (the value required to match the equity premium) has to

be below 4. The results implied an estimated γ of 3.0 (s.e.=0.5) from the C data and 2.8

(s.e.=0.6) from the GDP data.

        The likely reason that the parametric approach to gauging disaster sizes (based on power-

law distributions) produces smaller estimates of γ than the histogram approach is that the latter

method is especially sensitive to a selection bias that screens out the worst disasters from the

sample. This selection seems inevitable since economies that are nearly totally destroyed are
11
   In Barro and Ursúa (2008, Tables 10 and 11), the required ρ was 0.045 with the C data and 0.052 with GDP. The
corresponding effective rates of time preference, ρ*, corresponding to β* in Eq. (7), were 0.029 and 0.037,
respectively.
12
   Similarly, Weitzman (2007) shows that the equity premium can be infinite when the underlying shocks are log-
normally distributed with an unknown variance. In this context, the frequency distribution for asset pricing is the
t-distribution, for which the tails can be sufficiently fat to generate an infinite equity premium.

                                                         17
unlikely to have data. However, Ursúa’s (2011) recent extension to cases that had been

challenging in terms of data and that also feature large disaster events (Russia, Turkey, and

China) has lessened the extent of this selection bias.



7. STOCK-PRICE VOLATILITY

        One shortcoming of the baseline model is its failure to match the observed high volatility

of stock returns. The model’s standard deviation of unlevered stock returns equals that for

growth rates of C and GDP, but Table 2 shows for the world over the full sample that the

standard deviations were 6.4% for C growth, 6.0% for GDP growth, and 31.7% for stock returns.

Allowing for leverage in corporate financial structure explains only part of this discrepancy. The

basic problem is that the model implies a constant stock price-dividend ratio, V, whereas this

ratio is volatile in the data.

        In the baseline model, corresponding to Eqs. (2) and (7), the formula for the (constant)

dividend-price ratio, 1/V, is, as in Barro (2009):
        1                            1                              𝜃−1
            = 𝜌 + (𝜃 − 1) ∙ 𝑔 ∗ − � � ∙ 𝛾 ∙ (𝜃 − 1) ∙ 𝜎 2 − 𝑝 ∙ �         � ∙ [𝐸(1 − 𝑏)1−𝛾 − 1 − (𝛾 − 1) ∙ 𝐸𝑏] ,   (10)
        𝑉                            2                              𝛾−1


where ρ is the rate of time preference (equal to [1-β]/β) and g* = g + (1/2)σ2 – p·Eb is the

expected growth rate from Eq. (3). Thus, as in Bansal and Yaron (2004), with EZW preferences,

the model has “reasonable” properties for effects of one-time changes in the expected growth

rate and uncertainty only if θ<1; that is, if the IES > 1. In this case, the price-dividend ratio, V,

rises with an increase in g* and falls with an increase in uncertainty (σ, p, or an outward shift in

the distribution of b).

        Equation (10) suggests that volatility in V—and, hence, in stock returns—can be

generated by variations in g* (the long-run risks model of Bansal and Yaron [2004]) or by



                                                            18
variations in parameters, such as the disaster probability, p, that govern uncertainty (as in Gabaix

[2010], Gourio [2008, 2010], and Wachter [2011]). What is less clear is whether these fixes with

regard to volatility have much implication for asset returns, including the equity premium. We

consider this issue in the next three sections.



8. SHIFTING LONG-RUN GROWTH RATES

         Suppose that shifts to the expected growth rate, g*, occur independently of the other

shocks in Eq. (2)—the assumption made by Bansal and Yaron (2004), henceforth BY. With the

IES>1, an increase in g* raises the price-dividend ratio, V, as in Eq. (7), and leads, thereby, to a

high stock return. Therefore, variability in g* can generate volatility in stock returns. However,

since the realization of Ct+1 is independent of the shock to g* that occurs at t+1, the movements

in g* do not create non-zero covariance between stock returns and contemporaneous

consumption growth. 13 If preferences for consumption were time separable, this lack of

covariance implies that the variability of g* would not influence the equity premium.

         However, in an EZW world, preferences over consumption are not time separable.

Rather, if γ>θ and θ<1, as already assumed, EZW preferences imply complementarity between

Ct+1 and anticipated later values of C. Because of this complementarity, an increase in g* at date

t+1 reduces the value of the pricing kernel (through the term containing Vt+1 in Eq. [6]) in the

way that normally follows from a rise in Ct+1/Ct. Therefore, the covariance pattern is that

marginal utility of consumption is low when stock returns are high. This channel explains why

shifting long-run mean growth rates contribute to the equity premium in the BY model.


13
  With endogenous investment, shocks to g* can generate covariance between stock returns and consumption
growth. However, with the IES>1, a rise in g* tends to reduce contemporaneous consumption, implying that stock
returns covary positively with the marginal utility of consumption. Therefore, in this setting, the variability of g*
tends to reduce the equity premium.

                                                          19
        The BY model also contains a time-varying variance of the long-run growth rate. An

increase in this variance amounts to a rise in uncertainty. With the assumed configuration of

preference parameters in the EZW setting, a rise in uncertainty at date t+1 lowers the price-

dividend ratio, Vt+1—this result holds in Eq. (7) for analogous effects from shifts in the

uncertainty parameters σ and p. Therefore, shifting uncertainty helps to explain volatility of

stock prices. Effects on the equity premium depend again on the lack of time separability of

consumption under EZW preferences. Specifically, Eq. (6) implies that the negative effect of a

rise in uncertainty on Vt+1 raises the value of the pricing kernel, thereby creating a covariance

pattern where marginal utility of consumption is high when stock returns are low. Hence, time-

varying uncertainty reinforces the effect on the equity premium from a time-varying mean

growth rate.

        Bansal and Yaron (2004) find by calibrating their model with U.S. data that matching the

observed average equity premium depends on high risk aversion; the required γ is around 10. 14

Nakamura, Sergeyev, and Steinsson (2011) get similar results in an extended version of the BY

model fit to long-run data on consumer expenditure for 16 OECD countries. The reliance on

very high risk aversion is not surprising because the effects of long-run risks on the equity

premium depend on complementarity between present and future consumption. Although this

channel exists with EZW preferences, the linkage turns out to be too weak to explain much of the

equity premium when γ takes on “reasonable” values. Therefore, our conclusion is that variation

in long-run mean growth rates and in variances of these growth rates may usefully supplement



14
  Bansal and Yaron (2004, p. 1492) justify a γ as high as 10 by saying: “Mehra and Prescott (1985) argue that a
reasonable upper bound for risk aversion is around 10.” However, Mehra and Prescott were actually arguing that, in
the context of power utility, a γ of 10 was at the outer bound of what was conceivable. Nakamura, Sergeyev, and
Steinsson (2011, p.3) observe that an agent with a γ of 10 would turn down a 50-50 gamble that raised consumption
by a factor of 1 million or lowered it by 1%.

analyses that include disaster risk but probably cannot be the main basis for explaining the equity

premium and related asset-pricing puzzles explored by Gabaix (2010).



9. SHIFTING DISASTER PROBABILITIES

        Gabaix (2010) allows for time-varying probability and severity of disasters; as already

noted, these features can generate volatility of price-dividend ratios. Aside from the high equity

premium, low risk-free rate, and volatility of stock returns, Gabaix shows that the framework can

account for a number of other asset-pricing puzzles. These puzzles include the predictability of

stock returns based on price-dividend ratios, the typically upward-sloping nominal yield curve

for bonds, the high price of deep out-of-the-money puts on stock-price indexes, and the high

corporate-Treasury yield spread (compared with the underlying probability of corporate default).

For the last result, the key point is that corporate bonds, especially the highest-rated issues, have

their defaults concentrated into the worst of economic times when the marginal utility of

consumption is high. The same point explains high prices of deep out-of-the-money puts on

stock-price indexes.

        Gourio (2010) introduces an exogenous, persistent, time-varying disaster probability into

a closed-economy real business-cycle model. Realizations of this shock affect macroeconomic

variables, partly through direct influences on productivity and partly through effects on capital

accumulation. The shock also influences asset prices. In his preferred calibration, which

features an IES>1, a rise in disaster probability leads to a decline of output, investment, stock

prices, and the risk-free interest rate and to a rise in the expected rate of return on stocks.

Therefore, time-varying disaster probabilities create a counter-cyclical pattern for the equity

premium and a procyclical pattern for the risk-free rate.



                                                   21
            Gourio (2011) extends the model to include firms’ choices of financial structure, equity

versus debt. An expansion of debt has tax advantages but also raises expected bankruptcy costs,

and a rise in disaster probability makes the latter consideration more important. Therefore, an

increase in disaster probability raises the cost of capital, featuring a rise in the spread between

the corporate yield and the risk-free rate. Moreover, as in Gabaix (2010), this spread expands

relative to the objective probability of corporate default—because of the larger risk weight

associated with disaster-related default. The responses to a higher disaster probability include a

reduction in corporate leverage and a greater cutback in investment than in the original model.

To put things in reverse, a fall in perceived disaster probability up to 2006 would have raised

corporate leverage and led, thereby, to greater vulnerability to a financial shock of the sort

experienced in 2007-2009.



10. GAUGING TIME-VARYING DISASTER PROBABILITIES

            The models considered in the previous section rely on time-varying disaster probabilities.

However, it is a serious empirical challenge to measure these probabilities, as assessed

contemporaneously by agents. Even when the disaster probability, p, is constant across countries

and over time and is computed based on rational expectations, the empirical estimation of p is

difficult because disaster events are infrequent and may be absent in small samples, such as the

post-WWII period for the United States and other OECD countries. 15 Therefore, reliable

estimation required our long-term panel of national-accounts variables, which included several

thousand annual data points that generated 125 rare-disaster realizations for C and 183 for GDP

(Figure 2). The estimation problem is compounded if p is allowed to vary across countries or

over time within countries, although our estimation procedure would still work if the allowable
15
     See n.7 on the impact of inclusion of observations on the Great Recession up to 2009.

                                                            22
variations in p were limited (for example, to distinguish OECD from non-OECD or to allow for

occasional breaks over time for the world).

         An alternative approach uses stock-price-index options to infer the disaster probability,

pt, that agents perceive. Suppose, to begin, that agents have power utility and there is a fixed

size distribution of disasters. In this case, put-option prices on a stock-price index of given

maturity depend on pt, the strike price, and the coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ. At any

point in time, the model implies a relationship of option price to strike price (related to “smile”

curves), and the conformity of the data with this prediction could be checked. Variations in pt

shift the option-price/strike-price graph, and such shifts could be used to infer changes in pt.

However, the analysis is more complicated under EZW preferences.

         Bollerslev and Todorov (2011), henceforth BT, use options prices on the S&P 500 from

1996 to 2008 to back out jump (disaster) risk in the underlying stock-price index as priced by

investors. The estimation uses close-to-maturity deep out-of-the-money options, thereby relying

on claims that are worthless without disaster risk. Their procedure generates “risk-neutral

probabilities” 16 for jumps of various sizes (BT, Table 1, column 2). BT then back out equity

premia by comparing these measures with objective jump probabilities derived from futures

contracts on the S&P 500 (BT, Table 1, column 3). 17 A key conclusion (BT, p.22, n. 33) is that

the median of the estimated risk premium due to rare events is 5.6% per year, a large portion of

the average premium of around 7%. Hence, BT’s results support our analysis in which the bulk

of the explained equity premium came from disaster risk. BT’s estimates (Figure 2, upper panel)

17
   Bollerslev and Todorov (2011, Table 1) show that, for objective probabilities, large jumps are rare but reasonably
symmetric for positive and negative outcomes. However, for risk-neutral probabilities, the main action reflects
negative jumps; bonanzas play a minor role, consistent with our neglect of these episodes in our analysis of asset
pricing.

also reveal substantial time variation in the equity risk premium associated with rare events.

These results may be interpretable in terms of time-varying disaster probability.

       Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011), henceforth BCM, also use options prices for

contracts on the S&P 500, in this case from 1987 to 2003. In contrast to the macroeconomic

disasters in Figure 2—which exhibit low probability of occurrence (3.7% per year for C) and

large average size (22%)— BCM (Table 3, column 4) find frequent jumps (1.4 per year) of small

average size (below 1%). These jumps may reflect changing parameters that the BCM model

treats as fixed—notably the perceived disaster probability—rather than realized consumption

disasters. Also, the coefficient of relative risk aversion needed to match BCM’s target equity

premium of 4% is high, roughly 9. A useful research effort would reconcile the findings of

BCM with those of Bollerslev and Todorov (2011).

       Instead of looking at asset prices, such as stock-options prices, Berkman, Jacobsen, and

Lee (2011), henceforth BJL, gauge time-varying disaster probability by considering the number

and severity of international political crises. These political variables directly influence the

likelihood of disasters, particularly wars. BJL show that time variations in their political-crisis

variable measured at the world level relate to financial variables—stock returns, stock-price

volatility, earnings-price ratios, and dividend yields—in ways that would be anticipated for

variations in disaster probability. Hence, their world political variable might be a satisfactory

proxy for time-varying world disaster probability.



11. DISASTER RISK IN OPEN-ECONOMY MODELS

       Another line of research extends the rare-disasters model with time-varying disaster

probability to international macroeconomics and finance. Part of this literature adds disaster risk



                                                  24
to the international real-business-cycle modeling that started with Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland

(1992). One target of this research is the uncovered-interest-parity (UIP) puzzle, which relates to

the carry trade and refers to the disconnect between interest-rate differentials and subsequent

changes in exchange rates across countries. Early applications of this idea include Guo (2011);

Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, and Rebelo (2011); Jurek (2009); and Farhi, Fraiberger,

Gabaix, Ranciere, and Verdelhan (2009). The main ideas are well explained by Farhi and

Gabaix (2011).

       In the Farhi-Gabaix (2011) model, agents in each country value consumption of tradables

and non-tradables in a separable way. Since there is perfect risk sharing in tradables, the pricing

kernel for assets depends only on the quantity of world tradables. The realization of a global

disaster implies a small quantity of world tradables; hence, high marginal utility; hence, a high

value of the pricing kernel.

       There are also country-specific shocks, which affect a country’s productivity in

converting non-traded into traded goods. These shocks occur at times of world disasters, but

countries differ in their sensitivity to the global shock. Comparatively safe countries

(Switzerland, Japan, United States?) are relatively immune to world disasters. In the model, the

degree of safety is described by a country’s “resilience,” which is subject to world and local

shocks but tends to revert over time toward a value that may be country specific. If a disaster

occurs, the real exchange rates of low-resilience countries depreciate sharply compared with

high-resilience countries.




                                                25
         When a country is risky (resilience is low), its real interest rate is high and its real

exchange rate is depreciated. 18 If the world disaster probability, pt, rises, risky countries see an

increase in their real interest rates and a depreciation of their real exchange rates when compared

to safer countries. At any point in time, the high interest rate in a risky country is compensation

for risk—in the form of greater exposure to world disasters and, hence, to sharp currency

depreciation should a disaster materialize. Therefore, the carry-trade strategy of borrowing in

low interest-rate countries and lending in high interest-rate countries does not “beat the market”

once one factors in the frequency of future disasters. The high average return—present even in

samples that include the representative number of disasters—is compensation for disaster risk.

         To address the UIP puzzle, Farhi and Gabaix (2011) assume that low-resilience countries

tend to get more resilient over time and vice versa. This property holds for sure if all countries

tend to revert toward a common resilience. In this case, a high-risk country with a high interest

rate tends to get less risky over time and tends, therefore, to experience appreciation of its real

exchange rate compared to a low-risk country. 19 Therefore, in a sample with no realizations of

world disasters, Fama (1984)-style regressions of future exchange rate appreciation on current

interest-rate differentials for pairs of countries tend to yield coefficients with the “wrong” sign—

counter to the standard UIP theory but consistent with much empirical evidence. In contrast, the

sign of the coefficient is ambiguous in samples that include the representative number of

disasters. If agents are risk neutral, this coefficient equals unity, as in the standard UIP theory.




18
   In the model, a country’s real exchange rate and terms of trade depend not just on current productivity but also on
the path of expected future productivity. Therefore, a fall in resilience leads immediately to a depreciation of the
real exchange rate, even though no disaster has yet occurred.
19
   This analysis can be extended to allow for dynamics from the evolution of the world disaster probability, pt. These
shifts generate negative co-movement across countries between exchange-rate appreciation and changes in interest
rates (compared to the world average). However, this force may not have much influence on Fama-style
regressions.

                                                         26
More realistically, when agents are risk averse and potential disasters are nonzero, the coefficient

is less than unity and may be negative.

         Jurek (2009) looks empirically at disaster-based explanations of the UIP puzzle;

specifically, he examines whether the high average return on carry-trade strategies can be

explained by disaster risk. For equal-weighted portfolios involving carry trades between nine

OECD currencies and the U.S. dollar, the average rate of return from 1999 to 2007 was positive

and statistically significant: 4.7% per year with a t-statistic of 3.2 (Jurek [2009, Table IIb,

Panel B]). When the portfolio is hedged for currency-crash risk by using exchange-rate options

(at the 0.25δ level 20), the average rate of return falls to 3.1% with a t-statistic of 2.5 (Table VII,

Panel A). This result suggests that about one-third of the return to the carry trade from 1999 to

2007 represented a premium for exposure to currency-crash risk. However, when the sample is

extended to 2008—the crisis year in which carry-trade portfolios experienced losses of around

20%—the average return to the carry trade from 1999 to 2008 when hedged for currency-crash

risk was no longer statistically significantly different from zero: 1.7% with a t-statistic of 1.3

(Table IX, Panel A). Thus, in a sample with a disaster realization, the carry trade no longer

delivers returns that significantly exceed the premium for currency-crash risk.



12. THE DYNAMICS OF DISASTERS

         The baseline rare-disasters model involves unrealistic assumptions that go beyond the

assumed constancy of long-run growth rates and disaster probabilities. First, macroeconomic

contractions occur over a single period—a jump at an instant of time when the length of the

period approaches zero—instead of unfolding over multiple years. Second, disasters have

20
  The δ is the sensitivity of a stock-option price to the price of the underlying asset. For calls, δ is positive, near 1 if
the option is very far in the money (strike price far below current asset price), close to 0.5 if the option is at the
money, and close to 0 if the option is very far out of the money.

                                                             27
permanent level effects, but, as stressed by Gourio (2008), real-world disasters are usually

followed by strong recoveries. Third, the model neglects correlation in the timing of disasters

across countries. These shortcomings are addressed in the study by Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro,

and Ursúa (2011), henceforth NSBU. 21

        The NSBU model divides consumption, C, into three components—“potential”

consumption, a “disaster gap,” and a transitory shock. The disaster gap, which tends to dissipate

over time through a first-order Markov process, is the amount by which current C deviates from

potential C because of current or past disasters. Potential consumption evolves during disasters

and determines the level to which consumption tends to return once a disaster ends. Starting

from a “normal” state, entry into a disaster state occurs with a transition probability (equal across

time and countries), where the specification allows for correlation across countries in the starts of

disasters. As long as the disaster state persists, C growth tends to be substantially negative but

with a much larger standard deviation than in normal times. With another probability (equal

across time and countries), the economy moves from the disaster state to normalcy. This

specification generates disasters of varying cumulative sizes and durations, akin to the

histograms shown in Figure 2.

        NSBU’s numerical estimation of the model’s parameters uses all the annual observations

on real per capita personal consumer expenditure, C, for 24 countries with continuous data from

before 1914 to 2006. The estimates imply that the typical disaster reaches its trough after 6

years, with a cumulative drop in C by 30%. However, only about half the decline in C is

permanent; that is, post-crisis recoveries make up about half the level of C lost during a disaster.




21
  These extensions address criticisms of the baseline model offered by Constantinides (2008) and Julliard and Ghosh
(2008).

                                                        28
         The main implications of the estimated model for the equity premium concern the

recoveries. Since, on average, only half the decline in consumption during a disaster is

permanent, the model’s predicted equity premium falls short of the value in Eq. (9). The other

extensions have less influence on the equity premium, although the stochastic duration of

disasters matters because of effects on the correlation between consumption growth and stock

returns during disasters. The use of EZW preferences is important here because C growth

deviates substantially from an i.i.d. process, especially during disasters but also in recoveries.

For example, in the early stages of a disaster, such as a war, stock prices typically have already

fallen a lot, whereas C has fallen only modestly. However, there is a strong belief that future C

will decline much more but by a highly uncertain amount before the eventual end of the disaster

tends to generate a recovery. These expectations bring in effects involving the lack of time

separability in consumption under EZW preferences.

         Overall, the estimated model generates a sizable equity premium from disaster risk but

one that is smaller than in the baseline model, in which disasters are permanent and

instantaneous. To accord with an average unlevered equity premium of 5%, the NSBU model

requires a coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ, of 6.4, compared with the value around 3.5 in

Barro and Ursúa (2008, Tables 10 and 11) and around 3.0 in Barro and Jin (2011, Table 1). 22

         To put the results another way, since a γ of 6 seems implausibly high, the NSBU model

requires the addition of other features that raise the equity premium in order to get the estimated

γ down to a plausible range. One promising extension is to allow for shocks to the mean and

variance of the long-run growth rate; that is, to bring together the long-run risks model of Bansal

and Yaron (2004), considered in part 8, with the dynamics of disasters considered in NSBU.

22
  Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursúa (2011, Table VII) show that the required γ falls to 4.4 if disasters are
permanent; that is, when there are no recoveries. The required γ declines further, to 3.0, if the disaster shocks are
also instantaneous, rather than applying over periods of finite and random length.

                                                           29
Another idea is to incorporate time-varying disaster probabilities, considered in Section 9, into

the NSBU setting.



13. INCORPORATING THE FULL TIME SERIES OF RATES OF RETURN

          The empirical exercises described thus far seek to fit particular properties of asset returns,

such as a high average equity premium, low average risk-free rate, and high volatility of stock

returns. However, additional tests of the model can be carried out with the full time series on

rates of return.

          In the studies described before, Barro and Ursúa (2008) and Barro and Jin (2011)

followed the spirit of Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Rietz (1988) by examining whether the

unlevered equity premium generated from Eq. (8) matched the target of around 5%, given that

stock returns behave in ways hypothesized by the model particularly during disasters.

Specifically, in the term b·[(1-b)-γ-1] in Eq. (8), the first b represents the proportionate fall in

stock prices during a disaster, whereas the second represents the proportionate fall in

consumption, C. However, in the data, stock returns during disasters are not as correlated with C

growth as the model assumes.

          Barro and Ursúa (2009) looked directly at the first-order condition that applies, as in

Eq. (8), when the underlying shocks are i.i.d. The key term is the cross-product,

        𝐶𝑡+1 −𝛾
𝐸𝑡 �(       )     ∙ 𝑅𝑡+1 � , where R is the gross real return on stocks. For a panel of countries with
         𝐶𝑡


data on C and R, the sample average for this term depends particularly on how stock returns

behave during disasters. One finding in Barro and Ursúa (2009) is that the correlation between

stock returns and C growth (measured over a fixed period length, which could be one or more

years) is not nearly high enough during disasters for this approach to accord with the average real


                                                      30
rate of return on stocks observed over the full sample. Another finding is that, when the timing

of stock-market crashes and depressions is interpreted “flexibly,” the co-movement between C

growth and stock returns during disasters is strong enough to be consistent with the observed

average return on stocks. However, to be convincing, this approach requires a disciplined model

in which the timing between low C growth and low stock returns is not coincident during

disasters.

         As noted before, when preferences are of the EZW type and shocks are not i.i.d., the

model does not require stock returns to co-move precisely with C growth during disasters. The
                                                                                 (𝜃−𝛾)
                                                        𝐶                1+𝑉     (1−𝜃)
key term from Eq. (6) is the cross product,        𝐸𝑡 [( 𝐶𝑡+1 )−𝛾   ∙   � 𝑉𝑡+1 �         ∙ 𝑅𝑡+1 ], where V is the ratio
                                                           𝑡                𝑡


of wealth to consumption, corresponding in a simple model to the ratio of stock prices to

dividends. 23 It is an open question whether an analysis extended to allow for this influence from

stock-price changes will perform satisfactorily when implemented with the full panel of data on

C growth, price-dividend ratios, and stock returns. 24 A serious empirical challenge for this

implementation is that data on real stock returns tend systematically to be missing during the

worst disasters, particularly due to closed markets during wartime. 25 Moreover, even when



23
   Note that EZW preferences imply a particular form of time non-separability for consumption. It would be possible
to modify the form of this non-separability by including, for example, the habit-formation idea of Abel (1990) and
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) into a model with EZW preferences.
24
   Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursúa (2011, p. 20) incorporate these effects from stock-price changes during
disasters without using the full time series of stock prices and returns: “When the news arrives that a disaster has
struck, the stock market crashes. This crash … coincides with a sizable drop in consumption. The fact that stocks
pay off poorly at the onset of disasters, when consumption is low and the marginal utility of consumption is high,
implies that stocks must yield a considerable return-premium over bills in normal times. … [However,] the
consumption decline in any given year of a disaster is substantially smaller than the peak-to-trough declines used to
calibrate simpler disaster models … How, then do our estimates generate a sizable disaster premium? The key point
is that the current short-run decline in consumption is paired with news about future declines in consumption and a
large increase in uncertainty about future consumption, … [which] contribute … to the premium households are
willing to pay for assets that insure against disaster events.”
25
   Examples are Belgium 1914-1918 and 1944-1946, France 1940-1941, Greece 1941-1952, Mexico 1915-1918
(revolution and civil war), Netherlands 1944-1946, Portugal 1974-1977 (“Carnation Revolution”), Spain 1936-1940
(Spanish Civil War), and Switzerland 1914-1916. The data in these cases do allow for reasonable measurement of

                                                         31
financial markets remained open, the data on real stock prices and real stock returns were often

substantially mis-measured during wartime because of controls on prices, sometimes extended to

prices of financial assets. 26



14. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

         The rare-disasters perspective provides an important bridge between macroeconomics

and finance and helps to explain an array of asset-pricing puzzles, including the high equity

premium. From the perspective of macroeconomic fluctuations, shocks to the perceived

probability of disaster provide a potentially important supplement to existing closed- and open-

economy real business-cycle models.

         We conclude with a list of promising extensions of research on rare disasters.

         1. Rare disasters of uncertain timing and magnitude can be incorporated into models of

long-run economic growth.

         2. In the environmental-economics literature related to climate change (Nordhaus [2007],

Weitzman [2009]), a key issue is the appropriate discount rate for highly uncertain flows that

arise in the distant future. This uncertainty applies to effects of climate change on the economy,

effects of policies on climate change, and future real GDP. The standard, deterministic

neoclassical growth model used in parts of the existing literature is not helpful for this kind of

analysis. An appropriate treatment requires an explicit modeling of uncertainty, along the lines

of the disaster models that we discussed.

real stock returns over periods long enough to bridge the period of missing data; for example, from 1914 to 1919 for
Mexico.
26
   An extreme example is Germany during WWII, where controls—which held down reported consumer prices
starting in 1936 and propped up reported stock prices starting in 1943—lapsed only in 1948. During the war and
through 1947, the underestimation of true inflation and the propping up of reported stock prices led to a substantial
overstatement of real stock returns. Then the measured real stock return of –0.89 when controls were lifted in 1948
is misleadingly low. However, the data in this and other cases allow for reasonable measurement of real stock
returns over periods long enough to bridge the interval of controls; for example, from 1935 to 1948 in Germany.

                                                         32
       3. The framework developed by Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursúa (2011) can be

extended to incorporate the long-run risk ideas of Bansal and Yaron (2004).

       4. Stock-price index options, available for the United States and possibly other countries,

can be used to gauge shifting disaster probabilities, pt. These results would be important for

asset-pricing research and for assessing time-varying disaster probabilities as an input into

business-cycle models. Exchange-rate options can be used in a similar way to measure changes

in country “resiliences,” which appear in international business-cycle models and in studies of

the uncovered interest-parity condition.

   Note: Starting dates are in first rows for GDP and second rows for C. Symbol * means that series has missing
   years: for GDP, these are Greece (1944), Malaysia (1943-46), Singapore (1940-49), and Philippines (1941-45); for
   C, these are Austria (1919-23), Malaysia (1940-46), and Singapore (1940-47). Italics for starting year means that
   series lacks continuous data since at least 1913. End year in all cases is 2009. Superscript ° indicates inclusion in
   "OECD" sample. Subscripts [r t b p] indicate that country has long-term information on stock returns, bill returns
   (usually 3-month government bills), bond returns (usually 10-year government bonds), and consumer price inflation,
   respectively.

                                            Disaster Sizes and Durations


Note: This sample of disaster events extends Barro and Ursúa (2008, Figures 1 and 2) to include
the four countries with newly constructed data as shown in Table 3. (China is not included for C.
New Zealand is included for C but was not in Barro and Ursúa [2008].) Proportionate declines
in real per capita personal consumer expenditure, C, and GDP are those of 0.095 or greater when
computed from a peak-to-trough approach over multiple years. Duration is the number of years
from peak to trough. Samples have 28 countries for C and 40 for GDP.
