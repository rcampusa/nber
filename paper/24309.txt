                                          ABSTRACT

Natural resources have driven both growth and conflict in modern Africa. We model the
interaction of parties engaged in potential conflict over such resources. The likelihood of conflict
depends on both the absolute and relative resource endowments of the parties. Resources fuel
conflict by raising the gains from expropriation and by increasing ˝fighting strength. Economic
prosperity, as a result, is a function of equilibrium conflict prevalence determined not just by a
region's own resources but also by the resources of its neighbors. Using high-resolution spatial
data on resources, conflicts, and nighttime illumination across the whole of sub-Saharan Africa,
we find evidence confirming each of the model's predictions. Structural estimates of the model
reveal that conflict equilibria are more prevalent where institutional quality (measured by, e.g.,
risk of expropriation, property rights, voice and accountability) is worse.

1     Introduction

No understanding of the development of modern Africa would be complete without an appreciation
of the importance of natural resources. Rents from natural resources can drive economic growth;
yet the countries with the highest resource endowments tend to have the slowest rates of growth
(Gylfason, 2001; Sachs and Warner, 2001). One reason for this is that as the gains from expro-
priating resources rise, conflict becomes more likely (Buonanno et al., 2015; Caselli et al., 2015;
De La Sierra, 2015; Dube and Vargas, 2013; Fearon, 2005). Similarly, resources can empower the
state and its rivals, and can be used to fuel repressive and destructive activities (Acemoglu and
Robinson, 2001; Caselli and Tesei, 2016; Mitra and Ray, 2014; Nunn and Qian, 2014). Where these
motives are salient, and where conflict is destructive enough, resource windfalls may indeed hamper
economic development (Bannon and Collier, 2003).

     Critical in these arguments is the idea of strategic interaction between rival factions in the
face of economic incentives. Conflict and growth are outcomes of a game in which both a party’s
own resources as well as the resources of rivals determine equilibrium choices (Esteban et al., 2012;
Esteban and Ray, 2011a,b; Grossman, 1991; Mitra and Ray, 2014). How does the joint distribution
of resources across potential rivals work to foment or prevent conflict, and what economic outcomes
ensue in equilibrium? These questions are the focus of our paper.

     As evidence on the importance of resources across potential rivals in the African context,
consider the following correlations in the spatial distributions of conflict prevalence, economic de-
velopment, and resources. In Figure 1, we plot the log density of nighttime illumination (a proxy
for prosperity) against a resource index for 0.5◦ by 0.5◦ grid cells across the entirety of sub-Saharan
Africa, grouped into percentile bins.1 Importantly, to capture the idea that resource endowments
of potential rivals matter, we split all neighboring grid-cells within a 500km radius into being either
above or below the median value of this resource index.

     We see in Figure 1 a remarkable difference in the relationship between natural resources and
prosperity by neighbors’ resources. With resource-rich neighbors, there is a clear inverse U-shaped
relationship between natural resources and the density of nighttime illumination – after a certain
point, when neighbors are rich, one’s own resources become bad for economic development.2 In
contrast, with resource-poor neighbors, there is an increasing and fairly linear relationship between
natural resources and nighttime illumination. That is, when neighbors are relatively poor, resources
continue to be good for development at all levels.

     Figure 2 helps to explain part of these divergent relationships. Here, we graph conflict incidence
   1
     The resource index is comprised of the first principal component of (i) annual rainfall averaged over a ten year
period (1998-2008), (ii) oil or gas reserves, (iii) lootable diamonds, (iv) gold, (v) zinc, and (vi) cobalt in the 0.5 x 0.5
degree grid cell.
   2
     This is similar to, for example, Figure 1 in Sachs and Warner (2001).



                                                             2
against the resource index for sub-Saharan African countries in the same time period, again splitting
the sample by neighbors’ resources. The resulting relationship is substantially more positive for
resource-rich neighbors – that is, natural resources fuel conflict to a greater extent when potential
rivals also have greater resources. If the impacts of conflict on development are destructive enough,
then the increased likelihood of conflict could dominate the positive effects of natural resources to
produce the inverse U-shaped relationship we see in Figure 1.




   Figure 1: Log Light Density vs. Resources                       Figure 2: Prob(Conflict) vs. Resources
     Observations for 0.5◦ by 0.5◦ grid cells across Sub Saharan Africa, as binned averages. Graphs plot
     quadratic fits with confidence intervals of the relationship between a resource index against (1) Log
     (Light Density) in 2008 and (2) Whether the region was engaged in conflict between 1998 and 2008. The
     Resource Index consists of the first principal component of (i) annual rainfall averaged over a ten year
     period (1998-2008), (ii) oil or gas reserves, (iii) lootable diamonds, (iv) gold, (v) zinc, and (vi) cobalt in
     the 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid cell. Confidence intervals are estimated over the underlying data rather than
     binned averages. The slopes for each sub-group are statistically different in each graph. Neighbors are
     defined as grid cells in a 500km radius.



    In this paper, we formalize these linkages and shed light on the underlying mechanisms through
the lens of strategic interaction. We present a simple game-theoretic model in which two groups
decide whether or not to engage in conflict. Rather than incorporating mechanisms separately as
much of the literature does, we simultaneously integrate several mechanisms into a single model
that can be tested empirically. We model both supply-side channels that determine the ease of
engaging in conflict, and demand-side channels that capture the benefits of acquiring territory.

    In our model, offensive and defensive capabilities for each group increase with resource endow-
ments. This endowment effect of resources on conflict is a feature of early models of conflict (e.g.,
Grossman and Kim (1995); Hirshleifer (1989)) though it has received limited attention in more
recent empirical work, with the exception of a handful of important recent studies (Caselli et al.,
2015; Dube and Vargas, 2013; Mitra and Ray, 2014). In addition to this endowment effect, we
explicitly model a “rapacity effect,” by stipulating that each group’s return to fighting is increasing


                                                           3
in the neighboring group’s resources.3 In our baseline model, there is a fixed cost of participating in
conflict.4 Conflict arises as an outcome if either group chooses to fight. If both fight, the probability
of success is determined by the relative strength of each group, which itself depends on resource
endowments.

       Nash equilibria in this model are determined by the resource endowments of each group (along
with other fundamentals such as the cost of fighting and the fraction expropriated when winning).
When both groups have low levels of resources, peace results. This is because neither group has
much strength, and the gains from fighting are also not high for either group, since contestable
resources are few. When one group has more resources (loosely speaking) than the other, a one-
sided conflict equilibrium results – what one might call an “uncontested attack.” When both groups
have abundant resources, both are impelled to conflict. In line with the mechanisms outlined in
Acemoglu and Johnson (2005); Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2005), we model the quality of institutions
as shifting the cutoffs for conflict onset, by either changing the costs of war or the fraction of
appropriable resources, or both.

       We test the model’s predictions using disaggregated spatial data on resource endowments,
conflict, and satellite data on nighttime lights. Rather than focusing on countries, we partition
sub-Saharan Africa into a 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid. At each point, we match the likelihood of conflict
events and the intensity of nighttime lights to a “natural resource” indicator (which equals 1 if any
natural resource from the following is present: oil and natural gas reserves, deposits of “lootable”
diamonds, gold, zinc, and cobalt) at that point. We also use historical rainfall patterns as an
alternative agricultural measure of long-term wealth accumulation and resource abundance. We
then match these points i to every neighbor j within a given radius. We use two sources of data on
conflict, from (a) the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), which allows us to measure the spatial
intensity of conflicts, and (b) the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which
allows us to focus specifically on territorial conflicts. Using these data, we ascertain whether two
regions were involved in joint conflict over the past 10 years.

       The model’s main predictions amount to a partitioning of the ij “resource space” into Nash
equilibria regions defined by resource thresholds. Both a region’s own resources and also the
resources in surrounding areas jointly determine the likelihood of conflict. In the empirical analysis,
we begin by drawing a heat map of the raw data on the involvement of shared conflict for points i
and j over the resource index for these points. In this simple plot, we find striking confirmation of
the model’s implications regarding equilibria regions over the ij resource space. Groups represented
by our disaggregated points i and j behave in a manner markedly consistent with the predictions
of our simple model.
   3
     We extend the model by incorporating a sharing rule, and show within this augmented framework that societies
who share more are less likely to choose conflict.
   4
     We explore other functional forms in an extension of the model that incorporates the idea that the opportunity
cost of engaging in conflict depends on the resource endowment, as in, e.g., Brückner and Ciccone (2010); Hsiang
et al. (2013); Jia (2014); Miguel and Satyanath (2011); Miguel et al. (2004).


                                                        4
    In a regression framework, we test these implications by estimating the relationships between i-
and j-specific natural resource endowments with whether or not regions i and j were involved in the
same conflict. In keeping with recent work that finds time-invariant characteristics are often better
at predicting conflict than shocks (Bazzi et al., 2017), we focus on the longer-run “endowment” of
resources in the cross-section. To address concerns regarding identification that arise from the use of
the cross-sectional dimension of the data rather than time-varying shocks, we show that our results
are robust to controlling for local geographic, agricultural, and climatological characteristics, as well
as spatial fixed effects of varying size. Standard errors are clustered using conservatively-defined
geographic levels to account for potential spatial correlation in the error term. When testing the
model using rainfall data, we find a (two-dimensional) structural break in the relationship between
region i and j’s historical rainfall patterns on the one hand and conflict on the other.5

    The results of this analysis are in line with the heat map evidence and in strong support
of the model’s predictions. Own and neighbor resource endowments are both statistically and
economically significant determinants of the spatial distribution of conflict in sub-Saharan Africa.
These patterns are consistent when analyzing many different resources and both sources of conflict
data, further alleviating concerns of omitted confounders driving the results. We complement this
evidence with procedures relying on optimal bandwidth regression discontinuity (RD) methods
(Calonico et al., 2014) to measure the rise in the likelihood of conflict when crossing the resource
threshold from a peace to a conflict equilibrium region.

    We also investigate contexts in which resources do not lead to conflict. In keeping with the
importance of institutions as mediators of conflict and development (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2005;
Acemoglu et al., 2001, 2005; Barro, 1996; Caselli and Tesei, 2016; Mehlum et al., 2006), we show
that for ij pairs where baseline institutional quality (measured in alternative specifications by
property rights, risk of expropriation, political stability, and voice and accountability) is lower the
estimated resource value at which conflict ensues is lower (i.e., conflict is more likely to break out
for smaller resource endowments) and the explanatory power of our model is substantially higher.
These results suggest that good institutions at baseline potentially raise the costs of conflict and/or
lower the gains from expropriation, and weaken the link between resources and conflict overall. In
particular, the roles played by rapacity and relative strength in conflict may become less important
in the presence of stronger baseline property rights and lower risks of expropriation.

    Finally, we estimate analogous regression equations for satellite data on nighttime lights (Hen-
derson et al., 2012; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2013; Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin, 2015)
to highlight how the resource-conflict dependence results in a non-monotonic reduced form re-
lationship, seen in Figure 1, between resource abundance and development (Sala-i Martin and
Subramanian, 2013). Additional evidence using regression discontinuity methods and two-stage
   5
     Our empirical approach is an extension of structural break methods used by Card et al. (2008) and Gonzalo
and Wolf (2005), in which we use two-thirds of the sample to find the optimal cutoff and the remaining one-third to
perform regression analysis using the estimated cutoff value.



                                                        5
least squares analyses supports this story, showing that as we move across regions on either side
of the optimally determined threshold the rise in conflict correspondingly leads to a sharp drop in
light density.

        Our main contribution is to the literature on natural resources and conflict. The closest papers
to ours in this large literature are Besley and Persson (2010); Caselli et al. (2015); Harari and
La Ferrara (2013), and Berman et al. (2017). We build on these studies in several ways. First,
we highlight the importance of strategic interaction in determining conflict prevalence and levels of
development across space, simultaneously incorporating several mechanisms from this literature into
a single theoretical model with clear testable predictions. Second, like Harari and La Ferrara (2013)
and Berman et al. (2017), our analysis is on a granular (grid point) level and spans the entirety
of sub-Saharan Africa. What is different is that we analyze point pairs in potential joint conflict,
drawing focus on strategic interaction effects in the determination of equilibrium conflict. We also
show consistent results for a broad set of natural resources, allowing for greater generalizability.
Third, of the studies mentioned, only Besley and Persson (2010) explicitly model and examine
equilibrium impacts on economic development; we are able to study this outcome at a highly
granular level using satellite data on nighttime illumination.

        We also contribute to the literature on the determinants of growth (Barro, 1991; Jones, 2016).
While both natural resources and conflict have long been regarded as playing key roles in the eco-
nomic growth of developing nations (Rodrik, 1999; Sachs and Warner, 2001), few papers have dis-
ciplined the interrelationships between resources, conflict, and growth through a model of strategic
interaction, and tested its predictions across a large set of countries incorporating data on resource
endowments of many types. We are also able to directly incorporate the role of property-related
institutions in the model to study the potential for institutional quality to modulate the aforemen-
tioned relationships (Mehlum et al., 2006).

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets up our model and delivers its
main predictions through a set of lemmas and propositions. Section 3 describes our data. Section
4 details our empirical strategy, and section 5 presents and interprets our results. Finally, section
6 is a concluding discussion.



2       Model

We model the interaction of two parties, i and j, who play a symmetric, simultaneous game that
determines peace or conflict between them. Our static model generates testable empirical predic-
tions, and extensions to the basic model, including heterogeniety in institutional structures, provide
additional refinements to our predictions.6 Importantly, we integrate various mechanisms by which
    6
    We do not show any dynamics. A repeated game generates more equilibria including the Nash equilibria from
the static model we highlight here. We stick to the static version given the ambiguity in equilibria in the dynamic


                                                        6
resources may affect conflict into one model. We add additional mechanisms to the baseline setup
and show that our primary predictions stay the same.

      The parties choose strategies s from the set {F, N }, where F denotes the decision to fight (i.e.,
engage in conflict), and N denotes the decision not to fight. We denote a strategy profile by (si , sj )
for si , sj ∈ {F, N }.

      Each party is endowed with resource wealth, denoted ri , rj ∈ (0, ∞) for resources in i and j,
respectively. If neither party fights (N, N ), each keeps its own wealth. If a party fights, it expends
fixed cost c in conflict, which we assume for simplicity is the same for i and j. If a party wins, it
seizes a fraction δ of the opposing party’s wealth. Both c and δ vary with institutional quality, like
the risk of expropriation and property rights.

      If one party fights and the other chooses not to fight ((F, N ) or (N, F )), the fighting party
succeeds with probability 1. If, on the other hand, both parties choose to fight (F, F ), then with
                      ri
probability p ≡    ri +rj   party i wins.7 If i wins in this scenario, it seizes a proportion δ of j’s remaining
assets, (i.e. δ(rj − c)).

      The game is summarized in Figure 3. Note that in (F, F ), we evaluate the expected payoff to
each party given probability of success p defined above.

                              p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) + (1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c), ri − c + δrj ,

                              (1 − p)(rj − c + δ(ri − c)) + p(1 − δ)(rj − c)    (1 − δ)rj

Notes: p is the probability of victory for party i, rk are the level of resources for parties k = {i, j}, c is the cost of
engaging in conflict, and δ is the fraction of resources that the victorious party expropriates.



2.1     Best Responses

The best responses of each party to the other’s actions depend on the model parameters, and in
particular the realizations of wealth ri and rj . The following lemma determines the best response
functions (denoted BRk (s−k ) for k ∈ {i, j}) for i and j with wealth (ri , rj ) ∈ R2+ .


Proposition 2.1 The following are best response functions for agent k:
model, the strong adherence of the data with the simple static model, and our empirical set-up of cross-sectional
relationships.
   7
     We choose this functional form for p for its parsimony and because intuitively p should be increasing in ri and
decreasing in rj . Recent work on conflict uses similar functions or simple transformations of this function (Andersen
et al., 2018).

These best response functions help characterize the set of pure strategy Nash Equilibria in the
(ri , rj ) space. Figure 4 divides the (ri , rj ) space into the Nash Equilibrium regions. The space can
then be described by the following lemmas which are proved in Appendix A.1.:


  1. For ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ), (N, N ) is the unique pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium.

                                        δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )}

      Intuitively, these lemmas organize the (ri , rj ) plane into several regions summarized in Figure 4.
In the convex hull comprised of large realizations of wealth for both parties, each party’s dominant
strategy is F . This is brought on by two motives. First, when i and j both have high levels of
resource wealth, but i has relatively more, it is prone to fight because the probability of success in
capturing some of j’s wealth is relatively high. On the other hand, when j has relatively more, i
prefers fighting because if it does win, it captures some of j’s considerable wealth. The intuition
behind the proposition that i wishes to fight j when j has higher wealth comes from the ‘rapacity

effect’, where i wishes to capture a fraction of j’s larger resource pie. The intuition behind the
finding that i wishes to fight when i has higher wealth comes from the ‘relative strength’ mechanism
where i has more resources to build a stronger army and therefore a higher probability of victory
against j.

      Notice that the cutoffs depend on fundamentals like c and δ. Better institutions may raise the
cost of war c or lower the amount that can be appropriated δ, raising the cutoffs and enlarging the
(N, N ) region of the figure. We explicitly test for how institutional quality affects the structural
parameters of the model, with the prediction that stronger institutions raise the cutoff.


2.3     A Sharing Rule

The possibility that conflict can be mitigated by the sharing of resources can be captured by a
sharing rule, whereby each party shares a proportion φ of their wealth with the other party if and
only if neither party chooses to fight. This changes the payoffs in the (N, N ) portion of the game to
be (1 − φ)ri + φrj and (1 − φ)rj + φri . That is, in the absence of anybody fighting, party i receives
(1 − φ) of it’s own resources, and a φ portion of party j’s resources. The modified game is presented

in Appendix Figure A1. This sharing rule expands the region of the (N, N ) Nash Equilibrium as
can be seen in Figure 5.8

The figure plots the Nash equilibrium regions for any given draw of resources for parties i and j, in the presence
of a sharing rule. c is the cost of engaging in conflict, and δ is the fraction of resources that the victorious party
expropriates. φ is the fraction of resources shared.


       The best response functions, game matrices, proofs of propositions, and a description of the
Nash Equilibrium regions under the sharing rule can be found in Appendix A.2. Intuitively, the
easier it is to trade and share the fruits of higher resources with your neighbors, the lower is the
likelihood of conflict. importantly, the model’s predictions of the likelihood of conflict in different
regions remain similar to the baseline setup.9


2.4      The Opportunity Cost of Fighting

In many instances we may expect engaging in conflict to have a cost that varies with the amount of
resources that can be lost to violence. For instance, the opportunity cost of war in terms of foregone
earnings in the labor market will be higher for richer economies. Since the strength of the labor

    The figure restricts φ to values of δ > φ > 1+δ for clarity.
   9
    In addition, this setup also captures spillovers in resources across regions, showing that such spillovers are
consistent with our qualitative predictions.


                                                         10
market depends on the strength of the overall economy, we may expect that this opportunity cost
is larger in places that have more resources. In order to incorporate this aspect into our baseline
model, we disaggregate the cost of war into two different types of costs – c1 is a fixed proportion
of the resources, whereas c2 is the same fixed cost we had in the baseline model. The variable
cost c1 × rk captures additional channels like the opportunity cost of war. The payoff matrix that
includes this term is shown in Appendix Figure A2. These variable costs expand the (N, N ) Nash
Equilibrium regions, as shown in Figure 6.

The figure plots the Nash equilibrium regions for any given draw of resources for parties i and j. c1 is the variable
cost of engaging in conflict, c2 is the fixed cost of engaging in conflict, and δ is the fraction of resources that the
victorious party expropriates.


     The best response functions, game matrices, proofs of propositions, and a description of the
Nash Equilibrium regions under the opportunity cost extension can be found in Appendix A.3. The
{N, N } region is now larger, since even as resources increase, the opportunity cost motive dampens
the likelihood of conflict.

     In general, across the various model specifications it is clear that the rapacity effect and the
relative-strength mechanism divide the resource space into a few areas with different probabilities
of conflict. The sharing rule and opportunity cost extension change the shape of these areas, but
maintain the overall predicted patterns that we test empirically.


                                                            11
     We empirically explore the patterns highlighted in this model section. Regions i and j that
both have a high number of resources will engage in conflict with a higher likelihood than if one cell
has resources and another doesn’t. But the lowest likelihood of conflict arises when both cells have
few resources. For continuous measures of resources, like agricultural wealth (proxied by rainfall),
it will be important to also estimate the cutoffs that divide the space into the different Nash regions
using structural break methods. The advantage of the model is that we can estimate the parameters
c and δ that determine where these regions lie. Finally, better institutions will enlarge the {N, N }
by either raising c or reducing δ. How these structural parameters and the quality of model-fit
change with the quality of institutions illustrates the mitigating effects of good institutions.



3     Data

To test the implications of the model, we combine spatial data on rainfall, oil and gas reserves,
diamond deposits, gold mines, zinc deposits, cobalt mines, conflicts, and nighttime lights. We begin
with a data set at the 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grid level covering the whole of
Sub Saharan Africa.10 Each observation is a grid-cell pair: whether or not those two cells were
involved in a conflict, and the resources and the other characteristics of each of the cells. The same
cell will show up once as cell i, and may appear multiple times as cell j.11 We construct the pairs
between any two grid-cells within a specific distance radius. In our main specifications we use a
500km radius, but we do robustness checks to show that our results are not sensitive to any specific
radius, and, as we show, are even more powerful at smaller distances, such as at a 150km radius.

     The resolution of these cells is chosen to match the data on rainfall that are available in the
well-known series from Matsuura and Willmott (2009). This is the lowest-resolution spatial data
that we use in our baseline analysis. Hosted by the University of Delaware, these provide monthly
temperature and rainfall for each 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grid between 1900 and
2010.12 These data are commonly used as measures of localized economic development (e.g. Dell
et al. (2012)). We collapse all our inter-temporal data into a single cross-section, allowing us to
study the spatial patterns of conflict and development, rather than “shocks” to resources as much
of the literature does. We use mean annual rainfall experienced in each grid cell over the period
   10
      In keeping with the literature, we exclude the northern African countries of Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Libya and
Tunisia. We perform a robustness check on all our tables by also including these countries and each of our results
hold for the entire African continent.
   11
      While our model considered ‘parties’, in the empirical analysis we use ‘region-cells.’ It is possible to do a similar
analysis at the ethnic-group or political-boundary level, as some of the literature has done. However, as we are not
studying ethnic-war or geopolitical battles, but rather a model of territorial control of resources, the grid-level data
allows us to focus on this issue at the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, one may be concerned that ethnic-group
and political boundaries are endogenously determined.
   12
      See http://climate.geog.udel.edu/˜climate/. The data comes from weather stations and interpolates between
areas. The interpolation may introduce some measurement error that may attenuate results. Alternatively, we
explore satellite-sources of precipitation from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project and the ERA-40 project,
but satellite data is too coarse for our purposes as the data is either 2.5×2.5 degrees or 1.25×1.25 degrees.

1998 to 2008. The final year of our sample is constrained by the availability of the geographic
coordinates of one of our conflict datasets, whereas the first year of our data is chosen so as study
conflict over a ten year period.     13


       We then combine this rainfall data with data on oil and gas reserves and lootable diamonds,
available from the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO). The diamonds dataset, first
created by Gilmore et al. (2005), lists all known diamond deposits in the world, coded with precise
geographic coordinates. The oil and gas reserves dataset, developed by Lujala et al. (2007), depicts
polygons for each deposit. As the data on diamonds and mines is in point format, we take the
centroid of the polygon and merge this data with data on mines from the United States Geological
Survey (USGS).14 The USGS has geolocations for mines across the world, and we pick the minerals
that are most prevalent in Africa for our analysis.15 We merge this resources data, now at the
point-level, with data on conflict at the center of the 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree latitude/longitude
grid. We restrict ourselves to resources already discussed by the conflict literature: rainfall (Harari
and La Ferrara, 2013), oil (Caselli et al., 2015), diamonds (Balestri and Maggioni, 2014) and other
mines (Berman et al., 2017).

       We use two main sources of conflict data and show our results for both. The first is the Uppsala
Conflict Data Program (UCDP) / International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) Armed
Conflict Dataset, Version 4 - 2011. This is a widely used data set (e.g. Miguel and Satyanath
(2011)) that lists conflicts and the years during which they occur. Initially coded by Gleditsch
et al. (2002), these data report conflicts occurring between 1946 and 2010. To assign geographic
coordinates to these conflicts, we add additional data, taken from Raleigh et al. (2006). For conflicts
in the base PRIO data up to 2008, these report a latitude/longitude coordinate as well as a radius
in kilometers. The circle defined by these numbers is taken as the area affected by the conflict,
and we consider any 0.5×0.5 grid cell point lying within this circle, in the year of conflict, as being
a part of the same conflict. Additional information on these data are provided by Raleigh et al.
(2006) and Hallberg (2012). In particular, the latitude and longitude coordinate for a conflict is
defined as the mid-point of all known locations of battles. The radius is constructed in multiples of
50 km and encompasses all of these battle locations, except for sporadic violence far from the the
remaining events.16

       Our second source of conflict data is The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project
(ACLED) database records conflicts at each latitude and longitude, the parties involved on each
opposing side, and the type of conflict. We study territorial conflicts and exclude observations that
  13
     We do robustness exercises extending this window to be 20 or 30 years long.
  14
     See https://data.usgs.gov/
  15
     We pick the minerals that are most prevalent in terms of number of mines across sub-Saharan Africa, with a
minimum of at least thirty occurrences. Our results are robust to relaxing this cutoff and including the next set of
prevalent minerals (phosphate and barite which occur in few mines).
  16
     UCDP also publishes a companion dataset that covers the same time period– the GED polygon dataset, that
uses polygons instead of radii and includes other events like one-sided violence among non-state actors.



                                                        13
correspond with riots, protests or non-violent events. Since ACLED has information on parties
involved which allows us to determine whether the same parties were on opposing sides of a conflict
in two different regions. Specifically, if two parties are on opposing sides of a conflict in two
neighboring regions we code them as a conflict pair. This measure ensures that we are not looking
at parties that are on the same side of the conflict. While restricting our analysis to territorial
conflicts lowers the number of conflicts we study by almost half, the advantage is that we are then
focusing on the types of interactions most closely related to the model setup.

    Despite the possibility of measurement error in either conflict dataset, we are unable to think
of any reasons why the effect of the spatial distribution of resources may be biased by measurement
in our left-hand side variable. Since we construct grid-cell conflict pairs, each conflict will have
more than one observation, one for each party involved. A grid-cell pair will have conf lictij = 1
if they are both in conflict with each other during that 10 year period, and conf lictij = 0 if there
was no conflict between cells i and j.

    We also consider the development implications of resources and conflict. We follow past re-
searchers such as Henderson et al. (2012), Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) and Pinkovskiy
and Sala-i Martin (2016) in using night-time lights as a proxy for economic activity. Luminosity
data are taken from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System.
Major advantages of these data include their arbitrary divisibility, their consistency across multiple
political jurisdictions, their high spatial resolution, and their availability given the weaknesses of
official data on African economic activity (Jerven, 2013; Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin, 2015). Hen-
derson et al. (2012) provide additional information on these data. These data are constructed as
an annual average of satellite images of the earth taken daily between 20:30 and 22:00 local time.
The raw data are at a 30 second resolution, which implies that each pixel in the raw data is roughly
one square kilometer. We average over pixels within a 0.5×0.5 grid cell point. The raw luminosity
data for each pixel is reported as a six-bit integer ranging from 0 to 63. We average these pixels
within grid-cell; doing this ensures that almost no grid-cell has the maximum value.17

    In most specifications we only consider the variation within agro-ecological zones (AEZs). These
AEZs are determined by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and depend on long-term
climatic conditions, soil resources, terrain, land cover and other measures of crop suitability. For
instance, the elevation component is divided into lowland, mid-elevation and high, the humidity
component is divided into dry, semi-arid, sub-humid, humid and moist, and the soil component is
divided into desert, savanna and forest. A combination of these features ensures that each AEZ is
specific in its characteristics. As noted elsewhere, our results are robust to including grid-cell level
fixed effects.18
   17
      As only about one-fourth of the sample has non-zero values of light-density, we show our results using various
transformations used in the literature (like inverse hyperbolic sine functions, or re-normalizing the zeros to number
less than the minimum non-zero value).
   18
      And subsequently country-level fixed effects which are subsumed by the grid fixed effects.

4        Estimation Strategy

The theoretical model allows us to divide the conflict-resources space into four distinct Nash Equi-
librium regions. When there are low resources for both parties, there is a lower probability of
conflict as neither party has resources to build an army and there is little wealth to expropriate
from one’s neighbor. On the other hand, having a large amount of resources for either party leads
to more conflict, and this is especially true when both parties have high levels of resources.

         In order to capture this pattern produced by the Nash regions in Figure 4, we use the following
regression specification at the i − j grid-cell pair level:19


                       conf lictij = γ0 + γ1 ri + γ2 rj + γ3 (ri × rj ) + γx X + νa + ij ,                       (3)


where conf lictij = 1 if the grid-cell i was ever engaged in the same conflict as grid cell j between
1998 and 2008. Our first resource measure, the presence of oil or gas, diamonds, gold, zinc or cobalt,
is a discrete measure. Therefore, we can define rk = 1 for k = {i, j} if the region k contains any
of these resources. The γ0 captures the probability of conflict in the (N o, N o) region in the south-
west section of Figure 4 where neither party fights. Similarly, γ0 + γ1 captures the north-western
quadrant of the graph, which is represented by a (F ight, N o) region and a MSNE region. γ0 + γ2
corresponds to the (N o, F ight) and the MSNE region in the south-east section of the graph, and
γ0 + γ1 + γ2 + γ3 captures the (F ight, F ight) quadrant in the north-eastern portion of the figure.
Given the model’s predictions, we should therefore expect γ1 ≥ 0, γ2 ≥ 0 and sum of coefficients,
γ1 + γ2 + γ3 > 0. There is no prediction on γ3 alone as it may either be positive or negative. As
our empirical setup tests for how a neighboring region’s resources affects the likelihood of conflict,
we are explicitly testing for spillovers, but in a manner driven by our model’s predictions.

         When using a continuous variable such as rainfall, our model predicts that conflict will be
higher above certain rainfall cutoffs rc :


                conf lictij = β0 + β1 1ri >rc + β2 1rj >rc + β3 1ri >rc × 1rj >rc + βx X + νa + ij               (4)


         In this formulation, rc represents the cutoffs in Figure 4 separating the Nash regions. As a
region’s own resources ri cross the cutoff rc , we enter a different Nash region. Like before, β0
captures the (N o, N o) region in the south-west section of Figure 4, β0 + β1 captures the north-
western quadrant of the graph, and β0 + β2 corresponds to the south-eastern quadrant. Finally,
    19
    Notice that this setup differs meaningfully from what other studies have done in the past, as our empirical
framework follows from our model. For instance, Caselli et al. (2015) look at how far a given oil field is from a
national border to evaluate whether parties fight over that oil field, whereas we study whether or not each party have
any resources within their own territory.



                                                         15
β0 +β1 +β2 +β3 captures the (F ight, F ight) quadrant in the north-east portion of the figure. Given
the model’s predictions, we should expect β1 ≥ 0, β2 ≥ 0 and sum of coefficients, β1 + β2 + β3 > 0.

       Notice, given our model’s results, there is no prediction on the sign of β3 alone. Indeed, it
is entirely plausible that β3 < 0 even though the north-east quadrant displays a high probability
of conflict β1 + β2 + β3 > 0, and perhaps even higher than the south-eastern or north-western
quadrants β1 + β2 + β3 > β2 and β1 + β2 + β3 > β1 .

       While the amount and geographic location of resources is exogenous, in the sense that it is
taken as given by the actors involved, it is important to control for other factors, X, that otherwise
influence the likelihood of conflict in Africa and that may be correlated with resource endowments.
Our analysis exploits the cross-section rather than the panel dimension as we focus on long-run
growth.20 We, therefore, need to establish that our relationships are robust to including an exten-
sive set of fixed effects and controls. These controls include (for both points i and j) latitude and
longitude, measures of land quality, malaria prevalence, humidity, population density, ruggedness
and a quadratic in the distance between the two points. Furthermore, we also restrict attention
to the variation within continuous regions by including fixed effects, νa , for Agro-Ecological Zones
(AEZ) and, alternately, latitude-longitude grids of various sizes. Importantly, our results are ro-
bust to omitting controls or fixed effects suggesting that our estimated resource cutoffs are not
systematically correlated with other observable variables.


4.1      Cutoffs

In order to estimate Equation 4 for a continuous variable like rainfall, it is necessary to identify the
cutoff rc . One simple approach would be to use the median level of resources. While all our results
are consistent with using the median as a cutoff, there is no reason to believe that the median is
the correct threshold. The literature on structural breaks has made progress in identifying such
unknown cutoffs often in macroeconomics (Bai, 1997a,b, 2010; Bai and Perron, 1998; Gonzalo and
Pitarakis, 2002; Gonzalo and Wolf, 2005; Hansen, 2000). These papers propose that the cutoff can
be estimated by using a search algorithm that identifies the threshold that minimizes the residual
sum of squares of the model, or alternatively maximizes the partial R-squared for the the variable
of interest. Under a correctly specified model, this process leads to a consistent estimate of the
cutoff and the parameters of interest.

       While most of this literature focuses on structural breaks in time-series data, there are applica-
tions using cross-sectional micro-data (Card et al., 2008). In these cases, likelihood ratio (LR) tests
under the null of no structural breaks do not allow for conventional hypothesis testing, and instead
alternative methods that do not suffer from the drawbacks of such LR tests are used (Gonzalo and
  20
    Recent work shows that cross-sectional variation is a better predictor of conflict than time-varying shocks (Bazzi
et al., 2017).

The figure plots the partial R-square of the regression model in Equation 4 for each rainfall cutoff. Rainfall measure
is annual rainfall, in mm, averaged over 1998 to 2008. The optimal cutoff is at 77.68mm of rainfall.


Wolf, 2005). An advantage of having a large sample is that we can use a split-sample approach –
while one portion of the sample is used to identify the cutoff, the rest is utilized in running the
regression of interest taking the cutoff as given (Angrist et al., 1999; Angrist and Krueger, 1995).
Due to the independence of the sub-samples, the cutoff has a standard distribution under the null.
One application of this can be found in Card et al. (2008), who use two-thirds of the sample to
identify a threshold and the remaining one-third to identify the coefficients of interest. Similarly,
Gonzalo and Wolf (2005) use the intuition behind Politis and Romano (1994) to propose using many
randomly selected sub-samples to describe the distribution of cutoffs and coefficients of interest.

       In keeping with the literature, therefore, the following empirical strategy is used. Two-thirds of
the data are randomly selected, upon which the search algorithm is performed to identify the cutoff
that minimizes the residual sum of squares. This can be seen in Figure 7, which identifies the value
of the resources cutoff for which the partial R-squared is maximized in Equation 4. The remaining
one-third is then used to identify the coefficients in the equation. This process is repeated with
various randomly selected sub-samples to describe the distribution of the cutoffs and the parameters
estimated. In our case, however, the process of repeatedly picking different sub-samples did not
affect the estimates, largely because there was little to no change in the optimal cutoff across
iterations.21
  21
    Since our estimated resource cutoff parameter has little to no variation, we do not report a standard error on the
cutoff value.




                                                         17
       While identifying the cutoff is necessary for estimating β1 , β2 and β3 , it is also an informative
parameter in itself since it represents the threshold amount of resources that pushes parties into
conflict. As theory suggests, this threshold may be lower for regions that either have a lower cost
of conflict or higher potential returns to conflict. Facilitation of trade or any other sharing-rules
may, alternatively, raise the threshold necessary for the outbreak of conflict. Indeed, we test for
one dimension of heterogeneity in the optimal cutoff and model fit below. We investigate whether
the optimal cutoff is lower, and corresponding model fit improved, where institutions are weaker.

       We then estimate a similar regression model to study how light density changes at these resource
cutoffs. After identifying the cutoffs based on structural breaks in the likelihood of conflict, we
regress log light density on these cutoffs.22 Since rainfall directly affects light density, we also
control for continuous measures of own rainfall, neighbor’s rainfall and the interaction between the
two.


4.2      Standard Errors

One additional issue is that of the estimation of standard errors. A standard result in the structural
break literature is that the sampling error in the break can be ignored when estimating the size of
the break (Bai, 1997b; Card et al., 2008). Given the iterative nature of the split-sample approach,
it is possible to obtain a distribution of the coefficients of interest. However, in our context, this
produces extremely tight standard errors due to a very precisely estimated cutoff value, and a more
conservative approach may be warranted. Given the possibility of spatial correlation in the errors,
the approach we use is to cluster the standard errors at various geographic levels. The data consists
of points of a size spanned by 0.5×0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude, matched to each of its
“neighbors,” i.e. all points within a 500km radius. Standard errors can therefore be clustered at
the point level, or two-way clustered errors can be calculated for the point and each of its neighbors
(Cameron et al., 2011). Estimates that allow for a greater degree of spatial correlation can be
obtained by calculating errors at latitude-longitude grids of larger sizes, ranging from a 1×1 degree
grid, to a more conservative 2×2 degree grid which consists of sixteen adjacent points and spans
approximately 50 thousand square kilometers at the equator. Our results are robust to clustering
at larger grid-sizes and at the country-level as well.


4.3      Discontinuities

The cutoffs not only allow for the estimation of Equation 4, but also the estimation of the size of
the discontinuity at each boundary. In doing so, we can rely on the Regression Discontinuity (RD)
literature to identify how the probability of conflict changes at each threshold. We do this using
  22
    We also do a robustness check where we transform the light density variable to be log(light density+0.001) to
account for the 0 values, as Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) do in the context of Africa.


                                                       18
the latest methods developed by Calonico et al. (2014), who calculate the optimal bandwidths,
and provide a robust bias-corrected estimate of the coefficients and standard errors. The methods
developed by the RD literature can be used for two different results.23 The first is just to see what
happens to conflict when the region’s own rainfall crosses the threshold, whereas the second looks
at the effect of the neighboring region’s rainfall at the cutoff. We should expect the likelihood of
conflict to discontinuously rise at the cutoff, and in turn we should expect light density to jump
downwards in response to this increase in the likelihood of conflict. Given this response, we perform
a two-stage least squares exercise, again using the RD methods, where in the first stage we estimate
the increase in the likelihood of conflict in crossing the resource cutoff, and in the second stage
we estimate the corresponding fall in light density. The assumption underlying this 2SLS exercise
is that, other than conflict, there are no alternative underlying features of the data that produce
discontinuous jumps to light-density at the cutoff. With the help of this assumption we measure
the impact of conflict on light-density and regional development. For the exercise we translate
light density into GDP using the elasticities for low-income countries and Africa discussed in the
literature (Henderson et al., 2012; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2013).



5     Results

In this section, we present and discuss empirical evidence in support of the model developed in
section 2. The analysis is carried out in multiple stages as discussed in section 4 above.


5.1    Joint Conflict

We start by showing a heat map of joint conflict for points i and j as a function of the relative
resource endowments between the points in the pair. The heat map, shown in Figure 8, bears
remarkable resemblance to the graph depicting the model predictions in Figure 4. That is, the
region adjacent to the origin shows little to no likelihood of joint conflict; while the upper-right
quadrant of the heat map corresponds to the highest likelihood of joint conflict, as predicted by
the model. The no-conflict region at the origin extends along both the x and y axes until about
the 0 point of the resource index for both i and j, beyond which the likelihood of conflict appears
to increase starkly. Specifically, a high degree of inequality between resources in i and j leads to
a higher probability of joint conflict, as one region has the resources to attack its neighbor, and
the other wishes to expropriate its neighbor’s resources. This probability of conflict diminishes as
the inequality diminishes (i.e., resources in j approach the high level of resources in i), but then
jumps up again as we approach equally high resource levels for both i and j (i.e., as we approach
the upper-right quadrant). Note further that the corner portions of the lower-right and upper-left
 23
    Our exercise is not strictly an RD since we are using an estimation procedure to first identify the discontinuity.
Our exercise using RD methods is to provide an estimate of the corresponding size of this discontinuity.

Annual rainfall averaged over 1998 and 2008. Probability of joint conflict is the likelihood of cells i and j ever being
involved in the same conflict over a ten year period (1998 to 2008).


quadrants representing extreme inequality actually show a reduction in conflict corresponding to
the mixed strategy equilibrium regions in Figure 4. This non-monotonicity in the conflict-resource
relationship lends preliminary empirical support to the predictions of the model.

         Next, we discuss results from a more formal regression analysis of the model’s predictions. We
split up our main results into two tables – Table 1 uses PRIO conflict data and covers all conflicts,
whereas Table 2 focuses in on territorial conflicts based on the ACLED data.

         For both sets of tables, in our first two columns we look at the relationship between the
presence of any resource – oil, gas, diamonds or mines – with the probability of region i and j being
in conflict, whereas in our last two columns we do a similar exercise for rainfall being above the
cutoff. Using the procedure discussed in section 4, we estimate the cutoff level of rainfall above
which the probability of joint conflict is higher for a randomly selected two-thirds of the sample.
Using this cutoff value and the remaining one-third of the sample, we then regress the probability
of a joint conflict between cell-points i and j on whether rainfall in i being above the cutoff, and

similarly for point j, and both i and j combined. As we use only the randomly selected one-third
of the sample for the rainfall regressions, the number of observations in the final regression are
smaller.24

       As discussed in section 4, we estimate two different specifications with different fixed effects.
The results of these regressions are presented in Table 1 and 2 with the controls and fixed effects
denoted for each column in the rows below the estimated coefficients and standard errors. These
are our most conservative specifications, and the specifications without controls or fixed effects is
shown in Table 4 and discussed in the next subsection.

       In Tables 1 and 2 it is evident that the presence of a resource raises the likelihood of conflict.
More resources in i increase the probability of a joint conflict, as do more resources in j. Further-
more, as predicted by the model, the probability of a joint conflict increases further when both
i and j resources are high. Together, the estimates show that the likelihood of conflict is higher
when moving from south-west to the north-east portion of the resource distribution represented in
Figure 4. These results verify that the patterns depicted in the heat map in Figure 8 (i.e., low
probability of joint conflict in the lower-left quadrant, a higher probability of conflict in the upper-
left and lower-right quadrants and the highest probability of conflict in the upper-right quadrant)
are indeed statistically significant.25

       For the PRIO data in Table 1, the increase in the probability of conflict relative to the baseline
is also economically significant – the presence of oil, diamonds or mines raises the likelihood of
conflict by at least 15% relative to the baseline, when moving from the lower-left no-conflict region
to the upper-right high conflict region. This increase is even larger, an increase of at least 54%,
if rainfall crosses the optimal cutoff into the upper-right high-conflict region. We find the optimal
rainfall cutoff to be 77.7 mm (reported in the last row of Table 1). The distribution around this
estimate of the cutoff for the full sample of data is shown in Figure 7.

       The ACLED results display a similar pattern in Table 2 for the sub-sample of territorial con-
flicts. While the baseline level of territorial conflicts is small, the percentage increase in conflict
in going from the lower-left low conflict quadrant to the upper-right high conflict region is high:
around 92% for rainfall being above the cutoffs.

       The results are robust across the different specifications including controls for both points i
and j, along with fixed effects for agro-ecological zones (AEZ). The statistical significance of the
results is unaffected when clustering standard errors at larger squares of the point i geospatial grid
as well as two way clustering by squares in both the i and j geospatial grids.
  24
     As the random selection is done at the cell i level and not all cells have an equal number of neighbors, given
coastlines, the number of observations are not precisely one-third.
  25
     As a reminder, the model’s predictions are that the coefficients on Resourcei > 0 and Resourcej > 0, and the
sum of the coefficients on Resourcei + Resourcej + Resource(i&j) > 0. There is no prediction on the coefficient on
the interaction term Resource(i&j) alone.

5.2      Different Samples and Specifications

We next demonstrate the robustness of these main results in three important ways – changing the
sample of analysis, using different model specifications, and focusing on specific resources. We then
extend the analysis using RD methods to estimate the size of the discontinuity at these resource
thresholds.

      In Table 3 we replicate our main results for different cuts of the data. We test our model’s
predictions that the coefficients on Resourcei , Resourcej and the sum of coefficients are positive.26
First, we use the entire African continent rather than sub-Sahara, and show that across both
data sets (ACLED and PRIO) and across different resources (rainfall and the combination of oil,
diamonds or metal mines), our results are both economically and statistically significant. Second,
we restrict the sample only to i and j pairs that are of different ethnicities as defined by the Murdock
(1959) Atlas of Africa. Since ethnic wars are a major focus of the large part of this literature, it
is not surprising that our results are strong when considering such pairs of cells as well. Thirdly,
we narrow the radius of i-j pairs to be only for pairs within 150km of each other. This restricts
the sample to only 9% of our total observations. Once again, across data sets and resources, our
results tell the same story.

      In Table 4 we are able to study how sensitive our results are to different modeling specifications.
In the top half of the table we show specifications without controls and without fixed effects. These
results are similar to our baseline results. Our empirical analysis depends crucially on the validity
of the comparison between i and j pairs. Most importantly, estimates should ideally be obtained
from a comparison of pairs with sufficient variation in relative resources but otherwise common
unobservables. That is, we want to be careful to not confuse differences in unobservables across
disparate regions of the continent with the marginal deviations in relative resources underlying the
intuition of the model’s predictions. While the specification including AEZ fixed effects presented in
Tables 1 and 2 start to address this concern, we show further robustness of the results to restricting
identifying variation within smaller contiguous areas as captured by the 5 degrees by 5 degrees grid
fixed effects in the bottom half of Table 4.

      We then proceed to focus on specific resources in Table 5. Given that the literature on conflict
in Africa has often discussed the presence of oil and gas, and the presence of diamond deposits
as drivers of conflict, we study whether the presence of these resources in neighboring regions
individually predict joint conflict as our model suggests. Indeed, we find that a region having these
resources predicts conflict with a neighboring region, and the same is true if the neighboring region
possesses the resource as well.
 26
      As there is no prediction on the interaction term Resource(i&j) alone, we omit it from this table.

              Controls include Agro-Ecological Zone Fixed Effects, and measures of (for both points
             i and j) latitude, longitude, ruggedness index, land quality index, humidity, malaria,
             population density, and a quadratic of the distance between two points in kms. Standard
             errors clustered at latitude-longitude degree grid level.


5.2.1   The Size of the Discontinuity


Next, having verified the differences in the probability of joint conflict across the four quadrants
depicted in Figure 8, we test whether the relationships between the probability of joint conflict
and resources in points i and j are in fact discontinuous at the cutoffs estimated. These cutoffs
correspond to the optimal model fit shown in Figure 7 and used in the tables for the rainfall results.
We present graphical depictions of discontinuities in joint conflict as a function of i and j resources,
in turn, in Figures 9 to 12. We test statistically for these discontinuities more formally using the
latest semi-parametric methods developed in Calonico et al. (2014). The method determines an
optimal data-driven bandwidth h for both the primary estimation and a bias-correction exercise
with a larger bandwidth and different polynomial order p. The semi-parametric RD estimate is:
τ (h, p) = β+ (h, p) − β− (h, p), where β+ is the estimate above the cutoff, and β− is the estimate
below the cutoff.

    Table 6 reports results from the estimation of regression discontinuity specifications analogous
to the exercises depicted in Figures 9 to 12 for both the PRIO and ACLED data. The results show
that the discontinuities in the probability of joint conflict at the cutoff values in resources are indeed
statistically significant. At the cutoff, there is an increase of about 0.1 percentage points in the
likelihood of conflict for the PRIO conflicts and a 0.013 percentage point increase in the likelihood
of territorial conflicts as determined by the ACLED data. These increases are meaningful as they
are approximately one-third the size of the baseline levels of conflict.

     Graphs were produced using the Calonico et al. (2014) procedure of identifying the optimal bin sizes.




    We interpret these large and significant discontinuities in the probability of joint conflict as
further evidence in support of the model. While the patterns depicted in Figure 8 and verified
statistically in Table 1 validate the non-monotonic relationship between resources and conflict
that the model predicts should arise from the strategic interaction, the regression discontinuity
results demonstrate strong support of the specific functional form of this relationship. In addition,
the strength of these results validates the structural break estimation methodology we employ to
identify the resource cutoff.

      (Light Density) in 2008 and (2) Whether the region was engaged in conflict between 1998 and 2008. The
      Resource Index consists of the first principal component of (i) annual rainfall averaged over a ten year
      period (1998-2008), (ii) oil or gas reserves, (iii) lootable diamonds, (iv) gold, (v) zinc, and (vi) cobalt in
      the 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid cell. Good institutions are defined as having below the median value in the risk of
      expropriation index, whereas poor institutions are defined as having above the median value. Confidence
      intervals are estimated over the underlying data rather than binned averages.




5.3     Institutions and Mitigating Conflict

We next investigate the degree to which the strength of the conflict-resource relationship predicted
by the model is moderated by local institutions. In particular, we investigate whether stronger
institutions weakens the impulse for strategic conflict. If stronger institutions reduce the return to
fighting (e.g., by introducing some probability of legal retribution) or increases the cost of conflict,
the model predicts that the resource cutoff above which conflict becomes the optimal strategy
should rise. In addition, we might suspect that stronger institutions might dampen the ability of
the model to predict the drivers of conflict overall as the model focuses on rapacity and relative
strength in conflict which should become less important as institutions such as those protecting
legal rights become stronger.

      We begin by plotting the relationships between natural resources, nighttime illumination, and
conflict, akin to the plots in Figures 1 and 2 in the introduction, but here splitting the data by
places with ‘good’ v. ‘poor’ institutions, defined as having either more or less than the median value
of the ‘risk of expropriation’ index (Acemoglu et al., 2001). Figure 13 plots resources against log
light density, finding starkly different relationships across places with good and bad institutions.
In particular, nighttime illumination is increasing in resource endowments for places with good
institutions, but clearly decreasing in resources when institutions are weak. Figure 14 provides

             around the point estimate.


empirical support for the idea that part of this difference is via conflict incidence: there is a lower
probability of conflict at every point of the resource distribution for places with stronger institutions
and the slope of the relationship is flatter. This preliminary evidence is exactly in line with what
is found by Mehlum et al. (2006).

    To formalize the intuition laid out in the figures discussed above, we use various measures of
institutions including variables from the Aggregate Governance Indicators and the International
Country Risk Guide published by the Political Risk Services Group. These measures are commonly
employed in related studies (see, e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2001); Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
(2015)). We use values from 1996, pre-dating the first year of our data. To first study how
institutions affect the optimal cutoff, we repeat the exercise presented in Figure 7 for sub-samples
of points with above and below the median values of our institutions measures. Then, to study the
explanatory power of the model, we estimate the partial R-squared at the optimal cutoff.



                                                         30
        Figure 15: PRIO: by Property Rights                       Figure 16: ACLED: by Property Rights




       Structural estimates for cutoffs, costs of war c and fraction appropriated δ were estimated by simultane-
       ously finding the optimal values that maximize the explanatory power of the model. For ‘Good Property
       Rights’, the sample is restricted to countries that have an above median measure of property rights. For
       ‘Poor Property Rights’ the sample is restricted to countries that have a below median measure of property
       rights.




       In Figures 15 and 16 we present an example of the full structural estimation for one of our
measures of institutions – the quality of property rights.27 To estimate the full model, we estimate
the optimal cutoff c/δ and the corresponding cost of war c, that maximizes the explanatory power of
the model. We do this for sub-samples above and below the median measure of property rights and
create figures analogous to Figure 4, with estimated structural parameters. We see that, indeed,
better property rights produce a higher cutoff as the model would predict – indicating that in the
presence of good institutions, the rapacity effect and endowment effect would have to be stronger
to be able to produce conflict.

       In Table 7 we summarize this exercise for four different measures of baseline institutional
quality. As is evident from the table, for every measure and type of data, poor institutions at
baseline correspond to lower rain-cutoffs.28 A lower rain-cutoff indicates that even at low levels of
resources, an increase in resources can lead to conflict. Good institutions mitigate this, and better
institutions have higher rain cutoffs. Furthermore, the difference in the partial R-squared shows
that the overall ability of the model to explain the relationship between conflict and resources in i
and j is diminished when institutions are good. Our model is better at explaining conflict patterns
in regions that have poor institutional quality.
  27
     As is evident from Table 7, the figures using other measures of institutions will look qualitatively similar. We
focus on property rights given the importance in the literature (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2005).
  28
     Note that the ACLED territorial conflicts and PRIO all conflicts sample have different cutoffs as the two data
sets have different definitions of conflicts and coding rules.

5.4     Development: Night Time Illumination

Finally, we present evidence of the relationship between development in point i as proxied by a
measure of night time illumination (lights) and resources in points i and j, net of any intervening
conflict. Even as African growth has recently picked up (Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin, 2014),
indicators of development are still poor. Here we examine how big a role conflict plays in hindering
economic activity in Africa. Figure 17 repeats the exercise in Figure 8 for log(lights) as a function
of resources in both points i and j. We see a pattern similar to the one depicted in Figure 1: at
first luminosity increases with rainfall, only to fall at high levels of rainfall.29 We see that the
regions of joint conflict prevalence (e.g., upper-right) in Figure 8 correspond to low levels of lights
or development in Figure 17; while the region of little to no conflict (i.e., lower-left) corresponds to
low to moderate development as resources are low, but conflict is also low. The highest levels of
development appear in the center of the heat map where resources are moderately high and conflict
is avoided. These results are broadly consistent with the predictions of the model.

      In Table 8 we show how light-density falls as resources cross the estimated cutoffs. Using the
cutoffs estimated for the conflict regression, we regress light-density on the cutoffs, controlling for
continuous measures of own resources, neighbors’ resources and the interaction between the two. As
  29
     Notice, that unlike previous pictures, here the outcome is light density in region i rather than a joint outcome
between i and j. Resources in i will directly affect the outcome, negating the possibility of symmetry in the figure.

only one-fourth of cells have non-zero light density, we show that our results are consistent across
various measures of lights, including an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation and normalizing the
zeros to 0.001 which is less than the smallest non-zero value of density. We see that light density
falls at each of these cutoffs: own, neighbor’s and the sum of all three. This shows how an increase
in conflict may lead to a reduction in local economic activity.

         In Table 9, we conduct various robustness checks for this exercise. First, we look at variation
only within small grid-cells by including 5 by 5 degree grid fixed effects. We also restrict the sample
to different ethnic groups, and lastly, instead of lights, we use the G-Econ measure of disaggregated
GDP.30 Our results are robust across these specifications.

         We push this empirical test of the model one final step further by conducting the analogous
analysis using the RD methods for light-density at the resource cutoffs estimated in the conflict
results above. The results from these analyses are presented in the top panel of Table 10 and once

again lend further support to the predictions of the model. Non-monotonicity in the relationship
between resource endowments and development as proxied by lights is a particularly striking pre-
diction, but one that helps to explain the relationship depicted in Figures 1 and 2. More striking
still, is a sharp drop at the threshold, in an otherwise positive relationship between resources and
development, and one not easily explained by any mechanism other than the intervention of conflict
predicted by the model. We see in Table 10 that indeed there is a significant drop in lights at the
resource cutoff at which the likelihood of conflict rises discontinuously.

      Simple empirical correlations between development and conflict will suffer from endogeneity
concerns. As a final empirical exercise, we exploit this common discontinuity in the resource-conflict
and resource-lights relationships to obtain an estimate of how conflict affects overall economic
activity. The exclusionary restriction underlying this exercise is that other than conflict, there are
no underlying factors that cause light-density to change discontinuously at the threshold. In the
bottom panel of Table 10, we report results from a two-stage least squares analysis of how log light
density changes as the probability of conflict jumps at the resource cutoff. We then convert this to
measures of GDP using the elasticities discussed in Henderson et al. (2012) and Michalopoulos and
Papaioannou (2013).31 Together these results suggest that as we vary the probability of conflict
 31
      For low income countries the elasticity of light density and GDP is about 0.3.

              centered around the point estimate.


over the interquartile range, GDP falls by 0.15 log points at the neighbor’s resource cutoff and 0.33
log points at the own resources cutoff. This suggests that an increase from a 25% to a 75% likelihood
of conflict can reduce GDP by as much as one-third. These tabulations suggest a significant effect
of conflict on the economic prosperity of the region.



6    Conclusion

We present a model of resource-driven conflict and the corresponding impacts on development,
and test its implications in sub-Saharan Africa. In our model, natural resources impel societies to
conflict by increasing both the capacity for aggression as well as the gains from expropriation. We
extend the model to account for 1) the idea that resources raise the opportunity costs of conflict,
and 2) the possibility that neighboring societies share resources. Using a pairwise dataset of grid
points in sub-Saharan Africa containing information on resource endowments, joint conflict, and


                                                       36
nighttime illumination (a proxy for local development), we test the predictions of this model. We
find cutoffs for conflict onset in these data using a two-dimensional structural break estimator, and
show that cutoffs are lower when institutions are poor. The results are a striking confirmation
of our theory, and are robust to functional form assumptions and alternative data sources. We
also demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between resources and economic development with
sharp reductions at conflict cutoffs.

    The back-of-the-envelope exercise conducted in the previous section gives a sense of the im-
portance of our results for understanding the development of sub-Saharan Africa in the context of
natural resource-driven conflict. Moving from the bottom to the top end of the interquartile range
of the probability of conflict, we estimate a GDP reduction of 33%, based on the results in Table
10. Though rough, these numbers convey the extent to which conflict stunts growth, and helps
to explain the striking stylized fact that many of the most resource-rich countries grow no faster
(indeed, often slower) than the most resource-poor countries.

A         Nash Equilibria Proofs

A.1         Baseline Model

Lemma A.1 For ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ), (N, N ) is the unique pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium.


Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = N . i will choose N iff ri > ri − c + δrj , which reduces to
c                                                                  c
δ   > rj . Similarly, j’s best response to si = N is N iff         δ   > ri . Thus for ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ), N constitutes
the best response to N for both i and j, and we have that (N, N ) is a Nash equilibrium.

         To show that (N, N ) is the unique NE in this case, it must be that (F, F ) is not a NE.32 We
can show that (F, F ) will not lie in this region. Take i’s best response to sj = F . This best response
is F iff

                          (1 − δ)ri < p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) + (1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c).                                 (5)


                        ri
         Given p =   ri +rj ,   this inequality is equivalent to

                                           −δrk2 + c(1 + δ)rk                        1−δ
                                 rj    <                           for      ri ∈ (0, c     )                          (6)
                                            δrk − c(1 − δ)                             δ
                                           −δrk2 + c(1 + δ)rk                       1−δ c
                                 rj    >                           for      ri ∈ (c      , )                          (7)
                                            δrk − c(1 − δ)                           δ    δ


         Equation 6 would require that rj < 0 and equation 7 that rj > δc . There is thus no ri , rj ∈ (0, δc )
for which the F is the best response for sj = F




                                         −δrk2 +c(1+δ)rk
Lemma A.2 Let ψ(rk ) :=                     δrk −c(1−δ) . (F, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium         in
the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈         (c δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ (c 1−δ
                                        1−δ
                                                                                       δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )}



Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = F in this region. i will choose F iff p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) +
(1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c) > (1 − δ)ri , which amounts to the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                                        δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )}.
Similarly j’s best response to si = F is F iff (1 − p)(rj − c + δ(ri − c)) + p(1 − δ)(rj − c) > (1 − δ)rj ,
which is the region {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ (c 1−δ
                                           δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )}. Thus (F, F ) is a Nash equilibrium in the
intersection of these regions.

         To show that (F, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, it must be that (N, N ) is
    32
    Note that for ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ), (F, N ) and (N, F ) cannot be NE, given that if one party plays N , the other’s best
response must be N for values of ri and rj in the specified range.


                                                             43
not an equilibrium.33 We can show that (N, N ) cannot be an equilibrium in this region. i’s best
                                                      c                                                               c
response to sj = N will be N iff rj <                 δ   and j’s best response to si = N will be N iff ri <          δ.
However, the intersections of the regions {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                 δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈
(c 1−δ                                                c                      2
    δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )} and the region ri , rj ∈ (0, δ ) is a null set. In R+ , ψ(ri ) = ψ(rk ) at the point
( δc , δc ). There is therefore no region in R2+ , for which ri > ψ(rj ), rj > ψ(ri ) and ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ).




                                    −δrk2 +c(1+δ)rk
Lemma A.3 Let ψ(rk ) :=              δrk −c(1−δ) .        (N, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium in
the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈   ( δc , ∞), rj   < ψ(ri )}


Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = F in this region. i will choose N iff p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) +
(1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c) < (1 − δ)ri , which amounts to the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                                        δ , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}.
                                                             c                                                        c
Similarly j’s best response to si = N is F iff               δ   < ri . Thus (N, F ) is a Nash equilibrium if ri >    δ
and rj < ψ(ri ).

       To show that (N, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, we must rule out the other
                                                                                                              c
equilibria. (N, N ) can be ruled out because j’s best response to si = N cannot be N if                       δ   < ri .
Similarly, (F, F ) cannot be a Nash Equilibrium in this region because i’s best response to sj = F
cannot be F if {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}. Lastly, we must rule out (F, N ). i’s best response
to sj = N is F iff rj > δc . However, {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : rj > δc } = ∅, thus
precluding an (F, N ) equilibrium in this region.




                                     −δrk2 +c(1+δ)rk
Lemma A.4 Let ψ(rk ) :=               δrk −c(1−δ) .       (F, N ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium in
the region {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈   ( δc , ∞), ri   < ψ(rj )}


Proof. Consider j’s best response to si = F in this region. j will choose N iff {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈
(c 1−δ
    δ , ∞), ri < ψ(rj )}. Similarly i’s best response to sj = N is F iff
                                                                                     c
                                                                                     δ   < rj . Thus (F, N ) is a Nash
                       c
equilibrium if rj >    δ   and ri < ψ(rj ).

       To show that (F, N ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, we must rule out the other
                                                                                                              c
equilibria. (N, N ) can be ruled out because i’s best response to sj = N cannot be N if                       δ   < rj .
Similarly, (F, F ) cannot be a Nash Equilibrium in this region because j’s best response to si = F
cannot be F if {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ ( δc , ∞), ri < ψ(rj )}. Lastly, we must rule out (N, F ). j’s best response
to si = N is F iff ri > δc . However, {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ ( δc , ∞), ri < ψ(rj )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : ri > δc } = ∅, thus
preventing the possibility of an (N, F ) equilibrium in this region.
  33
    Note that in this region, (F, N ) and (N, F ) cannot be NE, given that if one party plays F , the other’s best
response must be F for values of ri and rj in the specified range.


                                                                 44
                                       −δrk2 +c(1+δ)rk
Lemma A.5 Let ψ(rk ) :=                 δrk −c(1−δ) .        ∃ a mixed-strategies Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) in the
region {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈   ( δc , ψ(ri )), ri   > ψ(rj )} ∪ {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc , ψ(rj )), rj > ψ(ri )}


Proof. In this region, each party k will play a mixed-strategy where they F ight, with probability
qk :
                                                           (δrk − c)(rk + r−k )
                                           qk =         2                                                           (8)
                                                     δ(r−k  − rk2 − c(rk + r−k − 2))

       Given these probabilities that each party F ights, the expected payoff from fighting and not
fighting are equalized.




A.2      Sharing Rule

                                              δ
Proposition A.6 For δ > φ >                  1+δ    and (ri , rj ) ∈ R2+ , the following are best response functions for
agent k under a sharing-rule agreement:

                         

                       −δrk2 +c(1+δ)rk
   2. Let ψ(rk ) :=     δrk −c(1−δ) .



        BRk (s−k = F ) = F , for all (rk , r−k ) such that

                                                                 1−δ
                                       {(rk , r−k ) : rk ∈ (c        , ∞), r−k > ψ(rk )}                            (9)
                                                                  δ

        And BRk (s−k = F ) = N , for all (rk , r−k ) such that

                                                 1−δ                             1−δ
                {(rk , r−k ) : rk ∈ (0, c            )} ∪ {(rk , r−k ) : rk ∈ (c     , ∞), r−k < ψ(rk )}           (10)

       The change in the best response functions, leads to an expansion of the (N, N ) region of the
Nash equilibrium.


Proposition A.7 The sharing-rule expands the Nash Equilibrium region of (No, No)



                                                                  45

p is the probability of victory for party i, rk are the level of resources for parties k = {i, j}, c is the cost of engaging in
conflict, δ is the fraction of resources that the victorious party expropriates, and φ is the fraction of resources shared.

Lemma A.8 Let χ(rk ) =                     δ−φ .   (N, N ) is the unique pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium for the
region {(ri , rj ) : rj < χ(ri ), ri < χ(rj )}.


Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = N . i will choose N iff (1 − φ)ri + φrj > ri − c + δrj ,
which reduces to χ(ri ) > rj . Similarly, j’s best response to si = N is N iff χ(ri ) > ri . Thus for
{(ri , rj ) : rj < χ(ri ), ri < χ(rj )}, N constitutes the best response to N for both i and j, and we
have that (N, N ) is a Nash equilibrium.

       To show that (N, N ) is the unique NE in this case, it must be that (F, F ) is not an NE.34
We can show that (F, F ) will not lie in this region. Take i’s best response to sj = F . This best
response is F iff

                           (1 − δ)ri < p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) + (1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c).                                   (11)

Lemma A.9 Let ψ(rk ) :=                    δrk −c(1−δ) . (F, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium               in
the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈        (c δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ (c 1−δ

    Note that for ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ), (F, N ) and (N, F ) cannot be NE, given that if one party plays N , the other’s best
response must be N for values of ri and rj in the specified range.



                                                                 46
Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = F in this region. i will choose F iff p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) +
(1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c) > (1 − δ)ri , which amounts to the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                                        δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )}.
Similarly j’s best response to si = F is F iff (1 − p)(rj − c + δ(ri − c)) + p(1 − δ)(rj − c) > (1 − δ)rj ,
which is the region {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ (c 1−δ
                                           δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )}. Thus (F, F ) is a Nash equilibrium in the
intersection of these regions.

       To show that (F, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, it must be that (N, N ) is
not an equilibrium.35 We can show that (N, N ) cannot be an equilibrium in this region. i’s best

response to sj = N will be N iff rj <             δ   and j’s best response to si = N will be N iff ri <           δ.
However, the intersections of the regions {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                 δ , ∞), rj > ψ(ri )} ∩ {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈

    δ , ∞), ri > ψ(rj )} and the region ri , rj ∈ (0, δ ) is a null set. In R+ , ψ(ri ) = ψ(rk ) at the point
( δc , δc ). There is therefore no region in R2+ , for which ri > ψ(rj ), rj > ψ(ri ) and ri , rj ∈ (0, δc ).

Lemma A.10 Let ψ(rk ) :=            δrk −c(1−δ) ,     and let χ(rk ) =    δ−φ .   (N, F ) is the unique pure strategy

Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = F in this region. i will choose N iff p(ri − c + δ(rj − c)) +
(1 − p)(1 − δ)(ri − c) < (1 − δ)ri , which amounts to the region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c 1−δ
                                                                                        δ , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}.
Similarly j’s best response to si = N is F iff χ(rj ) < ri . Thus (N, F ) is a Nash equilibrium in the
region {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (0, δc − c), χ(rj ) < ri } ∪ {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc − c, ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}.

       To show that (N, F ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, we must rule out the other
equilibria. (N, N ) can be ruled out because j’s best response si = N cannot be N if χ(rj ) < ri .
Similarly, (F, F ) cannot be a Nash Equilibrium in this region because i’s best response to sj = F
cannot be F if {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}. Lastly, we must rule out (F, N ). i’s best response
to sj = N is F iff rj > χ(ri ). However, {(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ ( δc , ∞), rj < ψ(ri )}∩{(ri , rj ) : rj > χ(ri )} = ∅,
thus precluding an (F, N ) equilibrium in this region.

Proof. Consider j’s best response to si = F in this region. j will choose N iff {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈

    To show that (F, N ) is the unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, we must rule out the other
equilibria. (N, N ) can be ruled out because i’s best response sj = N cannot be N if χ(ri ) < rj .
Similarly, (F, F ) cannot be a Nash Equilibrium in this region because j’s best response to si = F
cannot be F if {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ ( δc , ∞), ri < ψ(rj )}. Lastly, we must rule out (N, F ). j’s best response
to si = N is F iff ri > χ(rj ). However, {(ri , rj ) : rj ∈ ( δc , ∞), ri < ψ(rj )}∩{(ri , rj ) : ri > χ(rj )} = ∅,
thus precluding an (N, F ) equilibrium in this region.

    Lemma A.13 Let χ(rk ) =                 δ     .   (N, N ) is the unique pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium for the
    region {(ri , rj ) : rj < χ(ri ), ri < χ(rj )}.


    Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = N . i will choose N iff ri (1 − c1 ) − c2 + δrj < ri . This
                                     c2 +c1 ri                                                                 c2 +c1 rj
    inequality reduces to rj <           δ       Similarly, j’s best response to si = N is N iff ri <              δ     .   Thus
    for {(ri , rj ) : rj < χ(ri ), ri < χ(rj )}, N constitutes the best response to N for both i and j, and
    we have that (N, N ) is a Nash equilibrium.




                                                                    49
       To show that (N, N ) is the unique PSNE in this case, it must be that (F, F ) is not an NE.36
We can show that (F, F ) will not lie in this region. Take i’s best response to sj = F . This best
response is F iff

Proof. Consider i’s best response to sj = F in this region. i will choose F iff p(ri (1 − c1 ) −

{(ri , rj ) : ri ∈ (c2 δ−c1

an equilibrium.37 We can show that (N, N ) cannot be an equilibrium in this region. i’s best response
