    There is considerable debate over the output and employments effects of IMF-

supported stabilization programs. This controversy seems especially heated for countries

facing acute balance of payments problems and currency crises, as witnessed in 1997 in

Korea, Indonesia and Thailand and elsewhere. Stiglitz (2000), for example, supports

critics of the IMF who argue “…the IMF’s economic ‘remedies’ often make things

worse—turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions into depressions.” Some

academic work also reaches this conclusion. Bordo and Schwartz (2000), for example,

conclude, “…the recent spate of [IMF] rescues may be the case of the medicine doing

more harm than good” (p. 60)1. Similar statements by other leading economists are

commonplace.

    Despite these strong statements about the value of recent IMF programs, no

consensus has emerged about the impact of these programs on the real side of the

economy2. Most empirical studies using panel data sets and regression techniques find

that IMF-supported programs improve the balance of payments and current account (e.g.

Khan, 1990; Conway, 1994; Bagci and Perraudin, 1997; Bordo and Schwartz, 2000).

This is not surprising since a key purpose of the IMF is “…to give confidence to

members by making the Fund’s resources temporarily available to them under adequate

safeguards, thus providing them with the opportunity to correct maladjustments in their

1
  Part of the criticism against the IMF is that it contributes to moral hazard by creating the expectation of
bailouts (implicit debt guarantees) whenever countries face balance of payments problems. Empirical
evidence on this point is mixed. For example, Dreher and Vaubel (2001) find support for moral hazard
associated with IMF programs, while Lane and Phillips (2000) do not. See Willett (2000) for a recent
review and evaluation of the literature on the debate surrounding the role of the IMF.
2
  There is a large literature reviewing the effects of IMF-supported stabilization programs. See, for
example, Beveridge and Kelly (1980), Bird (1996), Bordo and James (2000), Connors (1979), Convoy
(2000), Edwards (1989), Gylafson (1987), Killick et al. (1992), Pastor (1987) and Santaella (1996). Bird,




                                                    1
balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international

prosperity” (IMF Articles of Agreement, Article I (v)).

    Views on the ultimate output and employment effects of IMF programs, however,

appear much more divergent than on the balance of payments effects. On the surface, it

may seem odd that countries would choose to participate in an IMF stabilization program

if it were not in their best interests to do so. That is, participation in a program would

presumably be unlikely if the output costs were perceived to be particularly large,

outweighing the benefits arising from improvement in the balance of payments,

continued access to credit markets and so on. Stiglitz (2000) and others argue, however,

that while officially the IMF doesn’t force countries to participate in programs and

negotiate conditions, “In practice, it undermines the democratic process by imposing

policies.”

     A number of previous studies have attempted to measure the output costs of IMF-

program participation. However, these studies have reached radically different

conclusions—with results suggesting sizeable declines in output growth arising from

participation in IMF programs (e.g. Przeworski and Vreeland, 2000) to quite strong

positive output effects (e.g. Dicks-Mireaux et al., 2000). These conflicting results arise

from several sources, including differences in the types of IMF programs that are

investigated; differences in the groups of countries that are investigated (e.g. poor

developing versus emerging market economies); differences in the methodologies that are

employed; and, perhaps most important, how other factors influencing output growth are

taken into account.


Hussain and Joyce (2000) investigate the factors that cause countries to repeatedly enter into IMF
programs, and Joyce (2001) investigates the factors that determine the duration of IMF programs.


                                                   2
   One area that has not been sufficiently addressed in previous work is the role of

severe currency and/or balance of payments crises on output growth and how these

events interact with subsequent participation in IMF programs. We argue that Heckman’s

(1979) Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) approach does not adequately control for selection bias

in this case, since “participation equations” in this literature (predicting whether a country

participates in an IMF program) generally have low explanatory power. This is partly

because 2/3 of IMF programs are not associated with severe balance of payments and/or

currency crises (discussed in section 4). Our approach, by contrast, is to measure the

output cost of participation in an IMF program, and investigate whether there are

feedback effects that make implementation of programs especially problematic in the

immediate aftermath or concurrent with an ongoing balance of payments/currency crisis.

Our study focuses on three related questions: First, given that a country is already facing

a severe currency crisis, does participation in an IMF-supported stabilization program

tend to make real GDP growth weaker? Second, can one identify the channels (policy

instruments) through which participation in IMF-supported programs affect real GDP?

And, third, how much of the downturn in East Asia following the 1997-currency crisis

may be attributed to participation in IMF programs?

   To address the first question we control for the effect of a currency crisis on real

GDP, and consider whether there is an additional effect arising from IMF-program

participation at this time. We want to be sure that the effect of a currency crisis on GDP

is not inadvertently attributed to participation in an IMF program. The second question

asks whether we can identify the policy channel or policy mechanism through which

IMF-program participation affects real GDP growth. Beyond providing countries with




                                            3
access to substantial lines of credit, IMF programs are generally associated with

conditions on the future conduct of fiscal, credit and other policies. Identifying the way

IMF conditionality affects the formulation of policy in practice (ex post)-- as opposed to

the agreements themselves (ex ante)-- is an important step in determining how

participation in programs might affect GDP. If the critics of the IMF are right—

conditionality leads to overly restrictive macroeconomic policies and poor output

performance—then it should show up in the data. Finally, the answer to the third question

should shed light on the macroeconomic performance of East Asian countries that faced

currency crises in 1997, distinguishing those that entered into IMF programs (Korea,

Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia) from the country that did not participate

(Malaysia).

   To investigate these issues we focus on short-run IMF stabilization programs (Stand

By Agreements and Extended Fund Facilities) that are explicitly focused on balance of

payments adjustment, rather than programs directed primarily toward structural reform

and poverty reduction. The broadest spectrum of developing and emerging-market

countries possible is considered where the key limitation on the number of countries is

the availability of macroeconomic data. The estimation methodology employed to

investigate real growth effects of IMF programs is the General Evaluation Estimator

(GEE). In this context, we control for the occurrence of recent currency/balance of

payments crises and also test for interaction effects between the two events. This allows

us to answer the question: Is the adverse output effect of a currency crisis made worse

when the IMF steps in with a stabilization package? We test the basic model using a

panel data set with country-specific fixed effects. Simple reaction functions are also




                                           4
estimated to characterize the influence of IMF programs on the formulation of

macroeconomic policy. We take into account the effect of recent currency crises on

policy as well as the effects of self-selection bias.

    Section 2 discusses the GEE methodology, and how we control for recent occurrences

of currency crises. Section 3 discusses the data employed in the study and our selection of

IMF programs to investigate. Section 4 provides a statistical background and summary

statistics on the size, frequency over time, and regional distribution of IMF programs. We

also consider the probability of a country adopting an IMF program conditional upon

having had a recent currency crisis. Section 5 presents the primary empirical results of

the study. This section presents estimation results of the “reduced form” output equation

with explanatory variables that include balance of payments/currency crises and IMF

program participation. It also applies the model to explaining the recessions faced by East

Asian countries following the 1997 currency crisis. Section 6 presents results from

estimating policy reaction functions, and the effect of IMF programs on credit policy.

Section 7 concludes the paper.



Section 2. GEE Methodology: Controlling for Currency and BOP Crises

        The basic General Evaluation Estimator (GEE) methodology employed in our

study was first applied to the evaluation of IMF programs by Goldstein and Montiel

(1986). It is based on the idea that one can derive a counterfactual—what would have

happened to an IMF-participating country if it had not adopted a program—by

investigating the policy responses of non-participating countries. The key element in this

approach is that it must be possible to characterize macroeconomic policy choices by a




                                             5
simple and stable (over time and across countries) reaction function that holds for both

participating and non-participating countries. We extend this standard model by

introducing currency/balance of payments crisis as an additional factor influencing the

evolution of output. We also introduce an interactive term that measures any additional

adverse effect on output that is associated with IMF programs directly following a

currency crisis.

        The growth of real GDP for the ith country at time t ( yit ) is explained by policies

that would have been observed in the absence of an IMF-supported program ( xit );


exogenous external factors ( wit ); the recent occurrence of a currency or balance-of-


payments crisis ( Dicc( t −1) ); the existence of an IMF-supported program ( Ditimf ); and

unobservable random disturbances ( ε it ).

Policy reaction function:
where x is a k-element vector of policy variables for country i at time t that would be

observed in the absence of IMF support, w is an h-element vector of exogenous variables

for country i at time t, Dicc( t −1) is a dummy variable equal to unity if the country has

recently experienced a currency crisis (and zero otherwise), Ditimf is a dummy variable

equal to unity if a short-run IMF program is in effect (and zero otherwise), Ditimf ∗ Dicc( t −1)

is an interaction term measuring additional effects on output growth arising from a

currency crisis that is immediately followed by an IMF program, and ε it is a zero mean,




                                               6
fixed variance, serially uncorrelated, disturbance term3. β 0 is a vector of country fixed

effects (allowing average growth rates to vary across countries in the sample), β k is a k-

element vector measuring the impact of policy changes on output, α h is a h-element

vector measuring the impact of exogenous factors on output, β cc measures the effect of

currency/balance-of-payments crises on output growth, β imf measures the affect on

output from participation in an IMF-supported stabilization program, and β int measures

the effect of the interaction term.

         After postulating a rule for the k-element vector of policies that would have taken

place in the absence of an IMF-supported program ( xit ), the model is estimated (with

fixed effects) using panel data drawn from countries and periods in which IMF support

was in place and those in which IMF support was absent. The aim is to get consistent

estimates for β imf and β int -- the effects of IMF-support on output.

         Policies adopted in the absence of an IMF-supported program ( xit ) are directly

observable only for non-program periods, and a key part of the GEE estimation approach

is therefore to construct a counterfactual for policies during programs. This

counterfactual is based upon a policy reaction function that links changes in the policy

instrument to the deviation of the observed lagged value for output growth from its

desired value ( yitd ). The policy reaction function is described by:


2)       ∆x =γ [ yd − y     ]+η                                         (2)

where η it is a zero mean, fixed variance, serially uncorrelated error term assumed to be

uncorrelated with ε it and ∆ is the difference operator. The parameter γ indicates the

extent to which the policy instrument is adjusted in response to disequilbria in the target

variable. Substituting (2) into (1) and subsuming desired output growth into the vector of

fixed-effect constant terms for each country ( β 0' ) gives:



∆y = βo' − (β γ +1) y                     +β x      +α w + β ccDicc(t −1) + β imf Ditimf   (3)

+ β int (Dicc(t −1) ∗ Ditimf ) + (ε + β η )
                                   it k it

        Equation (3) is the basic GEE reduced form model as applied in earlier studies

(Dicks-Mireaux et al., 2000; Goldstein and Montiel, 1986; and others). The usefulness of

the model, as discussed in detail in Dicks-Mireaux et al. (2000), depends on (i) whether

individual country behavior may be aggregated in a stable (across countries and time)

uniform model; (ii) whether it may be assumed that the policy reaction function of a

program country, had it not received IMF support, is identical to that of non-program

countries that did not seek support; and (iii) whether the additive term β imf Ditimf and the

interactive term β int ( Ditimf * Ditcc ) can fully capture all the channels (static and dynamic)

through which participation in IMF-programs may affect output growth.

        Unlike previous studies, we control for the (lagged) occurrence of currency and

balance of payments crises as a predetermined variable in the output growth equation. We

also take into account the possibility that an interactive effect (operating between

currency crises and the adoption of IMF programs) may have an additional impact on

output growth. Leaving out these terms could leave the output growth equation

misspecified and lead to biased estimates.

Section 3. Selection of IMF Programs and Data Description

Selection of IMF Programs

        The main IMF facilities designed to meet short-run balance of payments

stabilization are Standby Arrangements (SBA) and the enhanced fund facility (EFF).4

In general, Fund members can access credit tranches from the General Resources

Account (GRA) either by means of IMF program arrangements or by means of “outright

purchases.” Outright purchases are limited, typically, for the first 25% of the member’s

quota and do not involve any phasing or conditionality. Stand-by arrangements have been

the main instrument through which members gain access to further credit tranches.5 Stand

By Arrangements (SBA) typically last for 12-18 months (the legal maximum is 3 years)

and first tranche drawings do not require strict conditionality. Any drawings beyond the

first tranche require both phasing out and stricter conditionality and are limited to 100%

of quota annually (300% cumulatively together with the Extended Fund Facility, EFF, as

discussed below). Repurchase obligations last about 3 ¼ - 5 years from the date of

purchase.

        The Extended Fund Facility, established in 1974, provides somewhat longer-term

financing to countries in need of structural economic reforms. EFF arrangements

typically last for 3 years; phasing and conditionality are similar to the SBAs with an

emphasis on longer-term structural reforms. Quota limits are identical to the SBAs while

repurchases last much longer (4½ - 10 years). Both facilities are subject to the same rate

4
 This discussion is based on International Monetary Fund (2000). Review of Fund Facilities—Preliminary
Considerations (IMF, Washington D.C).




                                                9
of interest for repayments.6 The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF), introduced in 1997

in the Korean stabilization program, aims to supplement resources made available under

SBAs and the EFF in order to provide financial assistance for exceptional balance of

payments difficulties. Penalty interest rates (increasing over time) and short repayment

periods (1–1½ years) insure that these are taken only in exceptional circumstances.7

        We use the SBA and EFF programs (and, for Korea in 1997, the new SRF

program) as our definition of “IMF-supported stabilization programs.” These are the only

programs clearly linked to short-term balance of payments adjustment. (There are no

cases of SBA and EFF programs being approved in the same year in this data sample).

By contrast with these programs, some Fund facilities are designed with other objectives

in mind. We do not include these programs since their primary objective is not short-run

balance-of-payments stabilization and adjustment.

        For example, separate from the General Resources Account, the Fund established

the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) in 1986 for “all low-income countries …that are

in need of such resources and face protracted balance of payments problems” [italics

mine] 8, and its successor, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), in 1987.

In 1999, the ESAF was replaced by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

These are managed separately by the IMF and are financed from the sale of IMF-owned

gold together with resources provided by members in the form of loans or grants to the

Fund, as Trustee, for the purpose of helping low-income member countries. These

5
  As the Articles of Agreement state, they were defined as “a decision by the Fund by which a member is
assured that it will be able to make purchases from the General Resources Account in accordance with the
terms of the decision during a specified period and up to a specified amount” (Article XXX (b)).
6
  Starting in 1989, the rate of charge was linked directly to the SDR interest rate, and adjusted weekly.
7
  In our sample, the only such case is the agreement with Korea in 1997.

resources are used to finance highly concessional, low-interest loans. Eligible countries

can withdraw up to 185% of their quota conditional on their balance of payment needs

and the strength of their adjustment program. The interest rate charged is 0.5%; and

repayments are over a 10 year period.

         By contrast with our study, Dicks-Mireaux et al. (2000) focus on the structural

adjustment programs in their research (SAF and ESAF) and measure the effects of these

IMF-supported programs on poor developing economies. Bordo and Schwartz (2000), on

the other hand, consider both IMF stabilization and structural adjustment programs, and

use a mixed sample of 20 emerging market and developed countries (including Australia

and New Zealand). Similarly, Przeworski and Vreeland (2000) do not differentiate

between programs, including both stabilization and structural adjustment IMF programs.

But, similar to our work (and unlike Bordo and Schwartz (2000) or Dicks-Mireaux et al.

(2000)), they consider a broad set of developing countries. Our basic results, however,

are robust to broadening the definition of IMF programs to include the SAF and ESAF.



Defining Currency and Balance of Payments Crises

    Our indicator of currency and balance of payments crises is constructed from “large”

changes in an index of currency pressure, defined as a weighted average of monthly real

exchange rate changes and monthly (percent) reserve losses.9 Following convention (e.g.

Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) the weights are inversely related to the variance of

changes of each component over the sample for each country. Our measure, taken from



9
  Our currency pressure measure of crises does not include episodes of defense involving sharp rises in
interest rates. Data for market-determined interest rates are not available for much of the sample period in
many of the developing countries in our dataset.


                                                   11
Glick and Hutchison (2000 and 2001), presumes that any nominal currency changes

associated with exchange rate pressure should affect the purchasing power of the

domestic currency, i.e. result in a change in the real exchange rate (at least in the short

run). This condition excludes some large depreciations that occur during high inflation

episodes, but it avoids screening out sizeable depreciation events in more moderate

inflation periods for countries that have occasionally experienced periods of

hyperinflation and extreme devaluation.10 An episode of severe exchange rate pressure is

defined as a value in the index—a threshold point-- that exceeds the mean plus 2 times

the country-specific standard deviation, provided that it also exceeds 5 percent.11 The first

condition insures that any large (real) depreciation is counted as a currency crisis, while

the second condition attempts to screen out changes that are insufficiently large in an

economic sense relative to the country-specific monthly change of the exchange rate.

     For each country-year in our sample, we construct binary measures of currency crises,

as defined above (1 = crisis, 0 = no crisis). A currency crisis is deemed to have occurred

for a given year if the currency pressure index for any month of that year satisfies our

criteria (i.e. two standard deviations above the mean as well as greater than five percent

in magnitude). To reduce the chances of capturing the continuation of the same currency

crisis episode, we impose windows on our data. In particular, after identifying each


10
  This approach differs from that of Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), for example, who deal with episodes
of hyperinflation by separating the nominal exchange rate depreciation observations for each country
according to whether or not inflation in the previous 6 months was greater than 150 percent, and they
calculate for each sub-sample separate standard deviation and mean estimates with which to define
exchange rate crisis episodes.
11
  Other studies defining the threshold of large changes in terms of country-specific moments include
Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999); Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1998); and Esquivel amd Larrain
(1998). Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) use a three standard deviation cut-off. While the choice of cut-off
point is somewhat arbitrary, Frankel and Rose (1996) suggest that the results are not very sensitive to the
precise cut-off chosen in selecting crisis episodes.


                                                   12
“large” indication of currency pressure, we treat any similar threshold point reached in

the following 24-month window as a part of the same currency episode and skip the years

of that change before continuing the identification of new crises. With this methodology,

we identify 160 currency crises over the 1975-97 period.



Other Variables in the Output Growth Equation and Policy Function

     Estimation of the reduced from equation (3) for the output growth equation

necessitates that the external exogenous variables influencing output growth (vector ω it )

and the (lagged) policy instruments (vector xi (t −1) ) are identified. The external exogenous

factors included are (trade-weighted) lagged external growth rates of major trading

partners and the lagged rate of real exchange rate overvaluation.12 The (lagged) policy

factors considered are the change in the budget surplus to GDP ratio, inflation, and credit

growth.

     In the policy reaction function estimates of equation (2), we also consider regional

dummy variables and a measure of policy “autocracy.”13 In controlling for sample

selection bias, a probit equation explaining the likelihood of IMF-program participation is

estimated. Other variables employed in this estimation, not noted above, are the (lagged)

foreign exchange reserves to imports ratio, the change in the current account to GDP

ratio, and real per capita GDP growth. These macroeconomic data series are taken from

the International Monetary Fund’s IFS CD-ROM.

12
  Real exchange rate overvaluation is defined as deviations from a fitted trend in the real trade weighted
exchange rate. The real trade-weighted exchange rate is the trade-weighted sum of the bilateral real
exchange rates (defined in terms of CPI indices) against the U.S. dollar, the German mark, and the Japanese
yen. The trade-weights are based on the average bilateral trade with the United States, the European Union,
and Japan in 1980 and 1990.




                                                 13
     The minimum data requirements to be included in our study are that GDP are

available for a minimum of 10 consecutive years over the period 1975-97. This

requirement results in a sample of 67 developing countries.14 We use annual observations

in our analysis. While we employ monthly data for our (real) exchange rate pressure

index to identify currency crises and date each by the year in which it occurs, using

annual data enables inclusion of a relatively large number of countries. The appendix

table provides details on the countries included in the sample, the currency crisis dates,

and the periods when countries participated in IMF programs.



Section 4. Summary Statistics: IMF Programs, Currency Crises and the Economy

IMF Programs: Size, Growth and Regional Distribution

        The frequencies of the IMF programs are shown in Table 1 (for all countries) over

the 1970-99 period. (Descriptive statistics on IMF programs reported in Tables 1-2 cover

the 1970-99 period, while the other tables involving statistical analysis cover the 1975-97

period.) The total number of programs, the average size in terms of SDRs (in

parentheses), and the size of the average program as a percent of the recipient country

GDP (in brackets) is given in the table. The table is divided into short-term stabilization

(focus of our study) and longer-term structural adjustment programs, and also separated

into five-year intervals.

        Over the 30-year period, 845 IMF programs were approved, of which 678 were

short-run stabilization programs—Standby Agreements (SBA) or the Extended Fund

Facility (EFF). Only 167 were longer-term structural adjustment programs—Structural

13
  Autocracy is an index ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most “closed” political system. This
source of this variable is the “polity” database.



                                                  14
Adjustment Facility (SAF), Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) or the

Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

           The number of programs reached a peak in the early 1980s (with the Mexican

debt crisis and debt problems in other Latin American countries), both in terms of

number of programs (169) and size relative to the economies involved (average program

size over 4 percent of GDP). The number of IMF programs is not growing, nor is the size

relative to the economies involved (about 2 percent of GDP in 1995-99). The size of the

average program in terms of SDRs jumped in the late 1990s, however, due to the large

economic size of the countries going to the IMF for assistance (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia,

Mexico, Russian Federation, and South Korea).15

           The regional breakdown of program approvals is given in Table 2. The short-term

stabilization programs (SBA and EFF) are primarily directed to Latin America and

Africa, with about 30 and 35 percent respectively of program approvals. Africa

dominates the long-term structural programs (SAF/ESAF and PRGF) with 70 percent of

the programs over the period.



Currency Crises and IMF Program Participation

           An important part of our study is to investigate the link between currency crises,

real output developments and IMF stabilization programs. Table 3 shows the relative

frequencies of currency crises and IMF stabilization program participation for the 67

countries in our sample over the 1975-1997 period. Panel A shows the contemporaneous

frequencies (and associated chi-squared independence tests), i.e. contemporaneous

     This includes the disbursement to Korea under the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF).

currency crises and contemporaneous IMF program participation. Statistical

independence of these observations is rejected at the 99 percent level of confidence, but

only 18 percent of IMF program participation observations are associated with currency

crises. However, a substantially higher percentage (28 percent) of the currency crisis

observations coincide with IMF program observations.

   Panel B shows the link between IMF programs and contemporaneous and lagged

currency crises. This shows a stronger link than the contemporaneous relationship.

Statistical independence is again rejected (at greater than 1 percent significance). 33

percent of contemporaneous IMF program participation observations are associated with

either a contemporaneous or previous (one-year lag) currency crisis. Similarly, 28 percent

of contemporaneous or lagged currency crises are associated with a contemporaneous

IMF program. Hence, almost a third of currency crisis observations are linked to an IMF

program within the current year or next year. Of course, this implies that about 2/3 of the

currency crisis observations are not linked with IMF program participation.



Macro Developments: Participation/Non-participation and Before/After Statistics

   Tables 4-6 present summary statistics on the timing of IMF programs (SBA and EFF)

participation and key macroeconomic developments. Table 4 shows sample mean values

for macroeconomic developments during program years and non-program years. The first

two columns report the statistics for all countries (both for those countries that at some

point participated in IMF programs and for those that did not), focusing on non-program

observations and IMF-program observations. Real GDP growth was about 4% [1082

observations] during the non-program years and 2.9% during the program years [585




                                           16
observations]. This difference is significantly different at the 99 percent level of

confidence (t-statistic equal to 4.83). Inflation and budget deficits are significantly higher

during the program years, but no substantive difference between program and non-

program years is detected in the growth rate of credit or the current account balance.

   There may be systematic differences in the types of countries that approach the IMF

for assistance, however. Focusing only on countries participating in IMF programs

(second, third and fourth columns) avoids this selection bias. For countries involved in

IMF programs (at some point during the sample), average GDP growth was 3.6% during

non-program years and 2.9% during program years. This difference is statistically

significant. Inflation was also significantly lower during the non-program years. No

difference is discernible in credit growth or the budget and current account balances.

   If one simply compares IMF-program countries (both during program and non-

program years) with those not having a program during the sample period, the differences

are substantial-- but not surprising. Countries that have never participated in an IMF

program during our sample period-- presumably not having had a need to participate--

exhibit much stronger economic fundamentals: much higher GDP growth rates (6.8%

versus 3.4%), lower inflation, lower credit growth, and balanced positions in the current

account and budget.

   Table 5 focuses on the before/after time series of countries participating in IMF

programs. Four-year windows are imposed. The table shows that output growth does not

decline substantially when a country enters an IMF program, but does increase

significantly during the two-year period following the program. Credit growth, by

contrast, falls significantly during the IMF program and stays at the lower rate of growth




                                            17
following the program. No statistically significant shifts are noted in the time pattern of

inflation, the current account balance or the budget surplus.

    Table 6 undertakes the same decomposition as Table 5 but instead imposes only a

two-year window, together with a one-year interval before and after IMF program

participation. Real GDP growth is not much different one year before and during an IMF

program, but rebounds substantially the year following a program. Inflation drops

before/during and after programs, but the variation in the sample is so great that the

differences are not statistically significant. Credit growth drops sharply following an IMF

program and stays lower one year following a program. The budget balance improves

during an IMF program and stays at a lower level following the program.

    Tables 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate that economies typically experience slow growth

prior to entering into an IMF program, and sluggish growth continues until the program is

concluded. It does not appear that participation in the IMF program directly contributed

to slower growth. Inflation and credit growth both declined during the IMF-program and

stayed lower than the pre-program period. In short, these summary statistics paint a

classic recession-rebound pattern but it is not clear if IMF program participation played a

role.



Section 5. Real Output Effects of IMF Programs

General Evaluation Estimator (GEE) Estimates

    The reduced form GEE estimates (equation 3) are reported in Table 7. White’s

consistent standard errors are reported. The first column reports the model without

controlling for country fixed effects or currency crises. The lagged control variables are




                                           18
the change in the budget surplus ratio, inflation, credit growth, external (world) output

growth, and real exchange rate overvaluation. A lagged dependent variable, as suggested

in the theoretical formulation of the model, is also included. The focus is the coefficient

on the IMF-program dummy. The coefficient estimate is statistically significant (99

percent level of confidence) and indicates that real GDP growth is lowered by about 1

percent during each year of IMF-program participation.

   The estimated coefficients on lagged external growth (positive) and lagged real

exchange rate overvaluation (negative) have the predicted signs and are statistically

significant. In terms of the policy variables, the estimated coefficient on the lagged

change in the budget surplus is positive and the estimated coefficient on lagged credit

growth is negative. Both are statistically significant. Interpreting these coefficients in

terms of reaction functions, the rise in the lagged budget surplus (rise in credit growth)

could lead to a more expansionary (restrictive) contemporaneous fiscal policy (credit

policy) and hence rise (fall) in output growth. Other interpretations are possible. For

example, countries with more sustainable fiscal policies and lower credit growth may

have systemically higher real output growth rates. Inclusion of fiscal and credit variables

may be picking up important cross-country differences in economic performance.

   Column 2 reports results for the model with country fixed effects (dummy variables

for each country to capture the significant differences in growth rates over the full sample

period) and the currency crisis variable. These variables are highly statistically

significant, increasing the overall explanatory power of the model (R-squared) from 12

percent to 21 percent. A currency crisis in year t-1 is associated with a decline in output

growth in year t of about 1.5 percentage points. The coefficient estimate on the IMF-




                                            19
participation variable decreases substantially when the currency crisis variable is taken

into account, indicating that output growth is about 0.74 percentage points less annually

for each year of IMF-program participation. This coefficient estimate, however, is only

significant at the 90 percent level of confidence.

   Column 3 reports the results of the model when both contemporaneous and lagged

currency crisis variables are included in the regression. Both of the currency crisis

variables are negative and statistically significant. The coefficient estimate on the IMF-

program participation is similar (0.78) to the result reported in column 2.

   Column 4 reports the results where the model includes an interactive term measuring

the occurrence of an IMF-program that takes place around the time of a recent occurrence

of a currency crisis (i.e. contemporaneous or in the previous year). The model estimates

again suggest that a currency crisis leads to an output loss, but the coefficient estimate (-

0.66) on the IMF program dummy variable is not statistically significant. Is the output

loss associated with a currency crisis magnified if an IMF program is approved in the

same year or immediately following a severe balance of payments or currency crisis? The

interaction term in column 4 is not statistically significant, indicating that the output loss

associated with a crisis does not appear to be affected by a country’s participation in an

IMF program.

   Column 5 reports results from estimating a more dynamic specification of the model.

The objective is to investigate whether the adverse effects from participating in an IMF

program dissipate, or perhaps intensify, over time. This is accomplished by including

three lags of the IMF-participation variable. It appears that the adverse output effects are

felt during the years of IMF program participation (generally 1-3 years), but no




                                            20
significant additional effects are observed in subsequent years. That is, neither the sum of

the coefficients on the three lagged values of program participation nor the joint test is

statistically different from zero (see footnote b to table 7).

     In sum, the results are robust and indicate that participating in an IMF-program,

regardless of whether a currency or balance of payments crisis has recently occurred,

“costs” about 0.6-0.8 percentage points of real GDP growth annually. Our estimates are

about half the size of the negative impact reported by Przeworski and Vreeland (2000)16

or Bordo and Schwartz (2000)17, and similar in magnitude to Conway (1994). Unlike

Conway (1994), however, we do not find that the reduction in growth is followed by

higher future output growth18.

     It is noteworthy that we also tested for sample selection bias in the estimation

procedure, and the results were unaffected. The estimates on the IMF and currency crisis

variables did not change and the coefficient on IMR was not statistically significant. (The

probit equation estimated to measure self-selection bias is presented in Appendix Table

3.) Of course, insignificance of the IMR variable may either be because selection bias is

not an important issue or because the participation equation is misspecified. These results

are not reported for brevity but are available from the author upon request. This finding is

16
   Przeworski and Vreeland (2000) estimate a long run growth model (using capital and labor growth as
independent variables), dividing the sample into (IMF) program observations and non-program
observations. They also include the IMR in the regression. Their conclusions regarding the growth effects
of IMF-program participation are based on the difference between the estimated constant terms in the two
regressions.
17
   Bordo and Schwartz (2000) report a contemporaneous effect of IMF programs of –1.61 (t=-0.97) and a
one-year lagged effect of 2.24 (t=2.67). The contemporaneous effect is insignificantly different from zero
and the one-year lagged effect is significant at the 99 percent level of confidence. On balance, their results
indicate that IMF program participation has a net positive effect on growth. Surprisingly, they conclude
that: “The main detriment [of IMF program participation] is a temporary reduction in real growth.” (p. 57)
and “…the impression given by the annual data—that turning to the IMF may be harmful to a country’s
real economic performance…” (p. 60). Our results are not directly comparable, however, since they have a
limited sample of emerging market and developed countries (20 total), and include short-run stabilization
programs, structural adjustment, and poverty reduction programs in their study.



                                                   21
similar to Dicks-Mireaux et al. (2000). (We do find IMR significant in the policy

reaction functions, however.)



Extensions: IMF Program Dating and Downturns Prior to IMF Program Approvals

           Table 8 presents several extensions of the basic output growth model. The first

two columns use the conventional dating scheme employed in Table 7, i.e. dating the

IMF program in the calendar year in which it was approved. The first column adds a one-

year leading indicator of IMF program participation (“lead IMF program participation

dummy, t+1”) and the second column adds a one-year leading indicator of IMF program

approval (only the year of approval; subsequent program years are coded as zero). The

descriptive evidence presented in Table 6 suggests that a downturn in output tends to lead

(by one year) participation in an IMF program. A lagged dependent variable included in

the basic output growth equation helps to account for this dynamic. If “cycles” are

irregular, however, inclusion of the IMF leading variable might be able to better capture

downward shifts in output growth occurring with some regularity prior to IMF program

participation. The leading IMF dummy variable is not significant in either column 1 or 2,

however, and the contemporaneous effects are quite similar to those reported in Table 7.

            The second two columns use an alternative-dating scheme for the implementation

of IMF programs that has been used by Dicks Mireaux et al. (2000) and others. This

dating scheme dates the IMF program to be in effect in year t if it was approved in the

first half of year t or in the second half of year t-1. Again the leading IMF program

dummy variable is not statistically significant. However, the estimated contemporaneous

effects of IMF programs on output growth using the alternative-dating scheme do change

18
     Similar to our study, Conway (1994) uses only SBA and EFF programs in his study.

                                                  22
somewhat. In particular, the estimated negative effect of an IMF program in column 3

(IMF program participation) rises to –1.22 and is significant at the 95 percent level of

confidence. By contrast, the estimated output effect in the year of an IMF program

approval is insignificant. These results indicate that changes in the dating scheme of IMF

program implementation and program definition (whether defined as all years of

participation or only the first year of approval) affect the results to some extent but do not

change the basic findings.

       We also estimated the basic model over the 1990-97 period, as the evolving

nature of IMF programs and conditionality may have changed their effect on output. In

particular, the number of conditions attached to IMF programs have increased in the

1990s. The coefficient on the IMF dummy drops to only –0.36 in this regression and is

not significant at conventional levels.



The East Asian Financial Crisis and Output Contraction

       Figure 1 presents the predicted values for output growth for the five East Asian

countries that experienced a severe currency and balance of payments crisis in 1997.

These predictions are for 1998 and based on 1997 values of the explanatory variables and

the coefficient estimates—including country-specific fixed effects—are based on the

model presented in column 3 of Table 7 (estimates are based on 1975-97 data). The

explanatory factors leading to the 1998 predicted value are decomposed into: (a)

domestic factors (change in budget surplus, inflation, and credit growth), (b) external

factors (external growth and real exchange rate overvaluation), (c) other factors (previous




                                           23
year’s output growth and country-specific fixed effect), (d) the currency crisis effect, and

(e) the IMF-participation effect.

         Predicted output growth for all 5 countries is positive in 1998, and the forecast

error (unexpected declines in output) is therefore very large. The negative effect exerted

by the currency crisis and subsequent participation in an IMF program is entirely

dominated by positive “other factors”– mainly a history of very strong growth in the

region and the consequently large country-specific fixed effect growth factor-- and a

modestly supportive external growth environment. The effect of the currency crisis was

expected to slow output growth by between 1-2 percentage points and IMF-program

participation (for Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and the Philippines) lowers predicted

growth by about 0.8 percentage points.

         The largest unexpected fall in real GDP was Indonesia (17.6 percentage points)

and the least in the Philippines (3 percentage points). The average of the four negative

forecast error for the four countries participating in IMF programs was 12.3 percentage

points, not much different than the 13.5 unexpected fall in Malaysia’s GDP. Not

participating in the IMF program did not appear to help Malaysia avoid a huge fall in

output, and this decline was similar to others in the region.19 The 0.8 predicted negative

effect of participating in an IMF program pales by comparison with the actual declines in

output observed.




19
  Kaplan and Rodrik (2001) argue that, following the crisis, the imposition of capital controls in Malaysia,
as opposed to adoption of an IMF program, led to a faster recovery and lower unemployment compared to
Thailand and South Korea. They compare the aftermath of the imposition of controls in 1998 with the
adoption of IMF programs in 1997 by Korea and Thailand (using the time-shifted difference-in-difference
specification). However, this approach does not take into account a counterfactual that the Malaysian
currency crisis probably would not have extended to September 1998 if it had adopted an IMF program in
1997.


                                                  24
        There appears to have been a common shock or common vulnerability in these

countries-- not related to the IMF and unobserved in this model-- causing the

unexpectedly large collapse in output.20 All of these countries serious banking problems

that were associated with currency crises, a characteristic likely to cause substantially

greater output effects, working through the disruption of credit and other channels (Glick

and Hutchison, 2001). Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore avoided the worst of the

currency and banking problems because they did not have significant external (foreign-

currency denominated) short term debt positions. Other factors, such as an abrupt loss of

confidence after two decades of rapid growth and unrealistically high expectations for the

region, may also have played a role.



Section 6. Is Policy Changed by IMF Program Participation?

        An important assumption underlying the GEE strategy is that it is possible to

characterize policy actions in the form of stable and systematic reaction functions

(equation 2). This may prove extremely difficult since we are attempting to identify

common responses from a broad spectrum of developing and emerging-market countries

over a thirty-year period. The work of Dicks-Mireaux et al. (2000) highlight the problems

in identifying a consistent policy reaction function even among low-income developing

economies. For example, they do not find any significant determinants of the fiscal

balance or net domestic credit. They conclude “…these estimates provide a weak basis

for deriving estimates of the unobservable counterfactuals.” (p. 508).


20
  It is possible that the “common shock” was indeed especially severe austerity programs associated with
the IMF programs, and perhaps mimicked by Malaysia to gain international acceptance of its policies.
However, the evidence reported by Kaplan and Rodrik (2001) and others, and the imposition of capital
controls by Malaysia, does not support this view.


                                                 25
        Table 9 presents our estimates of policy reaction functions for domestic credit

growth—a primary policy instrument for many developing economies. Domestic credit

growth is also a key indicator of monetary policy used by the IMF in conditionality and

surveillance. Equations for narrow money growth, broad money growth, and government

budget policy-reaction functions were also estimated but the results are much weaker and

not reported for brevity.

        Column 1 reports the results of the basic policy reaction-function model for all

observations in the sample (program and non-program years), while columns 2 and 3

report the estimates over the program and non-program observations, respectively.

Consistent with the theoretical formulation of the model, the macroeconomic

determinants consist of lagged values of the current account surplus (relative to GDP),

inflation, real GDP growth, and whether or not the country experienced a currency crisis.

Also included are regional dummy variables and a dummy variable for the form of

government (“autocracy”). Further, in the equations for non-program years and program

years we have included the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) to control for sample selection

bias. (The probit model estimated with IMF program approvals as the dependent variable

is reported in Appendix Table 3. The IMR is calculated from the predicted values of this

model.)

        The only significant macroeconomic predictors of credit growth, shown in

columns (1)-(3), are lagged inflation and the occurrence of a currency crisis in the

previous year. The coefficient estimates of lagged inflation range between 0.6-0.7,

indicating that a one-percentage point rise in inflation is associated with a rise (fall) in

nominal credit growth (real credit growth) of about 0.7 (0.3) percentage points.




                                            26
Interpreting this equation as a reaction function suggests that, in response to a rise in

inflation, the authorities respond by reducing real credit growth. The coefficient on the

(lagged) currency crisis variable is positive and significant in columns 1 and 3, indicating

that countries generally respond to currency crises by expanding credit growth.

       The constant term is much lower during IMF programs (6.9) relative to the non-

program observations (28.8), suggesting more restrictive policy on average during the

IMF-program years. The IMR is significant in the IMF-program-years regression

(column 3), indicating that sample selection bias is an issue—countries don’t randomly

enter into IMF programs and their decision to participate is systematically linked to

domestic credit growth.

       The regressions reported in columns 4 and 5 cover all years and control for IMF-

program participation by including a dummy variable in the regression. Country specific

dummy variables are included in these regressions-- a fixed-effects model formulation--

in order to control for the wide variation in average credit growth across countries. These

results indicate the importance of controlling for country fixed effects in attempting to

explain credit growth over such a wide diversity of countries. The impact of inflation is

substantially reduced (to 0.4), indicating that inflation reduces real credit growth. The

dummy variable on autocracy is also significant in one formulation of the model as are

the regional dummy variables.

       We find that, in column 4, IMF programs reduce domestic credit growth by about

4 percentage points during the period they are in effect. Inclusion of the interactive term,

in column 5, indicates that currency crises tend to induce greater credit expansion (by 11

percentage points) and the joint coincidence of a recent currency crisis and current IMF




                                            27
program is associated with a contraction of credit by about 15 percent annually. The joint

effect of a currency crisis (lagged) followed by an IMF program is estimated to reduce

credit growth by about 5.6 percentage points (11.2-1.3-15.6).

       These results suggest that IMF program participation is associated with restrictive

credit growth. Investigations of budget policy and money growth, however, did not

indicate any link between IMF program participation and policy. Even the credit reaction

function is fairly weak, however, likely reflecting shifts in policy over time and the fact

that the types of countries going to the IMF for assistance have very different

characteristics than countries not going to the IMF.



The East Asian Financial Crisis and Credit Growth

       The empirical credit growth equation (column 4 of Table 9) is employed to

predict credit growth for the five East Asian countries that experienced currency crises in

1997. Predicted credit growth was divided into component parts and the “unexpected”

(forecast error) calculated. In every case, credit growth in 1998 is predicted to be quite

strong, ranging from 15.5 (Philippines) to 24.4 (Indonesia). Participation in IMF

programs lowered predicted credit growth by about 4 percentage points, and the predicted

response to the currency crises increased predicted credit growth by about 4 percentage

points.21

       A sharp and unanticipated contraction (negative forecast error) was experienced

in every country except for Indonesia following the East Asian currency crisis. The

countries that participated in IMF programs experienced smaller unexpected declines

(Korea: -8.4 percent; Philippines: -17.5 percent; Thailand: -18.2 percent) than did




                                           28
Malaysia (-23.2), and Indonesia experienced a sharp unpredicted jump in credit. The

observed decline, as opposed to the negative forecast error, in credit growth was also

largest in Malaysia at -2.7 percent. Indonesia, by contrast, experienced a 18.6 percent

unpredicted rise in credit and an observed rise of 43 percent. Similar to the output growth

prediction results, Malaysia was hurt at least as much by the Asian currency crisis as the

IMF-program countries.



Section 7. Conclusion

           The estimated cost of an IMF stabilization program, in terms of foregone output

growth, is about 0.6-0.8 percentage points during each year of program participation.

Currency crises also reduce output growth over a two-year period by about 2 percentage

points. Participation in an IMF-supported program following a balance of payments or

currency crisis, however, does not appear to mitigate or exacerbate the output loss. This

is despite the fact that countries participating in IMF-programs seem to follow much

tighter credit policy when facing a severe balance of payments crisis. Moreover, there is

some evidence that the decline in GDP growth generally precedes the approval of an IMF

program and may not be attributable to program participation per se. These results are

robust to estimation technique, model specification, types of IMF programs included, and

corrections for sample selection bias.

           The huge declines in output and credit growth in the wake of the 1997 Asian

currency crisis were much larger than predicted by historical patterns linking GDP

developments to currency crises, IMF program participation, external conditions and

policy developments. Indeed, the models predicted fairly robust output growth and credit

growth in 1998 despite the currency crises and, in most cases, participation in IMF-

supported programs. The unexpected falls in output and credit were also very large in

Malaysia, even though it chose not to participate in an IMF stabilization program at the

time. Whether or not a country decided to participate in an IMF-supported program at the

time of the Asian currency crisis seems to have had little affect on the ultimate output

cost.

        The effect of IMF-supported stabilization programs on output growth-- judging by

the experiences of 67 countries with over 450 programs—does not appear large in

comparison with the average growth rates of developing and emerging-market economies

over the 1975-97 period. Nonetheless, whether or not the cost of participating in an IMF-

supported stabilization program exceeds the benefit measured in terms of balance of

payments adjustment and continued access to credit markets is an open question to be

answered by policymakers in the countries involved.

Appendix: Participation in IMF-Supported Stabilization Programs

       Appendix Table 3 presents a probit equation attempting to explain participation in

short-term IMF programs by a variety of economic determinants. Our selection of

economic determinants is guided by previous literature in this area, especially Knight and

Santaella (1997) who test a number of supply side (e.g. willingness of the IMF to approve

programs) and demand side (e.g. demand of a particular country for IMF credits)

determinants. This literature demonstrates that entering into an IMF agreement is not

random, but guided by “…a clear set of observable economic factors that are strongly

correlated with the event of approval of a financial arrangement.” (p. 431). They find

that a low level of international reserves, low per capita GDP, high ratio of external debt

service (to export earnings), movements in the real exchange rate, weak GDP growth and

a low rate of domestic investment induce countries to seek an IMF-supported program.

Policy measures to enhance fiscal revenues, reduce government expenditures, to tighten

domestic credit, and to adjust the exchange rate are significant factors likely to win IMF

approval of programs.

       We report similar results in Appendix Table 3. We find that an improvement in

the budget surplus helps win IMF approval of programs, while lower foreign exchange

reserves (relative to imports) and a currency crisis induce countries to seek an IMF

program. Countries in Africa and Asia are less likely to have short-term IMF programs

approved. There is no discernible shift in the probability of having an IMF program

approved in the 1980s and 1990s compared to earlier periods and, surprisingly, we find

no connection between program approval and inflation, real exchange rates, real per




                                           31
capita GDP growth or the level of real GDP per capita. Other lagged values were

investigated but did not add explanatory power to the model.

       There are 862 observations in sample, and the model (at the 25% predicted

probability cut-off point) predicts 71 percent of the observations correctly. But while 80

percent of the “no program participation” observations are correctly predicted, only 34

percent of the "program approval” observations are correctly predicted. At the 10 percent

probability cut-off point, however, 96 percent of the “program participation” observations

are correctly predicted but only 32 percent of the “no participation” observations.
