Cross-Border Prudential Policy Spillovers: How Much? How Important? Evidence from the
International Banking Research Network

                                          ABSTRACT

The development of macroprudential policy tools has been one of the most significant changes in
banking regulation in recent years. In this multi-study initiative of the International Banking
Research Network, researchers from fifteen central banks and two international organizations use
micro-banking data in conjunction with a novel dataset of prudential instruments to study
international spillovers of prudential policy changes and their effects on bank lending growth.
The collective analysis has three main findings. First, the effects of prudential instruments
sometimes spill over borders through bank lending. Second, international spillovers vary across
prudential instruments and are heterogeneous across banks. Bank-specific factors like balance
sheet conditions and business models drive the amplitude and direction of spillovers to lending
growth rates. Third, the effects of international spillovers of prudential policy on loan growth
rates have not been large on average. However, our results tend to underestimate the full effect by
focusing on adjustment along the intensive margin and by analyzing a period in which relatively
few countries implemented country-specific macroprudential policies.

1. Introduction
The development of macroprudential policy tools is one of the most significant policy changes in
the past decade. Macroprudential policies aim at mitigating systemic risks in financial markets.
Macroprudential tools are often explicitly applied to banks and are mostly implemented at the
national level. Examples of such tools are bank capital requirements, counterparty
concentration limits, interbank exposure limits, loan-to-value ratios, and reserve requirements.
The desired targets might be bank lending growth, the resilience of banks to shocks, or asset
markets that are deemed to be frothy or mispriced.

     The effectiveness of these tools is a key consideration. Analysis of early experiences with
macroprudential instruments shows that some tools can reduce banks’ asset growth within
countries (Claessens, Ghosh, and Mihet 2014). However, effectiveness may be weakened when
risky or excessive lending moves outside of the regulatory perimeter to non-covered entities or
activities (Bengui and Bianchi 2014; Aiyar, Calomiris, and Wieladek 2014; Reinhardt and
Sowerbutts 2015) or to other geographic regions (Houston, Lin, and Ma 2012).

     The international financial openness of countries and the global nature of financial
institutions present added challenges (Obstfeld 2014). 1 International spillovers through banks
matter for instrument effectiveness within a country’s borders and are relevant for the broader
issues of policy frameworks, externalities, reciprocity, and welfare. Yet, there is little systematic
evidence that establishes whether spillovers are common, important, and support or hinder the
attainment of policy goals. The gap in knowledge is particularly acute when it comes to evidence
drawn from and relevant for a broad range of countries. Providing this evidence on prudential
policy effects and international spillovers is the subject of this multi-study initiative of the
International Banking Research Network (IBRN). 2 15 country teams examine domestic effects
and international spillovers of prudential instruments using detailed confidential micro-banking
data. In addition, researchers from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and from the
European Central Bank (ECB) provide cross-country perspectives. The analyses focus on
evidence for international policy spillovers through multiple channels: Inward transmission

    The IBRN was founded in 2012 to analyze issues pertinent to internationally active banks. The current list of
    participating central banks and institutions is available at http://www.newyorkfed.org/IBRN/index.html. Most
    central bank teams have access to confidential bank-level data on domestic and cross-border banking activities.
    In a previous project, the IBRN analyzed the transmission of liquidity risk domestically and internationally
    through the activities of global banks, with a meta-analysis (Buch and Goldberg 2015) and eleven country
    studies published in the IMF Economic Review (November 2015).

addresses how foreign regulations affect the domestic activities of domestic banks or foreign
affiliates (bank branches or subsidiaries) located in the host country; Outward transmission to
foreign economies addresses the effects of foreign policies on the foreign activities of a
reporting country’s global banks. All country teams implement the same baseline regression
models for analyzing inward or outward transmission. In addition, country teams address issues
specific to their banking markets or banks’ business models. In some cases, teams differentiate
adjustment of lending by their global banks’ branches (which are subject to the capital
requirements of their parents) versus subsidiaries (which are, in addition, subject to regulations
in the host country).

    This paper provides an overview of the full initiative, including its methodological and
database contributions, and it presents a meta-analysis that generates key cross-country
results. By design, the empirical studies we summarize are very homogenous because all teams
used the same baseline regression model. Hence, publication biases that can affect meta-
analyses that draw on only published research are not an issue here. Also, largely due to data
availability, previous studies of international spillovers are more restricted as they consider
fewer or less precisely dated policy instruments or countries, or as they cannot account for
differences across banks or channels of policy transmission internationally. 3
    The IBRN has worked toward closing several gaps that have limited prior analyses. The IBRN
provides cross-country evidence on regulatory spillovers using the same methodological
framework and consistent data – both bank-specific and in terms of prudential instruments –
across countries. As researchers apply a common research methodology, the IBRN’s broadly
relevant insights go well beyond the single-country case studies. In order to identify effects of
prudential policies, the project uses micro-data, and it exploits variation in prudential
instruments across countries, bank balance sheet characteristics, and the location of foreign
affiliates. Micro-data help in solving the identification problem which beleaguers impact
assessment studies based on aggregate data. Identification using heterogeneity and in the
international context is greatly aided by the degree of granularity of the data involved. To
facilitate results which are comparable across countries, the IBRN and International Monetary
Fund (IMF) developed a new database that contains more precise measures of prudential
regulation than were available to prior researchers. Described in Cerutti, Correa, Fiorentino, and
Segalla (2015), the quarterly database spans 64 countries and the period from 2000 to 2014.



3
    Most available studies cover the domestic consequences of domestic prudential policies. Examples include
    Bruno and Shin (2014), IMF (2011), Jiménez et al (2012) and Vandenbussche et al. (2015).


                                                          2
The instruments covered include different types of prudential regulations: capital requirements,
concentration limits, interbank exposure limits, loan-to-value ratio limits, and changes in
reserve requirements. 4

    Based on the meta-analysis of 15 country studies and the findings of 2 cross country studies,
here we highlight three key observations about prudential spillovers that are immediately of
interest from analytical and policy perspectives.

    First, some countries observe that prudential instruments spill over internationally and
through banks via lending growth. Specifications that focus on international spillovers along the
intensive margin and over a time horizon of several quarters detect significant international
spillovers in about a third of the specifications. The baseline specifications provide a lower
bound of regulatory spillover effects. As the analyses exclude large bank-specific outliers, they
do not capture potentially large adjustments along the extensive margin, representing entry and
withdrawal of banks from foreign markets. Moreover, as the meta-analysis summarizes results
from a common empirical approach imposed across countries, the identified spillovers also
exclude other potentially important country- and sector-specific dynamics that individual
country analyses document.

   Second, heterogeneity in spillovers through lending is common. This heterogeneity is at the
bank-level, where prudential instrument effects on lending can each differ with the balance
sheet characteristics and business models of the banks participating in international lending. For
example, foreign affiliates with higher illiquid asset shares and with stronger reliance on deposit
funding tend to have loan growth that responds more to loan-to-value ratio limits and sector-
specific capital buffer changes in the foreign parent location. Degrees of internal liquidity
management via internal capital markets can matter too, significantly differentiating across
these hosted affiliates in terms of how general capital requirements imposed in the parent’s
country spill over into lending in the host market. These same characteristics do not appear to
be as important for the inward transmission of foreign policies into the domestic lending of
global banks.




4
    To construct this database, the IBRN and IMF collaboratively worked with regulatory sources in the individual
    countries, and extended and utilized the Global Macro Prudential Instruments (GMPI) survey which the IMF
    conducted in 2013. Note that stress tests, which may give incentives for banks to adjust their foreign exposures,
    are not covered in this project. Changes in reserve requirements are included as they are sometimes used
    explicitly by countries for prudential purposes, instead of as monetary policy instruments.


                                                            3
    Cyclical considerations do not appear as important for the spillovers of regulations to
international lending activity. Most countries do not find strong evidence that international
spillovers of prudential policy differ across the business or financial cycle.

    Third, the economic magnitudes of international spillovers of policy thus far have not been
large on average. However, the pattern of results highlights the potential for larger and more
consequential spillovers as the use of macroprudential instruments increases. Changes in capital
requirements, for instance, have largely been implemented in many countries during similar
time frames, potentially limiting some of the first mover advantages for countries that had
banks with higher initial capital ratios. Even with this limitation, in some cases, banks with
higher initial capital were poised to increase lending internationally, sometimes pivoting from
domestic loan growth, when foreign countries tightened their capital requirements. Changes in
some prudential instruments may thus spur market share repositioning across banks and
foreign countries.

    Overall, based on the evidence provided from a range of country experiences with
international spillovers of prudential instruments through bank lending growth, we conclude
that there is not a one-size-fits-all channel or even direction of transmission that dominates
spillovers. While most of the countries in the IBRN initiative are advanced economies, we do not
observe that results are systematically different between these countries and participating
emerging market countries. Simple arguments about regulatory arbitrage do not characterize
the diversity of experiences across countries. Almost all prudential instruments have been
associated with both positive and negative spillovers, within and across transmission channels.
The effects through specific banking institutions can depend on their balance sheet
characteristics and business models. All of these observations raise complex questions: How can
countries insulate themselves from international spillover?; Are there tradeoffs between micro-
and macroprudential policy?; What if the goals of macroprudential instruments are made more
difficult to attain if, at the same time, the microprudential conditions locally are changing with
the market share adjustments across domestic and foreign banks?; What might policy
reciprocity achieve?

   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related literature and conceptual arguments
are presented in Section 2, and hypothesis testing and empirical models are in Section 3. Data
are discussed in Section 4, with more detail in Appendix B. Key findings are in Section 5, both
through a meta-analysis study of the patterns of international spillovers identified in the
baseline empirical models explored by 15 countries and through highlighting the idiosyncratic
specifications run by countries. Section 6 provides a short summary of results.

2. Prudential Spillovers: What do we Know? What do we Expect?
The terms “regulatory arbitrage”, “leakages”, and “spillovers” are sometimes used
interchangeably. All three terms have been invoked to describe when regulations in one market
have consequences for other markets or other institutions. But spillovers do not necessarily
reflect regulatory arbitrage or policy leakages. Spillovers can occur as a natural response to
changing supply or demand for credit in particular locations and by particular institutions. As
spillovers have less of a loaded connotation than “leakages,” we use this language. In general,
we cannot identify whether banks adjust to regulations in an intentional way with the explicit
aim to circumvent regulation or whether policy is ineffective because global banks adjust their
international activities. In describing the prior literature and moving forward with the exposition
of the IBRN initiative we apply our broad definition to comprise the respective concepts. In
general we analyze the effects of particular policy instruments, for example loan to value ratios
or capital requirements, to inform the consequences of prudential policy.

2.1 Prior Empirical Studies

Previous empirical studies of prudential instrument effects either follow a cross-country
approach, for example using BIS International Banking Statistics combined with a cross-country
database on regulations, or focus on the effects of prudential instruments for a specific country.
Most studies focus on domestic effects of instruments within the country applying the
regulatory changes.

    Using detailed data on prudential instruments similar to that within the IBRN database,
other studies provide cross-country lessons for domestic macro-economic and financial sector
aggregates. A number of studies use aggregate credit data. IMF (2011) use a 2010 survey on the
use of macroprudential instruments for 49 countries and find that most macroprudential
instruments (DTI, LTV, dynamic provisioning, reserve requirements, and credit growth ceilings)
are effective at reducing the cyclicality of credit growth, but that this effectiveness is sensitive to
the type of shock considered. Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (2015) use data covering 2000-2013
of changes in macroprudential policy instruments affecting the housing market such as loan-to-
value ratios (LTVs) and debt-service-to-income (DTI) ratios. They find that overall real domestic
bank credit declines if prudential measures are tightened. Mortgage lending and house prices
are affected only by macroprudential instruments related to the housing market. Kuttner and
Shim (2013) find a similar result in that only DTI significantly affect housing credit growth.
Bruno, Shim, and Shin (2015) document the role of macroprudential policies and capital controls
in mitigating credit growth in 12 Asian economies.



                                                    5
    Cerutti et al. (2015) use the 2013 GMPI IMF survey to create a database of macroprudential
policy stances in 119 countries, and find that domestic credit growth in emerging markets is
weaker when prudential policy stances are more restrictive. They also find that macroprudential
instrument effects are weaker in countries which are more open, suggesting evidence of
leakages.

    Claessens et al. (2014) are the only authors to use bank data rather than aggregate credit.
They use annual data collected through an internal IMF survey of country desk economists and
a sample of banks in 35 countries over the years 2000 to 2010 and find that caps on certain
activities – and particularly measures aimed at borrowers – may have a stronger impact on
banks’ asset growth than general capital buffers. The effectiveness of these tools was not found
to vary by the intensity of the credit cycle.

    Several studies look at prudential policy leakages from the perspective of a specific country
and focus on domestic lending. Aiyar, Calomiris, and Wieladek (2014) focus on the leakages that
arise when an instrument covers domestic banks, but is not applied to the branches of foreign
banks operating in the domestic market. The study concludes that leakages weaken policy
effectiveness in the U.K. Aiyar, Calomiris, Hooley, Korniyenko and Wieladek (2014) exploit
exogenous changes in the capital ratios of U.K. banks to investigate whether these regulatory
shocks are transmitted abroad. As the regulatory changes were imposed at the unconsolidated
level, the authors argue that cross-border lending responds more than lending by affiliates
abroad.

    After the financial crisis, some global banks have retrenched from foreign markets. There is
hardly consistent cross-country evidence analyzing the drivers of this retrenchment. One
prudential policy database commonly used in previous studies and compiled by Barth, Caprio,
and Levine (2013) has indices constructed based on survey responses to reflect the broad stance
of regulation and supervision. The three-year survey intervals are not ideal for studies using
higher frequency data and focusing on the identification and assignment of effects to particular
instruments. Houston, Lin, and Ma (2012) use these data and find that banks lend more in
markets with fewer regulations when there is an effort by domestic regulators to limit bank risk-
taking. Bremus and Fratzscher (2015) combine these data with the BIS international banking
data and show that cross-border bank outflows appear to be driven by expansionary monetary
policies, with some flows mitigated by tighter regulation. Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015)
construct a database of macroprudential instruments for sixty countries and find that countries
increase aggregate borrowing from abroad after an increase in capital requirements but not
after an increase in lending standards, attributing these outcomes to the coverage of these
instruments. As we observe in our initiative and discuss in Section 5, some of the specific

                                                 6
dynamics in global bank reactions to policy instruments depend on their ex ante balance
conditions, which are not generally observable or used in studies of aggregate data.

2.2 Expected Effects of Specific Instruments

Previous work reviewed above provides a mixed picture of the effects of prudential
instruments. While most studies find a decline in domestic lending following a domestic
regulatory tightening, effects differ across banks, countries, and instruments. In terms of
international spillovers, no single theoretical model captures the range of possible international
transmission channels and bank-level responses to the different prudential policy instruments –
capital requirements, exposure limits, concentration limits, loan-to-value ratio limits, and
minimum reserve requirements – examined by teams participating in the IBRN initiative. Figure
1 details possible routes for inward and outward policy transmission, whether through global
banks directly or through their affiliates around the world.

    To illustrate the distinct channels of outward and inward policy transmission internationally,
consider a global bank from the United States (U.S.) which owns an affiliated bank in Germany
and another in the United Kingdom (U.K.). Suppose that the affiliate within Germany lends only
in that host country, while the U.K. affiliate lends both in the U.K. and elsewhere throughout
Europe. The global bank can move funds across both affiliates and its U.S. operations as part of
a consolidated operational strategy. The bank’s lending in Germany could depend on U.S.
regulations, German regulations, and on regulations in the U.K. If the U.K. implements a
prudential policy change and this influences U.S. bank lending in the U.K. and possibly Germany,
we refer to this adjustment as the outward transmission channel. 5 If the U.K. prudential policy
influences lending by the U.S. bank in its home (U.S.) market, this is an inward transmission
channel.

    As an example of expected effects consider the possible implications of capital requirements
in the domestic market. In the longer-term, higher capital requirements make bank lending less
cyclical, albeit at a marginally lower level. In the short-run, the costs of raising capital may be
high and banks at home may reduce the supply of credit if capital constraints become more
binding. This response should be related to bank-specific capital ratios and overall balance sheet
composition in terms of risks and funding structures. The response will also differ whether the
capital requirement is set at the consolidated level or whether it applies to a particular domestic
sector (SCR) – in which case there may be a relative price effect when lending abroad. Some


5
    Alternatively, there could be an outward reallocation between the U.K., Germany, and other foreign markets.


                                                          7
domestic banks may increase international activities by moving to less regulated markets if the
regulation does not bind or is not applied on a consolidated level. Alternatively, tighter
regulations may induce banks to lower their foreign market activities if their global balance
sheet constraints become more binding. How domestic banks are affected by regulatory policies
will thus depend not only on how the policy is applied but also on the strength of their balance
sheet and on their international business model. The response of foreign banks to the domestic
regulation can depend on their own relative capital position and profitability. For example, if the
foreign banks start out with a relatively strong capital position, they can be well situated to
expand lending in a location where the domestic banks have retracted loan supply due to
tighter standards. These foreign banks may respond differently if their affiliates in the domestic
market are subsidiaries that are subject to the tighter capital requirements, instead of affiliates
established as overseas branches which are not.

    The effects of tighter capital requirements may also change over time as banks can raise
additional external equity or retain profits. Any negative impact effect might thus be mitigated
over time, and capital requirements become less binding. Careful analysis of the timing of
effects is warranted. Capital regulations are more likely to bind when the cost of raising equity is
high, in other words at the bottom of the output and financial cycles, when profitable
opportunities are rare and capital markets are less exuberant. Another noteworthy feature of
changes in capital requirements is that many have been implemented following international
agreements. As such, their impact is likely to be more global than the effects of prudential
regulations for which there is more national discretion with regard to implementation. At the
same time, spillover effects might be more limited to the extent that changes in regulation are
coordinated internationally and applied at the consolidated level.

    Consider next the mechanisms for international spillovers from changes in loan-to-value
ratios which limit the amount of borrowing a debtor can have on a particular transaction as a
fraction of the underlying asset value. Use of these instruments is typically not coordinated
internationally. Such limits work on credit demand rather than credit supply, and studies such as
Claessens, Ghosh, and Mihet (2014) have concluded that these instruments may be most
impactful on credit outcomes. A priori, international spillovers may be weaker and banks-
specific characteristics, such as the degree of capitalization, may be less relevant for identifying
the effects of these instruments. If a foreign country changes LTV caps on mortgage lending,
there may be a limited inward spillover if domestic credit demand is unchanged. However, LTV
limits also limit the risk that a bank is able to take in its home market. Hence, banks affected by
the regulation might change the composition of their credit supply by substituting away from
mortgage lending at home toward lending into other sectors or internationally.

                                                   8
    Reserve requirements or interbank exposure limits are instruments which may induce
spillovers as these instruments serve as funding restrictions. 6 Generally, higher reserve
requirements make either domestic currency deposits or foreign currency deposits scarcer
depending on the specific application of this instrument. With higher reserve requirements in
place, the cost of funding rises. Banks cannot lever up this funding to the same degree as
previously, thus favoring other sources of funding. The return offered to depositors would be
lower, which may reduce funding and lending. Restrictions on interbank exposures can lead to
spillovers from or to banking systems and possibly have concentrated effects on banks that
depend more on interbank funding. For global banks, restrictions also may constrain the scale of
borrowing from related parties through internal capital markets, generating funding
reallocations.

    The IBRN analysis of international spillovers does not consider the reasons why policymakers
vary prudential instruments. Macroprudential policies differ in intent from microprudential
policies which aim at stabilizing individual financial institutions, differ from capital controls
which target the cross-border movement of capital, and differ from monetary policy which
targets a combination of macroeconomic goals such as low price inflation and full employment. 7
We focus on the prudential policy changes more broadly, regardless of whether stated as
explicitly macroprudential or microprudential. Changes in interbank exposure limits may be
triggered by microprudential concerns, whereas changes in LTV caps typically aim at preventing
an overheating of the housing market and thus have a macroprudential motivation. For
example, a prudential policy instrument like exposure limits applied to banks is intended to
reduce risks due to the concentration of lending on the balance sheets of the targeted
institutions. This policy may be effective at achieving those goals for domestic entities, while at
the same time other foreign institutions pick up the customers squeezed from those institutions
for which the exposure limits bind. If the intent of policy was microprudential, such a
redistribution of activity may be the desired outcome: demand for credit is satisfied by
reallocating borrowers to institutions with stronger capital ratios and more liquid assets which
may have more capacity to safely engage in domestic lending. However, if the policy was
implemented for macroprudential reasons, the spillover might be less desirable and can be



6
    Policymakers may tighten reserve requirements in order to dampen credit growth and thus have an (implicit or
    explicit) financial stability goal in mind. This may by the case, for example, if the legal basis for the use of other
    macroprudential instruments is inadequate or if the institutional mechanisms to activate those instruments are
    comparatively restrictive.

interpreted as leakages that undermine the intent of the original policy. Likewise, if exposure
limits constrain lending to particular domestic counterparts, institutions might shift activity to
other economies or those counterparties unconstrained by the exposure limits. Such spillovers
may not be attempts to circumvent regulation or even leakages, but instead are a result of an
intended reallocation of bank activities.


3. Hypothesis Testing and Empirical Models
Fifteen IBRN country teams, as well as cross-country studies conducted by the BIS and ECB,
examine whether bank lending responds to changes in prudential regulation, and whether these
responses are shaped by characteristics of the banks or the state of the financial cycle. 8 For both
dimensions – the lending response and the prudential instruments – we consider the home and
the foreign markets. From Figure 1, we consider four types of banks for each country pair ij:
Domestic banks in i that operate in i and not in j (but may lend cross border); domestic banks in
i that have affiliates in j; banks headquartered in j that have affiliates in i; and banks that
operate in j and i but headquartered in k. While the specific features of the data in the inward
and outward transmission exercises determine some modelling choices, a number of
specification features pertain to all models. In the methodological discussion we focus
specifically on the common empirical methods applied by country.

3.1 General Specification Features
3.1.1 Dependent Variables

Bank lending as the key transmission channel running from banks to the real economy is the
dependent variable. Using changes in loans as the dependent variable has the added advantage
that loan data are readily available and relatively comparable across banks and countries. These
data will be considered in comparable baseline specifications implemented by all country
teams. The observations on the loan data accord with the perspective of the specification

    The studies included in this IBRN initiative on the impact of prudential instrument changes on the activities of
    global banks include: Auer, Ganarin, and Towbin (2016) for Switzerland; Avdjiev, Koch, Mcguire, and von

studied by the researcher, so may represent domestic loans, cross-border loans, or local claims.
If available, in their respective additional analysis some country teams have also used claims and
more refined sectoral breakdowns of loans. 9

    Because we are interested in the responses of lending to changes in prudential instruments,
the baseline model uses log changes in stocks as the dependent variable. 10 The advantage of
using log changes is that the data are smoothed while conserving the ranking of the values. This
approach implies that changes in prudential instruments may have temporary growth effects
rather than permanent level effects, following the approach of Henry (2007) for changes in
capital controls.

3.1.2 Prudential Instruments and Specifications

Prudential instruments could be introduced into the empirical specification simultaneously or
individually, with lags, and as levels or in changes. Some instrument changes might have been
implemented simultaneously, making it difficult to attribute possible effects to a specific
instrument. Also, prudential instruments target different balance sheet items of banks and
operate through different transmission channels. In the baseline model, instruments are
included in separate specifications and in one additional specification that simultaneously
includes all instruments. Moreover, teams examine spillovers using an index PruC that captures
the change of any regulation and which is conceptually more comparable to the approach in
studies that utilized the lower frequency (3-year survey) data of Barth, Caprio, and Levine.

     The international dimension of prudential regulations is captured in four ways (Figure 1):
•    Home (i.e. parent bank) country regulation (𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻jt ): The home country is the country of
     the parent bank. For the outward transmission exercise, the home country is the country
     that conducts the study. Typically, regulation in the home country does not vary across
     banks. For the inward transmission case, the home country may vary across banks if the
     IBRN country hosts affiliates of foreign banks.
•    Destination country regulation (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷jt ): The destination country is the economy to which a
     loan has been granted. This is mainly relevant for the outward transmission case. This




9
     These data have been used in many previous studies. For details, see the International Banking Library, hosted
     at the Halle Institute for Economic Research (http://www.bankinglibrary.com).
10
     In Appendix B, we describe the common methodology used for dealing with outliers. In addition, log changes of
     stocks do not inform about changes in loans relative to banks’ balance sheets. Country teams thus use different
     scaling options in robustness exercises.


                                                           11
     economy does not need to be the host country of the bank because cross-border loans are
     considered as well, and those might be granted to third countries.
•    Host country regulation (𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻jt ): The host country is the country where the affiliate of a
     bank is hosted. This is relevant mainly for the inward transmission case. In this case, the host
     country is the IBRN country that conducts the study. Recall that the destination and the host
     country might be different. In our previous example, a U.S. global bank owns a U.K. affiliate
     that lends to France and Germany. In this case, U.S. is the home, U.K. is the host country,
     and France is the destination country.
•    Foreign exposure weighted regulation (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸bt ): Banks can be subject to regulations in
     several countries, and teams create a composite measure of such regulations. In the
     outward transmission through global banks exercise, teams weight regulations with the
     foreign exposures outside the home country and destination countries.11 For the inward
     transmission case, domestic global banks that are active in several foreign countries are
     exposed to the regulations of those countries. Teams weight regulations with the bank-
     specific foreign exposures outside the home country. The exposure weights are based on
     exposures over the previous four quarters. They are calculated based on the sum of foreign
     assets (on an immediate borrower basis) and liabilities in a given market.12
The spillover effects of prudential policy should depend on whether policies are applied at a
consolidated or unconsolidated level. Most of the home prudential policies apply to the
consolidated entity, to domestic parents and their foreign branches (consolidated or
unconsolidated). Foreign bank subsidiaries are generally subject to host-country regulations.
Regarding the foreign affiliates in the home country, the same logic applies. The spillover effects
also depend on the type of regulation. For example, capital regulation is likely applied on a
consolidated basis to domestic banks and to the domestic subsidiaries of foreign banks. Other
instruments, including reserve requirements, may only apply to specific entities within the
organization. Moreover, sectoral capital requirements likely will be country-specific.

   Tests for Inward spillovers of foreign policy instruments take two broad formats, depending
on whether through global bank foreign exposures or through hosted affiliates of foreign banks.


11
     These exposure weighted prudential instruments share some similarities with price indices in Melitz-type
     models (Melitz 2003), although we do not derive the indices from an explicit optimization problem. Note that
     the weights can be considered exogenous as long as the patterns of banks’ international activities are
     sufficiently persistent and do not vary at the same frequency as the prudential instruments.
12
     This summing of assets and liabilities follows the international trade and finance literature, in which openness
     to foreign trade is often measured through the sum of exports and imports (Leamer 1988). In some country
     cases, data availability constraints necessitate using variants of the recommended weighting approach.


                                                             12
Tests of Outward spillovers of foreign policy instruments consider how global banks adjust total
positions externally or how these global banks reallocate activity across foreign locations.
   Formally, log changes in the stock of (domestic) loans (∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 ) are linked to prudential
changes, bank-level controls (𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ), as well as bank- and time fixed effects (𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 , 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 ):

∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + (𝛼𝛼1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ) + 𝑎𝑎4 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + ( 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ∙
          𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ) + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡                                                 (1)

where 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 is a policy measure appropriate for the international transmission exercise
conducted. Time fixed effects capture changes in prudential instruments on the home market.
Multiplying our interaction coefficients by the mean values of the corresponding balance sheet
variables (𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1), the F-test ∑3𝑖𝑖=1 �𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 � = 0 considers whether the cumulative
impact of regulations on lending growth over a time horizon of three quarters is statistically
significant for the average bank.

    An additional specification examined by teams allows for the effect of the foreign prudential
instrument to vary over the home financial or business cycle. The resulting specification is

      ∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡       (2)

where 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 is the credit-to-GDP or output gap in the home market. In order to measure the effect
of the financial cycle, we use a cumulative regulatory measure (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ). Using mean values
of our cycle variables (𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡), prudential instrument net effects on lending growth for the average
bank are analogously defined as (𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼3 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ) with a corresponding F-test of significance.
Additional baseline specifications do not include interaction terms or include multiple
prudential instruments simultaneously. A comprehensive discussion of the specific international
transmission test and regression specifications is provided in Appendix A.

3.1.3 Identification

Identification of causal effects of policy instruments is helped by the use of micro- or bank-level
data. The project exploits the joint effects of two features of the data to facilitate identifying
effects of policy instruments.

    This first identification feature is that prudential instrument changes are considered
exogenous for the individual bank behavior, as opposed to aggregate credit measures, and in a
cross-country environment. In this sense, our models take a partial equilibrium perspective:
decisions on changes in prudential instruments are assumed to not be driven by the specific
individual banks. But assuming this exogeneity is not sufficient. If all banks in the same country

                                                                     13
were to face the same prudential instrument changes, then instrument changes and common
shocks could not be identified separately. Prudential variables would thus be tantamount to
country-time effects. Our identification strategy depends on differences in prudential
instruments affecting banks domiciled in the same country. These differences arise when banks
are active in different countries and have heterogeneous exposures.

   The second feature is that business models of banks are heterogeneous so that banks are
expected to respond to the same policy measure in different ways. Some banks conduct cross-
border activities, others maintain branches and subsidiaries, and borrowing and lending
patterns are differently concentrated across countries. Adjustment along the extensive margin,
with exit and entry from locations, is assumed to take place with a much lower frequency than
changes in the lending and prudential policies.
3.1.4 Other Specification Issues

Whenever appropriate, country teams include within empirical specifications bank-, country-,
and time-fixed effects to account for time-invariant heterogeneity at the bank- and country-
level as well as common shocks affecting all banks in period t. As in Khwaja and Mian (2008),
demand effects in country 𝑗𝑗 can be captured by introducing borrower-time fixed effects to
account for changes in credit demand.13 While in the baseline specification clustering of
residuals by country has been used, country teams have been advised to cluster as appropriate.


4. Data and Descriptive Statistics
Section 4.1 provides a high-level overview of the patterns of use and changes in prudential
instruments over time and across countries included in the IBRN Prudential Instruments
Database. Section 4.2 introduces the specifics of the bank-level balance sheet data examined by
country teams. Section 4.3 provides details on the other variables used in the specifications,
including credit cycles, output gaps, and country characteristics.

4.1 Prudential Data

The IBRN and the IMF collaboration, the Prudential Instruments Database, includes rich
quarterly information on the announcement and implementation of policy changes for 2000
through 2014 for 64 countries, as described in in Cerutti, Correa, Fiorentino, and Segalla (2015).



13
     Some papers follow a similar route but include country-time fixed effects instead. In this case, the country-level
     regulatory measure can be included in the interaction terms only.


                                                             14
Seven prudential and regulatory instruments are included: general capital requirements, sector
specific capital requirements (split into real estate credit, consumer credit, and other), interbank
exposure limits, concentration limits, loan-to-value ratio limits, and reserve requirements (in
local and in foreign currency). 14 Generally, we do not explicitly distinguish whether prudential
instruments have been activated for micro- or macroprudential reasons because the channels
for generating cross-border spillovers are similar, regardless of the reason for instrument use.

    For a tightening (loosening) of an instrument, the index is coded as 1 (-1) in the quarter
when a change in the policy takes effect.15 Indices are presented in two ways. The first type of
index records the changes in each quarter when a policy is modified, with a zero in those
quarters when no change occurs. The second type of index is a cumulative index. In each
quarter, the index is the sum, since the first quarter of 2000, of all changes in that policy
instrument recorded prior to and during the quarter of interest. The purpose of this cumulative
index is to capture the level of overall “tightness” change of an instrument at a given point in
time. If a particular instrument has never been introduced in a given country, the raw data are
set to zero. While some of the prudential instruments have information on the overall level
(tightness), this information is not used in the analysis of the IBRN initiative because of
difficulties of constructing useful metrics similarly defined across countries and over time.

    Table 1 provides insights into the variation observed in the full database, by prudential
instrument, for the years 2000 through 2014. The table provides counts of the number of
countries that report a change in each instrument, the number of overall changes in the
instrument, and the breakdown between tightening (>0) and loosening (<0) events. The left
panel of the table provides this information across all 64 countries in the database out of a total
of 3,840 country-time observations; the right panel shows incidence across six countries –
Germany, France, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States – that have a number
of large globally active banks. These countries are highlighted for their potential importance in
generating international spillovers through prudential instrument changes.

                                                   (Table 1 here)


14
     Information on capital controls is not included in the regulatory dataset. This information currently is not
     available on a quarterly basis, as in Schindler (2009) and follow up studies using the IMF’s Annual Report on
     Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. In the IBRN studies, differences in capital controls across
     countries or variations over time are assumed to be absorbed in the country and time fixed effects.
15
     For some indexes, changes in a given quarter may be greater (lower) than 1 to account for the intensity in the
     change of the instrument that the index is capturing. For example, if a change in the reserve requirement in a
     quarter is double the change in the next quarter, this would be captured by a coding of 2 in the index for the
     first quarter and 1 in the second.


                                                            15
   Changes in general capital requirements and reserve requirements have been more relevant
compared with changes in other instruments. For example, interbank exposure limits have been
changed less frequently. In the right panel, only general capital requirements are well populated
across these six countries and with multiple events; two countries changed reserve
requirements on local currency deposits and two countries changed interbank exposure limits.

    Time series variation in instruments also is important for the econometric exercise, since the
instrument effects need to be separated from the time fixed effects used to control for omitted
variables such as changes in aggregate demand. Instruments that have changes well distributed
over time include concentration limits, loan-to-value ratios, reserve requirements, and sector-
specific capital requirements. Capital requirement changes are concentrated over time.
Nonetheless, although international agreements such as Basel II or Basel III set a common
framework for these regulations, there is still a sufficiently high degree of variability with regard
to the implementation and activation of instruments across countries to perform meaningful
analyses. 16

4.2 Balance Sheet Data for Banks

The data used by country teams is collected as part of financial supervision and regulatory
reporting, with banks in each country providing confidential quarterly balance sheet data and
data on international positions. The choice of bank-level characteristics in baseline empirical
specifications is guided both by theoretical priors on which balance sheet and bank
characteristics might matter for international transmission and by data availability.
        The baseline specification’s dependent variable (𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 ) is based on total loan data for the
reporting bank or global bank affiliate as relevant for the international spillover examined. The
balance sheet characteristics (𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ) included as explanatory variables capture the structure of
banks’ assets and liabilities, their profitability, and their degree of internationalization. Bank size
is the log of total assets (𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ); liquidity is measured as the fraction of a bank’s
portfolio of assets that is illiquid (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ); the deposit ratio is the fraction of the
banking organization’s balance sheet financed with core deposits (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ); and the
capital ratio is the banking organization’s regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital to asset ratio
(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇1𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ). 17 The bank’s degree of internationalization is generally measured through the

     See Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013) for an overview of the timing of implementation of financial regulations across
     European countries.
17
     Ratios are in percent (multiplied by 100). Some country teams use the balance sheet ratio of equity over total
     assets instead of regulatory Tier1 capital.


                                                               16
difference between “net due to” and “net due from” of the Head Office as a measure of internal
capital market positions of the entity, relative to assets (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ), and by foreign assets
plus foreign liabilities, relative to total assets plus total liabilities (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ).
More detailed information regarding data preparation, including variable definitions and
cleaning procedures, may be found in Appendix B.

4.3 Credit Cycles, Output Gaps, and other Country Characteristics
To test for potential differences in prudential instrument effects over the (aggregate) credit
cycle, some specifications include credit-to-GDP gap data. As in Drehmann, Borio, and
Tsatsaronis (2011), the credit-to-GDP gap is defined as the difference of credit-to-GDP from its
long-run trend in percentage points. 18 The credit component draws on total credit to the non-
financial private sector available at the BIS. 19 If total credit is not available, data on domestic
credit are taken from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. Financial cycles for the home
country are included in the inward transmission models, and financial cycles for the host
country are included in the outward transmission models. In addition, some specifications use
domestic credit growth by country, with the time series on credit to the private non-financial
sector available for a broader group of countries than the credit data, or output gap measures
constructed following BIS methods (BIS 2014).


5. Do Prudential Policies Affect International Bank Lending?
Fifteen country teams studied a combination of inward and outward transmission exercises.
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 summarize results only from the baseline models for inward and outward
transmission implemented by countries. Individual country papers provide more detailed and
nuanced analyses of inward and outward prudential policy transmission through bank lending.
Cross-country analyses conducted by the BIS and ECB provide additional insights.




18
     Prior studies show that financial cycles can be key indicators of emerging risks (Borio 2012; Claessens et al.
     2011). As such, cyclical developments may ultimately be triggers for macroprudential policies such as the
     counter-cyclical capital buffer.
19
     This long-run time trend in turn is calculated with a one-sided HP filter using a smoothing factor of 400,000.
     Data by country are available as the BIS’ long series on credit to the private non-financial sector:
     http://www.bis.org/statistics/credtopriv.htm, http://www.bis.org/statistics/credtopriv/documentation.pdf.


                                                             17
5.1 Which Transmission Channels and Instruments have been Analyzed?

The international spillover exercises explored by the country teams are summarized in Table 2.
Eleven of the fifteen countries study inward transmission of foreign prudential policy changes.
Eight countries explore inward transmission through their own global banks that maintain
foreign operations. Ten countries consider transmission into their country through the
operations of the affiliates of hosted foreign banks. The next column shows that six of the
fifteen countries study external adjustments in lending by their own global banks, i.e. the
outward transmission channel. Among these, most specifications address the effects of foreign
prudential policies on the external lending of global banks. A smaller number of specifications
explore foreign lending reallocation through global banks via cross-border flows and foreign
affiliates. As country teams focus only on those prudential instruments that show sufficient
variation and on specific transmission channels, the total number of empirical specifications by
channel thus differs across countries.

                                                (Table 2 here)

5.2 Meta-Analysis of the 15 Country Studies

We perform a meta-analysis to extract relevant and robust lessons on international spillovers
from the 15 country studies. Meta-analyses summarize the key outcomes of empirical exercises,
and then explore which features of an empirical model are drivers of different empirical
outcomes. A strength of the approach is that the empirical studies we summarize are designed
to be homogenous, by using the same baseline regression model and variable definitions.
Moreover, by summarizing the results of all the analyses, we are not subject to criticisms of
publication biases that can affect meta-analyses that draw on only published research. By
design, as we seek robust lessons on international spillovers we use conservative criteria for
significance.

     Our measure of statistical significance is the 10 percent significance of the summed effect on
lending growth over linear combinations of all regression terms that include each specific
prudential instrument. For example, in exercises that introduce prudential instrument
interactions with bank-balance sheet characteristics, the relevant test result reported is over
∑3𝑖𝑖=1(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ) and (𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ), which utilizes the mean level of each balance
sheet characteristic for the banking entities in each regression sample. In specifications in which
there are interactions of the prudential instrument with business or financial cycles, the
relevant metric for an effect on lending growth is the test result over the sum (𝛼𝛼1 +
𝛼𝛼3 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡) or (𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼4 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ). This type of test requiring the summed net effect of a prudential
measure on lending is a more conservative threshold for significance compared with a test of

                                                      18
statistical significance at any single quarter. As a conservative threshold, the exercise will tend
to provide a lower bound on the incidence of international spillovers of prudential policies
through bank lending. As exposited within the country papers, teams frequently observe
statistically significant international spillovers when not netting over three quarters.

    Table 3 shows the number of regression specifications and number of countries by
prudential instrument and exercise that are used in the meta-analysis. The largest numbers of
regression specifications across the collection of studies are for inward transmission of home
prudential policies into host markets through hosted affiliates of global banks. Ten countries
explore the spillover effects of changes in general capital requirements, sector specific capital
buffers, loan-to-value ratios, and local reserve requirements. Fewer countries examine inward
spillovers through hosted bank affiliates of the changes in foreign reserve requirements,
interbank exposure limits, or concentration ratios. Eight countries examine inward transmission
of foreign policies through the exposures of their own global banks. Six countries examine how
their global banks reallocate lending internationally when foreign affiliate locations have
changes in respective prudential instruments.

                                             (Table 3 here)

5.2.1 What is the Direction of Prudential Instrument Spillovers Through Global Banks?

Table 4 considers the sign pattern of significant international spillovers, showing – by specific
prudential instrument (rows) and by transmission channel – the share of empirical specifications
that register: statistically insignificant spillovers (column a), positively signed significant
spillovers (column b), and negatively signed significant spillovers (column c). “Positive” spillovers
indicate that a tightening of a prudential measure in one location is associated with an increase
in lending growth in another location. As baseline studies do not consider asymmetric effects of
prudential policy tightening or loosening, the discussion of results assumes symmetry in
spillovers even as the actual language of our discussion refers to tightening.

                                           (Table 4 here)

    Examination of Table 4 shows that the majority of these baseline regression specifications
do not exhibit statistically significant international spillovers of prudential instruments. For
example, when foreign general capital requirements are adjusted, the domestic lending of
home global banks with affiliates in foreign locations does not significantly change in 75 percent
of the specifications examined across country teams. However, significant international




                                                   19
spillovers of this instrument are still often observed. 20 In 25 percent of the specifications
covering home global banks, when foreign capital requirements tighten these banks significantly
increase domestic lending growth in 19 percent of cases (column b) and reduce domestic loan
growth in the remaining 6 percent of cases (column c). Similar patterns are observed in the
outward spillovers of these policies.

   The last columns of Table 4 show that global banks reallocate lending externally when local
reserve requirements change. Foreign reserve requirement tightening on local deposits is more
often associated with global bank expansion of lending growth abroad than with lending growth
contractions. While the literature reviewed in Section 2.1 tended to find that lending declines
when regulations tighten, this evidence drawn from a broad sample of countries using micro-
banking data shows a mixed pattern of responses to most policy instruments. Interestingly, the
columns summarizing inward transmission of policy through hosted affiliates of foreign banks
show that general capital requirements are least likely to be associated with significant inward
lending transmission, while home reserve requirements, LTV caps, and concentration limits
have significant spillovers into host loan growth in one quarter to one third of the regression
specifications.

    Table 5 complements these results by showing which countries’ experiences drive the
patterns of significant instrument spillovers just described. When foreign countries tightened
general capital requirements, positive spillovers to home loan growth by global banks were
observed across U.S., German, and Chilean banks, while German global banks had significantly
reduced loan growth outwardly and US global banks had mixed directional effects depending on
the regression specification. Negative inward spillovers were observed for U.K. and Swiss global
banks. The German global banks also expanded home loan growth when foreign loan-to-value
limits tightened, without significant outward transmission from the LTV ratios. Tighter local
reserve requirements influenced outward transmission by global banks in in all of the countries
which studied this channel. Global banks from Canada, France, Italy and the Netherlands
increased lending growth externally, while U.S. and German banks contracted loan growth
abroad without increasing loan growth back home. This directional heterogeneity, with the
incidence differing across instruments and transmission channels, is important for
understanding the intended and unintended effects for a range of prudential instruments.

                                                        (Table 5 here)


20
     This significance is beyond the level that likely could be attributed to Type I errors: under the hypothesis of “no
      spillovers” about 10 percent of specifications are expected to be significant at the 10 percent level.


                                                               20
    All country teams tested to see whether bank-level balance sheet characteristics were
important drivers of identified heterogeneity in the international spillovers through the
respective channels. Table 6 summarizes which countries identified a significant role for
particular balance sheet characteristics. In inward transmission of general capital requirements
by global banks into domestic loan growth, core deposit ratios of banks were important for four
countries; net due ratios and Tier 1 capital ratios were important features in transmission
through hosted affiliates of foreign banks. Within a country, heterogeneity in loan growth
spillovers from the loan-to-value ratio changes in the home countries of hosted foreign bank
were often associated with bank-specific illiquid asset ratios, asset size and core deposit ratios.
Tier 1 capital ratios also differentiated global banks in the spillover of exposure-weighted
reserve requirements on foreign deposits and concentration ratios into domestic lending
growth. Overall, these findings are consistent with the prior that a tightening of prudential
regulations induces a reallocation of market shares away from weaker banks towards banks
with stronger balance sheets. Changes of prudential instruments therefore are observed to have
influence on the global pattern of international lending, with potential implications for
competition, bank-level risk, and financial stability.

5.2.2 Which Specification Features Drive the Likelihood of Observing International Spillovers?

As a complement to these summary tables, we perform a formal meta-analysis using Probit
regressions to explore which spillover regression features and data sample characteristics are
associated with a higher or lower likelihood of significant international spillovers for each
prudential instrument. These Probit regressions consider whether the likelihood of identifying a
significant spillover varies across advanced and emerging markets, 21 across the type of
prudential transmission exercise (inward spillovers through hosted affiliates versus through
global banks, versus outward through global banks), across specifications that: include only
recent changes in prudential instruments versus including cumulative changes; or across
transmission specifications that include versus exclude bank-specific balance sheet
characteristics, that control for financial and business cycles, or that simultaneously introduce
the effects of multiple prudential instruments.22 The dummy variable is PP*bank for models


21
     An emerging market dummy captures potential differences in spillovers between emerging market and
     advanced economies, although emerging markets only explored inward transmission exercises.
22
     A dummy indicating whether all prudential instruments are included in the specification simultaneously, versus
     one at a time, is potentially important as the simultaneous instrument specifications reduce the degrees of


                                                           21
with interactions between the prudential policy instrument and bank-specific balance sheet
characteristics, and PP*cycle for models with interactions with cycle indicators and including
cumulative policy changes. Finally, the specifications include a continuous variable reflecting the
percent of instrument changes that represent tightenings as opposed to loosenings; and include
the share of foreign banks in the banking system studied, which may matter for the aggregated
transmission of spillovers through foreign banks and for market share considerations. The
dummy variables are further described in Appendix B.2.

    Each row of Table 7 represents an individual Probit regression.23 Three Probit regressions
are presented for each prudential instrument. The “all” row has the dependent variable take the
value of 1 if a specification reported by a country team indicates a statistically significant
international spillover of the prudential instrument, where significance is defined as summed
over three quarters and at the 10 percent level. The “positive” row keeps a value of 1 only if the
prudential instrument tightening is associated with spillovers of stronger loan growth externally.
The “negative” row explores whether prudential instrument tightening is associated with
reduced international loan growth. The columns of the table show the roles of the respective
specification or country characteristics in differentiating the probability of significance relative
to the base case of the Probit. The base case is the probability of a significant effect of the
prudential instrument on lending growth for an advanced economy through hosted affiliates of
foreign banks, in a specification that includes only one prudential instrument and without cycle
or bank-characteristic interactions. The rightmost columns of Table 7 provide the total number
of regression observations by instrument and the Pseudo R² of the specification. The Pseudo R²
indicates the relative power of the full group of right-hand side variables in describing the
pattern of observed significant spillovers of the respective prudential instruments into lending.

                                                     (Table 7 here)

    From Table 7, observe that countries classified as emerging markets (Mexico, Poland, Chile,
Turkey) have a lower probability of significant inward transmission of foreign prudential policies,
except for inward spillovers of interbank exposure limits and concentration ratios where the


     freedom in the regressions and may raise the difficult of identifying a significant set of regression coefficients.
     However, such specifications avoid omitted variable bias that might occur when prudential instruments are
     changed by a country at the same time, potentially causing a single instrument to mistakenly pick up the effect
     of another instrument not included.
23
     While Table 7 compares Probits on any significance versus by sign of significance, other Probits have been
     explored using different weighting approaches applied to regression observations (for example country weights,
     banking system size weights). Results are available on request.


                                                              22
probability is higher. For these latter two instruments, inward transmission through hosted
foreign affiliates is more likely to be associated with spillovers compared with through global
banks. The columns for inward transmission through global banks and for outward transmission
together show that the probability of tighter general capital requirements being associated with
higher international lending growth is greater for global banks compared with through hosted
foreign affiliates. Global banks are more likely to be associated with declines in loan growth
internationally from foreign tightening of loan-to-value limits and concentration ratio limits.

     The table column for the PP*cycle indicator shows that this variable is usually insignificant
or significant and negative in sign. The interpretation of this finding is that country teams did
not have a higher probability of finding significant international spillovers in specifications that
consider cumulative tightening or loosening of instruments, or in which these effects were
interacted with the state of the financial cycle or business cycle. This is an interesting result, as
prudential limits might be expected to bind more and spillover to a greater degree at times
when the banks are more extended through the financial cycle. Of course, as the sample period
of the underlying analysis in general was short (2000 through 2014), increased experience with
prudential instruments over multiple cycles would make this observation more robust.

     The table column for the PP*bank indicator considers whether the specifications that
include interactions between prudential measures and bank-specific balance sheet
characteristics have higher or lower probability of finding significant international spillovers.
While it was observed (Table 6) that bank-specific balance sheet characteristics are important in
the cross-sectional responses of banks to prudential instrument changes, in general such
characteristics did not raise the probability of finding international spillovers. This inclusion
reduces the degrees of freedom in the regressions and may raise the difficulty of identifying a
significant set of regression coefficients, possibly explaining some of the negative coefficients
observed in the associated column within Table 7. The specifications that simultaneously
include all prudential instruments, indicated by All PP, likewise can reduce the degrees of
freedom in the regressions while helping identify the role of a particular instrument, especially
when other instruments have also been changing and could elicit the international spillovers.
This type of specification increases the probability of finding significant spillovers from
concentration ratios, and lowers the probability of some of the specific directional findings from
other instruments.

     Finally, the Probits consider whether those regression specifications that had more
unidirectional changes in direction for an instrument were more likely to be able to identify the
international spillovers from that instrument. This finding is supported in the case of general
and sector-specific capital requirements, and for foreign reserve requirements. Foreign

                                                   23
ownership share in the local banking system, the last column of the table, did not systematically
change the direction or likelihood of spillovers in some robust way across all prudential
instruments.

5.3 What Other Broad Observations Arise from the IBRN Studies?

So far, we have summarized results from the baseline regression that were designed for
maximal comparability across countries and the meta-analysis. These key findings are set
against a high threshold for identifying consistent effects across transmission exercises. The
common baseline model did not consider the specificities that were clearly identified in more
idiosyncratic explorations present in the broader range of country studies of the full IBRN
iniative. Beyond these baselines, individual country papers and cross-country papers (without
micro-banking data) provide more in depth and nuanced analyses that generate additional
insights on international spillovers of prudential instruments. While the reader is referred to
those studies, here we highlight examples of some additional findings from across those papers.
    Two countries – Germany and the U.S. – analyze both inward and outward transmission of
prudential policies through loan growth of global banks, and contrast inward transmission
through domestic global banks and hosted foreign affiliates (Berrospide, Correa, Goldberg, and
Niepmann 2016; Ohls, Pramor, and Tonzer 2016). When foreign capital requirements tightened,
in both cases global banks expanded loan growth at home. German global banks tended to
contract loan growth externally, while U.S. bank directions of outward transmission depended
on the regression specifications studied. Interestingly, neither the U.S. nor Germany
experienced significant changes in domestic lending by their hosted affiliates of related foreign
banks when parent country capital requirements tightened. Global banks from both countries
contracted foreign loan growth in localities that raised local reserve requirements, while not
changing lending back at home. Foreign changes in loan to value ratios and concentrations
ratios did not lead to significant outward retrenchment in loan growth by the respective global
banks.

    A few of the country studies suggest that market share repositioning across global and
domestic banks may be a significant implication of prudential instruments changes. The
outward transmission channel analyzed by Canada, France, Italy, and the Netherlands confirms
a positive prudential spillover effect: as prudential instruments tightened, foreign lending
growth tended to increase (Bussière, Schmidt, and Vinas 2016; Caccavaio, Carpinelli, and
Marinelli 2016; Damar and Mordel 2016; Frost, de Haan, and van Horen 2016). This finding is
consistent with foreign banks acquiring market share during a country’s tightening episode,
either because they are not directly affected by the tighter regulations or because the

                                                 24
regulations are less binding. For example, well-capitalized banks may have been poised to
expand their international presence when other countries increased capital ratios and
constrained the activities of their own local firms. Some of the positioning and tendencies might
be sensitive to the organizational form of country global bank exposures to foreign locations.

    German and Italian teams also explored differences in prudential spillover responses across
branches versus subsidiaries of foreign banks. Outward lending by hosted subsidiaries of foreign
banks in Germany was rather unresponsive to changes in prudential instruments affecting
parent banks, whereas cross-border lending and lending by hosted branches reacted more
strongly to changes in regulations. In the case of Italy, inward transmission through hosted
branches was observed specifically in response to changes in local reserve requirements and
sector-specific capital buffers.

    Some of the studies by teams also underscore how the unit of observation – total loans – of
the baseline work used in the meta-analysis is likely to understate some important international
spillovers of prudential policies. For example, results for the United Kingdom emphasize the
importance of using sectorally disaggregated data (Hills et al. 2016). As an illustration,
tightening in LTV ratios in the home market of parents outside the U.K. leads to an increase in
lending to private non-financials and households in the U.K. When the home country tightens
foreign reserve requirements, lending to both financials and private non-financials decreases.

    Other considerations that are potentially important for detecting significant spillovers are
other policy measures such as capital controls, more of a focus on regional linkages, and
asymmetric effects of tighter or looser policies. In Korea, inward spillover effects were viewed
as relatively weak because foreign banks are not very active on the retail market and because
regulations of cross-border capital flows matter (Park and Lee 2016). Accounting for the
intensity of bilateral linkages by, for example, using weighted regressions was found to be a
better measure of the economic effects of spillovers in the study by Mexico. When the main
banks from the U.S. and Canada were explored, the Mexico analysis picked up more significant
spillovers of prudential policies into domestic retail lending (Levin et al. 2016).

   The econometric methods that assume the tightening and loosening episodes have
symmetric effects on loan growth may be inappropriate in the future for some instruments.
Symmetric effects would not be expected for instruments like capital requirements, which were
exclusively tightening episodes in the period studied, or sector specific capital buffers, which
exhibited both tightening and loosening episodes. When Netherlands considered such
asymmetries, they concluded that Dutch banks increased lending in countries that tightened
prudential regulation and decreased lending when regulation is relaxed, but to different


                                                 25
degrees. The effects were more significant in larger banks, in lending to advanced economies,
and in the post-crisis period.

    Reinforcing how the common empirical approach will not pick up all potential international
spillovers, the U.S. also provided a difference-in-difference analysis of the international lending
done by two types of U.S. global banks: those banks subject to or not subject to the
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). This type of review was applied to
systemically important institutions. The loan growth comparison across global banks showed
that the affected banks subject to enhanced capital analysis reduced loan growth to foreign
residents relative to the loan growth of the comparison group. The magnitude of difference in
loan growth effects depended on the balance sheet characteristics of the banks, again
reinforcing our broader observation of heterogeneity in the effects of prudential instruments
across banks, and vis-à-vis international counterparties.
    An additional scope for international spillovers of prudential instruments comes from
expanding the analysis beyond just the lending of banks, and taking into account the funding
side of bank balance sheets. Turkey finds that prudential spillovers occur both on lending and
borrowing (Başkaya et al. 2016): prudential tightening abroad led to higher cross-border
borrowing by banks in Turkey for the case of lower LTV limits.

    Finally, while the individual country studies provide many advantages in terms of
identification of effects and heterogeneity of responses to prudential instruments, they do not
provide a full view of the reallocation of international financial flows through banks in response
to prudential policies. This latter goal is accomplished in the cross-country analysis using country
aggregates by Avdjiev, Koch, McGuire, and von Peter (2016) from the BIS, which uses panel data
for banks from 16 home countries active in 53 destination countries. Among the seven
instruments analyzed, loan-to-value limits and local currency reserve requirements have the
most significant impact on international bank lending. The estimated international spillovers of
the prudential tightening tend to be positive, so that tightening in one country is more likely to
be associated with expanded loan growth elsewhere. Analysis of cross-country propogation in
the euro area through 248 banks from 16 euro area countries by Nocciola, Zochowski, and
Franch (2016) of the ECB conclude that inward spillovers of foreign prudential policies were
present. Generally, instruments directed to specific borrowers, such as loan‐to‐value limits or
sector specific requirements were most prone to spillovers, while the tightening of capital
requirements tended to be associated with a decrease in lending.

    Balance sheet characteristics of banking systems sometimes influenced the magnitudes of
spillovers. Consistent with the country studies that suggested the potential for market share


                                                  26
reallocations in response to changes in prudential regulations, the BIS team cross-country work
found that better capitalized banking systems, those with more liquid assets, and those less
reliant on core deposit funding had stronger loan growth externally when prudential
instruments were more restricted at home, for example from tighter loan to value ratios. The
BIS team found that institution-based prudential instruments (capital requirements or local
currency reserve requirements) affected more the local lending of foreign affiliates, whereas
activity-based instruments (loan-to-value ratios) primarily affected cross-border lending. Bank
characteristics such as size, capitalization, and liquidity play a role in determining the magnitude
of cross‐border spillovers.

6. Summary
Macroprudential policies have been established as a key line of defense in preventing and
mitigating the consequences of systemic financial crises. In recent years, the legal framework
for macroprudential policy instruments has been defined, institutions have been further tasked
with the surveillance and regulation of financial stability risks, and terms for applying
macroprudential policy tools and for monitoring consequences have been specified. Given the
urgency of addressing financial stability risks, policymakers moved forward with this toolbox
before having comprehensive empirical and theoretical evidence on the expected effects, on
possible spillovers, and on the effectiveness of macro-prudential policies.

    This paper and the overall IBRN initiative provide evidence relevant for discussion of the
international spillover effects of prudential policies used in a broad set of countries. The use of a
common research methodology allows for comparability of results across countries and for
drawing lessons from those country studies. Overall, the results of this prudential spillover work
demonstrate the importance of incorporating considerations on the international spillovers of
prudential instruments into discussions and frameworks around macroprudential policy,
including the role and potential for reciprocity.

    Key findings are, first, that prudential instruments spill over across borders through
international bank lending. The sign of spillovers onto lending can be positive or negative,
indicating that different constraints are binding for different types of banks and that banks
substitute between different types of activities. Second, bank balance sheet conditions and
business models in fact affect the intensity of spillovers. Evidence from some countries suggests
that some global banks with strong balance sheets responded to tightening foreign regulations
by expanding their market shares abroad as local banks presumably contract their balance
sheets. Spillovers of foreign regulations into home lending are more likely to arise through
hosted affiliates of foreign banks. Third, significant international spillovers of policy on loan

                                                   27
growth have mostly not been large. One reason for this is that the analysis focuses on
adjustment in loan growth along the intensive margin, excluding analysis of adjustment along
the extensive margin through entry and exit into foreign markets and mergers and acquisitions.
Moreover, countries have tested for prudential spillovers in the context of the relatively
infrequent and newer use of some instruments. To the extent that domestic activation of
macroprudential instruments increases, the scope for international spillovers of prudential
instruments might thus increase in the future.

    Overall, the results of this prudential spillover work demonstrate the importance of
incorporating considerations on the international spillovers of prudential instruments into
discussions and frameworks around macroprudential policy, including the role and potential for
reciprocity. While spillovers do not always occur through lending, they do occur frequently
enough to have consequences for countries interlinked through international banking.

Table 2: Types of Specification by Country
This Table summarizes the transmission channels studied by particular country teams, along with the total number
of regressions by country (row) and channel (column). The specifications differ in transmission channel (Exposure-
weighted inward transmission, Inward transmission of home policy via affiliates, Outward transmission) and in the
inclusion of bank variable interactions and business and financial cycles. *The Outward transmission channel looks
primarily at effects on lending from destination country policy. Third-country exposure-weighted effects are
included in addition to destination country policy in one exercise.

Table 4: Effects of Prudential Instruments on Lending Growth
This Table details – by instrument, channel, and sign – the percentage of prudential instrument net effects
significant at the 10% level. Net effects are calculated as the sum of all instrument coefficients in a given
regression, multiplying interaction coefficients by the mean of their interacted control. 0 = insignificant, + =
positive, − = negative. An F-test is used to test whether this linear combination of coefficients is nonzero. *For the
Outward transmission exercise in which both Destination country and third-country exposure-weighted policy
instruments were considered simultaneously; if either of these two current-lagged coefficient sums were
statistically significant, the net effect for this regression is considered significant.

                                                                                            Outward transmission

Table 5:      Country Breakdown of Prudential Instrument Significance by Instrument and
              Channel
This Table reports the country teams which found a 10% significant net effect on lending by instrument, channel,
and sign, adding a country dimension to the results of Table 4. Also reported are countries which ran exercises for
a given instrument and channel, but which found no significant net effects. 0 = insignificant, + = positive, − =
negative. Note that it is possible for a country to find both positive and negative net effects across exercises within
a channel, and to therefore appear in both columns b and c. Countries included are Canada (CA), Chile (CL), France
(FR), Germany (DE), Hong Kong (HK), Italy (IT), South Korea (KR), Mexico (MX), Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL),
Portugal (PT), Switzerland (CH), Turkey (TR), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). *For the
Outward transmission exercise in which both Destination country and third-country exposure-weighted policy
instruments were considered simultaneously; if either of these two current-lagged coefficient sums were
statistically significant, the net effect for this regression is considered significant.

Table 6:      Heterogeneity of Effects across Banks by Instrument, Channel, and Balance Sheet Characteristic
This Table shows the countries which found particular balance sheet characteristics to be important in differentiating the impacts of prudential regulations on bank lending growth,
defined as having found instrument-bank interaction sums (𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2 + 𝛽𝛽3 ) to be significant at the 10% level using an F-test. Countries included are Canada (CA), Chile (CL), France
(FR), Germany (DE), Hong Kong (HK), Italy (IT), South Korea (KR), Mexico (MX), Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Switzerland (CH), Turkey (TR), the United Kingdom (UK),
and the United States (US). All countries running a bank interaction regression in a given channel are listed in the final row, with the following exceptions: †Due to data availability,
CH, IT, MX, NL, TR, and the UK do not include net due variables, while NL also does not include an illiquid asset ratio. ‡Due to insufficient variation, foreign reserve requirements are
excluded by TR, local reserve requirements by CH, concentration ratios by US, and interbank exposure limits by CL, DE, and PT in all channels. In the via affiliates channel, foreign
reserve requirements are similarly excluded by HK, MX, PL, PT, TR, and US, with interbank exposure limits also excluded by US in this channel.

Table 7: Probit Regression Analysis of Significance by Prudential Instrument
This Table shows the features of regressions yielding significant impacts of prudential regulations on bank lending. The cells of the Table present Probit regression coefficients,
produced separately by prudential instrument and net effect direction (rows). The dependent variable in each Probit is an indicator variable for whether the prudential instrument net
effect associated with a regression was significant at the 10% level. In the latter two rows for each instrument, this net effect is further required to be positively or negatively
significant, respectively. This indicator is regressed on the characteristics of the country running this exercise, along with indicator variables detailing the specifications of this exercise

Appendix Table A1: Heterogeneity of Effects across Cycles by Instrument and Channel
This Table shows which countries found business and financial cycles to be important in differentiating the significant impacts of prudential regulations on bank lending, defined as
having found instrument-cycle interactions that were significant at the 10% level. Cycle variables are those of the host country, home country, and destination country respectively in
the three transmission channels below. Regressions involving cycle interactions use cumulative macroprudential instrument measures. Countries included are Canada (CA), Chile (CL),
France (FR), Germany (DE), Hong Kong (HK), Italy (IT), South Korea (KR), Mexico (MX), Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Switzerland (CH), Turkey (TR), the United Kingdom
(UK), and the United States (US). All countries running a bank interaction regression in a given channel are listed in the final row. ‡Due to insufficient variation, foreign reserve
requirements are excluded by TR, local reserve requirements by CH, concentration ratios by US, and interbank exposure limits by CL, DE, and PT in all channels. In the via affiliates
channel, foreign reserve requirements are similarly excluded by HK, MX, PL, PT, TR, and US, with interbank exposure limits also excluded by US in this channel.

Appendix A. Specific Regression Models by Transmission Channel

Appendix A.1 Inward Transmission through Home Global Banks

The analysis of the inward transmission channel begins with a specification focused on changes
in the domestic lending behavior of a domestic bank with activities in multiple foreign
countries. This global bank is exposed to foreign prudential instruments through its exposure to
foreign markets. Lending behavior at home may be affected. For example, as discussed in
Section 2.1, if foreign regulations tighten, lending on the home market is, ceteris paribus, more
attractive.
     Formally, log changes in the stock of (domestic) loans (∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 ) are linked to prudential
changes weighted by a bank’s lagged foreign exposures (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ), bank-level controls
(𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ) as well as bank- and time fixed effects (𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 , 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 ):

∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + (𝛼𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ) + 𝛼𝛼4 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 (1)

Time fixed effects capture changes in prudential instruments on the home market. In order to
test whether policies have a significant impact on lending growth, the F-test 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛼𝛼3 = 0,
considers whether the cumulative impact of regulations over a time horizon of three quarters
is statistically significant.

  In a second step, the prudential measures are interacted with bank-level variables to test
whether the banks’ business models influence the lending response to regulatory changes:

∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + (𝛼𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ) + 𝑎𝑎4 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + ( 𝛽𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 +
          𝛽𝛽2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ) + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡                           (2)

    The corresponding F-tests are 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛼𝛼3 = 0, 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2 + 𝛽𝛽3 = 0, ∑3𝑖𝑖=1(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 )
and (𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ). The country team analyses allow effects of the bank-level variables to
depend on the specific prudential measure considered. Take the case of prudential instruments
aiming at increasing the capital buffers of banks. For well-capitalized banks with large capital
buffers in excess of the regulatory minimum, higher capital requirements abroad should have
little impact on domestic lending. For weakly capitalized banks with foreign subsidiaries,
additional capital requirements may well be the relevant constraint, hence these banks may
have to cut back foreign lending and possibly domestic lending in the short-run. Therefore, the
expected sign of the interaction term between capital-based prudential changes and bank
capital is negative in this inward transmission exercise.

   An additional specification examined by teams allows for the effect of the foreign
prudential instrument to vary over the home financial or business cycle. The resulting
specification is

                                                                   A-2
      ∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 (3)

where 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 is the credit-to-GDP or output gap in the home market. In order to measure the effect
of the financial cycle, we use a cumulative regulatory measure (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 ). The cumulative
index captures not only contemporaneous changes in the policy but also previous changes that
may affect current lending, surfacing at specific stages of the financial or business cycle, as in
Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (2015) or by Cerutti, Claessens, and Laeven (2015).


Appendix A.2 Inward Transmission through Affiliates of Foreign Banks
Inward transmission of prudential instruments can arise through the lending behavior of home
prudential policy via affiliates of foreign banks that are active in the domestic market. Rather
than weighting foreign policy changes by the exposure of each domestic bank abroad, we now
have a direct measure of the home policy changes of each foreign affiliate, depending on
where the parent of this affiliate resides. Equation (1) thus becomes

where 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the regulation in the home country j of an affiliate with a parent in j. Time
fixed effects absorb changes in the regulation of the domestic market. Due to data limitations,
it is usually not possible to control for the international loan portfolio of these banks through
an exposure weighted index similar to the first inward transmission specification. Instead, a net
intragroup position term in some specifications controls for the degree of ex ante reallocation
of resources within the banking group. Also, bank fixed effects may capture structural
differences in banks’ business models. All other tests remain the same and interaction terms
are modelled in analogy to equations (2) and (3).


Appendix A.3 Outward Transmission through Home Global Banks
The general structure of the outward transmission exercise is very similar to the structure of
the inward transmission model. An initial specification starts with a given bank residing in
country i that has claims on several foreign countries j. To test how lending in these countries is
affected by destination country regulatory policies implemented in each country j (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ),
formally the following empirical model is used:

∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + �𝛼𝛼1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−2 � + 𝛼𝛼4 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼5 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗 +
            𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝜀𝜀𝑏𝑏,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡                             (4)




                                                                     A-3
       All variables are defined as previously, except that the business or financial cycle variables
𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 are now for the destination country j. The F-tests as well as interaction terms with bank-
level variables and the cycle are conducted analogously.

    The outward transmission exercise has a baseline specification that refers to prudential
policies in the destination country. Another specification is similar to the inward transmission
case in which teams consider exposure-weighted regulations in foreign countries that are not
home or destination country. Consider, for instance, the foreign affiliate of the domestic bank
located in a specific host market – say the U.K. – but with many foreign markets being serviced
from that location. In that case, prudential changes imposed in those third country locations
might affect the lending in the specific host market, and these prudential changes are included
in the model through a composite index 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸:

      ∆𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + (𝛼𝛼1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−2 ) + 𝛼𝛼4 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝛼5 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 +
(𝛽𝛽1𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−2 ) + 𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗 + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡 + 𝑓𝑓𝑏𝑏 + 𝜀𝜀𝑏𝑏,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡                    (5)

     The corresponding F-test analyzes whether either destination country regulations or
foreign-exposure weighted regulations in third countries have a significant impact over a
horizon of three quarters on lending in a given destination market: 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛼𝛼3 = 0 ;
𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2 + 𝛽𝛽3 = 0.




                                                                     A-4
Appendix B. Data Cleaning and Variable Definitions
Appendix B.1 Data Details and Cleaning

     Data availability, the length of time series, and the types of relevant banking groups vary
across countries. As general guidance, country teams use quarterly data from the first quarter
of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2013. The largest meaningful set of banks is included in
the baseline model implemented by country teams. The outward transmission exercises
generally exclude foreign owned banks. Inward transmission exercises use data on domestic
banks, foreign branches, and foreign subsidiaries.

    Data have not been adjusted for exchange rate changes because not all country teams have
information on the currency denomination of banks’ cross-border assets. Whenever feasible
and meaningful, positions adjusted for exchange rate changes were used for robustness
specifications. Quarterly growth rates of lending are based on nominal rather than real data in
order to avoid adding noise from quarterly price changes.

    A key consideration in understanding channels of transmission is the use of consolidated
versus unconsolidated data, in particular for those banking organizations that maintain
extensive international networks of affiliates. Consolidated data refer to the group level,
reflecting balance sheet items for all individual banks that are within the organization.
Unconsolidated data cover specific entities so that balance sheet items are at the level of an
individual bank which is part of a larger bank holding company or banking group. Consolidation
complicates an analysis of the international dimension of prudential spillovers as the
geographical split of a bank’s assets or liabilities by destination/country may be excluded. In
baseline specifications, country teams generally use data that have been consolidated across
parents and branches as relevant for the transmission exercise, but not for the entire bank
holding company. If that option is not available, data that have been consolidated at the group
level (parent, branches, and subsidiaries) are used. For those countries where neither is
available and instead resort to locational data, group-level variables are included as bank-level
controls.

    Teams impose screens on the bank-level data to account for merger-induced changes and
to correct errors in the data: (i) Log changes that exceed -100/+100 percent have been
dropped. Compared to the winsorization of data at standard levels, this has the advantage of
giving an approximately normal distribution of growth rates while keeping most observations in
the sample. Country teams additionally use standard winsorization techniques to check
robustness. (ii) Generally, zeros representing missing bank-level observations are dropped. (iii)
Strings that did not include at least two years of consecutive observations generally are
dropped.


                                                A-5
    These data cleaning steps follow standard procedures in the literature by focusing on
variation in bank-specific observations along the intensive margin and by eliminating large
outliers. But there is also the possibility that some large extensive margin adjustments in
response to prudential instruments are inadvertently excluded from the analysis. These steps,
along with baseline specification’s instructions designed to deliver maximum commonalities
across country results on specific transmission channels, imply that the meta-analysis results
provide a conservative, lower bound for international transmission of prudential instruments
through banks.

Appendix B.2 Construction of Regressors used in Probit Meta-Analysis
Indicator Variables:
• Emerging Market: Equals one if the country team running a given regression is classified as
    an Emerging Market economy (as opposed to an Advanced Economy), and zero otherwise.
• Inward Exposure-Weighted: Equals one if the regression studies the inward transmission of
    foreign prudential regulation through domestic global banks, and zero otherwise.
• Outward Transmission: Equals one if the regression studies the outward transmission of
    policy through the international activities of domestically-owned banks, and zero
    otherwise.
• PP*Cycle Indicator: Equals one if the regression includes prudential instruments interacted
    with business and financial cycle variables, and zero otherwise. Note that these
    specifications are also exactly the specifications which use a cumulative prudential
    instrument measure.
• PP*Bank Indicator: Equals one if the regression includes prudential instruments interacted
    with bank-level balance sheet variables, and zero otherwise.
• All PP Indicator: Equals one if the regression specification simultaneously includes all
    prudential instruments showing sufficient variation, and zero otherwise.
Non-Indicator Variables:
• % Foreign Bank Ownership: Indicates the share of banks operating in the regression country
    in 2013 which are foreign-owned as derived from the Claessens and van Horen Database
    (2015).
• % Tightening: Indicates the share of prudential instrument changes which represent
    tightenings (as opposed to loosenings), for a given country team, channel, and specific
    instrument.
• Log Observations (not shown): The log number of observations included in a regression
    specification.
• Constant Term (not shown)
