                                          ABSTRACT


Obesity has risen dramatically in the past few decades. However, the relative contribution of
energy intake and energy expenditure to rising obesity is not known. Moreover, the extent to
which social and economic factors tip the energy balance is not well understood. In this
longitudinal analysis of developed countries, we estimate the relative contribution of increased
caloric intake and reduced physical activity to obesity using two methods of energy accounting.
Results show that rising obesity is primarily the result of consuming more calories. We estimate
multivariate regression models and use simulation analysis to explore technological and
sociodemographic determinants of this dietary excess. Results indicate that the increase in
caloric intake is associated with technological innovations such as reduced food prices as well as
changing sociodemographic factors such as increased urbanization and increased female labor
force participation. The study findings offer useful insights to future research concerned with the
etiology of obesity and may help inform the development of obesity-related policy. In particular,
our results suggest that policies to encourage less caloric intake may help reverse past trends in
increased consumption.

INTRODUCTION

           Today, obesity affects more than 300 million adults; the majority of whom live in the

developed world (72). In the past two decades, the average level of obesity in the Organization

for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries has risen by 8 percent. Unlike

previous centuries, where increased weight was a sign of improved health, (24) the rapid increase

in body mass index (BMI)1 over the past few decades has meant that a growing share of the

population in developed countries is becoming obese (22, 33).

           Excess body weight is the fifth most important risk factor contributing to the burden of

disease in developed countries (73). Rising body mass index steadily increases the risks of type 2

diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers (3). In addition, obesity is

responsible for approximately six to ten percent of national health expenditures in the U.S. and

two percent to four percent in other developed countries (3, 8, 21, 42, 66, 68). Moreover, the

lifetime medical costs related to diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension and stroke

among the obese are $10,000 higher than among the non-obese (6).

           It is clear that genetic changes are not the cause of increased obesity over such a short

period of time. Rather, changes in the energy balance are key; consuming more calories than are

expended leads to weight gain (35). However, the relative culpability of energy intake and

energy expenditure to the pathogenesis of weight gain is the subject of some dispute. Some

studies place blame on increased physical inactivity (29, 49, 57, 70) while others point to over

consumption (13, 46, 47, 65).

           The complex range of social and economic factors that tip the energy balance are not well

understood despite a vast body of research exploring obesity and its determinants (40).

           1
           The levels of Body Mass Index (BMI) that distinguish healthy weight from overweight (BMI at or above
25kg/m ) and obesity (BMI at or above 30 kg/m2) are based on how much the risk of chronic disease and death
       2

increases for populations as weight increases.


                                                       2
Increasingly, experts point to technology innovations as a key mechanism driving the energy

imbalance (21, 40). Technological innovations refer to improvements which have lowered the

costs associated with consumption and a sedentary lifestyle. However, whether obesity is more

related to dietary excess or physical inactivity as a result of these innovations is unclear. Those in

support of the reduced energy expenditure theory point to the increasingly automated work place

and rising time costs of physical activity (21, 41, 50). This argument is weakened by the fact that

available evidence on declines in work-related physical activity suggests that reductions have

been gradual and largely predated the dramatic increase in weight gain across the developed

world in the past few decades (2). Those arguing that over consumption is responsible point to

decreases in food prices, increases in the mass preparation of food, increases in the efficiency of

food production, and increases in the availability of fast food and calorie-dense foods. Studies

linking dietary excess to obesity are supported by empirical evidence indicating that food

consumption has increased in parallel with rising obesity (12, 13).

       In addition to the behavior and environmental changes fueled by technological

innovations, obesity has also been related to changes in sociodemographic factors. We focus on

those factors which are both strongly supported by empirical evidence and amenable to data

analysis. In particular, we look at urbanization and female labor force participation. There is a

vast body of literature relating urbanization to rising obesity. Rising urbanization is associated

with increased opportunities for eating and reduced opportunities for physical activity. For

example, food options in urban areas are typically more varied and accessible than rural areas.

Moreover, people in rural areas typically have higher levels of physical activity due to the focus

on agricultural work (53). The differences between diet and activity patterns in urban and rural




                                                  3
areas are lowest in those high-income countries where urbanization is most prevalent as a result

of infrastructure development (54).

        Increasing female labor force participation has been related to rising obesity through

changes in time allocation and food consumption. The proliferation of women in the workforce

has meant that women are devoting more time to work and less time to food preparation – a trend

which has increased their reliance on convenient food and fast food (12). Such foods are not only

inexpensive but they also have high caloric density to increase palatability which has been shown

to increase weight gain (28, 44, 61). Healthy food, by contrast, is less convenient, less accessible,

and more expensive (16).

        Previous research exploring the relative contribution of caloric intake and energy

expenditure to weight gain has been limited by the focus on single countries or sub-populations.

This study is the first to use a series of cross-sectional observations in a multi-country analysis.

Use of data from multiple countries allows us to observe common trends among the OECD

countries. The developed world was selected because data are most ubiquitous and obesity rates

are among the highest in the world.

        The main purpose of this study is to identify the relative contribution of caloric intake

and energy expenditure to obesity and the mechanisms driving the energy imbalance. We first

discuss our data sources and methods. We next provide evidence about trends in obesity and

caloric supply. We then evaluate whether the rise in obesity is more attributable to increased

caloric intake or reduced physical activity. We subsequently look at the factors driving this

imbalance, focusing on those with the greatest public sector implications. We conclude with a

discussion of policy implications as well as how our findings relate to the broader obesity

literature.




                                                  4
       We propose a theory based on dietary excess. In particular, we hypothesize that rising

obesity is the result of increased caloric intake and that this shift towards over consumption is

driven by technological innovations and changing sociodemographic factors.



RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES


Data
       The data for this study includes country-level and individual-level measures obtained

from several sources (Table 1).



Energy Accounting. To evaluate the relative contribution of energy intake and energy

expenditure to obesity, we constructed a panel data set of OECD countries using data from food

balance sheets (FBS) from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and obesity

prevalence from the OECD Health database. We also used individual-level data from the United

States and England.

       The FBS data are compiled from national accounts of the supply and use of foods. Food

available for consumption is calculated as total food production (including imports excluding

exports) net losses from processing at the mill and food for animal consumption. These data are

widely used and cited as they provide the most comprehensive picture of food consumption at

the national level, making it possible to study trends in per capita caloric supply across countries

and over time.

       There are several limitations to using the FBS (19). The data do not reflect actual

consumption and are typically overestimated due to failure to account for household waste and

spoilage, as well as transformation of food composition during the process of cooking (15, 63).




                                                 5
The resulting measurement error may vary by country (e.g., U.S. 26%; U.K.10%; Japan 25%) (9,

37, 64).

        We only included FBS data from countries with a reputation for high quality data

collection methods and that scored well above average in terms of data completeness. However,

differences in methodologies or definitions between countries may lead to some incomparability.

We employed methods to reduce the impact of these limitations (described below).

        The OECD Health Data are the most comprehensive source of health-related data,

including obesity prevalence, for the OECD countries. Survey respondents are classified as obese

if their self-reported or measured BMI is 30 kg/m2 or more. To account for the fact that, on

average, women under report weight and men over report height, (18) we control for whether the

BMI measure is observed or self-reported.

        For the U.S. and England, individual-level data were obtained from two nationally

representative surveys: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III

(1988-94) and IV (1999-2002) and the Health Survey for England (HSE) for 1991 and 2003.



Energy Expenditure. There is no single, comparable source of information on energy

expenditure across OECD countries. Therefore, we used World Development Indicators (WDI)

and a number of individual level data sources to measure physical activity, which was

categorized into four broad types: highly active work, less active work, active leisure time,2 and

everything else (see Appendix A and B) .

        There are several limitations of the physical activity data used for this study. The

employment categories in the World Development Indicators are broad making it difficult to


        2
          Trends in work commuting are included in the Appendix, but were placed in the “everything else”
category given that changes over the period were very small.


                                                       6
capture variations in work-related physical activity. The data collection methods for leisure time

activity are not uniform across countries and the accuracy and methodology used by the

reporting country. Moreover, the leisure time activity data only includes measures of physical

exercise. Ideally, we would have also included measures of other activities such as television

use, household chores, or errands due to the potentially large effect of sedentary or household

activity for some countries or population subgroups. Unfortunately, those data were not

available.



Drivers of the Energy Imbalance. To measure drivers of the energy balance, we use the WDI

and the Economic Freedom of the World Index (EFW). The Economic Freedom of the World

Index measures the degree to which the policies and institutions of countries are supportive of

economic freedom. We use the following measures of economic freedom as previously validated

proxies for technological innovation: relative food prices (WDI), market entry – the ease with

which new businesses can enter the market place (EFW), and pricing freedom – the freedom of

businesses to set their own prices (EFW) (13, 17). Sociodemographic change is measured as the

degree of urbanization (WDI) and female labor force participation (WDI).



Analysis

       This study is conducted in two parts. In part I, we use two methods of energy accounting

and a 24-hour time budget of energy expenditure to assess the relative contributions of caloric

intake and energy expenditure to the rising prevalence of obesity in developed countries.

Consistency in results across these methods should provide a relatively convincing explanation

for increasing obesity in spite of data limitations. In part II, we use ordinary least squares




                                                  7
regression to assess whether technological innovation and sociodemographic changes are

associated with changes in the energy balance.



Part I: Calories In or Energy Out

Energy Accounting. To calculate the relative contribution of energy intake and energy

expenditure to rising obesity, we use two methods of energy accounting. The first method uses

country-level data and the second method uses individual-level data.

       Each energy accounting model is based on the biological fact that the energy balance is

equal to the difference between net energy intake and net energy expenditure (27, 35). The

energy accounting analyses address the question of whether people are eating more or exercising

less. We examine factors that drive changes in the energy balance in the second part of this paper

       At the individual level, a change in the energy balance is equal to the summation of

changes in energy intake and energy expenditure over time, written as:

                                t +α                     t +α
       Energy balancet, t+α =   ∑t
                                       energy intake -   ∑ energy expenditure
                                                          t


where t is time and α is the number of years. Energy expenditure is the sum of three parts:


       K = α + (ß + E) * Weight + 0.1 * K


where K represents the daily calories consumed; α + ß * Weight represents the basal metabolic

rate, energy associated with keeping the body alive (~60 percent of daily energy expenditure); E

represents activity-related energy expenditure (~30 percent of daily energy expenditure); and 0.1

* K represents the thermic effect of food, energy necessary to process food (~10 percent of daily

energy expenditure). This weight equation was parameterized by Cutler et al. (2003) from the




                                                     8
most commonly used estimates in the literature (13, 62, 71).3 Because it describes a biological

phenomenon, we can be reasonably confident that this equation can be applied across developed

countries and aggregated to the population level (20).

         Given that individual-level BMI data are not available for all of the countries included in

this analysis, we rely on an aggregate measure of percent obese. We compared trends in mean

BMI and percent obese using individual-level data from England, Japan and the United States to

estimate the linear relationship between BMI and obesity and found a high level of correlation.4



Method #1. The first energy accounting model estimated the relationship between caloric intake

and obesity as described below:


         percent obesec,t = ß0 + ß1 (total caloric supply)c,t + countryc + timet + ec,t


where c indicates country and t indicates year. For this model, the country is the unit of analysis.

The outcome variable is percent obese and the primary independent variable of interest is total

caloric supply.5 The inclusion of country and year fixed effects control for shifts in wastage and

other unobserved factors across countries and over time. The time fixed effects are measured in

five year increments (e.g., 1990-94, 1995-99, 2000-02 etc.).



         3
           The estimates from the literature are as follows: α: men = 879 and women = 829; ß: men = 11.6 and
women = 8.7 (Schofield WN et al. 1985). The estimates from Schofield et al. were accepted as the standard by the
FAO/WHO/UNU expert consultation on the Energy Requirements of Adults in 2001.
         4
           For England, we used data from the Health Survey for England fielded annually from 1991 to 2003. For
Japan, we used data from the National Nutrition Survey fielded annually from 1976 to 2002. For the United States,
we used data from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHES), NHANES I, NHANES II, NHANES III,
and NHANES IV. The correlations between mean BMI and percent obese were very high: Japan (0.93), England
(0.95) and U.S. (0.99).
         5
           There is disagreement in the literature regarding the relative importance of the key dietary factors that
have been most associated with obesity including: high fat, energy-dense foods, and carbohydrate rich foods with
high sugar content. Given this lack of consensus, we do not address the possibility that calories may differentially
impact obesity and instead focus on the relationship between total caloric intake and percent obese, since it is here
where the science is the clearest.


                                                          9
           The coefficient for caloric supply (ß1) represents the association between caloric supply

and percent obese. To obtain a predicted estimate of average percent obese, this coefficient is

multiplied by the actual change in caloric supply for each country individually and for all

countries as a group (e.g., pooled) over the respective survey period. The difference between our

calculation (predicted percent obese) and the actual percent obese indicates how much of the

change in percent obese is due to reductions in physical activity (i.e., residual unexplained

variance). Countries were included in the pooled model if they had three obesity surveys or more

from 1990 to 2002. For those countries with four or more obesity surveys, only three data points

were used in the analysis.

           Using the same basic model structure described above, we also estimated the association

between the change in caloric supply and the change in the percent obese, excluding fixed

effects.

           To the extent that caloric supply and physical activity are highly correlated, the

coefficient on caloric supply above could absorb some of the effect of physical activity, leading

to a biased estimate of the independent contributions of these behaviors.6 We found evidence of

a slight correlation, but nothing to suggest that the model cannot produce unbiased estimates of

the independent effects of caloric supply and physical activity. 7



           6
           Correlations between caloric supply and unmeasured wastage will underestimate the impact of caloric
supply on percent obese causing our estimate of the coefficient for caloric supply to shrink towards zero.
Correlations between caloric supply and physical activity could go in either direction. Our estimate would be biased
downwards if individuals who eat more also exercise more (less likely). Our estimate would be biased upwards if
individuals who eat more also exercise less (more likely).
         7
           Using country-level data, we empirically tested the possible correlations between caloric supply and
physical activity proxies using an OLS regression model and found that our coefficient estimate for caloric supply
remained relatively constant with (ß = 0.0042) and without (ß = 0.0039) the inclusion of physical activity proxies
(e.g., number of cars per 1000, type of employment: agricultural, industrial and service). However, given the
limitations of these proxies, we also looked to the individual-level data to help understand the direction of the bias.
Using data from the NHANES IV we estimated correlations between caloric intake and a series of physical activity
variables measuring exercise related to moderately active work (r = 0.08), leisure-time activity (r = 0.10),
housework (r =0.09), and commuting (r = 0.03). Each association was positive but small.


                                                          10
Method #2. The second energy accounting analysis evaluated the effect of additional weight

from calories on obesity using individual level data. We first translated the actual change in food

supply for a particular country into the predicted weight gain, which was then allocated

proportionally across individuals within each country according to their BMI percentile. We then

compared the predicted BMI gain with the actual BMI gain over the period to estimate the

portion of obesity attributable to increased calories. We ran this model for the United States

using the NHANES III and IV and for England using the Health Survey for England 1991 and

2003. If the hypothesis of dietary excess is correct, we would expect this model to over predict

the growth in obesity given that our caloric supply measure does not account for household

wastage. We show that the results of this model are robust against the over consumption error of

the caloric supply data.



Energy Expenditure. As an alternative approach to the energy accounting method described

above, we calculated a 24-hour time budget of energy expenditure for each country with

available physical activity data including: highly active work, less active work, active leisure

time and everything else. Each activity was assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score based

on the classification from Compendium of Physical Activities (1), producing MET hours for

each activity. We then estimated the change in calories expended for each MET score, translated

the change in calories into pounds, calculated the aggregate change in energy expenditure, and

determined the effect of weight change on the percent obese. These calculations are detailed in

Appendix C.

       To validate our energy expenditure findings, we also related several crude proxies of

physical activity (the number of passenger cars per 1000, the number of internet users per 1000,




                                                 11
and the number personal computers per 1000) to the percent obese using an OLS model with

country and year fixed effects. The model includes data from approximately 1990 to 2002.



Part II: Drivers of the Energy Imbalance

       We use a series of OLS models with country and year fixed effects and all years of data

from all OECD countries to estimate the impact of technological innovation and

sociodemographic factors on caloric supply. Technological innovation is represented by three

proxy measures: food prices, pricing freedom and market entry. Food prices are measured as the

ratio of food price index to the consumer price index and serve as a proxy for efficiency in food

production. We expect reduced food prices to be associated with increased caloric consumption

given that individuals consume more when prices are low (52). Reduced food prices should lead

to the biggest increase in caloric intake where they are falling faster than overall prices.

       Pricing freedom is measured as the ability of businesses to set their own prices and is

measured on a scale from 0 to 10; where 0 indicates high government interference and 10

indicates little or no government interference. Market entry is defined as the ease of starting a

new business and is measured on a scale of 0 to 10; low scores signify that countries have

regulations which retard entry into the market place while high scores indicate ease of market

entry. The critical relationship between pricing freedom/market entry and the broader concept of

technological innovation is the role of regulation. Empirical evidence suggests that regulation

can stop new technology (14). In other words, there is an inverse relationship between regulation

and technological innovation. Therefore, we expect that countries with more regulation (e.g.

more price controls and more barriers to market entry) would have lower technological

innovation and, subsequently, lower caloric supply. Ideally, we would have included a variable




                                                 12
which measures the ease of market entry for only food venders. Unfortunately, these data were

not available.

        Changing sociodemographic factors were represented by two variables: percent urban

and percent female labor force participation (as a percent of the total labor force). We expect

urbanization and women working to be positively associated with consumption.

        The influence of each of these factors was modeled separately, controlling for GDP

which is measured in purchasing power parity (PPP). We do not present a multivariate regression

including all the independent variables for two reasons. First, the data for each independent

variable is sparse, so putting them all together in one model significantly reduces the total

number of observations and results in low explanatory power. Second, normal practices of

imputation are not designed to work well on time-series data (38). The model relating

urbanization to caloric supply is shown below:


        caloric supplyc,t = ß0 + ß1GDP(PPP)c,t + ß2urbanization c,t + countryc + yeart + ec,t


where we control for country and time fixed effects represented by c and t, respectively.

        Using the coefficients from these models, we use Monte Carlo simulation8 (Clarify

software in STATA) to calculate the expected change in caloric supply due to changes in

technological innovation and sociodemographic factors (39).




        8
           Monte Carlo simulation is a procedure that generates possible outcomes by sampling from a theoretical
distribution with predefined parameters. For this analysis, estimates are drawn from a normal distribution. To
increase precision, each simulation uses 1000 draws.

RESULTS

Descriptive Trends

Trends in Obesity

         Figure 1 illustrates the level and trend of obesity in developed countries with measured

(as opposed to self-reported) BMI data.9 The United States has the highest level of obesity at all

points in time. However, the rate of increase is quite similar across countries. For example,

Korea, which has a much lower level of obesity than the United States, has a comparable rate of

increase. Similarities in the speed with which obesity prevalence has increased across all

countries with measured data, suggests a worldwide time-related phenomenon rather than a

country-specific trend.

         This consistent increase in adult obesity across the developed world is further illustrated

in Figure 2, which shows the annual average change in the percent obese across all OECD

countries. We observe the highest annual change in the United States (0.8 percent) and lowest in

Japan (0.1 percent). While this annual change in the United States may seem small, it is

synonymous with approximately 1.5 million more adults becoming obese each year.

         In Figure 3, we compare percentiles of BMI over time for England, Japan and the United

States. In particular, the value for each BMI percentile in the distribution in an earlier survey

period (x-axis) is compared to the same BMI percentile of the distribution in a later survey

period (y-axis). The 45 degree equivalence line is included to highlight the BMI percentiles

demonstrating the largest changes over time. For example, in the early 70’s, the 95th percentile of

BMI in the United States was 35. By the early 2000’s this number has risen to 40. We observe

similar trends in England and Japan. Consistent with other evidence, BMI in all three countries is


         9
          Although Mexico is included in the OECD countries, it is not a developed country. For this reason, it is
not included in the analyses conducted for this paper.


                                                         14
increasing more rapidly at the higher percentiles (23, 36). In other words, heavier people are

getting heavier at a faster rate and thinner people are getting heavier at a slower rate.



International Evidence on Energy Intake

       Trends in caloric supply for selected countries are shown in Figure 4. In each country,

increases in caloric supply appear to be rising in parallel with obesity. Starting with the United

States, we can see that caloric supply increased at a modest rate in the 1970’s. However, from

1985 to 2000 caloric supply rose by about 12 percent or 300 calories a day (58). The size of this

increase is more than sufficient to explain rising obesity in the United States which, the literature

has suggested, may have resulted from an average net increase in calories as small as 50-100

calories per day (30). In Canada, we see a similar trend; modest increases in caloric supply until

after the mid-1980s, followed by a sharp increase in trend. From 1985 to 2002, per capita caloric

supply in Canada increased by 530 kcal compared to the period from 1970 to 1984 where it only

increased by 67 kcal. We observe the same pattern in the United Kingdom where caloric supply

jumped by 190 kcal from 1985 to 2002 and only by 63 kcal from 1970 to 1984. Of all the

countries shown in Figure 4, Japan shows the most modest increases in caloric supply. This

preliminary evidence suggests that trends in energy supply since mid-1980 may be of a sufficient

magnitude to explain the rise in weight gain.



Part I: Energy In or Energy Out

Energy Accounting

       The findings from the first energy accounting method are shown in Figure 5. The graph

includes the results for the individual countries as well as the pooled model, represented by the




                                                 15
last bar on the right. Excluding Australia and Finland, the portion of obesity due to increased

calories ranges from 17 percent in New Zealand to 100 percent in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy,

Norway and Switzerland with almost all of the countries attributing 60 percent or more of their

weight gain to dietary excess. The pooled model results, excluding Australia and Finland,

suggests that calories in account for 93 percent of the change in obesity from 1990 to 2002. The

typical confidence interval for the percent change in obesity in a typical country is plus or minus

2 percent.

       The pattern in Australia and Finland is puzzling as it suggests that decreased physical

activity is the driving force behind obesity in these countries. Why do these two countries follow

an opposite pattern? One explanation is that the pattern in Australia and Finland reflects a true

reduction in physical activity. However, this is not supported by evidence on energy expenditure

(Table 2) presented in the following section. An alternative explanation is that the caloric supply

measures for these countries are unreliable. Individual-level dietary data from Australia

(National Nutrition Survey) and Finland (National Public Health Institute) are in conflict with

data from the FBS for the same time period, (5, 51) indicating that the FBS from these two

countries may lack face validity. For these reasons, we present the pooled result on the right hand

side of Figure 5 without Australia and Finland.

       Results from the model using a differencing approach (i.e., outcome=change in obesity)

show that an additional 100 calories was associated with a 1.6 percent increase in the percent

obese (ß = 0.016; 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.02). This suggests that countries with higher

increases in food consumption have higher increases in obesity.

       The results from the second energy accounting method are shown in Figures 6a and 6b.

This method evaluates the effect of additional weight from calories on obesity in the United




                                                  16
States (Figure 6a) and in England (Figure 6b). From 1991 to 2000, caloric supply in the U.S.

increased by 296 kcal, or a weight equivalent of 26 lbs, resulting in an estimated proportional

weight gain of 19 pounds for those in the bottom percentile and approximately 40 pounds for

those in the top percentile of BMI. We estimate the corresponding weight gain to be 26 percent,

more than three times the actual increase (8 percent) from 1991 to 2000. We found a similar

overestimation for England shown in Figure 6b. There, caloric supply increased by 179 kcal

from 1991 to 2002 which translates into 16 lbs or 7.1 kg. When we proportionately assigned this

additional weight and recalculated BMI, we predicted an increase in obesity of 17 percent. The

actual increase in obesity over the period was only 9 percent.

       These discrepancies between the actual change in obesity and the predicted change in

obesity for both the United States and the United Kingdom beg the question, why has obesity not

risen as much as the models predict? A possible, but unlikely explanation is that people are

exercising more over the respective periods. However, as we show in the following section,

physical activity in the United States and United Kingdom has remained largely constant. Given

these trends in energy expenditure, a more plausible explanation for the discrepancy we observe

between the predicted level of obesity and the actual level of obesity is that the increase in food

supply overstates the increase in food consumption. In other words, caloric intake has not

increased as much as caloric supply. We calculate the overestimation of the change in caloric

supply and find that the food balance sheet data does overestimate consumption. This analysis is

detailed in Appendix D.




                                                 17
International Evidence on Energy Expenditure

       As a final piece of evidence in support of our theory of dietary excess, we present

available data on cross-country comparisons of changes in energy expenditure from 1990 to

2001 in Table 2. The allocation of time to each type of activity is remarkably stable over time

and across countries. Where energy expenditure appears to have changed the most is with respect

to highly active work, which is consistent with patterns observed worldwide (53). We observe

the largest declines in highly active work in the United Kingdom and the lowest in Canada.

Despite this variation, the changes in highly active work differ at most by 30 minutes between

the countries and research suggests that moderate intensity activity of approximately 45 to 60

minutes per day is required to prevent the transition to overweight or obesity (60). The small

changes in highly active work we observe are expected given that the majority of the shift away

from manual labor occurred in the 1960’s and 1970’s, before the rapid rise in obesity (69). The

importance of employment-related energy expenditure to weight gain is also challenged by the

fact that obesity among children and the elderly has been rising in tandem with adult obesity, yet

these two sub-groups largely fall outside of the employment sector.

   For each country, the total change in calories and total change in METs is small (Table 2).

The effect of these changes in energy expenditure on weight gain is less than 3.5 percent for all

countries (Table 2, col 5). For example, for the average 65 kilogram person in the U.S., the

decrease in physical activity was associated with a small 2.8 pound increase in weight, resulting

in a rise in obesity of 2.1 percent. This is hardly sufficient to explain the eight percent increase in

obesity in the United States over the period. Our finding of decreasing energy expenditure in the

U.S. is supported by recent research suggesting that physical activity has, on average, declined




                                                  18
for adults and children (10). Of note, the time between which the change in calories turns into

steady-state pounds is not known, but probably does not exceed a few months.

       The results of our model relating several crude proxies of physical activity (the number of

passenger cars per 1000, the number of internet users per 1000, and the number personal

computers per 1000) to the percent obese support our finding that declining energy expenditure

is not the primary driver of excess weight gain. We found a significant inverse relationship

between passenger cars per 1000 and percent obese (β = -0.017; p<0.0001) which is the opposite

direction we expected. This result is similar to a recent study looking at environmental and

policy correlates of obesity in Europe (59). We found no effect of internet users and personal

computers users per 1000 on percent obese.



Part II: Drivers of the Energy Imbalance

       The results of the OLS models of caloric supply as a function of technological

innovations and changing sociodemographic factors are presented in Table 3. Simulated results

are shown in the bottom two rows.

       The first column shows the association between caloric supply and relative food prices

which is measured as the ratio of the food price index to the consumer price index. A ratio above

one implies that food prices are increasing faster than the overall cost of living. We find a

negative and statistically significant relationship between relative food prices and caloric supply

(β=-317.38; p<0.0001). Our results suggest that a decrease in the relative food price of 8 percent,

equivalent to the change in the U.S. between 1980 and 2002, was associated with a

corresponding higher caloric intake of 25 calories (0.08 * 317). Across the developed world,

average food prices fell by 12 percent from 1980 to 2002.




                                                 19
          Model 2 (Table 3, col 2) examined the relationship between pricing freedom and caloric

intake. We find no statistically significant relationship between pricing freedom and caloric

intake.

          Model 3 (Table 3, col 3) explored the relationship between market entry and caloric

supply. We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between the ease of starting a

new business and caloric supply (β=19.73; p<0.001).

          The results of the model investigating the association between female labor force

participation (measured in percent) and caloric supply are presented in column 4. Female labor

force participation is positively and significantly associated with caloric supply (β=7.05;

p<0.001). A ten percent increase in female labor force participation is associated with an

increase of approximately 70 calories.

          The last column in Table 3 relates urbanization (measured in percent) and caloric supply.

Urbanization was positively and significantly and caloric supply (β=11.25; p<0.0001).

          The last two rows of Table 3 report the results from the first difference analysis using

Monte Carlo simulation. For these simulations, we look at how much caloric supply would

change if we increased each independent variable from its lowest value to its highest value. This

is useful for understanding the maximum change in caloric supply that is possible for each

model. For example, if we look at column three, we can see that changing the ease with which

businesses can enter into the market place from the most difficult (0) to the easiest (10) is

associated with an increase of 192 calories. We observe the largest effect for urbanization.

Increasing urbanization from zero to 100 percent is associated with an increase of 1127 kcal.

          Our results suggest that changes in consumption can be addressed through policy

intervention. Table 4 considers the impact of some potential policies based on the results of our




                                                   20
analysis looking at the possible drivers in increased caloric intake. The first column shows the

impact of increased food prices on caloric supply. Specifically, a 12 percent increase in food

prices is associated with a decrease of 38 calories. While this caloric change may seem small, it

would lead to a reduction of approximately 3 pounds for a 65 kilogram person at a steady state.

The second column relates market entry to caloric supply and indicates that the average 65

kilogram person would lose almost 4 pounds if entry into the market place was retarded by 20

percent. The third column shows the relationship between urbanization and caloric supply.

Decreasing urbanization by 5 percent reduction is associated with a decrease of 5 pounds for the

average 65 kilogram person.



DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

       The purpose of this exploratory study was to assess the relative impact of caloric intake

and energy expenditure on the rising obesity epidemic in developing countries and to explore the

drivers of changes in the energy balance. The available data on energy expenditure, albeit

limited, suggests that physical activity has declined but that the magnitude of the change is

probably too small to explain most of the rise in adult obesity. With the exception of Australia

and Finland, our analyses suggest that increased caloric intake is the driving force behind the

growing obesity epidemic. However, we do not want to diminish the importance of energy

expenditure to weight management and overall health.

       Also, in our study, we examined two main mechanisms driving increases in caloric

supply: technological innovations and changing sociodemographic factors. Technological

innovations refer to those factors which reduce the costs associated with consumption and a

sedentary lifestyle. We focused on technological innovations associated with consumption given




                                                21
our finding that increased caloric intake is the primary driver of weight gain in the developed

world. In particular, we looked at relative food prices, the ease of businesses to enter the market

place, and the ease with which businesses can set their own prices. In support of our hypothesis,

we find lower relative food prices to be associated with increased caloric supply. Our analysis of

technological and sociodemographic drivers of this energy imbalance indicate that certain

characteristics of development (i.e., lower food prices, higher percentage of women working,

increasing urbanization, and GDP) are associated with greater weight gain, even among

developed nations.

       Our results are consistent with recent evidence from the U.S. that the increase in adult

weight gain is primarily attributable to over consumption (46). In addition, evidence from two

longitudinal studies, one using infants and the other using Pima Indians, found caloric intake to

be the primary determinant of weight gain (65, 67). In contrast, research using food recall –

where respondents detail everything they ate in the previous 24-hour period – place majority

blame for excess body weight on physical inactivity (57). However, a major limitation of food

recall data is underreporting which makes it very difficult to capture an accurate picture of

consumption (43, 56).

       Our findings with respect to the drivers of over consumption are supported by other

research evidence (4, 7, 12, 13, 40, 45, 54, 55). While we do not model the relationship between

these factors and physical activity, changing sociodemographic characteristics such as increased

urbanization have been linked to more sedentary lifestyles (54). Above and beyond the

determinants of the energy imbalance explored in this study, there are others which the literature

has identified as important such as advertisements, television use, and limited access to healthy

food options (25, 31, 32, 48).




                                                 22
       There are limitations of our analysis that deserve discussion. We cannot draw causal

inferences from this observational data analysis. Therefore, our conclusions are restricted to

associations between factors. This paper mostly relies on a country-level analysis which does not

make it possible to account for the natural heterogeneity within populations and may limit our

generalizability to individuals. In addition, the use of data from a variety of sources is both a

strength and weakness of this study. Lack of consistent data across countries required the use of

data from different sources resulting in measurement error, non-comparable measures and

unequal time periods for analysis. Further, we had to use proxy measures for many of our key

covariates due to the absence of direct measures at the country level. For example,

overestimation of actual BMI for England and the U.S. using the second energy accounting

method indicates that caloric supply is a poor proxy for actual consumption.

       Despite these limitations, our data provide consistent evidence that caloric supply, driven

by changing technological and sociodemographic factors, is highly associated with the increase

on obesity among the OECD countries. Our findings also highlight potential unintended

consequences of positive societal trends such as increased availability of food and increased

participation of women in the work force.

       Our findings suggest that relatively small changes in the price of food (e.g., junk food

tax) have the potential to slow the trend in obesity. However, more research is needed to assess

whether these programs disproportionately affect vulnerable populations (e.g., poor, adolescents)

in areas where access to health foods is limited. Other strategies may include increasing access

to weight loss services (e.g., bariatric surgery, pharmacological treatments, commercial weight-

loss programs) and population-based interventions such as healthy eating programs, or price

reductions of healthy foods (11, 25, 26, 34).




                                                 23
        The uncertainties about the etiology and macro drivers of obesity remain chief barriers to

our understanding of weight gain. As developed countries continue to develop and innovate, the

factors associated with increased caloric intake identified in this research and elsewhere will

likely increase, potentially making it harder and harder for individuals to maintain a healthy

weight. Additional research is necessary to better understand the questions explored in this study.

An ideal study investigating the relative contribution of energy intake and energy expenditure to

obesity would use comparable data on food consumption and total physical activity across

countries and over time. This requires the development of accurate tracking systems. There is

also a need for more research within countries and sub-populations to improve our understanding

of the drivers of the energy imbalance. Improved knowledge in this area will allow for the

development of effective targeted and universal interventions.

        However, improving the precision of our estimates and gaining a stronger understanding

of the causes of obesity is necessary but not sufficient. The creation of effective interventions

will require collaboration across a diverse set of stakeholders including: legislators, educators,

the food and health industries, media, community organizations, researchers, and public health

organizations. And the complexity of obesity dictates that the solution will not be simple.

Without sustained commitment from the broader society and an improved understanding of its

determinants, obesity itself and the associated morbidity and mortality from excess body weight

are likely to rise.

Notes: For United Kingdom, data on leisure time is for England only. Highly active work refers to agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying
(including oil production), manufacturing, construction, and public utilities. Less active work refers to wholesale and retail trade and restaurants and hotels;
transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services. Each activity was
weighted by a MET score and an average number of hours per day. MET scores were obtained from the Compendium of Physical Activity (Ainsworth BE 1993).
Detailed notes about the calculations for this table can be found in Appendix C. The time between which the change in calories turns into steady-state pounds is
not known, but probably does not exceed a few months.

B: Measured on a scale from 0 to 10; where 0 indicates high government interference and 10 indicates little or no
government interference.
C: Measured on a scale of 0 to 10; low scores signify that countries have regulations which retard entry into the
market place while high scores indicate ease of market entry.

Appendix C. Calculations for Energy Expenditure Trends

To calculate a 24-hour time budget for physical activity we first divide the week into four
activities: highly active work, less active work, active leisure time and everything else. The
proportion of the population level engaged in each type of work activity is obtained from the
World Development Indicators (detailed in Appendix A). Participation levels for leisure-time
physical activity are obtained from individual-level surveys (detailed in Appendix B). We
assume a 40-hour work week and 7 hours of leisure-time physical activity per week. To
determine the amount of time spent in each activity we multiply the fraction of the population
participating in the activity by the average number of hours. These values are reported in
columns one and two.

Each activity is assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score based on the classification from
Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth BE 1993). The MET score for an activity is
defined as the ratio of the metabolic rate associated with that activity divided by the resting
metabolic rate. One MET is the rate at which adults burn calories at rest; this is approximately
one kcal per kilogram (kg) of body weight per hour (expressed as 1 kcal/kg/hr). We calculate the
MET hours for each activity by multiplying the hours spent in each activity by the assigned MET
score. We assume that eight hours of the activity type labeled “everything else” is sleeping. The
difference in MET hours from 1990 to 2001 is reported in the third column.

To find the caloric equivalent, the assigned MET value is multiplied by the amount of time spent
in each activity and by average weight. The change in calories from 1990 and 2001 is reported in
the fourth column.

To translate the change in calories into pounds we use weight equation from Cutler et al (2003)
shown below:

                              K = α + (ß + E) * Weight + 0.1 * K

where K represents calories consumed (we use 2268 kcal/day based on the average of caloric
intake for men and women in the NHANES 1999-2000); α + ß * Weight represents the basal
metabolic rate; 0.1 * K represents the thermic effect of food; and E represents physical activity.
Together, these three factors represent total energy expenditure. The basal metabolic rate refers
to the energy necessary to keep the body alive and represents about 60 percent of all energy
expenditure. The higher a person’s weight the more energy is necessary to sustain bodily
functions. Estimates for α and ß are from the literature. α: men = 879 and women = 829; ß: men
= 11.6 and women = 8.7 (Schofield WN et al. 1985). Weight is measured in kilograms. The
thermic effect of food is the energy necessary to process food and represents about 10 percent of
daily energy expenditure. Physical activity (E) represents the remaining 30 percent of energy
expenditure. We calculate E as follows:

First, we calculate energy expenditure as a ratio of resting metabolic rate. This is done by
summing the MET values from the individual activities to find the total MET hours per day and
dividing by the total number of hours in a day. This ratio is calculated for each country where a
represents each type of activity as follows:


                                                49
                                             ∑    a
                                                       timea * METa
                                   ratio =
                                                      ∑   a
                                                              timea

Next, we find the per-kilogram average energy expenditure for physical activity (E) net of
resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is about 1-kilogram per kilogram hour. We assume average
weight to be 65 kg (143 pounds) and calculate E as follows:

                                              RMR * (ratio -1)
                                      E=
                                                 weight

Given that we are interested in weight, we rearrange the weight equation from Cutler et al.
(2003) in the following way:
                                                       .9K - α
                                             W=
                                                       (ß + E)

To determine the effect of weight change on the percent obese we use individual-level data from
England, Japan and the United States. For each country, we add the weight change to each
person in the distribution, recalculate BMI, and recalculate the percent obese. This value is
reported in the last column of the table. Those countries without individual-level data are
matched to the country with individual-level data which most closely approximates their level of
obesity in 1990. We calculate the percent increase in obesity for an additional pound in England,
Japan and the United States. Next, we proportionately apply the known percent increase in
obesity from the most closely related country and recalculate the percent obese.

Appendix D: Overestimation of the Food Balance Sheets

We look at the overestimation of the change in caloric supply data in the table below. The first
and second columns of the table illustrate the country and available years of survey data,
respectively. The third column describes the change in obesity over the period. The fourth
column provides estimates of the average percent increase in weight which is calculated using
two steps. First, we determine how much average weight would need to increase around the BMI
cutoff to explain the observed increase in percent obese. Second, using the impact around the
cutoff, we add the same percent increase in obesity to each person in the individual-level
distribution and observe what average weight change is implied. This individual-level data is
available for England, Japan and the United States. (For those countries where individual-level
data was not available, we used the estimate of the percent increase in obesity from the country
with the closest initial level of obesity.) The fifth column gives the observed change in caloric
supply over the period. The sixth column includes estimates of the calories required for the
observed increase in weight using the weight equation from Cutler et al. (2003). The final
column provides a calculation of the overestimation of the Food Balance Sheets (the ratio of our
predicted change in caloric supply to the actual change in caloric supply). Given that caloric
supply may fluctuate significantly in the short term, we only include those countries with at least
ten years of trend data.

With the exception of Australia and Finland, where caloric supply is significantly lower than our
estimate of the calories required for weight gain, the overestimation of caloric supply ranges
from approximately a factor of one in Denmark and Japan to approximately a factor of three in
the United States. This overestimation may be attributable to household wastage in the Food
Balance Sheets.
