          International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination

              When Policy—Makers Disagree on the Model



                              ABSTRACT



          The existing literature on international macroeconomic policy
coordination makes the unrealistic assumption that policy—makers all
know the true model, from which it follows in general that the Nash
bargaining solution is superior to the Nash non—cooperative solution.
But everything changes once we recognize that policy-makers' models
differ from each other and therefore from the "true" model. It is still
true that the two countries will in general be able to agree on a
cooperative policy package that each believes will improve the objective
function relative to the Nash non-cooperative solution. However, the
bargaining solution is as likely to move the target variables in the
wrong direction as in the right direction, in the light of a third true
model.

          This paper illustrates these theoretical points with monetary
and fiscal multipliers taken from simulations of eight leading
international econometric models. (It is a sequel to NBER Working Paper
1925, which considered coordination between the domestic monetary and
fiscal authorities.) Here we first consider coordination between U.S.
and non—U.S. central banks. We find that out of 512. possible
combinations of models that could represent U.S. beliefs, non—U.S.
beliefs and the true model, coordination improves U.S. welfare in only
289 cases, reducing it in 206, and improves the welfare of other OECD
countries in only 297 cases, reducing it in 198. Then we consider
coordination with both monetary and fiscal policy. We find that out of
512 combinations, coordination improves U.S. welfare in 183 cases,
reducing it in 228, and improves the welfare of other OECD countries in
283 cases, reducing it in 219. A final section of the paper considers
possible extensions of the framework, dealing with uncertainty.

          International policy coordination has been the fastest-growing

research topic in the field of open-economy macroeconomics.1 The topic

owes its success to the happy marriage of the mathematical techniques of

game theory and the practical problem of coordination that has in the

mid—1980s become of central concern to international policy—makers.

Virtually all of the coordination literature has made the automatic

assumption that policy-makers agree on the true model of how the world

macroeconomy behaves. As a consequence, it has reached a very strong

conclusion: in general, countries will be better off it they coordinate

policies than they would be in the Nash non-cooperative equilibrium in

which each government sets its policies while taking those of the others

as given.2 The empirical literature is as yet less fully developed than

the theoretical literature. But it too has claimed gains from

coordination that, though small, are necessarily positive.3 If the case

in favor of coordination is indeed this clear, one might wonder at the

stupidity of governments in not pursuing it more seriously.

         The assumption that policy—makers agree on the true model has

little, if any, empirical basis. Different governments subscribe to

different economic philosophies. If one wishes to think of actors as

perpetually processing new information in a Bayesian manner, so that

their models over time would converge on any given reality in the limit,

then one must admit that the speed of convergence is sufficiently slow,

or else that reality is changing sufficiently rapidly, that

policy-makers have not been able to reach agreement on the true model.

Nor is there much prospect of them doing so in the foreseeable future.

          Professional economists are not much more able to agree on the

correct macroeconomic model than are policy—makers. A concrete
                                   —2--



illustration was offered by a recent exercise at the Brookings

Institution. Ralph Bryant and Dale Henderson asked those responsible

for twelve leading econometric models of the world economy to simulate

the effects of some carefully—specified policy changes.k The

predictions of the models varied widely as to both the magnitude and

the sign of the effects on output, inflation, exchange rates and current

account balances among trading partners and even in the country

originating the policy change. (See tables 1 and 6 below.) Obviously

no more than one of the models can be right, and it seems unlikely that

even one of them is in fact exactly right.

          Lack of knowledge as to the true model helps explain a

troublesome fact. While support for the proposition that coordination

would improve welfare is widespread, proponents do not generally agree

on the nature of the Pareto-improving package of policy changes that is

called for in any particular set of circumstances. Some call for

coordinated expansion, some for coordinated discipline, some for

coordinated shifts in the mix between monetary and fiscal policy, and so

forth.5 Obviously if one sort of package would raise welfare, then

others would lower welfare. Disagreement, even within one country, as

to where the economy currently sits relative to the desired values of

the target variables is responsible f or some of the disagreement on the

desirable coordinated policy changes, but disagreement as to the correct

model is also a significant factor. As Branson (1986, 176) says, "With

this range of disagreement on economic analysis, how are the negotiators
                                    —3—



to   reach agreement? The topic is one for the National Science

Foundation, not a new Bretton Woods."

           One implication of the lack of agreement on the true model is,

of course, that "more research needs to be done." But the implications

for any policy coordination that might take place in the meantime are

considerably more interesting. This paper demonstrates two propositions

that hold when policy—makers disagree on the model. First, in contrast

to what one might think before careful reflection, such policy—makers

will in general be able to find a package of coordinated policy changes

that each believes will improve its country's welfare relative to the

sub—optimal Nash noncooperative equilibrium.6 Second, and in striking

contrast to the standard result when policy-makers agree on the model,

the package of coordinated policy changes could turn out to reduce

welfare, as judged by some true model of reality, as easily as raise it.

For example, using eight models from the Brookings simulations as models

which could represent the views of the U.S. government, the views of

other industrialized countries, or the true world macroeconomy, we find

that out of 512 possible combinations, monetary coordination perceptibly

improves U.S. welfare in only 289 cases, reducing it in 206 cases, and

improves the welfare of the other industrialized countries in only 297

cases, reducing it in 198.

           The first two sections of the paper analyze a very simple game

where two countries, the United States and Europe, must decide how to

set their money supplies so as to come as close as possible to their

desired levels of two target variables: income and the current account
                                   —14—



(internal balance and external balance). Section 1 makes the two points

theoretically, that the two central banks will in general be able to

agree on a coordinated policy package that each thinks leaves its

country in a better position, and that the package might in fact leave

them in a worse position. Section 2 uses the multipliers from the eight

models in the Brookings simulations to provide a dramatic illustration-

of the points.

          In section 3 each government is given a second policy

instrument, government expenditure, to use, in addition to monetary

policy, and a third target variable, inflation, to pursue in addition to

income and the current account. Again we see that the governments will

in general find a coordinated policy package that they expect to improve

welfare, but that it could as easily have the opposite effect in

reality. Section $ considers extensions of the framework to deal with

the policy—maker's uncertainty regarding the true model, or the other

player's model, or both.

Section 1: The Theory of Monetary Coordination with Disagreement

             Here we assume that each country is interested in two target

variables: its own output, denoted y for the United States and y for

Europe (expressed relative to their optimum values and in log form), and

its current account balance, denoted x and x respectively (expressed as

a percentage of GNP and again relative to their optimums). Each

government seeks to minimize a quadratic loss function.

(1)     W =       y2+wx2
(2)           =   y*2 + w x2
where w and u* denote the relative weights placed on external balance

versus internal balance.

             We assume a general framework in which the targets are

linearly related to the available policy instruments, which in this

section are limited to the countries' money supplies, m and m*

respectively (in log form). We denote the parameters as perceived by

the U.S. authorities by a "us" subscript.

(3)     y=Aus÷Cusm÷Eusm*
(14)    x=Bus+Dusm+Fusm*
We denote the parameters perceived by the European government by an "e"

subscript.

(5)     y*=Ge+Iem+Kem*
(6)     x*He+Jem+Lem*
             Since each country has only a single instrument but two

targets, it cannot unilaterally achieve Its targets. We begin by

considering the Nash non-000peraclve equilibrium. To ascertain U.S.

behavior we differentiate (1) with respect to m, using (3) and ('4) and

holding m constant. It follows that the U.S. reaction function Is:

(7)     m=M+Nm*,
             A C   wB D
where    M=- us us÷ us us
                      C
                          us
                                  -,
                                       +   iD us
                  E

and
                              Cus +wD us
To ascertain European behavior we differentiate (2) with respect to rn,

using (5) and (6) and holding m constant. The European reaction

function is:

             GK +w*H eLe
where    Q=- ee    *

                              e

                          e
                                            *
                                                L
                                                 e


We solve equations (7) and (8) for the Nash equilibrium.

          Figure 1 shows the two policy—makers' reaction functions,

equations (7) and (8). The optimum point as perceived by the U.S.

policy-makers is a point                             on its reaction function. Concentric

indifference curves radiate from                              These curves are vertical

wherever they intersect the reaction function, because m is chosen so

that its marginal benefit given m* is zero. Similarly the optimum point

as perceived by the European policy-maker is a point E' and its

concentric indifference curves are horizontal wherever they intersect

its reaction function.

          We have drawn the European reaction curve as steeper than the

U.S. curve. One might expect that the effects that are largest in

absolute value are the positive effects of money on domestic output: C

in equations (3) -   ()   for the United States and K in equations (5)—(6)

for the non-U.S. OECD.7 It follows that, unless the welfare weight o on

the current account is large, the absolute value of the slope of the

U.S. reaction function is less than one when the U.S. money supply is on

the vertical axis, and vice versa for the European reaction function.

          The possibilities for the sign of the slope are more diverse.

If monetary expansion is thought to be transmitted negatively to trading

partners (E < 0), presumably via a depreciation of the currency and

improvement in the trade balance of the expanding country as in the

Mundell—Fleming model, then the slope is positive: N > 0. If monetary

transmission is thought to be positive on the other hand CE > 0), then

the slope is ambiguous: when the welfare weight w on the current

account is small, the slope is negative, but when w is large, or when

the transmission multiplier E Is small (relative not only to the own

multiplier C, but also to the current account multipliers D and F), the

slope is again positive.     (We are assuming that D and F, the effects of m

and m* on the domestic current account, are of opposite signs by symmetry.)
                                    —8—


          The same analysis holds for the foreign reaction function

(e.g., I < 0 => R > 0), though it must be remembered that even if any

given model is symmetric, the two reaction functions could easily have

opposite slopes. For example one country might believe that

transmission is negative and the other that it is positive. In figure 1

we have drawn the functions downward-sloping: a foreign expansion is

transmitted positively to the domestic country and so the domestic

government reacts by contracting.

          The Nash equilibrium N is determined as the intersection of

the two reaction functions. At N the indifference curves cannot be

tangent, but must intersect, since their respective slopes are infinity

and zero. It follows that the Nash equilibrium is perceived as

Pareto—inefficient. Both policy—makers think they would be better off

if they could agree to move to a point within the "lens" determined by

the intersection of the two indifference curves.

          As we have drawn the graph, each country would like to expand

but is afraid to do so on its own, presumably because of adverse

implications for the current account. But they can agree to expand

simultaneously, moving northeastward in the graph to higher levels of

perceived welfare. Such joint reflation is the kind of international

coordination that has been urged on Germany and Japan by the United

States under two different Administrations: in 1977—78, in the form of

the "locomotive theory," and in 1986 in the form of coordinated discount

rate cuts.8
                                                       —9—

             If an efficient mechanism of coordination exists, the

countries will move, not just northeastward, but specifically to one of'

the points on the contract curve, where the two countries' indifference

curves are tangent. There is no strong reason to choose any particular

point. Nor, for that matter, is there reason to think that any

Pareto-improving solution can necessarily be enforced. But we follow

much of the literature in consIdering the Nash bargainIng solution,

defined as the point where the product of the two countries' perceived

welfare gains, compared to the perceived welfare at the Nash

noncooperative solution, is maximized:

One would differentiate with respect to m and m* to find the bargaining

solution (mb, m*b), a point such as B in figure 2.

             Once we recognize that the two policy—makers have different

models of the world, we must recognize that one, or both, will be wrong.
                                             — 10 —




To evaluate whether the bargaining solution B is superior to the

noncooperative solution (m", m*r) not just in perception but also in

reality, we would have to know the true parameter values, the output and

current account functions (3)—(6) without the subscripts:

(12)      y =A+Cm+Em*
(13)      x =     B + D rn + F


(114)     y=G+Im+Km*
(15)      x =     H +   J   in +   L   rn*




We would then plug mb and m*b into (12)—(15), and in turn plug the

target variables Into the loss functions (1) and (2), to see whether the

bargaining solution in fact improves welfare.

          In the standard case where the policy-makers agree on the

correct model, coordination must necessarily improve welfare for each

country, or else its government would not have agreed to go along. In

our case, coordination may improve welfare. For example if the true

model is very close to that believed by the U.S. authorities, then the

true iso—welfare map will be very similar to the perceived indifference

curves shown in figure 1, and U.S. welfare will indeed be higher at B

than N. But this need not be the case.

          The true optimum policy combination to maximize U.S. welfare

is given by differentiating (1) with respect to in (as in the derivation

of (7) but without the subscripts), and with respect to m*, and solving

simultaneously:

If the true optimum point 0 is not at Ous but rather is as shown in

Figure 2, with the new set of true Iso—welfare curves drawn, then the

move from N to B could very well be In the wrong direction, resulting in

a reduction in U.S. welfare. Similarly If the true optimum policy

combination from the viewpoint of European Interests is not at e but

rather at P as shown In Figure 2, then coordination could reduce

European welfare as well.

                It is worth considering momentarily the case when the two

policy—makers are seeking to maximize the identical objective function,

and disagree only about the proper model. For example they might be the

monetary and fiscal authority within the same country. Our two

propositions would still hold:             (1) the two policy—makers will in

general be able to agree on a package of coordinated policy changes that

each thinks will improve the (same) country's welfare relative to the

Nash noncooperative solution, and (2) the package agreed to in

bargaining could in fact worsen welfare as easily as Improve it. This

is the case considered in Frankel (1986b).9 While in that paper

coordination arises solely from different perceptions, and in the

conventional literature it arises solely from different objectives, in

the present paper both factors are present.

Section 2: Coordination with Eight International Econometric Models
        How important for coordination Is the issue of' conflicting

models likely to be in practice? Is the case where bargaining reduces

welfare as judged by the true model merely a pathological

counterexample, or is it a likely occurrence? In what follows we use

the   international simulation results of the macro—econometric models

that participated in the Brookings exercise to get an idea of what might

actually happen if governments coordinate.

          The models were asked to show the effects of four experiments,

among others: an increase in the U.S. money supply, an increase in the

non—U.S. OECD money supply, an increase in U.S. government expenditure

and an increase in non-U.S. OECD government expenditure. In each case

the instructions were to hold the other policy instruments constant.

Though twelve models participated, some did not report effects on

current account balances, which we need along with effects on output

levels. The eight that we can use here are the Federal Reserve Board's

Multi—Country Model (MCM), Patrick Minford's Liverpool Model (LIVPL),

the Sims—Litterman Vector AutoRegression Model (VAR), the OECD's

 forward—looking in expectations formation, European and American In
 authorship, and public—sector and private—sector in function.

             Table la reports the effects of monetary expansion on several

macroeconomic variables. The simulations showed effects over six years,

 but ours is a static framework; we use only the effect in the second

year. (Two years is intended to be just long enough to get past the

negatIve    part of the "J—curve effect" of   the   exchange rate on   the trade

balance.)     Table   1 reports the multipliers for output and the current

account   calculated in the form that we need: as a percentage of GNP per
one percent change in the money supply. The models all agree that a
monetary    expansion raises domestic output, but they agree on little else.

There is a surprising amount of disagreement, in particular, on whether

a monetary expansion improves or worsens the current account and, in

turn, on whether it is transmitted negatively or positively to the rest

of the world. The reasons for this and other disagreements in the

simulations are examined elsewhere.1° It suffices to repeat that

disagreements with respect to both the sign and magnitude of effects are

common among honorable economists, and are common even within subsets of

models that are supposedly similar in orientation, let alone among

policy-makers.

            Computing the policy—makers' reactions requires knowing not

only the perceived policy multipliers, but also the target optimums and

the welfare weights. We adopt the same target values as Oudiz and Sachs

(19814): current accounts of zero for the United States and two percent

of GNP for the non—U.S. OECD, and GNP gaps of zero for both regions.

The baseline values of both variables, specified as part of the

Brookings simulation exercise, were below target as of 1985. Thus
policy—makers will seek to Increase both output and the current account.

The targets, together with the baseline values for the variables and any

set of policy multipliers from Table 1, imply corresponding values for

the constant terms A, B, G and H in equations (3)—(6).

chose the values that the weights would have had to have held for

countries to have produced the values of output, Inflation and the

current account actually observed In the 1980s, assuming a Nash

non—cooperative equilibrium. For lack of a better alternative, we adopt

the set of weights calculated by Oudiz and Sachs for the EPA model, and

apply it uniformly regardless of model. We do not replicate their

methodology separately with each model, because our welfare comparisons

require a common objective function. But we have examined the

sensitivity of our results to different welfare weights, and to

different optimum values for the targets as well; we found no

qualitative change in the results.11

                       If the U.S. policy-maker can believe any of the eight models

and the non-U.S. (henceforth "European") policy—maker can believe any of

the eight models, then there are 8 x 8                                  61 possible combinations, each

implying a different Nash non-cooperative equilibrium. In Table 2 we

report 6 x 6 = 36 of them.                        (8 x 8 is a bit too unwieldly for one

table.)

          For each combination we report first whether the Nash
equilibrium is stable, and the number of moves needed to reach

convergence starting from the baseline.12 We then report the values of

the two countries' variables of' interest in the equilibrium: the money

supply (relative to the baseline), the perceived output and current

account (relative to baseline, first, and then relative to the optimum)

and the perceived welfare function (relative to the baseline). It

usually turns out that both countries think they can do better than the

baseline even without cooperating, but not always. All but two of' the

36 cases call for expansion by one country or the other.

          Our main interest lies in the move from the non—cooperative to

the bargaining equilibrium, shown in Table 3. To take one example, if

the U.S. policy-maker believes in the MCM model and the European

policy—maker believes In the OECD model, then they can agree to expand

further their money supplies simultaneously (0.36 percent and 1.59

percent, respectively). They each believe that this policy package will

result in higher output with little adverse effect on their current

accounts. This is the often-mentioned case in which the Nash equilibrium

is too contractionary. But besides the case of simultaneous expansion

(9 combinations of models), every other case Is possible, as well:

European expansion with U.S. contraction (12 combinatIons), U.S.

expansion with European contraction (8 combinations), and simultaneous

contraction (5 cases).

          Without knowing the true model, we can not determine whether

any given policy package actually improves welfare. But we can get a
                                    — 16 —




good idea of the possibilities by trying out each of the models as a

candidate for the true model. The 36 cells in Tables 14 and 5 correspond

to the same 36 combInations as Tables 2 and 3. But within each cell we

report the effect that the corresponding coordination package of Table 3

would have under each of the 6 models; thus there are 63   216

combinations altogether.13 Table 14 shows the actual effect of

coordination on U.S. welfare and Table 5 the effect on European welfare.

Whenever one or the other policy—makers turns out to have had the right

model, his country does gain from coordination. Otherwise he would not

have agreed to the package. For example the Joint monetary expansion

that they agree on when the U.S. policy-maker believes the MCM model

and the European policy—maker believes the OECD model is seen to raise

U.S. welfare if the MCM model is the true one (Table 14) and to raise

European welfare if the OECD model Is the true one (Table 5). It also

turns out to raise both countries' welfare If the LINK model is the true

one. But it turns out to reduce welfare if the LIVPL, VAR or MSG model

is the correct one. The reader who does not believe in one of the

latter three models might not be concerned with that result. But such a

reader should instead be concerned with the result that when the U.S.

policy-maker, for example, believes in the LIVPL model and the European

policy-maker in the VAR model, coordination will reduce welfare

according to each of the other models.114

          Altogether there are 83 = 512 combinations (counting those

with the EEC and MINIMOD models in addition to those shown in the

tables). Coordination turns out to result in gains for the United
                                       — 17 —




States   in   289 cases, as against losses in 206 cases and no perceptible

effect (to four decimal places) in 17 cases. For Europe there are gains

in 297 cases, as against losses In 198 cases and no effect In 17 cases.

These figures in a sense overstate the odds in favor of successful

coordination, in that by construction each country's welfare is improved

(or at least not worsened) In 1/8 of the combinations, those in which

the policy—niaker has the same model as the true one, if we exclude such

combinations and take only the 8 x 7 x 6 = 336 combinations where all

three models are different, the margin is narrower. For the United

States there are gains in 168 cases, as against losses in 156 cases and

no effect in 12.      For Europe there are gains in 170 cases, losses in 1514

and no effect In 12.

              The results thus suggest that the danger that coordination

will worsen welfare rather than improve It Is more than just a

pathological counterexample. It is true, but beside the point, that the

proper strategy, if the correct model could be discovered, would be

simply for both policy—makers to optimize subject to it. The point is

that one cannot, under conditions where policy—makers do subscribe to

different models, make the blanket pronouncement that coordination must

Improve welfare.


Section 3: International Coordination of Monetary and Fiscal Policy
            Together


              In this section we give each country a second tool, government

expenditure — g for the United States and g* for Europe. We must add a

'third target variable for each country; otherwise each will be able to




                                                                                1

attain   its optimal point regardless what the other country does. We

choose the inflation rate. Now 214 multipliers are relevant from each

model: the effects of m, m*, g and g* on U.S. output, current account

and inflation and European output, current account and inflation.

           Table 6 reports the 214 multipliers for each of the eight

models. There Is not as much disagreement regarding fiscal policy as

monetary policy. A domestic fiscal expansion in most of the models is

transmitted positively to the other country,          via a domestic

current account deficit. But a few models have fiscal or monetary

expansion reducing the domestic price level rather than raising It.

           We again assume that each country seeks to minimize a

quadratic loss function. Rather than repeating our earlier points in

algebraic form, we turn directly to the simulation results. As before,

the weights and target optimums are taken from Oudiz and Sachs (19811).

The inflation target is zero for both the United States and Europe.

Thus policy—makers will seek to reduce inflation, as well as increase

output and the current account.

           Table 7 reports the Nash non—cooperative equilibrium for the

six models.15 The movement from the baseline to the Nash involves

fiscal expansion as often as contraction. (Both fiscal authorities

contract in 9 case, both expand in 9, and only one expands in 18.) But

the money supply Is expanded more often (both central banks contract in

8 cases, both expand in 18 cases, and one expands in 10.)

           Table 8 reports the Nash bargaining solution. To take one

example, when the United States subscribes to the LINK model and Europe

to   the LIVPL model, the resulting package of coordinated policy changes

takes exactly the form urged by many economists in the 1980s:    a U.S.

fiscal contraction, accompanied by a fiscal expansion in the rest of the

OECD and monetary expansion all around.16 This package is considered

desirable because it would depreciate the dollar and reduce the U.S.

current account deficit (and European and Japanese surplus) without

causing a large world recession.17 But most other possible kinds of

policy packages occur as well: U.S. fiscal contraction and monetary

expansion accompanied by either European expansion (6 cases) or European

fiscal contraction and monetary expansion (9 cases); general U.S.

contraction accompanied In Europe by either general expansion (1 case),

loose fiscal and tight money (3 cases), tight fiscal, loose money (3

cases) or general contraction (1); general U.S. expansion accompanied in

Europe by either general expansion (3), monetary expansion and fiscal

contraction (1), or general contraction (1); and, finally, U.S. fiscal

expansion and monetary contraction accompanied In Europe by either

general expansion (1), fiscal expansion and monetary contraction (2),

fiscal contraction and monetary expansion (2), or general contraction

(3)18
           Tables 9 and 10 show the true gains from coordination for the

U.S. and Europe, respectively. Again we find that coordination

necessarily improves U.S. welfare if the U.S. model turns out to be the

correct one, and European welfare if the European model turns out to be

the correct one, but that otherwise welfare can go down. Of the

total 512 combinations of all eight models, the United States has gains
                                    — 20 —



in   282 cases, losses in 228, and no perceptible effect In 2. Europe has

gains In 283 cases, losses in 219, and no effect In 10. If we take only

the 336 combinations where the U.S. model, European model and true model

are all different, bargaining results in U.S. gains In 183 cases and

losses in 153, and for Europe gains in 166 cases and losses in 170.

Thus the odds for successful coordination appear to be no better when

policy-makers can take advantage of the monetary—fiscal mix than when

the degree of monetary ease is alone at stake.



Section U: Extensions

           This paper has made the simplest assumptIons to examine the

topic at hand. But many extensions suggest themselves. Most have to do

with the introduction of uncertainty, which would seem to come

hand-in—hand with the consideration of disagreement regarding the true

model. We here briefly discuss four such possible extensions.

           To begin with, even if we retain our assumption that each

policy-maker believes in his own model with certainty, he may be

uncertain as to the model in which the other policy—maker believes. In

the present paper it was assumed that each observes directly the other's

policy settings, money supplies or government expenditures, so that each

has no need to know the other's model. (Each could infer the other

government's model from its policy actions, if it cared to.) But one

could assume instead that the policy-maker does not observe the foreign

governments policies continuously (think of the central bank's Ml

target, as opposed to current Ml) and that when it is making its
                                                     — 21 —




decision,   it must guess what the other might do based on (uncertain)

guesses as to the other's model. Then the policy—maker will set its

policies so as to maximize expected welfare, a weighted average of the

economic consequences of each of the policy-settings that the foreign

government would choose under each of the possible models in which it

might believe. The foreign government's policy settings in turn will

depend, not just on its model, but also on its beliefs about what the

first country's model, and therefore its actions, might be. So the

ordinary Nash equilibrium involves an extra degree of simultaneity.

            The U.S. central bank chooses m to minimize

             8       *                  *
                         w(m1, m. )


where 1TI* is the U.S. estimate of the probability that Europe believes

in model I and rnj* Is the money supply Europe will pick if it believes

In model I. If the U.S. central bank believes In, for example, model 1,

then the first order condition is similar to equation (7), but with the

foreign money supply replaced by a weighted average of the

possibilities:

                                   8        *    *
(7')             =       +
            m1               N1         it1 mi
                                  i=1


or

                 = H1 +

where jr'   is   the row vector of irj and m* Is the column vector of mj*

(each for 1=1,8, assuming eight possible models).
                                                     — 22 —




                 Similarly           the European central bank chooses m to minimize

                  8
                  E      irj   Wj*(mj,        m*),
                 1=1


where vj is the European estimate of the probability that the United

States believes in model i, and mi is the money supply the United States

will pick if it believes in model I. If the European central bank

believes in, for example, model 2, then the first order condition is

(8')             m2 =               + R2(ii'm)
where it'    is       the row vector of itj and in is the column vector of in1.    We


have one version of equation (7') for each of the eight models in which

the U.S. central bank might believe, giving

(7")                     M +       N(lr*fm*)
and similarly for Europe,

(8")             m =      Q +       R(ir'm)
where N, N, Q and R are the vector forms of M1, N1, Q1 and

respectively. Substituting and solving,

(12)             m =     [I    —
                                   Nrr*?RirJ_l [ + Nir'Q}
(13)             rn* =             — Rir?Nit*?} [ + Rw'M]
where I is the identity matrix.

                 Equations (12)—(13) represent the 8x8 computable Nash

non—cooperative solutions for the 8x8 combinations of models in which

the two policy—makers could believe. As a concrete example we could try

putting equal weight on each of our eight Brookings models:

   =
       irj   =    1/8 (1=1,8). The bargaining solution remains the same as

before, assuming that each policy—maker reveals his model as part of the
                                       — 23 —




cooperative   bargain. As before we could calculate in each case the gain

or loss in welfare entailed in the move from one equilibrium to the

other, where the true effect of any given pair of money supplies is

judged by each of the eight models in turn.

          The second extension would view policy-makers as not so

stubborn as to believe in their own models with certainty. Now they

assign some probability to the possibility that each of the eight models

may be true, and choose their policies so as to maximize expected

welfare, as in Brainard (1967).19 In a simple version we could go back

to assuming that each knows the views of the other policy-maker (now a

set of probabilities). We could even assume that each modifies in a

Bayesian manner his own beliefs when he learns the beliefs of the other

player. However if each is so reasonable as to base his beliefs solely

on the statistical estimator that optimally combines the data available

to him with that available to the other player, then each will come to

the same conclusion. To get disagreement about the model —— and it is

the premise of this line of research that such disagreement is an

accurate description and crucial characteristic of the actual

policy—making environment -—   It   Is necessary that the policy—makers have

either Incomplete access to each other's data or (what can be thought of

as much the same thing) different Bayesian priors.

          The third extension would be to assume both uncertainty about

the true model (as in the second extension) and uncertainty about what

probabilities the other policy—maker assigns to the models (as in the

first extension). Here it would be possible to assume that the
                                      — 2I   —




policy-makers    originally shared the same priors, but that they have

observed different sets of data and have come to different conclusions

for that reason. Let Z1 be the set of data from which U.S. economists

obtained the maximum likelihood point estimates of the parameters that

we have been calling model 1. Such estimates come with standard errors

that imply (in terms of classical statistics) the probabilities that one

could    have observed Z1 condItIonal on each of the other models in fact
being true, or (in terms of Bayesian statistics) the probabilities that
each of the models could in fact be true conditional on the known fact
that Z1 has been observed. Similarly if Z2 is the set of data from

which   European economists obtained a maximum likelihood   estimate that we

have    been calling model 2, then Bayesian methods will give us
(conditional on Z2 and a set of priors, which may be the     same as the

U.S.    set of priors) European probabilities that each of the models is
true.    Then each policy-maker will choose his money supply so as to

maximize expected welfare, taking into account all the different data

sets that the other central bank could have drawn and the money supplies

that it would consequently set, and also taking into account the

different possible true models and the consequent etfects on the

macroeconomy. The interesting application of Bayesian principles comes

in the realization that the two kinds of uncertainty are not independent.

The probability that a given action by the foreign central bank will

have the consequences implied by model 2 is greater if that action is

the one that would be optimally chosen based on the observation of the
                                    — 25 -



data set Z2, i.e., that data set that would imply model 2 as the maximum

likelihood estimate.

          These three extensions are more elaborate models of the Nash

non—cooperative equilibrium, but none offers an evident reason for

altering our conclusion that the bargaining solution is as likely to

reduce welfare as to improve it. For those interested in making

coordination work, it is natural to ask whether there might not be some

other cooperative solution concept (that is, mapping from the players'

beliefs and welfare functions to their policy settings) that would turn

out to Improve welfare by light of the true model more often than does

the Nash bargaining equilibrium in Tables 14 and 5.

          Under certain conditions, the weighted average of two

statistical estimators will be a better estimator of a parameter than

either considered alone. If the policy—makers' models are treated as

different statistical estimators of the true model, it might be better

to channel the bargaining process to focus on parameters rather than

directly on policy settings, and then to set policy so as to maximize

joint welfare under the compromise model. It is not obvious what is the

relevant stage at which to "average to get the best parameter estimate."

Do we want the best estimates of the structural parameters such as the

elasticities of money demand? The best estimates of functions of those

such as the reduced form money multipliers C and D? Functions of those

like the reaction parameter N? These alternatives are not equivalent

because the functions are nonlinear. If, following the Nash bargaining

solution, the goal is to maximize the product of the countries' expected
                                     — 26 —




weif are   gains relative to the Nash noncooperative equilibrium, then the

first-order conditions turn out to be stated in terms of expected

products of multipliers such as E(CH), the expectation (based on

available data) of the product of the multiplier of U.S. money on U.S.

income and the multiplier of European money on U.S. income. If we were

willing to think of each model's estimate of CII as being equal to the

true CH plus an independent random error (which could be either of equal

or different variances across models), then the best estimate of CII

conditional on any two available models 1 and 2 would be a weighted

average of their estimates e(CH)1 + (1—e)(CH)2 (with either equal or

unequal weights, as appropriate). The coordinating agent would then

calculate the value of in and m* that satisfied the first order

conditions in terms of these averaged multiplier-products, and would

instruct the two central banks to adopt those monetary policies,

assuming they wish to avoid a breakdown to the Nash non-cooperative

equilibrium. The extension of the present line of research would be to

calculate the effects of such compromises by using, again, each of the

eight models as possible true models, and to see if the result is an

improvement in the countries' welfare levels any more often than when

the conventional Nash bargaining solution Is used. If so, the

prescriptive implication would be that policy—makers in OECD or G—7

meetings might better spend their time debating directly their views of

the world, rather than debating only over the policies that they would

like each other to adopt.

          It   is not a matter of deciding whether the treatment in the

present paper is adequate. Extensions such as those sketched in this

section need to be pursued. It is only a matter of sorting out which

extensions are highest priority, a process In which we trust some of our

readers will assist.
                                 FOOTNOTES



    Hamada (1976) is generally credited with the birth of the topic in
    its modern analytic form (though under the assumption of fixed
    exchange rates). More recent contributions Include Canzonerl and
    Gray (1983). Miller and Salmon (1985), Rogoff (1985) and Buiter and
    Marston (1985). For good introductions to the literature and
    further references, see Oudiz and Sachs (19811) or Cooper (1985).

2   There are two important qualifications to the generality of the
    proposition that coordination improves welfare under the standard
    assumption that policy—makers know the true model. The first Is
    that if policy-makers have enough independent instruments to reach
    their optimum target goals regardless of each others' actions, then
    coordination is moot. The second is that Rogoff (1985) and Kehoe
    (1986) have shown that if coordination reduces governments' ability
    to precommit to anti—inflationary policies, credibly to their own
    peoples, then it can reduce welfare. The present paper is a
    counterexample along very different lines.

3   Oudlz   and Sachs (198'!) and Ishli, McKibbin and Sachs (1985).

    The project was entitled "Empirical Macroeconomics for
    Interdependent Economic." Frankel (1986a) discusses the
    disagreements among the 12 models.

5   Indeed many of the authors in the coordination literature decline to
    take any position at all on whether the problem with the Nash
    non—cooperative equilibrium is that it is too contractionary or too
    expansionary, etc. They leave it for econometriclans to fill in the
    correct parameter values at some later date.

6   One's intuition is that players who disagree about the model will
    find it harder to agree on a package of joint policy changes. The
    correct way to interpret this intuition is probably that, even if
    there exists a bargaining solution that is believed Pareto—superior
    to the non—cooperative solution, It will be harder for the players
    to agree on a mechanism to enforce the bargaining solution if they
    do not share a common view of the world. In an Interesting account
    that he believes may carry lessons for macroeconomic coordination,
    Cooper (1986) describes the history of International cooperation in
    the sphere of public health; cooperation was first proposed early In
    the 19th century, but because there were conflicting schools of
    thought on whether diseases were carried internationally by
    travelers, actual cooperation did not take place until a consensus
    was achieved around 1900 as to the correct model of the transmission
    of disease. If there are positive costs to an enforcement mechanism
    and some parties believe the gains from coordination are small, then
    it will not take place.

7   This holds in the eight econometric models considered in the
    following section except the LIVPL and MSG models.

8   More often, It has been private economists, and the governments of
    smaller countries, who have urged such coordinated expansion; e.g.,

    Bergsten, et al (1982). The 1981-814 Reagan Administration opposed
    coordination.

9   In equations (3) and (14), one could simply redefine m* as fiscal
    policy, and let y y, x x, and                   .
                                                As long as the two
    policy-makers have different parameter estimates, there will still
    be scope for coordination. The only difference is that in Figure 2
    the true optimal points P and 0 would coincide.

10 The positive effect of a monetary expansion on the current account
    via currency depreciation is offset by a negative effect via higher
    income. In the Mundell-Fleming model the positive effect on the
    current account must dominate, to match the net capital outflow that
    results from lower interest rates, giving negative transmission
    abroad. But in more modern models the net capital flow may be
    reversed, In response to perceived overshooting of the exchange rate.
    The theoretical literature contains many other ways of reversing the
    Mundell—Fleming transmission results as well. (See Mussa (1979) or,
    for an optimizing approach, Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1986)). On
    the models used in the Brookings simulations, see Frankel (1986a),
    or other papers In Bryant and Henderson.

11 The alternative weights tried were: first, equal weight on both
    targets and, second, a weight of 20 times greater on the current
    account than on GNP (for both countries). Different targets tried
    were: a GNP target 95% of the baseline level for the US, and a GNP
    target of 95% of the baseline level for Europe. For these
    experiments, the magnitude of the changes in targets and instruments
    was the same as in the example presented. The total count for true
    gains and losses for the two countries were:

           Relative weight ü                                   Cases    of:

12 There is   only one case of technical instability, the combination of
    the MSG   and VAR models. In this case the U.S. reaction function is
    steeper   than the European reaction function because the transmission
    effects   are strong relative to the own multiplier effects.

13 The diagonal entries of the three—dimensional matrix are the cases
    where both policy—makers have the correct model. The calculations
    correspond conceptually to those in Oudiz and Sachs (19811) for the
    MCM and EPA models.

111 The most bizarre combination occurs when the U.S. believes the LIVPL
    model and Europe believes the OECD model. Under this combination,
    the Nash non—cooperative equilibrium entails a mutually destructive
    increase in the European money supply of almost 100 percent and
    decrease in the U.S. money supply of over 100 percent C!)
    (Evidently the problem is that the Liverpool model shows European
    monetary expansion raising U.S. output much more than does U.S.
    monetary expansion, as can be seen in Table 1.)

15 All combinations show technical stability, but convergence is slow
    in several cases.

16 Examples include Blanchard and Dornbusch (19814), Layard et al (19811)
    and Marris (1985).

17 Table 8 shows that according to the MSG model this change in the
    monetary/fiscal mix, though increasing non-U.S. output 0.1 percent
    and having the desired effect on the current accounts, would in fact
    reduce U.S. output 0.7 percent. There are several other
    combinations in the table where this same change in mix results from
    coordination, all of them involving the LIVPL model; but none of
    them shows quite the expected effects on the target variables.

18 As in the case of coordination of monetary policy alone, there are
    a few cases of absurdly large changes, in particular the two
    combinations with the MSG and MCM models. The explanation, again,
    is that these changes offset absurdly large changes implied by the
    move from the baseline to the Nash equilibrium in Table 7.

19 Brainard assumed a continuous probability distribution for the
    parameters (rather than assigning discrete probabilities to 12
    models, as suggested here). Roubini (1986) applies this assumption
    to international coordination.
