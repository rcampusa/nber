Measuring Market Integration: Foreign Exchange Arbitrage and the Gold Standard, 1879-1913

                                        ABSTRACT

A major question in the literature on the classical gold standard concerns the efficiency of

international arbitrage. Authors have examined efficiency by looking at the spread of the gold

points, gold point violations, the flow of gold, or by tests of various asset market criteria, including

speculative efficiency and interest arbitrage. These studies have suffered from many limitations,

both methodological and empirical. We offer a new methodology for measuring market integration

based on nonlinear theoretical models and threshold autoregressions. We also compile a new, high-

frequency series of continuous daily data from 1879 to 1913. We can derive reasonable econometric

estimates of the implied gold points and price dynamics. The changes in these measures over time

provide an insight into the evolution of market integration.

1 Introduction
How can we measure market integration? By way of illustrating a new approach
to the problem, this paper assesses the degree of market integration in the dollar-
sterling foreign exchange market of the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies.
     The focus of our work, therefore, cannot be considered original—the study of
the Anglo-American foreign exchange market has been one of the most actively
pursued avenues of research in economic history. A major issue has been whether
the gold-standard regime was stable and efficient, and tests of this have often
centered on whether the gold points bounded the market exchange rate. The gold
points, the exchange rates at which gold arbitrage would commence, then needed
to be estimated to facilitate the test. Thus, the literature has frequently focused
on getting this estimation right. However, a persistent lacuna in this literature
is suggested by the disconnect between the arduous work devoted to measuring
the gold points, and the apparent lack of progress in documenting the connection
between these measures and the actual behavior of arbitrageurs in the market.
     The conventional wisdom had long been that the rapid and efficient adjustment
of the exchange rate under gold point arbitrage kept the dollar-sterling exchange
stable: in this view, large deviations from par supposedly provoked gold flows
sufficient to keep the rate always within the gold points (Cole 1929; Einzig 1970).
However, influential revisionist contributions by Morgenstern (1959) and Mog-
gridge (1972) sought to depict the classical gold standard as inefficient. Their
estimates of gold points, based on transactions costs, suggested a narrow band,
one frequently “violated” by the actual movements of the exchange rate, even in
monthly time series.1
     Standing up in defense of the conventional wisdom, Officer has produced a
large body of research papers (1983; 1985; 1986; 1989; 1993), culminating in a
seminal book (1996). This corpus of work finds much at fault in the revisionist
literature. For example, the major studies all incorrectly used the cable transfer
rates of exchange when the dominant arbitrage instrument was the demand bill (or
sight bill), and, most importantly, they used ad hoc gold point estimates based on
secondary sources. Officer’s response was to meticulously recalculate gold points
   1 This approach was revisited by Clark (1984), who reached similar conclusions using refined
estimates of transactions costs and found, even more disturbingly, persistent violations that spanned
several monthly periods. Further consternation was caused by Clark’s finding that gold flows
frequently did not correlate with arbitrage opportunities. Similar findings arose in an analysis of
pure exchange-rate time-series behavior in a probabilistic model by Spiller and Wood (1988).

from first principles, for the right instruments, and his summary volume lends
considerable weight to the restoration of the conventional wisdom.
    In a long run context, the conventional view also makes a good deal of intuitive
sense once the years of the classical gold standard are seen in historical perspective.
By the late nineteenth century, the dollar-sterling exchange had reached its peak
level of stability, as shown in Table 1. It should then come as no surprise that
historians also place in this period, circa 1879 to 1913, the likely high-water mark
of international capital mobility in the modern era. Indeed, by some measures, it
is only in very recent years that measures of global financial market integration
match levels seen under the classical gold standard (Eichengreen 1991; Obstfeld
and Taylor 2004).
    We believe that significant new contributions to the literature can be made
in two ways. First, we can better formalize the theory of arbitrage in the markets
concerned; and, second, we can bring more suitable high-frequency data to bear on
the question. In this paper, we make progress on both fronts, but with an approach
that is radically different to any previous method. It is appropriate, then, to spell
out the specific ways in which our analysis departs from the “state of the art” in


                                               2
the current literature.2
    One deficiency in most of this literature, identified by Officer (1996, p. 187)
is a curious dichotomy which finds studies of the gold points and the movement
of the exchange rate almost always divorced from each other. A major aim of this
paper is to formally model the linkage between the two for the first time.
    Officer (1996, pp. 117–21) arrived at his method by discounting all the others.
What are those alternative methods? Officer’s nine categories can be collapsed
into four:
       (a) Consult an Expert or Two. The common method employed by newspa-
       pers a century ago. An “expert” typically meant a foreign-exchange dealer
       or a banker. But such sources may be inconsistent, unrepresentative, omit
       some costs, and may not provide a complete time series.
       (b) Find the Exchange Rate at Which Gold Flows. This elegant method
       has obvious theoretical appeal, using as it does the principle of revealed pref-
       erence. It was suggested over one hundred years ago by Newcomb (1886,
       pp. 281–82), but his suggestions were neglected. The method has been
       applied by various authors (e.g., Clark 1984), but has run into practical diffi-
       culties due to the poor quality of gold-flow data.3 However, later in the paper
       we report some new, seemingly reliable, and previously unused data on gold
       flows that re-open this possibility.
       (c) Use the Exchange-Rate Maximum and Minimum. The advantage of
       this technique is the minimal data requirement. The main problem is the
       maintained assumption: that any gold-point violations are eradicated so in-
       stantaneously by arbitrage that we never observe them. This is clearly, a
       priori, a tenuous assumption; in a moment we will show that it is in fact
       erroneous.
       (d) Break Down All Components of Transaction Costs. The benefit is that
       it makes no maintained theoretical assumptions. The obvious problem is the
       intense data requirement. A less-obvious problem is whether these direct
       cost estimates do indeed correspond to the behavior of the arbitrageurs in
       question.

    Officer proved the feasibility of method (d) whilst casting grave doubt on
   2 See, inter alia Moggridge (1972), Davis and Hughes (1960), Bloomfield (1959), Morgenstern
(1959), Cole (1929), Spalding (1915), Seyd (1868), Goschen (1861), and Officer (1996).
    3 As noted by Officer (1996, 118), the bilateral gold flow data for many periods were, in Mor-

genstern’s (1955) words, “worthless” for fine-scale analysis, and, in Goodhart’s (1969) view, in
need of corrections for four independent sources of error: shipping time, transit shipments via
third countries, incomplete customs reporting, and clerical errors. Moreover, such corrections are
feasible only after 1899, Officer argues.

                                                3
method (a).4 Still, it remains an open question whether the methods (b) and (c)
can be improved upon, and whether they might shed light on the actual process
of arbitrage, one of the weaknesses of method (d). A major contribution of this
paper is to show how to implement a novel variant of Newcomb’s elegant test
in method (b) using a nonlinear model to detect the points at which the onset of
arbitrage behavior begins, whilst using only the time-series properties of the reliable
exchange-rate (price) data, and avoiding the pitfalls of using the dubious gold-flow
(quantity) data in method (c). Even so, for the few years in which new sources of
data can supply more reliable gold-flow data we can perform a cross-check, where
we find qualitative evidence to support our conclusions.
    If our approach is to be feasible, however, a richer dataset is needed than has
been hitherto assembled. Accordingly, in the final and most labor-intensive contri-
bution of the paper, we have constructed by hand a new dataset of high-frequency
(daily) exchange rates from newspapers, a new time-series with a frequency that
more closely corresponds to the adjustment horizon in the actual market. We next
discuss these data, and the operation of the market, before moving on to the theory
and empirics.


2 Data
2.1 Exchange Rates
Previous researchers have relied on monthly, quarterly, or annual data series. Al-
though weekly data are reported in certain sources (e.g., some documents of the
National Monetary Commission), we decided to collect data at the highest fea-
sible frequency for the entire period of the classical gold standard, namely daily
data for the period 1879–1913. This covers every full calendar year of the dollar-
sterling gold standard that began with the restoration of U.S. convertibility after
the Greenback suspension on January 1, 1879, and ended with the suspension of
U.K. convertibility in August 1914 (Officer 1996, pp. 16 and 43).
    We collected the exchange rates based on sterling demand bills in New York
since it is now accepted that the dominant form of arbitrage under the classical gold
   4 For  example, the publication by The Economist of an invariant gold point spread (for several
currencies, probably due to Ernest Seyd) in every issue from late 1877 to 1916 is rightly deemed
unsatisfactory. The critique of shortcut techniques, like those of Clark (1984) that assume some
components of costs, or use cost aggregations, are properly tested against the strict and unforgiving
ruler of repeated fine-scale measurement.


                                                 4
standard was via the demand bill (or sight bill) denominated in sterling and drawn
on London. Only later, in the interwar period, did cable or telegraphic transfers
dominate the market. In earlier periods, the sixty-day bill introduced in colonial
times was the preferred instrument, except for a brief period in the mid-nineteenth
century when a three-day bill was used (Officer 1996, pp. 113–15).5
    We went to the best primary source for these data, the Financial Review, which
tabulated daily data on the New York exchange each year in an annual summary.6
Sight bill quotations are usually in a range, e.g., “4-85 85-1/2” meaning between
4.85 and 4.855 on that day. We convert such ranges to a midpoint. There is
considerable rounding in the quotes: often the finest gradation is one half cent.7
This minimizes the information in the data, and effectively shrinks the meaningful
range of points in the search algorithm to find the best-fit threshold (a blessing, at
least, in terms of computational cost).
    The data cover every trading day, that is, every day except Sundays, holidays,
and a few exceptional days on which the exchange was closed. We discard non-
trading days and perform time series analysis on the series of price quotes for
trading days only. Thus, we have about 300 daily observations on the New York
price of sterling demand bills in each year from 1879 to 1913. This represents an
enormous amount of data for time-series analysis: over 10,000 observations in the
entire sample. With such a dataset we should have ample information to identify
parameters of interest and how they change over time.
    Figure 1 displays the exchange rate deviation xt = E t − E par measured in
dollars where we define parity as the ratio of the fixed mint prices of gold in the
United States (P g , in dollars per ounce) and Britain (P g ∗ , in pounds per ounce),
   5 The  use of bills may seem surprising given the deployment of the first trans-Atlantic cable
in 1866, but it appears to follow from high transaction costs involved in cable transfers and in
securing forward cover for the duration of any gold shipment (Davis and Hughes 1960; Perkins
1975; Officer 1996, pp. 60–63 and 115).
    6 We thank Lawrence Officer for suggesting this source to us. The tabulations covered sight and

sixty-day bills; we compiled both series, but only the information on sight bills is used here. Note
that these are “posted rates” of banks, taken from the weekly data published by the same company
in their Commercial and Financial Chronicle. The weekly publication also published “actual rates”
for transactions, but these were not summarized for the annual review. We do not know which rates
were more relevant for arbitrageurs. However, based on inspections for selected years it is hard to
see any systematic tendency for “posted rates” to diverge from “actual rates,” except for a small
difference in levels. We thank Jan Tore Klovland for pointing out this difference. In principle, one
could comb the weekly publication for the “actual rate” daily observations, but this would require
handling fifty-two times as many publications, and this proved beyond our scope. Instead, we took
the thirty five annual summaries and entered the daily data on “posted rates.”
    7 Specifically, before 1904 the finest distinction is 0.5 cents, thereafter 0.05 cents.

that is, E par = P g /P g ∗ = 4.86656. We note that the maximum deviation from
parity over the full period was slightly more than $0.05 or about 1.06%. The
dynamics of xt will be the object of study in the remainder of the paper. We think
it is fairly clear that xt does not exhibit explosive behavior and we will assume
stationarity in all inference and seek to identify any nonlinear dynamics in the
series as suggested by theory.8

2.2 Gold Flows
Though our initial focus is mainly on arbitrage as it relates to price dynamics, we
will later perform some cross-checks on our analysis by using two new sources
of gold flow data. The quality of gold flow data was first seriously questioned by
   8 If it is not obvious from the chart, we can report that the Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic

(with intercept, linear time trend and three lags chosen by the Schwarz Criterion) was a highly
significant −7.22.


                                                  6
Morgenstern (1955), who found serious discrepancies in many periods between
the reported imports of gold received and the exports of gold sent for several
countries, including the U.S. and Britain. The source of Morgenstern’s data was
the Monthly Summary of Commerce and Finance of the United States published
by the Department of Commerce. Goodhart (1969) performed a much-needed
correction for the period 1900–13 to strip out various mistakes, and he found that
there was then a fair match between export and import data provided by the U.S.
and Britain. However, Goodhart’s data are available only on a monthly basis,
which is too low a frequency to be of use in a model of arbitrage activity.
    Prospecting for new gold flow data, we made a lucky strike. After writing
most of this paper, we discovered previously unused (at least for this purpose)
gold export data published in the Annual Reports of the Director of the U.S. Mint.
Between May 1888 and July 1889 about $60 million in gold was exported from
the U.S., and this was a matter of great concern for the Director of the Mint. In
response he began publishing tables in his annual report documenting the exact
date, quantity, and destination of gold exports from New York, which was the main
port of departure. The data are apparently directly obtained by the Assay Office
in New York from Customs reports and appear to be of better quality than any
previous data put to use, although, as with most gold export data, there seems to
be an occasional problem of figuring out the precise destination of any shipment.
    We compiled these daily data from the original source as soon as they came to
our attention—which was thanks to Captain Martin Bayerle, who had examined
this source for quite a different purpose, in an effort to prove that the liner RMS
Republic, which sank in fog two days after sailing for France from New York on
January 22, 1909, was carrying a large and clandestine gold shipment.9 He writes:
“I found the French import data very reliable, and an almost exact match between
US exports and French imports exists for the years 1904–14” (personal communi-
cation). In many cases there is an almost exact match between these figures and
Goodhart’s numbers, although on several occasions there are large discrepancies.
   9 Thus, the loss of the Republic, even at the time the biggest maritime loss in history, could now

precipitate the most lucrative salvage operation ever known. Bayerle believes the cargo was an
enormous quantity of bullion and coin intended by the U.S. government as a subscription to part
of the massive Russian bond issue of that year, making its movement—and perhaps all the more
so its irrecoverable loss—a very politically sensitive matter. Conspiracy theorists have long stoked
these rumors, egged on by the official silence of the American authorities and the unprecedented
failure of the British Board of Trade, under Winston Churchill, to hold the requisite legal enquiry,
the findings of which might have averted the loss of another White Star vessel, the RMS Titanic,
three years later. See <http://www.rms-republic.com>.



                                                 7
Although, one has to be fairly skeptical about any one particular observation of
gold exports, and possibly some gold exports are missed in these tables, overall
they seem sufficiently detailed and reliable as a check on our methods.
    Sadly, no comparable source for gold imports exists as the director of the Mint
was less worried about heavy gold inflows. The best data that we are aware of
was compiled and generously provided by Andrew Coleman (1998). He collected
weekly shipping reports published in the New York Times between March 1895
and November 1901. The quality of these data is also an issue, as newspaper
reports are considered to be the least reliable source, and the short time span is also
a major disadvantage. Unfortunately, these data provide only weekly aggregates
and only for a limited number of years.


3 A Model of Gold Point Arbitrage
We next explore the workings of the market and construct a tractable model of
gold point arbitrage based on certain key features: the demand for sterling sight
bills in New York, changes in the net supply of bills via gold point arbitrage, and
the costs and benefits of the arbitrage operation itself.

3.1 Demand for Sterling Bills in New York
Leonard Presnell, perhaps only half jokingly, once declared that the “international
gold standard” was a misnomer, and that the regime would be better described by
the term “the international bill-on-London standard” (Davis and Gallman 2001,
131). The serious point here is that the functioning of the sterling-centered system
depended not only on the free convertibility of gold both in London and overseas,
it also involved the ability to quickly and easily translate domestic currency claims
into sterling claims, and vice versa, using an important “quasi-money”—the leg-
endary financial instrument knows as the sterling demand (or sight) bill. Innovated
in centuries past this was a negotiable instrument that was almost universally ac-
ceptable in trade and finance circles, and hence highly liquid. It could serve as a
means of payment for trade, or, if remitted to London and cashed on sight (that is,
on demand), it could perform as a vehicle for capital movement. Accordingly we
think of the demand for a stock of sterling sight bills in offshore centers, such as
New York, as being analogous to a demand for quasi-money, and we will base our
analysis on a partial equilibrium model of that market.



                                          8
    Let the stock of bills in the New York market be Bt .10 The price of these bills
in U.S. dollars is simply the exchange rate on demand (sight) bills expressed in
U.S. dollars per pound sterling, E t . The first building block of our model is an
expression of the market for such bills, written as a demand curve,
                                     E t = ψ − η Bt + u t ,                                      (1)
where ψ and η > 0 are demand parameters, and u t is a shock to the demand curve
at date t. This equation states that an increase in the quantity of bills Bt in the New
York market leads to a fall in the price of bills E t .11
    Both gold and sterling bills will circulate in the model between two centers,
London and New York. We note at this point that although there are two centers
and two goods in the model, meaning four prices, we do not need to consider the
market for bills in London, nor the market for gold in both centers, since in those
markets we can effectively treat prices as fixed, and all arbitrage in this system
is driven by one price, that of sterling demand bills in New York. The market
price of gold in each center was fixed by the mints at the parity level adjusted for
the relatively fixed transaction costs of buying and selling.12 The market price
of sterling bills in London, like those of a check to be cashed, was equal to their
face value plus or minus similar transaction costs (that is, a one pound bill in
London was worth, effectively, one pound). These institutional features motivate
our approach of considering a very simple form of price adjustment in E t only,
and argue against the application of a commodity-market type of model with price
adjustment in both locations (Coleman 1998).
    The time series disturbance term u t is of concern, and it will be important in
what follows. We have no simple priors on this process, except to say that in the
  10 The  extent of this market could, of course, include the entire United States, much of it linked
to the New York market. The development of the internal U.S. market and its relationship to the
external market has been a subject of considerable debate (Davis and Hughes 1960; Officer 1996).
   11 In what follows we will close the model with a supply relationship where changes in the stock

of bills result from gold arbitrage. Technically, this was not the only source of bill supply. In
principle, bankers in New York, for example, could create new bills for redemption in London
without a corresponding gold movement to cover the bills. Instead, the banks would use the
sale proceeds to acquire U.S. dollar assets in New York, and would cover the bills in London
via the sale of British sterling assets. To model this process would require, however, a model of
banks’ international portfolio choice, and to estimate it would require comprehensive data on bank
portfolios. We have no such model and no such data.
   12 However, the model can be easily extended to apply to “triangular” arbitrage via third markets

and to situations where the gold price in one or more centers is subject to exogenous variation.
Coleman (2002) discusses arbitrage between New York and London via Paris and cases where the
London gold price was affected by the use of gold devices by the Bank of England.

                                                 9
long run it is probably not stationary. It may even have a deterministic trend, related
to long-run trends in, say, the international trade in New York and its dependence
on sterling bills, or possibly other structural factors relating to technical change
or growth in the financial sector, or the desire of agents to make shifts in their
dollar versus sterling portfolios. We consider all such derived demand, supply,
and “taste” shocks as exogenous shifts and for the present purpose we impound all
these effects in the disturbance term.

3.2 The Mechanics of Gold Point Arbitrage
We next consider how gold and sterling bills circulate between the two centers.
Whenever arbitrage via demand bills takes place, the arbitrageur effectively swaps
a demand bill in New York for gold in London, or vice versa, through shipments
across the Atlantic. Revenues could be derived in this trade when the exchange
rate E t (the market price of demand bills in New York) diverged from its par value
E par , the latter given by the ratio of the fixed mint prices of gold in the United
States (P g , in dollars per ounce) and Britain (P g ∗ , in pounds per ounce), that is,
E par = P g /P g ∗ . Provided such revenues exceeded transaction costs, the trade
would be profitable.
    Table 2 relates the changes in the quantity of gold and bills in the typical
transactions. The table shows first that there was no delay between the arbitrageurs’
actions and the change in the stock of bills in the New York market and this implies
that we can ignore bill shipment delays. It is never the case that the New York
market has to wait for bills to arrive from another center like commodities—they
are simply created by financial intermediaries.13 The table shows that, in both
directions, the relationship between gold movements and changes in the stock of
demand bills is given by
                                 Bt = −P g ∗ G t ,                               (2)
where G t is gold inflow into New York, and X t = X t − X t−1 for any variable
Xt .
     A remarkable feature of gold point arbitrage was that there was little or no risk
in the realization of profit. Suppose that the New York arbitrageur takes profits in
dollars in New York. In the case of gold export the revenue is taken out before
gold is acquired for shipment, and there is no risk, no interest cost, and profit is
  13 In
      contrast, Coleman’s (1998) model includes shipment delays as would occur in commodity
markets.

immediately realized.14 In the case of gold import, the time interest cost is that of a
two-way Atlantic voyage, where a one-way trip takes a stochastic time of expected
length T .15 This introduces the possibility of an asymmetry in costs, and hence
in the gold points. Still, the arbitrageur could engage in advance the shipping
contracts, for a known price, and calculate expected profit, adjusting for any risk
aversion to the stochastic time delay of two voyages. In neither case, however, was
there uncertainty over prices, absent any default risk and neglecting any risk of a
loss in transit, say to due to the sinking of a ship at sea bearing bills or gold. It is
these unusual features of gold point arbitrage that make a simple, tractable model
both possible and desirable.
   14 That is, the arbitrageur exports only enough gold to cover the bills that need to be redeemed

in London, and keeps the remaining dollars as net revenue in period t = 0.
   15 With gold import, the bills have to go to sale in London at time T , and the gold has to come

back and be sold for the dollar profit which is not realized until time 2T .




                                                11
3.3 Costs of Arbitrage
The final element of our model is the cost function for the arbitrage operation. We
will consider the cost function to be a convex (for simplicity, quadratic) function
of the flow of gold G t . We will consider a representative arbitrageur with a cost
function for transactions that depends on the quantity of transactions. In reality,
with many arbitrageurs, this amounts to a definition of the supply curve of arbitrage
services. Since arbitrage operates in both directions, the cost function will be a
function of the absolute size of the flow |G t |. We suppose that the total cost of
the flow is given by
                                              1
                            T C = b|G t | + c|G t |2 .                          (3)
                                              2
This is a general technology where there are no fixed costs, an initial marginal
cost b, and an increasing marginal cost at a rate c. In principle, the potential
asymmetry in interest costs can be accounted for by varying the coefficients of this
transaction technology in each direction. Other possible sources of cost asymmetry
are differences in abrasion costs, insurance premia, freight rates, assaying charges,
bank fees, or other cost components in each direction. In the empirical analysis
we will make explicit allowance for such asymmetries.
    The arbitrage technology represents a departure from most of the traditional
gold point literature which assumes, at least implicitly, constant marginal costs,
with b > 0 and c = 0. From Table 2 we know that the marginal revenue of one
extra ounce of gold movement is given by M R = |E t − E par |P g ∗ Hence, in this
traditional view, once the marginal revenue of shipment exceeds marginal cost b,
gold freely moves (in the appropriate direction) and the exchange rate cannot move
any further from parity. It is this view of the market that has motivated the use
of the exchange rate maximum and minimum as the estimates of the gold points
as in method (c). Upon closer inspection, we think that this view of the market
cannot be maintained. Consider the following three periods of large gold export
illustrated in Figure 2.
    The first period of heavy gold exports was from April 29, 1891 to July 6, 1891;
the second period was from July 9, 1895, to September 20, 1895; and the third
period was from April 1, 1910, to April 26, 1910. In each of these episodes $30
to $35 million was exported from New York to England. As can be seen, in the
beginning of May 1891 the exchange rate reached $4.9 but exports still took place
in the end of June when the exchange rate was only $4.89. In the first half of
October 1895 the exchange rate reached $4.91, but again many exports took place
in the beginning of September when the exchange rate did not go higher than

$4.905. On April 26, 1910, the exchange rate reached $4.8795 but the first exports
started when the exchange rate had not gone beyond $4.8775. Even if we allow for
some errors in the gold export data it is hard to believe that these conclusions can
be overturned and we conclude, in accord with Officer, that using the maximum
and minimum observed price (method (c)) is not satisfactory as a way to estimate
gold points.
     We think a major reason for these results is that the marginal cost of gold point
arbitrage increased with the quantity shipped. This had at least two causes.
     Firstly, the arbitrage firms had a limited amount of capital available for their
operations and using it for GPA made it unavailable for other uses. If they had
a portfolio choice of where to invest their capital they would have first diverted
it from the lowest yielding alternative opportunities, and later from investment
opportunities with higher yields. This mechanism is obviously outside the realm of
our partial equilibrium model, where we have purposely abstracted from portfolio
choices. The second reason is that costs of shipping gold could go up when
quantities increase, and this more directly fits our model. Moreover, there is
copious evidence from contemporary reports to support this notion. For instance,
gold could be exported either as gold bars or gold coins, where the first one was
the least costly method for arbitrageurs.16 However, when exports were heavy
the U.S. Mint could not always provide gold bars, and arbitrageurs would have to
resort to the more costly method of gold coins.
     For example, on December 22, 1908, of a $500,000 shipment by Goldman
Sachs the Wall Street Journal noted that “this engagement of gold bars represents
the accumulation of daily receipts at the Assay Office during the past ten days, or
since the National City Bank took all the suitable gold bars there when it shipped
$4,000,000 on Dec. 12. The Assay Office is thus again without any exportable
bars.” Such events were not unusual. On May 18, 1909, the New York Post stated
that: “The demand for exchange was so much in excess of supply as to make exports
extremely profitable with sterling bills selling at today’s high level. There was a
rush to secure gold for Europe almost as soon as the market opened, and the fact
that the coin obtainable at the Sub-Treasury was in very good condition led many
bankers to risk the usual chance of abrasion in sending coin instead of bars.” Two
days later the Journal of Commerce described a “scramble” for gold bars wherein
banks were reserving ahead each day’s entire meltings and the Superintendent was
  16 Why? Compared to bars, coins would be bought at a discount by an overseas mint; they were
more awkward to transport, being more easily abraded; and they were much easier to purloin (and
one assumes, therefore, more expensive to insure).

forced to place limits on such tactics.17
    It also happened at least once that the Assay Office of New York ran out of gold
and that arbitrageurs had to secure gold from other Assay Offices with the additional
cost of shipping the gold to New York. This caused considerable consternation, as
the New York Commercial noted on January 12, 1909 under the headline “GOLD
EXPORTS STOPPED BY LACK OF GOLD BARS: BANKERS EVEN GO TO
PHILADELPHIA TO GET THEM”:

      While it would be expensive to transport gold bars from Philadelphia
      here, international bankers attempted to secure bars yesterday rather
      than ship gold coin.…There has been much disapproval expressed
      against the small supply of gold bars at the Assay Office as on every
      occasion of gold exports last year the movement was stopped by this
      lack.”

The next day large shipments were reported in the same newspaper “almost all in
gold coin, a transaction that was not thought possible at any reasonable profit.”
As might be suspected, when exports were heavy the U.S. Mint often started to
discourage exports through additional costs or inconveniences, and this is hinted at
above. Thus government policy, by the deployment of such “gold devices,” could
have thrown sand in the wheels of gold point arbitrage, leading just as surely to
increasing marginal costs.
    We think the case for constant marginal costs cannot really hold in the face
of this evidence. To model increasing costs we henceforth assume a convex cost
function and in order to arrive at a closed form solution we restrict it to be quadratic,
which is always valid as a first approximation.

3.4 Optimal Arbitrage
We now consider arbitrage operations. Arbitrageurs move gold up to the point
where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Without loss of generality, consider
gold export at time t, where the import case is analogous. For export, we must
have E t > E par and z > 0 units of gold are already being moved. From Table 2
we know that the marginal revenue of one extra ounce of gold movement is M R =
(E t − E par )P g ∗ ; and, from equation (3), the marginal cost is MC = b + cz. By
equating MC and M R, and by a similar calculation for gold import, we obtain the

   From equations (1) and (2), gold flows and the exchange rate are related via

                              E t = η P g ∗ G t + vt ,                           (5)

where vt = u t . We think vt , as the difference of u t , is likely to be a stationary
process. In what follows, we will assume that vt is independent but not necessarily
identically distributed.
    A solution follows from equations (4) and (5). To simplify the model, let us
normalize by defining xt = E t − E par , so that xt is the deviation of the exchange
rate from par. We find in the gold export regime that

                   xt = E t = η P g∗ G t + vt
                              g∗ (E t − E

where α = η P g∗ /c. After some tedious manipulations of this equation we can
recover the principal object of our study, the difference equation governing the
dynamics of the exchange rate, as follows

       (1 + α P g∗ )xt = xt−1 + αb + vt ;

holds for the gold import regime, and in practice, of course, the model parameters
might vary across regimes. When no arbitrage is profitable, the stocks of bills and
gold remain unchanged and the exchange rate is driven by the disturbance term in
equation (5). The complete solution of the model is then as follows:
                    ⎧
                    ⎨ −λ(xt−1 − γ ) + µvt when xt−1 > γ ;

    This model incorporates a simple formulation of gold point dynamics, a thresh-
old autoregressive (TAR) model with three regimes and heteroskedasticity. If the
current exchange rate is in the upper and lower regimes, then the exchange rate
reverts toward the edge of the band (the nearest gold point) at a speed λ, where
necessarily 0 < λ < 1. Within the band, in the middle regime, between the gold
points, there is no reversion and the process follows a driftless random walk. The
gold-point spread γ and the adjustment speed λ are intuitively related to the shape
of the underlying arbitrage cost function. An increase in the linear cost parameter
b causes an increase in the gold point spread γ , as in the traditional approach;
an increase in the quadratic cost parameter c causes a decrease in the speed of
convergence λ. We also see that λ = 1 and adjustment takes only one period in
the case where c = 0 and marginal costs are constant. This is intuitively obvious:
if marginal costs never rise, then enough gold will be shipped right away to force
the exchange rate back to the gold points. As we have argued, this case seems
empirically less relevant, as such shipments are not seen, nor can costs be assumed
to be linear forever.


4 The Econometric Model
The models developed in the theoretical section find their closest discrete-time
econometric representation in the Threshold Autoregression model (or TAR; some-
times referred to as SETAR or Self-Exciting TAR). In such models the dynamics
are governed by AR processes that differ across regimes delineated by the position
of a lagged value of the dependent variable relative to a set of given thresholds
(See Tong, 1983 and 1990, and Potter, 1999, for an overview).
    The general form of a TAR model with R regimes, an order k, and a delay
parameter d, can be expressed as

                                 
                                 k
                xt =   β0r   +         βir xt−i + tr , if γr −1 ≤ xt−d < γr
                                 i=1

where −∞ = r0 < r1 < ... < r R = ∞ and tr is a martingale difference sequence.
In this model AR(k) dynamics obtain in regime r. The process is in regime r at time
t when the selection variable xt−d lies between two thresholds γr −1 < xt−d ≤ γr ,
with r = 1, . . . , R and, by convention, γ0 = −∞ and γ R = +∞. We will call this
model a TAR(R; k, d), or sometimes a TAR(R) when concealing the dependence
on k and d.

                                               17
    We proceed to estimate all our models using Conditional Least Squares Esti-
mators (CLSE).18 This is performed in a two-step process. Given values for the
thresholds, each regime is estimated using OLS. Subsequently, we mininize the sum
of the residual sum of squares over the values of γr using a simple grid-search.19
    Asymptotic results are dependent on the continuity of the TAR model. In
general, in an unrestricted TAR model, the conditional expectation of the dependent
variable is a discontinuous function of the threshold variable at the threshold value.
However, it can be easily verified that in equation (7) the restrictions guarantee that
this function is continuous everywhere.
    For the continuous TAR model the results of Chan and Tsay (1998) apply.20
They show that under regularity √conditions the CLSE of all parameters—including
the threshold parameters—are T -consistent and asymptotically normally dis-
tributed, and this permits the convenient construction of standard errors.21 Al-
though not explicitly shown, these results are assumed in the literature to generalize
to threshold models with more than two regimes.
    The results of Chan and Tsay (1998) are not widely recognized but they are
important to the literature of market integration. In general one would expect that
the conditional expectation function is continuous, but that the adjustment process
is not. The fact that all inference is then standard makes life much simpler for
the applied researcher. In contrast, inference on the thresholds in the general TAR
model is currently only possible under further assumptions that we are unwilling
to make.
  18 See,  for instance, Chan (1993). Alternatively, one might estimate the models using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) assuming normality as in Qian (1998). The CLSE has attracted
more theoretical attention and consequently more results are known. Moreover, CLSE identifies
the thresholds from the change in slope parameters, while MLE also uses information in the change
in variance. Since our model does not necessarily predict that the process vt has constant variance,
we prefer CLSE.
   19 Of course, the thresholds can not be more precisely identified than is allowed by the coarseness

of the grid that is generated by the discrete (rounded) selection variable x t −d . In our case, the
exchange rate for the full sample has 234 unique values.
   20 Note that these results to hold, the continuity restrictions must be imposed on the estimated

model.
   21 For the discontinuous TAR model the results of Chan (1993) apply. He shows in a two

regime model that: (a) all the estimates of the unknown parameters are strongly consistent; (b) the
thresholds converge at rate T ; (c) the slopes parameters βir and intercepts β0r are consistent at rate
√
  T ; (d) the slope parameters and thresholds estimates are asymptotically independent; and (e) the
slope parameters are asymptotically distributed as if the thresholds are known.




                                                 18
4.1 A Fully Restricted Model
We first estimated the fully restricted model as in equation (7) using the full sample
of the time series data, all trading days from 1879 to 1913 inclusive.22 We restricted
the grid search to values so that the middle regime by itself and the upper and
lower regime combined have at least 5% of the observations. This corresponds to
a restriction that the gold point falls in the interval [0.001,0.033] which seems a
priori not unreasonable.
    The results are presented in Table 3. The threshold is estimated to be γ =
0.0324 or 0.67 percent parity of parity, which is remarkably consistent with Offi-
cer’s gold point estimates. The standard error on γ (computed using the Chan and
Tsay (1998) methodology) is only 0.0013 which suggests that γ is very precisely
estimated. Figure 3 plots the sum of squared residuals as a function of the thresh-
old. The figure shows the surprising result that there exists a second local minimum
at γ = 0.010 which is almost as low as the global minimum at γ = 0.0324.

4.2 An Unrestricted Model
To test the validity of the model, we then estimated a much less restricted speci-
fication. Specifically, without imposing any restrictions we estimated a series of
TAR(R; k, d) models with R = 3, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; and 1 ≤ d ≤ k. We then examined
the following implications of the model: only two thresholds; symmetry of thresh-
olds; convergence in outer regime towards the thresholds; symmetry in speed of
adjustment in the two outer regimes; random walk behavior in the middle regime;
and, finally, only a single lag in all regimes. To be consistent with the previous
section, we imposed that the upper and lower regime combined have at least 5%
and at most 95% of the observations.23
    To choose between TAR models with the same R, but different values of k and
d, various extensions of standard model-selection criteria have been proposed. We
elected to minimize the BIC, defined as

                                      
                                      R
                             BIC =           nr ln σ̂r2 + (k + 1) ln nr
                                      r =1
  22 In all the results that follow the first 10 observations are used as startup values and are omitted

from the sample.
   23 This means that there is no restriction on the number of observations in each regime. If the

parameters of either the lower or upper regime are unidentified, the residual sum of squares in that
regime is set to zero.

This choice is motivated by the work of Kapetanios (1999) who showed that the
standard results regarding the consistency of the BIC and Hannan-Quinn criteria
and the non-consistency of the AIC procedure can been extended to TAR models.
However, Wong and Li (1995) conjecture that the asymptotic efficiency of AIC in
linear settings is carried over to TAR models, and simulation evidence seems to
show that the AIC often performs better than BIC in small samples and is less likely
to underestimate the lag length. Given the large sample size in our application, we
suspect that the BIC will outperform other non-consistent criteria. We note that
the BIC criterion generally biases the results towards more parsimonious models.
    The BIC criterion selects the TAR(3;7,6) and we report the results in Table 4.
The two thresholds are −0.0224 and 0.0003, respectively 0.46 percent below and
0.006 percent above parity. While the lower gold point estimate might seem rea-
sonable the upper gold point estimate is too low to be credible. The upper regime
also shows barely any convergence; in fact, it has a root closer to unity than the
middle regime. Only the equality of the steady states and the threshold estimates
seems to have some validity.
    Under the assumption of a random walk in the middle regime, a test for the
equality of the steady states of the outer regimes and the threshold estimates is
simply a test of the continuous versus the discontinuous threshold model. We are
unaware of any formal test for this purpose.
    Testing for additional nonlinearities is not straightforward and has attracted
very little attention in the literature.24 The difficulty arises because the nuisance

here.

parameters γr are not identified under the null, which makes the distribution of
a likelihood ratio test nonstandard. This problem is sometimes referred to as the
Davies problem (see Davies, 1977 and 1987). Two tests for testing linear versus
nonlinear models that appear in the literature are those proposed by Luukkonen,
Saikkonen, and Terasvirta (1988, henceforth LST), and Tsay (1989). LST construct
tests of linear models versus Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) models and
show that these tests have power against TAR models; we use their Augmented First
Order Test procedure: first estimate an AR(k) model, then regress the residuals on a
limited set of second and third order terms, and test if this regression is statistically
significant. Tsay’s test exploits the similarity between change-point models and
TAR models: after reordering the data based on the selection variable xt−d , one
tests for the orthogonality of the one-step ahead prediction error relative to the
right-hand side variables.
    Assuming that the thresholds are known, we can test for TAR(R) against
TAR(R + S) models by applying the above linearity tests on each regime. In
the discontinuous TAR model√the threshold estimates are rate-T consistent while
slope estimates are only rate- T consistent and thus we can treat the thresholds
as known and proceed accordingly. But if the TAR is continuous this argument

does not hold and we are unable to construct valid tests of remaining nonlineari-
ties. Nevertheless, in Table 4 we report the Tsay and LST statistics. Although the
significance level is likely to be overstated, the evidence suggests that remaining
nonlinearities are somewhat problematic for the model as applied here.
    Concluding, almost every implication of the economic model—single lag in AR
processes, linearity after allowing for two thresholds, symmetry of thresholds, and
symmetry in speed of adjustment—is strongly rejected. Only the unit root in the
middle regime, and possibly the outer-regime convergence towards the thresholds
have some validity.

4.3 A Non-Parametric Model
The results of the previous section are discouraging. We think that the problems
are caused by declining thresholds, that is, an increase over time in “market inte-
gration.”
    The first strong indication of a changing degree of integration comes from
Figure 4. It presents the standard deviation of xt around the mean and around zero
in a moving window of 1,000 observations. Both graphs show a strong decline
over the entire period although the standard deviation around the mean shows a
gradual decline over the entire period, while the standard deviation around zero
shows a rapid decline during the second half of the period.25
    Since we have no priors on how market integration improved over time, it is
natural to think of a non-parametric approach. Specifically, we take a moving
window of 1500 observations (about 5 years) and estimate a constant threshold
model in each window.26 First, to regain some confidence in the model after the
disastrous results of the previous section we estimate an unrestricted model and
test the symmetry of the thresholds, the unit root behavior in the middle regime,
the convergence towards the thresholds in the outer regimes, and the symmetry
of the speed of adjustment in the two outer regimes. We imposed the restriction
of a single lag to limit the number of models that we needed to estimate. The
symmetry of thresholds is tested in the following way: we estimate a model with
symmetric thresholds but examine whether thresholds that are identified mainly
from lower regime data are different from thresholds identified mainly from upper
regime data.
    So we estimate the model
                        ⎧ 1
                        ⎨ β0 + β11 xt−i + t1 , xt−1 < −γ

    As before we impose that the upper and lower thresholds combined have at
least 5% and at most 95% of the observations. Since it is possible that during the 5
year period the exchange rate stayed within the middle regime most of the time we
might not be able to identify the thresholds for each window. To purge thresholds
  25 These  trends for daily data mimic the patterns seen in Officer’s monthly data seen in Table 1.
  26 We  took 1500 as a reasonable visual compromise between under- and oversmoothing. The
window shifted by 10 observations each time to limit the computational costs. A single observation
was eliminated because it was an extreme outlier and strongly affecting the results whenever it was
present in the window.

estimated from these cases we eliminate results when the LST test is not significant
at the 10% level.
    We start with an evaluation of the random walk prediction in the middle regime
and the tests of convergence towards the thresholds in the outer regimes. Together,
these predictions would imply that the threshold model is continuous. Since no
formal tests exists for testing either prediction we proceed rather informally.
    Concerning unit root behavior in the middle regime, we found the mean and
standard deviation of β12 were 0.9961 and 0.0420 respectively. Only 2.26% of the
observations are higher than 1.025 or lower than 0.975. The estimated intercepts in
the middle regime have a mean of −0.000012 and a standard deviation of 0.000057.
Figure 5 shows the correspondence between directly estimated thresholds (γ ) and
the implied steady state of the outer regime in each sample.27 The question is
whether the outer-regime dynamics converge to the edge of the band, as in the
continuous case. Looking across all of the sample windows, this property appears
to hold.
    We view these results as offering support for the continuous threshold model.
  27 Note that 6 of 483 points are not shown since they fall outside the plot area.   These points show
very different steady states from threshold estimates.

We also compared the speed of adjustment in the two outer regimes. Here the
model is not consistent with the data: the mean convergence rates are about 0.76
for the lower regime and 0.94 for the upper regime.
    Based on these results we subsequently estimated nonparametrically a con-
tinuous threshold model similar to equation (7) relaxing only the equality of the
λ parameters in the two outer regimes. The estimated thresholds are shown in
Figure 6, and are labeled “nonparametric estimate.”28 Figure 6 provides evidence
that the gold points experienced a dramatic decline during the period. Threshold
estimates declined from 0.0375 at the start of the period to less than 0.010 in the
end.

4.4 A Smooth Time-Trend Model
Given these findings, we prefer to model the dynamics of the gold points as a
parametrically specified smooth time-trend during the entire period. Based on the
results in the previous section, we estimate a fully restricted model as in equation (7)
with the exception that we relax the symmetry of the speed of adjustment.
  28 The graph is very similar to a graph constructed from the threshold estimates in the unrestricted

model.

    Again estimating this model using CLSE as explained earlier implies that γ (t)
has to be chosen using a grid search. This restricts the feasible number of un-
known parameters in γ (t). Although maybe not completely satisfactory consid-
ering Figure 6, we estimated such a model with only two unknown parameters:
γ (t) = γ0 e−γ1 t with t = 1, ..., 10615.29
  29 Themodel remains a continuous model, and so we again rely on the Chan and Tsay (1998)
methodology, adapted to this case. We started with a grid of 100 values for γ0 between 0.00 and
0.05 and 100 values for γ1 between −0.001 and 0.001. We then repeated the search, each time
choosing an increasingly refined grid around the optimal point from the previous stage.

    The results are reported in Table 5. We also compute the Tsay and LST statistics
for illustration. Strictly speaking these tests are invalid for the continuous model,
and may overstate the significance level as before, but compared to the earlier
results these statistics are now much lower, suggesting that there is little remaining
nonlinearity.
    That is, there seems to be some nonlinearity left, but this is unsurprising with
more than 10,000 observations and the significance levels have decreased enor-
mously from Table 4. The estimate of γ (t) is plotted in Figure 6, labeled “smooth
estimate.” Perhaps surprisingly, this time trend is fairly flat compared to the non-
parametric estimates. The time trend shows a decline of gold points from 0.0204
to 0.0121 during the full period while the non-parametric estimates decrease from
0.0375 to 0.0058. The non-parametric estimates suggest a very rapid decline in
threshold size during the first decade (the 1880s) which is obviously not picked up
by the smooth time-trend model. Either way, the evidence strongly points towards
gold points that have significantly declined during the full period.

quantity movements solely from the price dynamics? It would be nice to perform
Newcomb’s cross-check to see if our thresholds do a better job of predicting gold
flows, so as to validate our model with flow data. Still, we are almost stymied in
this regard since, for the most part, the extant flow data remain under a dark cloud
of suspicion, as already noted (Morgenstern 1955; Goodhart 1969; Officer 1996).
    Nonetheless, we can now present a limited quantity-based cross-check on our
method. In Figure 7, we plot for the time period for which we have Mint Report
gold export data, the exchange rate, our gold export point estimates from the smooth
time trend model, and Officer’s export GPA gold point. With circles we indicate
on the exchange rate line those days when substantial gold exports (more than
$50,000) were observed. To account for the short lag in buying bills and shipping
gold, we plot the maximum of the exchange rate in the three days before the actual
shipment. On the bottom of the graph we also show the actual volume of the
exports.
    As mentioned before gold flow data are not very reliable. This is a possible
reason for the five observations where gold was shipped to the U.K. when the
exchange rate was actually below parity. It might also be the case that for these
observations gold was shipped for other reasons than gold point arbitrage, a possi-
bility that always renders problematic cross-checks of this kind. This explaination
seems to be favored by the fact that the volumes shipped were small compared to
other gold shipments. In any case, any single gold export observation should be
viewed with skepticism and only general patterns can be considered relevant.
    Our gold point estimates predict actual gold flows quite well for the period
1890-1896. For this period we observe almost no gold movement when exchange
rates are within the bound and observe almost everytime some gold flow when the
exchange rate is above the gold point. Arguably, however, the gold point might
be slightly higher than our estimate (our non-parametric estimate is a little bit
higher than the smooth trend estimate, and possibly more accurate). Officer’s gold
point, however, is almost certainly too high, except possibly for a short period in
1895. Around the turn of the century, our gold point estimate seems too low while
Officer’s estimate seems again too high. The truth appears to be somewhere in
the middle. At the end of the period, between 1907 and 1910, it appears that we
have hit the gold export point almost exactly right, although there are a couple
of peaks that show no gold flows. Overall, by volume, only 35% of gold exports
in this period occured at exchange rates above Officer’s gold point; 50% of flows
occurred above our estimate but below Officer’s; and only 15% of flows occured
below our estimate (with less than 1% below parity).

gold import points.30 There are several reasons why this graph is less reliable than
Figure 7. First, Coleman only collected weekly aggregates of gold imports. So
the timing, of the gold imports is less precise and for this reason we have plotted
the maximum exchange rate over ten days. Second, one has to account for the lag
with which gold imports arrive. This lag is likely to be somewhere from one to two
weeks. We have taken it to be ten days and so plotted with circles the maximum
exchange rate from 19 days until 10 days before the end of the reporting week
which showed gold imports. Third, Coleman collected the data from newspaper
reports which are considered the least reliable source for gold shipments. These
import data reveal some oddities. In 1895 and 1896 we see that large imports
occurred at an exchange rate far above parity, but Coleman explains these as being
driven by subscriptions to a large gold bond issue by the U.S Treasury, and hence
such flows were unrelated to gold point arbitrage. We may also question the cause
of the gold imports observed in late 1898 and early 1899 at exchange rates only just
below 4.86. If these data are correct then our gold point estimates seem too high
(that is, too far from parity). However, if these observations are also due to special
circumstances then our estimates seem too be hitting the gold import point almost
exactly. It is also clear that Officer’s GPA gold import point is almost certainly
too high. Overall, by volume, none of the gold imports in this period occured at
exchange rates below Officer’s gold point (indeed the exchange rate never fell so
low); 47% of imports occurred below our estimate but above Officer’s; and 52%
of flows occured above our estimate (with 22% above parity, although most likely
this large fraction of the flows was related to the gold bond issue and should be set
to one side).


6 Conclusions
Our study offers several new issues for consideration. We have shown that work
on the classical gold standard need not be confined to annual, quarterly, monthly,
or even weekly data. Many financial publications list daily data, and we sample
just one to construct a new series of dollar-sterling exchange rates. Such data are
essential for the proper study of exchange rate dynamics where arbitrage operations
were measured in days.
    We then modeled the actual arbitrage process as described by the actors and
experts at the time. We argued that increasing marginal costs of arbitrage are
  30 Only  imports of more than $350,000 in a week are considered to be substantial, as indicated
by circles.

essential to understanding the functioning of the system, in particular to explain the
fact that persistent gold point “violations” and gold flows could be observed. Our
model implies nonlinear dynamics and we used threshold autoregression methods
to identify two distinct regimes of exchange rate behavior: an inner band with a
random walk, and an outer band where the exchange rate reverts inwards. Naturally,
the thresholds have an interpretation as implicit or revealed-preference gold points.
    We compared our estimated thresholds with accepted estimates of the gold
points, and found very different trends in the two measures. Our threshold de-
clined dramatically but the measured gold points were fairly stable. We take this
as evidence that the classical gold standard was an evolving standard in ways not
very well captured by existing costs measures alone. Our conjecture is that various
dynamic considerations could have acted to cause arbitrage to operate at different
thresholds: for example, evolving concerns over the reputation of the convert-
ibility commitment and the evolution of new technologies (or “learning”) in the
market itself. There might also have been increasing competition in the business
of arbitrage itself, leading to decreases in the implied cost parameters.
    There is some anecdotal evidence of changing costs over time, sometimes in
ways dramatic enough to surprise even seasoned market participants. For example,
there is an indication that, late in the period, banks trading on their own account
were able to execute arbitrage, even in coin, at very low margins, perhaps below
even their posted rates in the reports used today to construct direct gold point
estimates. Thus, on May 20, 1909, the New York Post noted unusually heavy
exports of gold coin, about $2.5 million, and observed that news of such shipments
“was received with considerable surprise in financial circles, as it was not thought
heavy exports of the metal could be made at prevailing exchange rates. The bankers
making the shipments announced, however, that they were not losing money on
the operation.”31 So much for received wisdom. One is relieved, of course, to
learn that bankers had figured out how not to make a loss on simple arbitrage. At
face value, this report offers strong support for our revealed-preference measures
of the gold points—at the very least compared to method (a), consulting an expert!
    Is such a report plausible? For reference, on May 19, the exchange rate stood
at 4.87775, about 0.2 cents above our export point (4.8756) but still 2 cents below
Officer’s GPA export point (4.8909). Two tenths of a cent might not sound like
much of a profit, but in this business the margins had certainly been shrinking,
perhaps as a result of competition among banks. The correspondent for Bankers
Magazine, could report on June 1910 (p. 924) that “there is not much profit in ship-
  31 Quotes   here and below are as cited at <http://www.rms-republic.com>.

ping gold as might be thought, a thousand dollars on each million being considered
quite enough of an inducement to make banking houses go in for transactions of
this kind.” Given the dollar-sterling parity, a margin of about 0.486 cents was ap-
parently thought sufficient; by that reckoning, an extra 0.2 cents, as in May 1909,
could be considered a significant extra incentive.
    Thus, though the example par excellence of monetary stability in an interna-
tional setting, the classical gold standard may yet deserve analysis as more than
just a monolithic, rule-bound system driven by the simple arithmetic of arbitrage
operations. And it should be seen that the analysis of the gold points is more than
an accounting exercise, and is a key ingredient in a fundamental method of mar-
ket integration analysis, the comparison of measured costs to revealed behavioral
responses. Our technique promises to be of use in all fields of market integration
research, and opportunities abound to extend this type of study to other currencies
or to markets for other goods.
