     GDVERNNENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND ECONOMIC OEVELOPMENT


                             ABSTRACT

     Ideological debates on the role of government in development

have focused on two contrasting prescriptions: one calling for
large scale government interventions to solve problems of massive
market failures, the other for the unfettering of markets, with

the dynamic forces of capitalism naturally leading to growth and
prosperity. This paper is part of an exploration of a middle
road, focusing in particular on the role of government in

financial markets. After explaining the importance of, and the

limitstions on, capital markets, particularly in allocating
scarce investment resources, the results are used as a basis of a
critique of the two 'extreme' approaches. Recognizing the

limitations of government intervention as well as of free

markets, the 'new viewlr of capital markets provides new insights

into s vaciety of policy issues, which are addressed in the final
section of the paper.

                               Joseph S. Stiglita

     For the past several decades, economists have offered developing

countries two contrasting prescriptions for success. One school of thought

has seen the failure of countries to develop as evidence of   a massive   market

failure, and suggested that what is required is massive government

intetvention; at the very least, government should take a central role in

planning, allocating investment and credit, and controlling international

trade.2 The second approach see government more as the problem than as the

solution:    hy unfettering markets, the dynamic forces of capitalism would

natnrally load to growth and prosperity.

     There is growing diailluaioruaent within the Third World with both of

these extreme approaches. Many governments are groping to find an eclectic

approach, in which governments play a limited, but vital, role in the

developuent process.     Those who advocate such "reasonahlc" approaches to

     2Though the intcllectual origins of this perapective undoubtedly go a
long way hack, in recent decades, this school has attempted to relate the
problems observed in less developed countries to the general 'market
failures approach." This approach begins with the fundamental theorem of
welfare economics, which provides a    set of aasuatptions under which market
economies are Pareto efficient, and then attempts to interpret observed
instancea of deficiencies in market economies can he related to the failure

government policy [ace a difficulty: the two alternative approaches have a

clearly articulated intellectual basis, a framework to which they can appeal

for guidance. Never mind that the underlying assumptions are inappropriate

or that sore of the central ptedictions of the theories supporting one or

the   other extreme    approaches say be tefuted:     these are reiineeents which

are    of concern to academics.       The ideology serves a vital function     of

providing ready- -if not always appmopriate--answers to difficult questions.
       the   purpose of this paper is to present an outline of some of        the

ingredients     of the intellectual foundations of the middle approach of

balanced government intervention, focusing in particular on finaocisl

markets, and to explain why I believe it            is that the two alternative,
estreme      approaches are so intellectually bankrupt.         The two extreme

approaches share in common two factors: an appeal to aimple prescriptions

to solve complex problene, and an explanation of the failures of their

prescriptions to work in those instances where they have been tied to the

patients' foilute to        follow the prescribed course of medicine      in its

entirety.

       1 focus my attention on the role of government in financial markets.

This is partly because of the general consensus concerning the central role

of    financial msrkets in economic development, partly because of rhe extrese
divergence in views concerning the appropriate role of government in this
sphere.
       I begin with two assertions concerning the historical experience of the
role   of financial markets and government in economic development:

       1. Governments hsve played a central role--whether for good or ill say

he    debated--in   the development of moat of those countries which today belong
among the more developed. I am particularly concerned here with the role of
government in financial markets. In the United States] the railroads were

given huge land grants, which provided them with an important asset

facilitating raising capital by issuing bonds. Even today. in the US, more

than a quarter    of   all loans (to private individuals or firms) are made with

gcvernment guarantees or are intermediated by government lending agencies.

In Japan, MITI is believed to have played a central role in determining

which industries get credit. High on the agenda of nationalization in most

countries is the nationalization of the banking industries.

     2.        Well functioning equity markets have played a relatively

unimportant role in economic development.         Even today, in the developed

countries, a     relatively   small fraction ef new funds is raised on equity

markets.



     Most, but not all, ci the successful efforts at development have

entailed enterprises requiring considerable amounta of capital. There are

four principal ways that such egglomerations of capital can be formed: (a)

accumulsticn of capital by families; (b) sccumulation within corporate

enterprises; (c) voluntary agglomeration of capital via capital markets

(including banks) ;       and (d)    "forced" agglomeration of capital via

gcvernment.3      Successful development requires not only the agglomeration

of capital, but also the appropriate allocation and management of capital.

This entails screening different investment opportunities for those most




     3tovernrsent policies may. in effect, channel aavings to large
enterprises within the private sector or be used for large projects within
thu public sector.
likely to yield high returns and managing the investment opportunities in a

way to ensure that they live up to thetr potentiala.

     The problems of agglomerating and allocating capital are, of course,

closely linked together. When capital is accumulated within families, there

is no separation of ownership and control, ot to put it          in   the more

fashionable jargon of modern information economics, no principal agent

problem. The family has a clear incentive to ensure that the funds are well

spent.   Of course, if the family has many enterprises to manage, they can

only devote part of their energies to each project, and must engage in

considerable delegation.   Thus, principal-agent problems Inevitably arise,

but there is at least a clear incentive to ensure that they be handled as

well as possible.

     The heightened sense of egalitarianism in modern societies has

resulted in most governments imposing taxes which inhibit huge family

agglomerations.

     Some large agglomerations occur within corporations, but, as we are

increasingly becoming aware, the interests of those who run the corporations!

often are distinctly different from those who nozstnslly own the corporation.

By now, there is a clear body of evidence suggesting at least that in many

instances managers advocate, and undertake, actions which do not maximize

the market value of the firmA

     Capital aarkets--providing for voluntary agglomerations--while they crc

of critical importance, face, as we show in the next section, importenc

limitations arising from imperfect and incomplete information.



     4The clearest evidence relates to how firms respond to taxes and take-
overs. See Stiglitz (1922a) and Shleifer and Viahny (1968).

                                         4
    We have increasingly become aware of the limitations of government

within capital markets. Governments compound the standard principal agent

problems with what may be called, for want of a better term, political

economy problems.    Providing loans at interest rates which are below the

"actuarially" appropriate rates provides an excellent way for governments to

provide   hidden subsidies to their friends and supporters: who is to know1

until oc unless the borrower defaults1 that the loan was not one that could

be justified on good business grounds; end even if it is attacked on those

grounds one can always appeal to broader social objectives. The potential

scope of the abuse of public loan programs and the difficulties of

contcnlling those abuses makes such programs problematical, even if one

could justify them on other grounds (a point to which I shall return later.)

     From this perspective then, we face a second best problen: none of the

aethods of providing for the agglomeration of capital are without their

deficiencies or difficulties.



    This paper is divided into three sections.      In the first, I explain

both the importance of, sod the limitations on, capital markets.      In the

second. I use these results as the basis of a critique of what I have called

the two extreme approaches to development strategies. In the third, I use

the analysis of Part I to address several policy issues,

                I. Aspects of   the Theory of Capital Markets



                  A.   On the Inportance of Capital   Markets



     Capitalmarkets perform several critical roles: they aggregate savings
and they allocate funds. In the process of performing these functions,
funds must be allocated not only     among competing sectors, but also among

competing management teams (firms). iithin capital markets, banks play a

distinct role: having allocated the funds, banks continue to perform an

important   task in ensuring thmt the funds are uaed in the way promised by
the borrower, and thmt the horrower, in responding to new contingencies,
takes into account the interests of the providers of capital. At the same

time that they provide these services, they reduce the risks facing savers

by allowing for diversification.

    The funds required for undertaking investments of any scale are, as we

have noted, beyond the means of most entrepceneurs.              Banks and other

financial institutions take the relatively small savings of large numbers of

individuals, aggregate them together, and thus make funds available for

larger scale enterprises.       This is socially desirable because of the

importance of scale effects:        if each individual was limited to the

investments he himself could finance, returns would be correspondingly

limited.    This would be an important rcle, even if       all   individuals were

identical, and the bank could, accordingly, allocate the funds simply by

randomly choosing one individual to receive the loan.

     Eut individuals are not identical.       Some are better managers than

others, and some have better ideas.         A central function of finsnciel
institutions is to assess which managers and which projects are most likely

to yield the highest returns.

     Moreover, nnce the loan has been made, it is important to mocitor that

the funds are spent in the way promised, and that the project is well

managed.

     These two functions of financial institutions are referred to as their

screening and monitoring roles.5



                        B.      Financial Strucrure



     The form in which capital is provided has consequences both fnr how

these screening and monitoring functions are performed and the behavior of

borrowers. The three most important forms in which capital is provided are

tqjjt, long term leans, and short tern loans.



                                     1. Equity

     From the perspective of the entrepreneur, equity has two related

distinct advantages. Risk is shared with the provider of capital, and there

is no fixed ohligaticn for repaying the funds.         Thus, if times are bad,

payments to the providers of capital are suspended. The firm will not face

bankruptcy, and will not be forced to take the extreme measures intended to

stave off bankruptcy.        From a social point of view, equity has a distinct

advantage:   because risks are shared between the entrepreneur and the

provider of capital, the firm will not normally cut back production as much




     5See SLights and Weiss (1989).

                                            7
as it would with debt financer if there is a downturn in the economy. (See

Greenwald and Stigiitz (lPSBb, lSBSc))

     But there are some distinct disadvantages of equity.            Becauae

entrepreneura do not have a fixed conatitment (and because they must share

the returns to their effort with the other shareholders) incentives are

atteousted, Because shareholders only get a fraction of profits, managers

have an incentive to divert profits to their own uses (not only managerial

perks, but the acquisition of knowledge and skills which improve their

market position).6 Recent literature has stressed how imperfect information

provides   theoretical explanations for why take-overs and other markets

mechanisms provide only limited discipline on managerial behavior, and

consequently, fat why managers have considerable autonomy.'            These

incentive issues have recently received considerable attention, as instance

after instsnce of cash rich oil, companies squandering the extraordinary

profits they received during the years of high oil profits come to light;

Exxon with its half billion dollar loss on Reliance and Mobil with its loss

on Montgomery Ward are but two of many instances. Indeed, the increase in

value which has been associated with corporate financial restructuring,




       There is, by now, considersble empirical evidence for these views,
     Managers not nniy expend resources to increase their outside market
value, but they also take actions which make it more difficult for the firm
to replace then.    This is referred to as managerial entrenchment.     Sac

increasing firm debt, is often partly attributed to the fact that with high

debt, managers are forced to work hard--they have their backs to the wall)9

     Moreover, those entrepreneurs who are must willing to sell shares in

their fines include those who believe, or know, that the marker has

overvalued their shares.      There are, of course, good reasons fur issuing

equities--risk averse individuals with good investment projects, requiring

more capital than they have will also issue shares. But these individuals

snd firms are mingled together with these who see an opportunity to cash in

on the markets' ignorance.       And unfortunately, the market cannot easily

distinguish among the two.         As a result, there is an adverse signal

associated with issuing new equities- -on average, the value of firms' shares




     6Robert Mall has, accordingly, referred to this theory of corporate
finance as the "batks-to-the-wall' theory of corporate finance.       Early
studies emphasizing the role of finance in affecting managerial incentives
include Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Stiglitz (1974), who pointed out the
close analogy hetween the    traditional incentive concerns in  the
sharecropping literature, and similar problems in modern corporate
enterprises. For a isore recent survey, see Jensen (1968),

     5Three other mechanisms for ensuring that those who get fonda froa
others treat the providers of capital in the manner promised should briefly
be noted: (a) Reputation may be effective, if firms wish to re-enter the
capital market to raise capital again in the future.         But reputstion
mechanisms are only effective if firms wish to raise additional capital,
and the adverse signalling effect associated with new equity may make firms
particularly reluctant to re-enter the equity market, at leaat for a
codnsiderable period (see Gale and Stiglitz, 1989).          Moreover, reputation
mechanisms become particularly ineffective as firms face threats of
bankruptcy.  (See Eaton, Cersovitz and Stiglitz [1986] for a general
discussion of these issues.)       In LDGs, the absence of an established
reputation may put new domestic financial institutions at a disadvantage and
serve as a barrier to entry.    (b) Fraud and securities laws may impose
important constraints on how firas treat their providers of capital.   In
many LDGs, legal systems are, however, both slow and relatively ineffective.
Cc) In traditional societies, trust (ethnic ties) may provide an effective
enforcement mechanism.     In the process of developeent, however, these
ties may be weakened, impairing the efficiency with which capital markets function.


                                           9
decreases when they issue shares. This serves as an important deterrent to

issuing shares,1

     The disadvantages oi equity seen, in most cases, to outweigh the

advantages, even in enre developed economies. Relatively little capital is

raised by new equity issues, and even by secondary equity issues (where a

ptincipal stockholder shares his shares, either so that he can diversify his

portfolio or spend his wealth).

     gut the more developed countries have several distinct advantages in

issuing equities that are not available in most LDCs.        The existence of

well organized secondary markets for securities makaa equities particulerly

attractive.        It   increases   liquidity and   allows    easy portfolio
diversification.

     Moreover, the standard accounting procedures (enforced, in part, by the

taxing authorities and hy government securities regulators) reduce the

problems posed by outright managerial cheating. They make it more difficult

for investors to be eislead by shady practices, including Ponri achemes.

Managers can still rip off the firm--in one recent take-over episode, they

walked off with more than a $100 million--but typically, the amount they

take is hut a sisall fraction of the firm's assets.     In the early days of

modern capitalist economies there wore numerous instances of stock market

soaas,   Given this history, and the apparent ease with which stockholders

can be taken advantage of, it is perhaps remarkable that equities aarkcta

work as well as they do.




     10The theoretical arguments are provided in Greenweld, Stiglitz an Weiss
(1984), Stiglita (1982) or Myers and Hajluf (1984).             For empirical
evidence, see e.g., Aaquith end Mullins (1986).
     Nonetheless, we must bear in mind the quite limited role that they play

in raising capital in developed countries.     Hopes of raising substantial

amounts of capital in this form within LDCa appear to me to be
unreasonable. 11




     Tha   evidence is summarized in Mayer, 1989: new share issues, during
the period 1970-1985, as a percentage of net financing, were negative for
Finland, U.K and the U.S. , and only 2.2% for Canada and .6% for Germany.
     Critics may point out that at certain selected times, stock markets
have raised appreciable amounts of finance.      (See, for instance, Taggart
(1985), who cites figures as high as high as 19% for the period 1923-39.)
Taggart notes that the increase in equity issues, from 2% in the 60's to 3%
in the 70's, is largely accounted for by public utility preferred stock
issues; preferred stock does not suffer from some of the "enforcement"
problems associated with common stock; moreover, utilities, because they are
regulated and accordingly heavily monitnred, do not suffer from some of the
other control problems associated with equities in other industries.
     Moreover, the temporary success cf a financial instrument in raising
capital provides little evidence for its long run viability. It takes time
for investors to learn about all the relevant attributes of a security, and
it takes managers time to learn about all the ways by which they can
manipulate securities, Thus, income bonds looked like they had risk sharing
advantages over traditional bonds, without the enforcement problems
associated with common stock; yet investors eventually learned that firms
could manipulate the value of income, and that they were inadequately
protected.  The income bonds thus grew out of favor, Junk bonds are an
instrument which have recently enjoyed considerable popularity in the United
States.  They have higher nominal yields than ordinary bonds; the question
is, are those yields high enough to compensate for the additional risks?
Though experience with these bonds is sufficiently limited that one should
be cautious in drawing conclusions, preliminary evidence suggests that
default rates on junk bonds that have been outstanding for a number of years
are so high that actual returns are no higher than on much safer bonds. A
major receaaion in the United States, with a concomitant high default, would
turn investors away from junk bonds. Scandals in the U.K. equity earket at
the turn of the century contributed to the decline in equity issues there.
(See Kennedy, 1987, for an excellent account of these.)
     Today, investors in LOGs bring to bear the full experience of how
equities have been abused, even in societies with fairly well functioning
legal systems. This should make them wary about what would happen in LOGs.
See Greenwald and Stiglita (1989b) for a more extensive discussion of the
develpnent of financial markets snd its relationship with changes in the
legal systems.

                            2. Short Term Loans



     Short term hank loans give the firm much less discretion: finns are on

a short leash. They must make interest payments, and the bank can request

its funds back at each of the due dates.            Thus, while nominally.

shareholders control the firm, minority shareholders exercise no effective

control, while banks often exercise considerahie influence over the firm's

actions. Their refusal to renew a loan can have serious sdverse effects on

the firm,   and thus firm's have a strong interest in complying with the
demands of the benks. Overseeing loans is, of     course,   one of the bank's

main economic roles--the role of monitoring noted above.

     There Is an important difference between the contractual arrangements

and the true economic nature of the relationship. For the lender can only

force the horrewet to repay the amount due if the borrower hss the funds; if

he does not, he can force the borrower into bankruptcy. But there are often

significant economic costs of doing so, reducing the amount that the lender

will eventually recover. Hence, the borrower can often "coerce" the lender

into extending more credit- -or at least not forcing the borrower to repay

what is due.   The borrower knows this, end this may affect his behavior.

(This explaina why banks sre losthe to undercapitalize projects, knowing

that they can be "forced" to extend further credit later.) The experience

with Third World Debt provides ample evidence to the importance of this




     '°The view that backs may exorcise more effective control over capitol
than minority shareholders is developed in Earle (1926) and Stiglita
(l9i5)

                                       12
phenomena.'    The possibility of behavior leading to subsequent "forced

loans" provides banks with further incentives to monitor borrowers.

     than markets are distinctly different from the kinds of "auction"

markets characterizing other goods and services.         Traditional textbook

oxpositicns characterized loan markets like the market fnr chairs or

tables, with the price (the interest rate) equilibrating supply and demand.

But this view is incorrect. It misses the essential property of loans- -they

are not contemporaneous trades, but an exchange of funds by one party for a

prosise of a return in the future, It misses the essential heterogeneity of

1oan contracts- -   the differences in the probability of default.     And it

misses the essential informational problems- -   while   the lender knows thst

different borrowers differ in the probability of default, he cannot

perfectly ascertain which borrowers have high default probabilities; and

while the lender knows that borrowers can undertake actions which affect the

likelihood that he gets repaid, he cannot perfectly monitor those actions.14

     Three important consequences follow: first, the process of allocating

credit (and monitoring its use) is not simply left to the market, with

different borrowers competing for funds by offering to pay higher interest

rates,    Banks screen loan applicants.       Secondly, because of adverse

selection and adverse incentive effects associated with increases in the

interest rate (that is, as the interest rate charged increases, the

"quslity of the mix of applicants changes adversely, and successful


     For an early theoretical discussion of these concerns with short term
debt, see Hellwig (1977) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).  For an analysis of
third world debt from this perspective, see Eaton, Ceraovitz, and Stiglitz
(1986)

     These arguinants also apply to equities markets.


                                         13
applicants undertake riskier projects)'5 , banks may not raise interest rates

evon when there is an excess demand for credit.    The interest rate doea not

perform its market clearing role. Karket equilibrium may be--and frequently

is- -characterized by credit rationing. Thirdly, loan contracta will have a

variety of provisions other than interest rates, which will affect both the

actions undertaken by borrowers and the mix of loan applicants. While these

non-price terms (such as collateral) may affect the extent of credit

rationing, they do not eliminate it (See Stiglits and Weiss (1986, 1990).)

Moreover, banks may respond to defaults not by increasing the rate of

interest charged on subsequent loans, but by cutting off credit.

     Thus, loan markets face different aspects of the three problems of

enforcement, selection and incentives that equity markets face. So long as

the firm does not go bankrupt, the 'enforcement" problem is not as serious:

there is no necessity to having to ascertain what the firm's profits are.

The firm has a simple commitment.       But as we suggested, there are still

enforcement prcblem:    in the event of bankruptcy, the bank must see to it

that the borrower does not subvert funds; end, as we have argued, the

borrower may attempt to extract more funds from the borrower, under the

threat of bankruptcy.

    The selecticn problem in the case of equity focused on firms with low

expected returns; in loan markets, there is also a selection problem, now

focusing on those with high probabilities of default.

    The incentive prohlem itt the case of equity markets focused on the

attenuation of managerial incentives. Since borrowers can keep all of what

the firm obtains in excess of what they have borrowed, effort incentives


     155ee Stiglits and Weiss (1981).

                                         14
are good (And, as we have suggested, these incentives may be reinforced by

firms' concerns about bankruptcy.) But there are adverse risk-incentives:

fines pay insufficient attention to returns in those contingencies where

the lire goes hankrupt.'5 When firms have a high likelihood of default,

these incentive distortions can become quite large.

     Finally, while in principle, both providers of loans and equity have an

incentive to monitor the actions of the borrower, lenders may be in a more

effective position for doing so, through their ability to withdraw credit.

And while typically there are many equity owners, each firm has only one or

in any case a few providers of loans.        This means that the "public good

problem associated with- monitoring- -of ensuring that the borrower takes

actions which are in accord with the interests of the lenders--ia less for

loans than for equity)7



                                  3. Bonds



     Bends represent a half-way house between short term loans and equity.

With a bond, a firm has a fixed comisitment        it must pay interest every

year, and it must repay the principal at a fixed date. As a result, all the

problems we have discussed above with loans arise with bonds.


     This aspect of the discrepancy between the interests of firma and the
providers of capital was noted in Stiglitz (l972)

     1?That is, since all those who provide a particular form of capital are
treated the same, if any one provider takes actions (e.g. monitoring the
actions of the firm) which increases his returns, all other members of the
class are benefited equally.   This gives rise to a classic public goods
problem: Firm management is a public good. See Stiglits (1985). Shleifer
and Vishny present evidence that fires in which equity ownership is
concentrated actually do perform more in accord with the intereata of
shareholders -

                                        IS
     Bonds have one significant sdvantage--and disadvantage.    Because, the

lender cannot recall the funds, even if he is displeased with what the firm

is doing, the firm is not on a "short" leash, the way it is with loans.

This has the advantage of enahling the firm to pursue long term policies--

but has the disadvantage of allowing the fin to pursue policies which

adversely affect the interests of bondholders. Bond covenants may provide

some restrictions, but these generally only foresee a few of the possible

contingencies facing firms.    The recent spate of take-overs and corporate

financial restructuring have significantl.y adversely affected bondholders,

and yet they had little or no say in the proceedings.

     There may be second reason why bonds play a relatively saall role in

raising capital, even in major industrial countries        There may be en

adverse signal associated with a firm expressing an unwillingness to be put

on a short leash.    A firm which knows that it will be undertaking safe

actions, and that its projects are really good will be willing to subject

itself to the continued scrutiny of its bankers. Those who do not want such

close scruriny include those who think there is a high likelihood that

eventually they will fail to pass auater.     Thus, even if there were some

economies associated with long term commitments, the market night not

provide these ccmsiitments.5




     At the saae time, it must be recognized that the focus on short tern
performance may have adverse long term effects,

                                        16
C. Banks versus Markets



     In recent years, there has been increasing reliance on markets, as

opposed to banks, as a source of capital. What are the causes of this, and

what are ita consequences?     One possible explanation is that transaction

costs may be lover. Competition among banks may be limited (partly because

of the role that iniormatinn plays as a barrier to entry), and firms that

have high public visibility, with a strong financial position, may be able

to raise funds at comparable interest rates, with lower fees, through

markets. Turning co markets to raise funds has one further advantage, hut a

related disadvantage. The firm using the market (e.g. borrowing by issuing

commercial paper or bonds) may be less affected by credit crunches imposed

by monetary authorities,     In such periods, firms that rely on hank credit

may find that they either have to do with less credit, or must issue

commercial paper; but in dcing so, they may be at a disadvantage relative to

firms that have done so on a regular basis. On the other hand, firms that

rely on long term bonds for much of their financing may find that rhey can

respond less flexibly to changing circumstances.    Firms which are in good

financial strength may perceive themselves as needing this flexibility less,

in which case the willingness to rely on bond finance becomes a positive

signal (as opposed to a negative signal, as suggested above.)




     '5This would not, of course, be true if credit markets were like auction
markets with the commercial paper of one firm being a perfect substitute
for commercial paper from another. Potential lenders have to decide whether
a particular firm which is turning to the cozsmericial paper market is doing
so because of the general credit crunch, or because his bank knows that his
credit worthiness has declined, and has cut off credit.

                                        17
     If market finance is, indeed, less flexible than bank finance, the

change could have important consequences for the Isacroecoomic stability of

the economy:       Greenwald and Stiglits (1988b, 1938c), Stiglitz and Weiss

(1990) and Bornonke and Gertler (1989) have argued that financial

constraints play a central role in the economy's business flucruations.



D. The Distinction and Links Between Primary and Secondary Capital Markets



     Our discussion so far has focused on the role of capital markets in

raising new capital. The term "capital marketsT' (like the term capital) is

nsed in a variety of ways; most of the activities which go under the rubric

of capital markets are connected only loosely with the primary function

which I have described, of raising and allocating new capital. The markets

on which claims to assets are traded are sometimes referted to as secondary

capital markets.      Indeed, only a small fraction of the reacurces of the

financial industry is directed at raising and allocating capital.

     Keynes likened the seccndary financial market (the stock market) to a

beauty contest, in which the judges were concerned not with judging who wss

the most beautiful contestant, but who the other judges would think would be

judged the most beautiful contestant (or, perhaps more accurately, he shonid

have said, who the other judges would judge the other judges to judge to he

the most beautiful contescant. .   . .)   Others (Stiglica, 1982) have suggested

that the stock market might be thought of as a gambling casino.            It is

impossible to reconcile behavior in this market with rational, risk averse

individuals.




                                            18
     While the   ability of individuals to trade on the secondary market

undoubtedly makes securities mere attractive, Keynes, as well as many more

recent authors (such as }{irshleifer, 1971, and Stiglitz, 1971) have

suggested that ranch of the short term speculative activity has zero or

negative net social value. While it is true that the stock market may be

efficient, reflecting all available information20, that information has

little effect on resource allocations. Firms do not and cannot rely on the

information (whatever that is) communicated by the stock market for making

their production and investment decisions. (See Stiglitz, 1989.) While one

individual, by getting the information earlier than the other, may be able

to "trick" another individual into buying a share from him, or selling a

share to him, these trades only affect who gets society's resources; they do

not affect the level of production. They represent, in other words, private

rent seeking activities.

     I stress this because the two aspects of financial markets are often

confused.   Much of the recent innovations in financial markets have been

concerned with the secondary market.    New instruments have been invented.

Transactions can be recorded sore      quickly.    But improvements in the

secondary markets do not necessary mean that the economy functions more

efficiently. (Indeed, Stiglitz and Weiss (1989) have shown that some of the

financial innovations, such as faster recording of transactions, may




     2°Though if it were truly efficient in that sense, no one would have
any incentive to collect information, and thus the only information which
would be reflected in the market price would be free (although in this case,
that may not mean completely worthless) information.        See Grossman and
Stiglitz (1976, 1980).

                                       19
actually be unaabiguously welfare reducing.)     In particular, the primary

financial markets may not perform their roles any better.21

       These observations are important, because they warn ua against

thinking that improvements in secondary financial markets--or decreases in

government regulations of secondary financial markets-- necessarily, or even

normally, will iaprove the efficiency of the economy.



                    II. A Critique of the Two Paradigms



                          A. The Market Pmradigsi



       Allocating capital is thus a much core complicated matter than the

simple "supply and demand" paradigm suggests.       Unfortunately, much of the

simplistic advice given by "free market" economists is based on the

hypotheses that markets fur capital are just like aarkets for chairs and

tables; that competitive markets--whether for chairs, tables, or capital--

ensure Pareto efficient resource allocations; and that policies that move

the economy closer to free market soiuttcns are welfare enhancing.         All

three of these presumptions are incorrect. We have already argued against

the first. And there is no Intellectual foundationa for either of the ocher

two,

       The second best theorems of Meade and Lancaster and Lipsey long ago

showed thac in crononies in which there were some distortions, removing one



     2tThey even may perform their functions less effeotively.      Taxing
transactions may reduce noise trading, and hence market volatility.   Long
term investors' expected return may be increased, and their risk may be
reduced. See, e.g. Scmmera and Summers (1989) or Stiglitz (1989).

                                        20
distortion may not be welfare enhancing. Uhile they did not have in mind

the kinda of problems with which we are concerned here, the baaic lesson

remains valid in this context as well.22

     More fundamentally, Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986, 1988) showed that

economies in which markets are incomplete23 or in which inioreation is

imperfect--that ia, all economies--are, in general not constrained Pareto

efficient that is, there almost always exista some forms of quite limited

government intervention, e.g. taxes and subsidies, which respect the

limitations on markets and information which are Pareto improviogJ''

     I ahould perhaps distinguish the Greenwald-Stiglitz view from other

market failure approaches to government intervention. Since the formulation

of the Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics, there has been a wall-

articulated view concerning the role of government intervention, which has

been known as the market failures approach.        This apprcach identifies

inportant instances where the assumptions underlying the Fundamental Theorem

are not satisfied, and argues for a very seiectfye intervention in the

market co correct those well-identified instances of market failure.     For

instance, the presence of pollution cells for a government pollutant tax.



     22Ron Mckinnon (1989) provides a good discussion of how liberalizing
financial markets in less developed countries may not have been welfare
enhancing.

     23 Several earlier studies showed that eccnonies in which there were
an incomplete set of risk markets were not constrained Pareto efficient.
See, in particular, Newbery and Stigliti (1981, 1982, 1984) and Stiglits
(1982b) -

     2They show that several widely discussed examples in the literature
(e.g. the Arrow-Debreu model, or the Diamond (1967) stock market model)
represent special cases in which the market is Pareto efficient.



                                           21
The market failures approaches identifies a role for government in

correcting externalities and providing public goods. Beyond that, the

absence of markets into the future provides a basis for government

investment planning,

     By contrast, Creenwald and Stiglita argue that market failures crc

pervasive in the economy and that accordingly there is no nigaumption that

the market, left to itself, would be constrained Paretn efficient.      They

recognize that this in itself does not constitute a recoismendation for

government intervention: nne must be able to identify the Pareto improving

intervention and one must argue that goverresent policies will actual be

consistent with such Pareto iaproviog interventiona.5      The difficulties

associated with each, of these tasks suggests that government intervention

should be selective and aimed at what is likely to be the most significant

instances of market failure.   The problems that arise in financial markets

suggest that market as one such candidate.



                       B. Government as the Solution



     While the precise arguments put forward by Greenwald and Stiglitz in

their critique of market solutions may be new, the view that markets do not

provide a good basis for raising aod allocating capital within LDCs (or,

for that matter, in more devaloped countries) is not.   In the absence of a

complete act of futures markets, prices cannot perfors that central role of

coordinating investment decisions that traditional price theory ascribes to



     In their paper, they relate the desirable government interventions to
empirically observable parameters.

                                       22
it. Whether for this or other reasons, many governments have seen the task

of allocating capital as being too important to he left to the private

sector, The socialist platform typically has the nationalization of banks

and other financial institutions high on its agenda.

     The central problems which I have discussed are no less problems within

the public sector than in the private.         Shifring the locus of decision

saking does not alter the difficulties associated with selection and

monitoring. But to make matters worse, the government often does not have

the incentives to ensure that it (or its ageits) does a good job in

selecting and monitoring loans.    The deep pocket of the government means

that any losses can easily be made up.        Moreover, since economic criteria

are often supplemented with other criteria (saving jobs, regional

development), losaas can be blamed not on an inability to make judgments

about credit worthiness, but on the non-economic criteria which have been

imposed. The absence of the check provided by the market teat means that

credit can he allocated on the basis of political favoritism: the subsidy

associated with charging a lower rste of interest than the riskiness of the

loan merits is hidden.26

     The results of this and the previous subsection oight, at firat, seen

to be ai odds with each other, but they are not. In the previous section,

we showed thee in economies in which there are an incomplete set of markets

or imperfect inforaaticn (virtually all markets) there exists actions by the

government which are Pareto improvements, and which respect thc limitations




     26Moreover, even in the absence of corruption, if rationing is optimal,
the ability to choose among loan applicants gives the government an enorsous
saoont of power.

                                         23
on the existence of markets and the availability of information. Government

is not given any more powers in these respects than the private sector.5'

When the central result of economic theory was that no government, no ratter

how benevolent or how far sighted, could improve upon the workings of the

private sector, we had no need to call upon a theory of government to

describe what an actual government might do in a particular situation: the

upper hound of what it might achieve was no higher than that of thu private

market, The Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem ssye that there is a potential scope

fcr welfare improving government activity. Whether government action will

actually improve matters is a more delicate question.     This subsection of

the paper serves to remind us that governments face the same informational

prohlems that the private sector does, snd in addition faces some "political

economy" problems, difficulties which, in the past, in jppjy   (but   not all)

instances have limited the ability of the gcvernmenr to effect welfare

improvements.

     But while I am not sanguine about the ability of government to rep)ece

markets as a mechanism for raising and allocating capital, our anaiysis at

least suggests the possibility that there may exist government polities

which will enhance the efficiency--for the social perspective--with which

the market economy raimes and allocates capital. Of course, any analysis of

government policies towards capital markets needs to take into ocoonnt the

fundamental problems (enforcement, selection, incentives) to which we hove

called attention.     With this view in mind, I went to discuss several


     °7lhere are, of course, still distinctions between the government and
the private sector. The government, for instance, has the power to tax and
to proscribe entry. For a fuller analysis, at a theoretical level, of rho
differences between governnent and other economic organizations, see
Brights (l989b,)

                                        24
possible policies.       I want to emphasize the tentative nature of this

discussion:   the central thrust of my paper is that alternative policies

need to be evaluated from s perspective which takes into account the central

features of capital markets, as I have described there, and the second best

nature of the problem.



                     III. Renarks on Economic Policy



Banks versus secujities msrkets as sources of funds, The first, and most

obvious implication of our analysis is that the LDCs must expect that firms

within their economies will have to rely heavily on bank lending, rather

than sacuricies markets, as sources of funds. While it may do little harm

for governments to try to promote tha growth of aacuriciaa markets, both

aarkata for equities and long term bonds, these are likely to provide only a

small fraction of the funds firms require.      If investors are inadequately

protected, by strong securities and fraud laws, and a judiciary which can

fairly and effectively enforce such laws, there is a high likelihood of

abuses; the resulting loss of investor confidence may have repercussions

well beyond the aecurities directly affected.

     Since primarily reliance almost inevitably will be placed on bank

lending, it is importani for governmenta to take actions which improve the

efficiency of the banking system.

     For instance, having well definad property rights (say in land)

provides a source of collateral, which facilitates bank lending.               A

judiciary which can quickly deal with defaults, at low costs, allowing the




                                        25
lender Lo    seize   and dispose of the collateral again enhances the willingness

of hanks to lend.

     Such reforms may seem relatively uncontroversial, compared tn the

suggestions below.



Foreign investment and banks.            Many governments of LDCs have been
particularly loath to allow foreign banks to play a major role.        I want to

suggest that this policy ipgy be misguided, but in any case, needs to be re-

examined    from the perspectives provided in    this paper.

     In   all countries, the ratio of banks' net worth to their liabilities is
usually very small.        In a sense, banks can be viewed as highly leveraged
firms.     Highly leveraged firms are particularly prone to undertaking risks

which are not in the interests of their lenders--here these who have

deposited funds with them.

     In the United Ststem (and many other countries) the government provides

depositors with insurance.         When the idea of auth insurance was first

broached to President Roosevelt, he reacted strongly negatively, pointing

out (to use our modern terminology) the moral hazard (incentive) problems to

which that insurance gives rise.          Though he eventually relented, vith
hindsight, we can see how right he was!28          Banks which undertake greater

risk can offer greater intereat rates to depositors, who tan, with impunity,

turn over their funds to the bank, These banks attract funds away from mote

prudent banks. A kind of Gresham'a Law works with a vengeance.



     2810 the United States, at the preaent time, not only do a majority of
savings and loan institutions have negative net worth (if their assets were
valued at current market value), but so do a significant frattioo of the
major banks. See Bruishaugh, Carron and Litsn (1989).

                                            26
     What is at issue is not jusL corruption (though that plays a role as

well)°, but rather judgments about prudent risks.           It is evidently

extremely difficult for honk regulators to monitor banks effectively.     One

must largely rely on market forces to ensure that banks take prudent

actions. What regulators can do is to try to ensure that the banks have an

incentive to take prudent actions.      The maintenance of reputation is one

such incentive. But the cost of losing one's reputation is obviously larger

for a large international hank than for a small local bank.       High equity

(net worth) also may be effective.        Local banks may find it difficult

raising the required equity.

     These arguments suggest that foreign banks and firms may be sore

reliable in siloceting capital efficiently than domestic banks and fitiss.

To put it another way, establishing a reputation is like any other

investment.     The process of allocating capital- -when due concern is taken

for the requisite incentives if it is to be done well- -is e capital

intensive process, and foreign banks (and other international companies) may

have a comparative advantage in that process.

     At the same time, there may be an infant industry argument for

protection, and, in particular, for limiting external capital flows (which

allnw foreign institutions to serve the role of intermediation30) and the

operation of foreign banks domestically.      So long as savers have a choice

between domestic and foreign banks, at comparable tents, they will choose


     29The corruption itself may, to some extent, be viewed as endogenous;
the opportunities to profit by dishonesty attract those with such
inclinations.

         In several LUCs, capital outflows roughly equal capital inflows.
It is as if funds went to international banks to be intermediated, and then
wore returned to the country of origin.

                                         27
the latter.   (Lack of) reputation serves as an effective entry barrier for

doaesitc banks: to compensate for the lack of reputation they cannot pay a

higher interest rate, for that (in the by now familiar way) would

oxacorbate both the moral hazard and adverse selection problems.

     Domestic firms are not only at a reputation disadvantage; they are also

at a risk disadvantage.     International firms can diversify over a wide

portfolio.    Even if the domestic banks have a portfolio of assets that is

widely diversified among domestic risks, the common (country) risks which

affect all of them (exchange ri-sks and other macro-economic risks) make

theit portfolios riskier.    Hence, even with the same "reputation" and the

same equity base, investors might rationally prefer foreign firms,

     While foreign fins may thus have an advantage within the cepitsl

market, they may have an informational disadvantage --they may find it more

difficult to respond to the particular situations which arise in the

country.31 That is why there is much to be gained from a country having its

own entrepreneurs.22    But entrepreneurship is, in part, learned, and to

undertake the learning requires capital.     And we have explained why it is

that dozes tic entrepreneurs end banks may find it difficult raising the

requisite capital.

     Note that a standsrd argument against the infant industry arguisent

simply doesn't apply in this context: if the idea is a good one, the firs

should be willing to sell at a loss, until its costs are down to a level at

which it could compete effectively. For to sell at a loss, the firm must


     31This argument may not be a compelling one against foreign honks
located within the LDCs.

     32There are undoubtedly other reasons as well, such as national pride.


                                        28
borrow or raise equity, and it is precisely the inability of firms to borrow

or raise equity which is our concern here

     Moreover, there may be a distinct difference betwoen private and social

returns, both to entrepreneurship and to providing capital to new

entrepreneurs. Private investors (banks), for instance, are only concerned

with that fraction of the total returns which they can appropriate; society,

more broadly conceived, is coccerned with the total returns to the project

which accrue within the country (thus excluding the surplus returns which

say accrue to foreign investors.)33 '

     More broadly, foreign hanks, in allocating capital, will have different

objectives than those of domestic banks, so that the disparity between

social and private returns may be particularly large.         Foreign banks may

particularly concerned with nationalization, end thus may provide capital to

sectors which appear relatively isajuna from nationalization, and in forms

(with restrictions) that make nationalization less likely and that make it

aore likely that, should nationalization occur, they can recover their

capital.

     While these arguments might suggest a role for government credit

markets, the caveats we expressed earlier suggest that other forms of

indirect subsidy may be more effective.        Restrictions on foreign banks and

on capital flows out of the country (impeding the efficiency of the


    33itiglitz and Weiss (1981) argued that in their model of credit
rationing, there was a distinct disparity between social and private
returns.

           Hoff [i989 argues, for instance, that when an entrepreneur
undertakes a new project, it conveys information to other entrepreneurs
about the idiosyncratic properties of the country's production techcology,
returns which that entrepreneur cannot appropriate.


                                          29
secondary capital market) oay be cne way of channelling funds to domes tir

cotrepreneurs and of subsidizing domestic banks and corporations.        Such

broad restrictions provide domestic investors with incentives to allocate

funds to the best domestic projects/entrepreneurs, and if there is broad

enough competition within the domestic economy--an important caveat- - the

rents obtsined by domestic firms will be limited.

     Another caveat is in order As always, a concern needs to be expressed

thst restrictions are not used simply to protect domestic monopolies. Thus,

if one or two banks dorlnate the doncstic banking industry, restrictions on

foreign banks may simply scrvo to protect those firms' monopoly rents.

Those firms may not be particularly efficient allocators of capital, and the

disparity between their interests and a broader sense of national interest

may be no less than the corresponding disparity for foreign banks.     Since

in many LDCs, the domestic banking sector is far from competitive, policies

aimed at locking out foreign owned banks located within the country may be

particularly inadvisable,



     In the previous section, I argued that restrictions on the secondary

capital markets--on the free flow of funds abroad- -may have sore advantages

in encouraging the development of e domestic financial sector.             To

e0000miers used to hearing the contention that governments should try to

'free up" nerkers, this argument may seem strange.

    One of the important lessons of the theory of the second best, to which

i referred earlier, is that when there are some important distortions in the

economy, removing one distortion may not be welfsre enhancing.       In most

LOTs, there are maoy distortions. Indeed, as we argued esrlier, in markets


                                       30
with incomplete risk markets end imperfect information--that is, in all

markets- - there   is     no presumption that market allocations will be

(constrained) Pareto efficient, and a fortiori, there is no preauaption that

making one market--the secondary capital market--work sore nearly like the

"ideal" market is welfare enhancing.

     Far instance, McKinnon (1988) has argued persuasively that flexible,

unmanaged exchange rates have imposed enormous risk burdens on producers

engaged in international trade, risks which they cannot divest adequately

thrcugh futures sarkets.        Oor analysis of limited equity markets suggests

thst these risks may have real--and deleterious--effects.            (See, for

instance, Newbery and Stiglits (1981,1984).)

     All of this suggests that there are no easy policy answers.        In same

cases, governments have (perhaps unintentinnally) served to exacerbate the

prcblems we have identified rather than reduce them, by subjecting the

domestic banking industry to high taxes and arbitrary and capriciouc

cegulation.        [ri these cases, "freeing op" the market would seem to nske

gcod policy sense.



Multinationals.         Many of the same arguments for why foreign banks may be

able to perform an important role in allocating capital apply to

multinationals,         They have one advantage over banks:      they typically

provide capital in the form of (what is in effect) equity, While equity has

distinct advantages over debt--it provides more effective risk sharing, and

 thus leads firma to act in a less risk averse manner, resulting, in turn,

 in the economy being less sensitive to a variety of shocks- -we have seen

 that tilts era likely to face particular problems in establishing well


                                            31
functioning equity markets. Thus, it may be desirable for governments in

12Cc to recognize the important role that multinationals can play in the

development process, rather than putting impediments in their way,



Risk sharing by government,         For the teasons I have explained equity

markets are unlikely to provide effective risk sharing opportunities. Hany

governments, by their tax policies, exacerbate the effects of limited equity

morkets, for the gcvernment shares in the profits, hut shares in the losses

to a much more limited extent.        As Domar and Nusgrave (1944) and Stiglitz

(1969) long ago recognized if the government fully shares in gains and

losses,    it can actually encoursge risky investment; in effect,                 the

government enters into every investment as a silent partner.35 Though this

is not the occasion to provide a detailed technical proposal of how this aay

he done, I should note that there are several ways in which governments can

shore risk much more effectively than they do at present,35



Covernrent risk reduction strstegg. In addition, there are poliojes which

the government eon undertake which reduce the riskiness of the environments

in which firms operate, and given the limited opportunities for risk sharing


     35Hore recently, Auerbach and Poterhe (1987) have emphasized the
importance, within the United States, of the provisions limiting loss deductibility.

          The important difference between the government acting as a silent
equity partner, through the tax system, and the government acting as a
source of credit (as described above) needs to be recognized: in the latter
oaso, the government is given discretion; in the forcer case,                     the
"partnership" arrangement is automatic, While this partnership srtangemenc
obviously affects incentives (attenuating effort inoentives, accentuating
risk incentives), the question is, on balance, are these incentive effects
positive, or, if negative, suffioiently small to outweigh the government's
revenue gain?


                                            32
provided by markets, this can provide a strong stimulus for the economy. In

particular, it can increase both the willingness of firms to borrow (since

the lower the riskiness of the environment, the more they can borrow while

still facing a particular probability of bankruptcy), end the willingness of

banks to lend.

     These policies can he both micro-economic and macro-economic in nature.

Stabilizing the price of export crops will not only have a direct effect on

the producers of export crops (assuming that price and quantity are not too

negatively correlated), but will also have an indirect effect;            the

variability of income of the producers of export crops gives rise to

variability in the demand for non-traded goods. Stabilizing incomes within

the rural sector will thus result in increased production of non-traded

goods. (See Newbery-Stiglitz, 1981.)




                                 Conclus ions




     In the past two decades there has been a major shift in the prevailing

economic paradigm, reflected in our views of economic policy in general, and

development economics and policy in particular.

     Earlier discussions focused on the debate between those who believed in

efficient, competitive markets- -for developing as well as developed

countries--and saw government as a major impediment to the efficient

functioning of the economy; sod those who saw pervasive matket failures

requiring government intervention. Among the central market failures which




                                         33
they cited was the absence of a complete set of futures and risk ieerkets37,

and accordingly one of the central responsibilities of the government was to

plan and coordinate investment activities. In the yesrs following World War

TI governments of newly independent countries set up Ministries of Planning

to fulfill their responsibilities and to facilitate the development process.

     But the absence of futures and risk markets was not pure happenstance.

It reflected more fundamental problems- -    including   problems of imperfect

information, imperfect competition end costly contract enforcement--which

affected all economies.      The recognition of the limitations of the

development planning prccess coincided with the recognition of these

linitations of the standard economic paradigm. Withic developed countries,

it was recognized that labor, capital, and product markets worked--in many

instances at least--in a manner markedly different from that depicted by the

conventional competitive demand and anpply snalysia. While this paper has

focused on the problems associated with financial markets, leading to credit

and equity rationing, similar analyses have been conducted of labor and

produnt markets. These problems are, if anything, more pervasive and more

prominent in tDCs than in developed economies.

     We have already noted one major implication of this perspective: there

ia no longer any presumption that market solutions are (constrained) Pareto

efficient.   but there is another equally important implication:           the

problems of imperfect information--including imperfect monitoring--is no

less present in the public sector than in the private.          The fact that



          noted earlier, the Fundamentsl Theorem of Welfare Economics, which
represented the formalization of Adam Smith's notion of the Invisible 1-land,
requires that there be m complete set of risk and futures markets, Only
under these conditions will competitive markets ensure economic efficiency.

                                        34
markets do not work as well as their ardent proponents claus does not mean

that governments can remedy the problem. The absence or limited scope of

financial markets may not be simply because the private sector has failed to

recognize a profitable opportunity. There are, aa we have seen, good

reasons that financial markets look markedly different from the way they are

characterized in old-style textbooks.         Governments should at least go

cautiously where private markets fear to tread,

     We now recognize that, particularly for small open economies, the

problems of macro-economic coordination stressed in the earlier development

planning literature may be far less important than the micro-economic

problems of selecting (quite specific) projects and choosing good managers

to manage those projects.      And we now recognize the difficulty of micro-

managing     from above--the    virtual impossibility of      specifying   the

characteristics (including delivery dates, durability, etc.), and of setting

prices for each of the infinity of possible commodities, We have else come

to recognize the pervasiveness of decentralized planning in market

economies.     The old market paradigm wes wrong in may more ways than

suggested by simply the absence of futures markets.35

     One of the functions of the economy's financial institutions is not

only to raise capital, but to channel funds to che most profitable

opportunities (the selection or screening function), and to ensure that

those funds are well used (the monitoring function,) We need to think more

about vhat kinds of institutions can most effectively perform these

functions.    Centralized government bureaucracies and large public credit

institutions may be poorly situated to perform those functions. But there


     38For a more extensive discussion of these issues, see Stiglitz (1989).

                                         35
may be ways in which the government can assist in the development of a

variety of institutions which can play an important role.

     But much of this paper is predicated on a more pessimistic appreisal.of

the potential role of financial markets in the development process. It has

argued that they play a limited role even within well organized developed

countries, and that their role within the LDCs is likely to be even more

circujastribed. Hence, government policies should be directed at mitigating

the consequences of these inherent--and important--limitations of financial

markets and institutions within LDCa.        lThat might be called hsecond• or

"third" heat policies have to be developed.           Many current government

poiicies fail to recognize these limitations which fate both the government

and the private sector.   I have put forward some quite tentative propoaals

which suggest some ways in which government policy can be designed to

reflect the broad set of concerns which I have raised.
