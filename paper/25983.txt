We study the evolution of profits, investment and market shares in US industries over the past 40 years.
During the 1990's, and at low levels of initial concentration, we find evidence of efficient concentration
driven by tougher price competition, intangible investment, and increasing productivity of leaders.
After 2000, however, the evidence suggests inefficient concentration, decreasing competition and
increasing barriers to entry, as leaders become more entrenched and concentration is associated with
lower investment, higher prices and lower productivity growth.

We analyze the evolution of concentration in US industries over the past 40 years. Figure 1 summarizes the
four stylized facts that motivate our work. Concentration and Profits have increased, while the labor share
and investment have decreased (Panels A to D, respectively).1 This is true across most US industries as
shown by Grullon et al. (2019) (concentration and profits), Autor et al. (2017a) (labor shares) and Gutiérrez
and Philippon (2017b) (investment and profits). While these stylized facts are well established, we are still
far from consensus on what is causing them and what they tell us about the health of the U.S. economy. The
most prominent explanations can be organized in two groups:

    · Good Concentration: the observed trends may be explained by good sources of concentration, such
        as increases in the elasticity of substitution (henceforth  ) or technological change leading to increas-
        ing returns to scale and intangible capital deepening (henceforth  ). Autor et al. (2017a) argue for  ,
        noting that concentration reflects "a winner take most feature" explained by the fact that "consumers
        have become more sensitive to price and quality due to greater product market competition." Haskel
        and Westlake (2017) argue for  , emphasizing how scalability and synergies of intangible capital can
        lead to increasing returns to scale. Under  and  , concentration is good news: more productive firms
        expand yet competition remains stable or increases.

    · Bad Concentration: alternatively, the trends may reflect bad sources of concentration, which we
        summarize as rising barriers to competition (henceforth ).2 Furman (2015), for example, shows that
        "the distribution of returns to capital has grown increasingly skewed and the high returns increasingly
        persistent" and argues that it "potentially reflects the rising influence of economic rents and barriers to
        competition."3 According to , concentration is bad news: it increases economic rents and decreases
        innovation.

The goal of this paper is to differentiate between these explanations at the aggregate- and industry-level.
Before discussing our approach and results, however, it is important to clarify three points. First, these
hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Leaders can become more efficient and more entrenched at the same
time ­ which can explain their growth, but also the rise of barriers to entry (Crouzet and Eberly, 2018).
Indeed, a combination of these explanations is often heard in the discussion of internet giants Google,
Amazon, Facebook or Apple.
    Second, intangibles can play a role in all theories. They may increase the elasticity of substitution (e.g.,
through online price comparison), increase returns to scale (e.g., organizational capital), and also create
barriers to entry (e.g., through patents and/or the compilation of Big Data).
    Third, these specific patterns are unique to the US. Panel A of Figure 2 shows that profits margins have
increased in the US but they have remained stable or decreased in Europe, Japan and South Korea. Panel B

      See Autor et al. (2017a) for a longer time-series of US census-based concentration measures under a consistent segmentation.
The series in Autor et al. (2017a) exhibit similar trends: concentration begins to increase between 1992 and 1997 for Retail Trade
and Services, and between 1997 and 2002 for the remaining sectors.
    2
      One could entertain other hypotheses ­ such as weak demand or credit constraints ­ but previous research has shown that they
do not fit the facts. See Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017b) for detailed discussions and references.

      Furman (2015) also emphasizes emphasizes the weakness of corporate fixed investment and points out that low investment
has coincided with high private returns to capital, implying an increase in the payout rate (dividends and shares buyback).

Notes: Panel A based on the cumulated sales-weighted average change in 8-firm Concentration Ratio (CR8). Data from the US
Economic Census based on SIC-4 codes before 1992 and NAICS-6 codes after 1997. When multiple tax groups are reported,
only taxable firms are included. CR8 equals the market share (by sales) of the 8 largest firms in each industry. We include
only those industries that are consistently defined over each 5-year period. Change from 1992 to 1997 imputed from Autor et al.
(2017b). Panels B, C and D based on quarterly data for the Non-Financial Corporate sector from the Financial Accounts of the
United States, via FRED. Profit rate defined as the ratio of After Tax Corporate Profits with IVA and CCAdj to Value Added
(series W328RC1A027NBEA and NCBGVAA027S, respectively). Labor Share defined as the ratio of compensation of employ-
ees (NCBCEPQ027S) to gross value added (NCBGVAQ027S). NI/OS defined as the ratio of net investment (gross fixed capital
formation minus consumption of fixed capital, series NCBGFCA027N minus NCBCFCA027N) to net operating surplus (series
NCBOSNQ027S). Dotted lines show the average of the corresponding series before and after 2002.

shows that concentration has increased in the US but it has remained roughly stable in Europe and Asia.4
Lastly, panel C shows that the labor share has declined in the US but it has remained stable in Europe
since 2000.5 Assuming that all advanced economies use similar technologies, the uniqueness of US trends
suggests that technology ­ alone ­ cannot explain the trends.

       For this figure, we measure concentration as the ratio of sales by the 8 largest firms in Compustat that belong to a given
KLEMS industry x region to total Gross Output reported in OECD STAN. Corporate consolidation is therefore accounted for, as
dictated by accounting rules. The appendix provides additional details on the calculation, while Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018)
provide a detailed comparison across a wide range of concentration measures for the US and Europe. Bajgar et al. (2019) use
ORBIS data to include private firms; and take into account that some firms are part of larger business groups. When they measure
concentration at the business group-level within 2-digit industries they find a moderate increase in concentration in Europe, with
the unweighted average CR8 increasing from 21.5% to 25.1%. In North America, CR8 increases from 30.3% to 38.4%.
     5
       These comparisons aggregate across industry categories, and may therefore be affected by changes in industry mix. However,
Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) reach similar conclusions using industry-level data. Moreover, in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a),
we compare the evolution of the 5 industries that concentrate the most in the US against Europe. We find that Concentration, profits
and Q increased in the US, while investment decreased. By contrast, concentration and investment remained (relatively) stable in
Europe, despite lower profits and lower Q. This is true even though these industries use the same technology and are exposed to the
same foreign competition. For more on the labor share see Gutiérrez and Piton (2019) and Cette et al. (2019).

Approach         We begin by using a sequence of simple models to clarify the theories of good and bad con-
centration. We derive a broad set of predictions regarding the joint evolution of competition, concentration,
productivity, prices and investment under each theory. We then evaluate these predictions empirically, first
at the aggregate-, then at the industry-level. While some of these predictions have been studied by the lit-
erature, we contribute new facts/results for each of them. We also clarify several measurement issues and,
perhaps more importantly, we show how the combination of all the facts helps us differentiate good and bad
concentration.

Aggregate Results Table 1 summarizes our aggregate results. It contrasts the theoretical prediction of
theories of good and bad concentration against the observed evolution of each measure.6 Predictions colored
green are consistent with the data after 2000. Predictions colored red are not.
    According to theories of good concentration, the growth of large firms is an efficient response to tech-
nological change. Under  , competition increases as consumers become more price elastic. More pro-
ductive firms expand to capture a larger share of the market, while less productive firms either shrink or
exit. Economic activity reallocates towards more productive firms, increasing industry-level productivity
and decreasing prices. Under  , technological change leads to increasing returns to scale. Large firms
again respond by expanding, which increases concentration and productivity while decreasing prices. The
productivity gap between small and large firms grows.
    If the economy experiences good concentration, we should observe: (i) concentration driven in part by
exit; (ii) concentration associated with higher productivity and lower prices; and (iii) stable or increasing
investment rates relative to Tobin's Q ­ particularly for leaders. (iv) If the increase is driven by  , we
should also find higher volatility of market shares as demand responds more strongly to cost shocks. If the
increase is driven by  , however, the prediction could flip: volatility of market shares could fall as leaders'
comparative advantage become (potentially) more persistent (e.g., Aghion et al. (2018)).
    We already know that  and  are important for certain industries during certain periods. For instance,
they describe well the evolution of the retail industry from 1990 to 2005 (Basu et al., 2003; Blanchard,
2003). The rise of superstores and e-commerce led to more price competition, higher concentration, higher
productivity and the exit of inefficient retailers (Hortacsu and Syverson, 2015). The question is whether
these theories explain the evolution of the economy as a whole, over the past 30 years. We test these pre-
   6
       We derive most but not all of these in section 1. For predictions on leader investment, see Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a).


                                                                  5
dictions in the data and find some support for them during the 1990's. During this period, concentration is
correlated with rising productivity, falling prices and high investment ­ particularly in intangibles. Since
2000, however, these predictions are rejected by the data. The correlation between concentration and pro-
ductivity growth has become negative while the correlation between concentration and price growth has
become positive; exit rates have remained stable; investment relative to Q has fallen; and market shares
have become more persistent. Estimates of returns to scale based on the methodology of Basu et al. (2006)
have remained stable, as have other estimates in the recent literature (Ho and Ruzic, 2017; Diez et al., 2018).
All these predictions are consistent with the  theory.
    Barriers to competition therefore emerge as the most relevant explanation over the past 15 years. It
correctly predicts the evolution of profits, entry, exit, turnover, prices, productivity and investment in most
industries.

Industry Results Aggregate trends are interesting, but the dynamics of individual industries are more
informative:  and  cannot explain the broad trends but they probably matter for some industries. To
obtain a systematic classification of industry-level changes, we perform a Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) on a wide range of measures related to competition. We find that the first principal component, PC1,
captures the  and  theories of good concentration while the second principal component, PC2, captures
theories of bad concentration. This distinction is quite stark and allows us to show which industries have
experienced good vs. bad concentration, and to compare the importance of each theory over time.
    Durable computer manufacturing exhibits the highest loading on PC1. It exhibits high intangible capital
intensity but remains relatively competitive, likely as a result of intense foreign competition. By contrast,
Telecom, Banking and Airlines are predominantly explained by , consistent with the results of Gutiérrez
and Philippon (2018). They exhibit high concentration, high profits and low productivity growth. Interest-
ingly, some industries ­ such as nondurable chemical manufacturing and information - data ­ load heavily
on both PC1 and PC2. These industries hold large amounts of intangible assets but also exhibit high barriers
to entry. They are good examples of intangible assets giving rise to barriers to entry, as emphasized by
Crouzet and Eberly (2018). In fact, Crouzet and Eberly (2018) argue that the Healthcare sector ­ which
includes nondurable chemical manufacturing ­ is one where market power derived from intangible assets is
largest.
    Looking at the evolution of loadings over time further emphasizes the transition from good to bad con-
centration. The average PC1 score (reflecting good concentration) was substantially higher than PC2 in
1997, and increased faster from 1997 to 2002. But PC2 caught up afterwards and, by 2012, explained a
larger portion of industry dynamics. Our results therefore indicate that the US economy has transitioned
from good to bad concentration over the past 30 years.

Related Literature Our paper contributes to a growing literature studying recent trends in competition
and concentration in the US economy. The literature began by (separately) documenting the stylized facts.
Haltiwanger et al. (2011) find that "job creation and destruction both exhibit a downward trend over the past
few decades." Decker et al. (2015) argue that, whereas in the 1980's and 1990's declining dynamism was ob-


                                                      6
served in selected sectors (notably retail), the decline was observed across all sectors in the 2000's, including
the traditionally high-growth information technology sector. CEA (2016) and Grullon et al. (2019) docu-
ment the broad increases in profits and concentration; Elsby et al. (2013) and Karabarbounis and Neiman
(2014) document the decline in the labor share; and IMF (2014); Hall (2015); Fernald et al. (2017) discuss
the decline in investment in the context of weak overall growth. Akcigit and Ates (2019) review some of the
literature.
    Over time, the literature began to connect these facts and propose theories of "good" and "bad" con-
centration (we use "good" and "bad" for didactic purposes). The most prominent explanations of good
concentration include Autor et al. (2017a) and Van Reenen (2018) who argue that rising concentration and
declining labor shares are explained by an increase in  , which results in "winner take most/all" competi-
tion; and Alexander and Eberly (2016) and Crouzet and Eberly (2018) who link the rise in concentration and
the decline in investment to intangible capital. Bessen (2017) links IT use to industry concentration, while
Ganapati (2018) links concentration to increasing labor productivity and stable prices. Aghion et al. (2018)
and Ridder (2019) develop models where Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) increase
returns to scale, leading to higher concentration and lower labor shares.
    Moving to bad concentration, Grullon et al. (2019) show that firms in concentrating industries exhibit
higher profits, positive abnormal stock returns and more profitable M&A deals. Barkai (2017) documents
a rise in economic profits and links it to concentration and labor shares. De-Loecker et al. (2019) argue
that markups have increased. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017b) link the weakness of investment to rising
concentration and market power, while Lee et al. (2016) find that capital stopped flowing to high Q industries
in the late 1990's. Eggertsson et al. (2018) introduce time-varying market power to a standard neoclassical
model to explain several of our stylized facts. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018), Jones et al. (2019) and
Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019) argue that domestic competition has declined in many US industries because
of increasing entry costs, lax antitrust enforcement, and lobbying.
    We would like to notice that this debate between good and bad concentration has a direct precedent
in the Industrial Organization literature of the 1970's and 1980's. By then, the discussion was centered
on how to interpret the positive correlation between profits and concentration at the industry level, first
documented by Bain (1951). While this fact was commonly rationalized as evidence of market power ("bad
concentration"), Demsetz (1973) argued that the observed pattern was instead explained by differences
in productivity ("good concentration"). This seminal contribution spanned a series of empirical papers
evaluating these two hypotheses, reviewed in Schmalensee (1987).
    Finally, our paper is also related to the effect of foreign competition ­ particularly from China (see
Bernard et al. (2012) for a review). Bernard et al. (2006) show that capital-intensive plants and industries
are more likely to survive and grow in the wake of import competition. Bloom et al. (2015) argue that
Chinese import competition leads to increased technical change within firms and a reallocation of employ-
ment towards more technologically advanced firms. Frésard and Valta (2015) find that tariff reductions
lead to declines in investment in markets with competition in strategic substitutes and low costs of entry.
Within-industry, they find that investment declines primarily at financially constrained firms. The decline in
investment is negligible for financially stable firms and firms in markets featuring competition in strategic

complements. Hombert and Matray (2015) show that R&D-intensive firms were better able to cope with
Chinese competition than low-R&D firms. They explain this result based on product differentiation, using
the Hoberg and Phillips (2017) product similarity index. Autor et al. (2013); Pierce and Schott (2016); Autor
et al. (2016); Feenstra et al. (2017) study the effects of Chinese import exposure on US manufacturing em-
ployment. Feenstra and Weinstein (2017) estimate the impact of globalization on mark-ups, and conclude
that mark-ups decreased in industries affected by foreign competition. Some of these papers find a reduction
in investment for the `average' firm, which is consistent with our results and highlights the importance of
considering industry leaders and laggards separately.

      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 derives theoretical predictions. Section 2
discusses measurement issues related to common empirical proxies of competition. Section 3 tests aggregate
predictions related to business dynamism, productivity, prices, investment and returns to scale. Section 4
replicates the exercise at the industry-level, using PCA. Section 5 concludes.


1      Theory
We use a few simple models to derive testable predictions for the various hypotheses. The timing of the
models follows the classic model of Hopenhayn (1992): (i) there is a sunk entry cost ; (ii) firms draw their
productivities a (and/or idiosyncratic demand shocks); (iii) they either produce with a fixed operating cost
 or they exit early.


1.1     Good Concentration, Bad Concentration.
Let us start with the simple case where there is no heterogeneity. Consider, then, an industry with N identical
firms with productivity ai = A for all i  [0, N ], and industry demand Y . Suppose the game among the N
firms leads to a mark-up µ over marginal cost. In other words, firms set the price

                                                           1+µ
                                                      p=
                                                            A

and firm i's profits are
                                                  1               µ
                                    i =    p-         yi -  =        pyi - 
                                                  A              1+µ
In a symmetric equilibrium with identical firms, all firms produce

                                                  Y
                                           yi =     for all i  [0, N ]
                                                  N

So profits are
                                                       µ pY
                                              =             -
                                                      1+µ N
Under free entry, we have
                                                      E [ ]

where r is the discount rate,  is the (exogenous) exit rate, and  is the sunk entry cost. The free entry
condition is then
                                                    µ        pY

                                                                                           ¯ /p and we
A simple case is when industry demand is unit elastic (Cobb-Douglas). In that case Y (p) = Y
              µ     ¯
                    Y
have N       1+µ (r+ )+ .    We then have the following proposition

Proposition 1. In response to shocks to ex-post mark-ups µ, concentration is positively related to competi-
tion. In response to shocks to , concentration is negatively related to competition.

      This proposition summarizes the fundamental issue with using concentration as a proxy for competition.
Concentration is endogenous and can signal either increasing or decreasing degrees of competition. In
other words, when looking at concentration measures, it is crucial to take a stand on why concentration is
changing, in particular to see if it is driven by shrinking margins or by higher barriers to entry.

Corollary 1. Concentration is a valid measure of market power only when concentration is driven by
barriers to entry or by mergers.

    Note that it is straightforward to extend the analysis to the case where µ depends on the number of
firms. We can write µ = ¯
                       1+µ   lN - where ¯l is the baseline Lerner index and  is the elasticity of the mark-up
to concentration. In a standard CES-monopolistic competition model, for instance, we have  = 0 and
¯                                                               ¯¯
                                                                lY
l = 1/ . We can then write the free entry condition as N 1+  (r+ )+ which shows that our propositions
are valid when markups vary with concentration.

1.2     Selection and Ex-Post Profits
Consider now the case of heterogenous marginal costs. Heterogeneity creates a selection effect and we need
                                                       ^ ) and the number of firms that actually produce
to distinguish between the number of firms that enter (N
(N ). Formally, consider the following industry entry game:
                                                                      ^ ;
      · Each entrant pays  for the right to produce one variety i  0, N

      · After entry, each firm draws productivity ai , and decides whether to produce with fixed operating cost
         and mark-up µi .

Let N  N^ be the number of active producers. We re-order the varieties so that i  [0, N ] are active while
i  N, N^ exit early. The demand system is given by the CES aggregator

                                                               N     -1
                                                                     
                                             Y         =           yi       di

to consider only this case. We could assume limit pricing at some mark-up µ < -     1 , strategic interactions
among firms, and so on. For now we simply keep µ as a parameter.
   Firms with productivity ai < a do not produce, so the active producers are N = (1 - F (a )) N          ^

There is a cutoff a such that only firms above the cutoff are active producers

The RHS is increasing in  and decreasing in a , so we have the standard selection effect.

Lemma 1. The cutoff a increases with the demand elasticity  .

    From the free entry condition we have

                                     (r +  )  = (1 - F (a )) × E [ | a > a ] .

Since 1 - F (a ) decreases with  it follows that E [ | a > a ] must increase with  for a given .

Proposition 2. For a given free entry condition, an increase in  leads to higher rate of failed entry (early
exits) and higher profits for remaining firms (selection effect). An increase in , on the other hand, leads to
lower entry, lower exit, and higher profits.

    This proposition allows us to distinguish the  hypothesis from the  hypothesis.


                                                              10
1.3     Increasing Returns
Now suppose that firms can choose between two technologies after entry: low fixed cost & low produc-
tivity (AL , L ) or high fixed cost & high productivity (AH , H ). Let us ignore idiosyncratic productivity
differences for now. Profits are then

                                                             µ  a              -1     PY

The choice of technology clearly depends on the size of the market and the elasticity of demand.

Lemma 2. Firms are more likely to switch to the high returns to scale technology when  is high.

      Assume that the parameters are such that the firms decide to switch to ai = AH for all i. Equilibrium

Concentration increases when firms switch to the high return to scale technology. The behavior of equilib-
rium profits depends on the selection effect. Without idiosyncratic risk, profits are simply pinned down by
free entry. If we take into account idiosyncratic risk, then equilibrium profits increase when firms switch to
the high return to scale technology because the selection effect intensifies.

Proposition 3. A switch to increasing return technology is more likely when demand is more elastic. A
higher degree of increasing returns to scale leads to more concentration, higher profits and higher produc-
tivity for the remaining firms.

      This proposition connects  and  , as often discussed in the literature. Note that we can measure the
                                                                                 1                       1
degree of returns to scale  as the ratio of average cost                 y   +   A    to marginal cost   A:

                                                         A                 µ

which is increasing with  since N is decreasing in . Therefore if we were to measure  under the old and
the new technologies, we would indeed find H > L .


1.4     Dynamics of Market Shares
Consider finally the case where, after entry, firms are subject to demand and productivity shocks. In the
general case, we have j  [0, 1] industries and i  [0, Nj ] firms in each industry. The output of industry j
                    j -1                                 j -1
                                        1
                    j            Nj                      j
is aggregated as Yj,t      =    0     hi,j,t (yi,j,t )          di, where j is the elasticity between different firms in the
same industry and hi,j,t are firm-level demand shocks. The demand for good (i, j ) is given by

                                                                                        -j
                                                                             pi,j,t
                                                yi,j,t = hi,j,t Yj,t
                                                                             Pj,t

                                                                    11

                                                    pi,j,t yi,j,t = pi,j,t j hi,j,t Pj,t

and the market share of firm i in industry j is
                                                                                                 j -1

                                                    Pj,t Yj,t       Nj       (1 + µi,j ) Aj,t

where µj is the industry average mark-up and Aj,t is the industry average productivity, as defined earlier. If
we track the market shares of firms over time, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 4. The volatility of log-market shares is

                                                                          2 2
                                                   2       2
                                                   log s = log h + (j - 1) log a


where 2
      log a is the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity shocks.

and therefore

Corollary 2. All else equal, an increase in j leads to an increase in the volatility of market shares in
industry j .

      In summary, we have that an increase in  leads to an increase in concentration, productivity, exit,
the volatility of market shares and investment. Similarly, an increase in  results in more concentration,
higher profits and higher productivity for surviving firms.7 Finally, an increase in  leads to an increase in
concentration, and a decrease in productivity, exit rates, market share volatility and investment (relative to
Q).


2         Measurement Issues
Before testing our predictions, we discuss two important issues related to the measurement of concentration
and mark-ups.


2.1         Foreign Competition and Concentration
First, when computing industry concentration, it is important to control for imports. We compute import-
adjusted concentration measures (CR8IA ) and use them throughout the paper. Figure 3 shows the impor-
tance of the correction, focusing on manufacturing industries that are highly exposed to foreign competition.
While domestic concentration increased by 6.7 percentage points in these industries, import-adjusted con-
centration (dotted line) increased by only 1.6 points.8 Foreign competition, therefore, plays an important

      7
          In this model, an increase in returns to scale correspond to a shift towards a high productivity, high fixed cost technology.
      8
          Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a) reports similar results using Herfindahls and the data of Feenstra and Weinstein (2017).


                                                                      12
role in manufacturing. But import-exposed industries only account for about 10% of the private economy,
so foreign competition cannot explain the aggregate trends that we have presented earlier.

year. See appendix for details.


2.2        Mark-up Measurement
The second issue relates to measurement of mark-ups. De-Loecker et al. (2019) (DLEU hereafter) estimate
mark-ups using the methodology of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). The idea is to compare the elasticity
of output to a variable input, with the cost share of that input. DLEU implement this methodology using
COGS (cost of goods sold) as their main measure of variable input. While this approach is promising in
theory, the question is whether it provides a reliable measure of market power. There are measurement issues
with COGS that we discuss in Appendix A. Our main concern, however, is that technology can change over
time in a way that creates challenges for COGS-based mark-up measures.

Identification: The China Shock.                                                  We use the China shock to illustrate this issue, following Autor et al.
(2016) and Pierce and Schott (2016). Chinese competition led to a strong replacement effect. Figure 4 shows
the normalized number of firms in industries with high and low Chinese import penetration.9 Both groups
have the same pre-existing trends, including during the dot-com boom, but start to diverge after 2000. In

                                                                                                                                               UC

          We follow Autor et al. 2016 and define import penetration for industry j at time t as IPjt =                               Yj,91 +Mj,91 -Ej,91
                                                                                                                                                         ,   where
     UC
Mjt      denotes the change in US imports from China from 1991 to t; and Yj,91 + Mj,91 - Ej,91 denotes the initial absorption
(defined as output, Yj,91 , plus imports, Mj,91 , minus exports, Ej,91 ). Yj,91 is sourced from the NBER-CES database; while Mj,91
and Ej,91 are based on Peter Schott's data. Only NAICS level 6 industries where data are available across all sources are included
in the analyses.

unreported tests, we confirm this relationship is strongly statistically significant.



    Realized imports are endogenous so, in the rest of the section, we use the instrument proposed by Pierce
and Schott (2016). The instrument exploits changes in barriers to trade following the United States granting
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China.10 Pierce and Schott (2016) show that industries facing
larger NTR gaps experienced a larger increase in Chinese imports and a larger decrease in US employment.
We follow Pierce and Schott (2016) and quantify the impact of granting PNTR on industry j as the difference
between the non-NTR rate (to which tariffs would have risen if annual renewal had failed) and the NTR rate
as of 1999:


                                                        N T R Gapj = N on N T R Ratej - N T R Ratej .

This measure is plausibly exogenous to industry demand and technology after 2001. The vast majority of
the variation in NTR gaps is due to variation in non-NTR rates set 70 years prior to passage of PNTR. See
Pierce and Schott (2016) for additional discussion.




   10
     Until 2001 China was considered a non-market economy. It was subject to relatively high tariff rates (known as "Non-Normal
Trade Relations" tariffs or "non-NTR rates") as prescribed in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. From 1980 onward, US
Presidents began temporarily granting NTR tariff rates to China, but required annual re-approval by congress. The re-approval
process introduced substantial uncertainty around future tariff rates and limited investment by both US and Chinese firms (see
Pierce and Schott (2016) for a wide range of anecdotal and news-based evidence). This ended in 2001, when China entered the
WTO and the US granted PNTR. The granting of PNTR removed uncertainty around tariffs, leading to an increase in competition.

where ijt denotes a given outcome variable (profits, etc.). All regressions include firm and year fixed
effects, and are weighted by firm sales. Standard errors are clustered at the NAICS-6 industry-level. Consis-
tent with the identification assumption, we see no significant pre-trends before 2000, and strong responses
afterwards. Consistent with the increase in exits, the operating income of US companies falls upon Chinese
accession to the WTO (Panel A).
         What is more remarkable, however, is the increase in the share of Sales General & Administrative expen-
ditures (SG&A) in total costs. SG&A is the second major component of costs and includes all intangible-
building activities (e.g., R&D, Advertising and IT staff expense). US firms react to the increased competition
by almost doubling their SG&A intensity (Panel B), a result consistent with the shift towards intangible cap-
ital documented in Table 4 below, as well as the increased product differentiation documented by Feenstra
and Weinstein (2017). The increase in SG&A is precisely the type of technological change that may affect
the validity of COGS-based mark-ups. Indeed, panel C shows that SALE/COGS appears to increase rather
than decrease upon the shock.11 COGS-based mark-up measures would fail to classify the China shock as
an increase in competition, while exit and profit margins do.12
         We can also get a broad evaluation of the usefulness of mark-ups by studying the evolution across
regions. Figure 6 plots the sales-weighted average ratio of SALES to COGS against gross profit rates
by region.13 The shift towards intangible expenditures is clearly present across all advanced economies:

       11
       SALE/COGS is related to the benchmark measure of DLEU up to a measurement error correction and a (time-varying)
industry-level scaling factor, which measures the elasticity of SALES to COGS. Both the measurement error correction and the
elasticity of output remain largely stable even in the long-run so that SALE/COGS dominates the evolution of mark-ups.
    12
       In unreported tests, we find similar conclusions (i) using the firm-level user-cost mark-ups first reported in the appendix of
Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a); and studying regulatory shocks (the entry of Free Mobile in France and the implementation of
large product market regulations, as compiled by Duval et al. (2018)).
    13
       See De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) for actual mark-up estimates globally. As expected, their results closely follow the
SALE/COGS series.

Notes: SALE/COGS equals the sales-weighted average ratio of SALE to COGS across all Compustat firms in a given region.
GOS/PROD based on OECD STAN for non-agriculture business sector excluding Real Estate.


SALE/COGS rises everywhere as the cost-share of COGS falls. This may suggest a global rise in market
power, but profits shows us the opposite ­ especially for the EU15 and the UK. Only in the US do we observe
a large increase in profits. In the remaining regions, the decline in COGS is fully offset by a rise in SG&A so
that profits remain flat (operating income before depreciation equals sales minus COGS and SG&A.). Given
the inability of mark-up estimates to control for technology, we focus on profits and market share dynamics
in the rest of the paper.14


3     Aggregate Evidence
3.1    Entry, Exit and Turnover
Having clarified some measurement issues, let us return to the main goal of the paper: differentiating theories
of good vs. bad concentration. We begin with market share turnover. IO economists rightly complain about

    14
       This is not to say that profits are a perfect measure. Accounting rules often deviate from economic concepts, and estimates
of economic profits are prone to errors given the difficulty in measuring the capital stock and the user cost of capital. We can gain
some comfort, however, by comparing a wide range of measures from alternate sources. In Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2018, for
example, we show that accounting profits from Compustat and national accounts, economic profits in the style of Barkai (2017) as
well as firm-level user-cost implied profits are consistent with each other in both the US and Europe.


                                                                   16
the use of HHIs or Concentration Ratios at the broad industry x country level as measures of market power.
The limitations of national CRs and HHIs are well understood. NAICS industries and countries are much
broader than product markets ­ and concentration may evolve differently at more granular levels.15 But there
is a more fundamental problem: depending on the nature of competition, technology as well as supply and
demand primitives, concentration may be positively or negatively correlated with competition and mark-ups.
In other words, concentration "is a market outcome, not a market primitive" (Syverson, 2019).

Leader Turnover. To obtain an alternate measure of market power, we consider turnover of market shares
and market leadership. In particular, one can ask: given that a firm is at the top of its industry now (top
4, top 10% of market value), how likely is it that it will drop out over the next 5 years. Per proposition 4,
increases in  would result in higher leader turnover, while increases in  would result in lower turnover.
    Figure 7 tests this prediction. We define turnover in industry j at time t as the probability of leaving the
top 4 firms of the industry over a five-year period,

                                                                #4               #4
                                   T opT urnjt = Pr zi,j,t+5 < zj,t+5 | zi,j,t  zj,t ,

                                                                                              #4
where zi,j,t denotes either the sales of firm i at time t or its market value of equity, and zj,t is the value of
zi,j,t for the fourth largest firm at time t in industry j .16 We then average turnover across all industries in a
given year. We focus on the post-1980 period, after the addition of NASDAQ into Compustat. As shown,
the likelihood of a leader being replaced was 35% in the 1980s ­ rose to 40% at the height of Dot-Com
bubble ­ and is only 25% today. Appendix A presents results by sector.

Persistence of market shares. Leader turnover focuses on the right tail of the distribution. Let us now
broaden the sample to include all firms, and study the persistence of market shares. We follow proposition
4 and estimate an AR(1) model of the log-market share for firm i that belongs to SIC-3 industry j , using a
5-year rolling window:
                                               log si,j,t = j,t log si,j,t-1 +       i,j,t

    Panels A and B of figure 8 plot the sales-weighted average j,t and root mean squared error (RMSE),
respectively. In line with the decline in turnover, the persistence of market shares increases after 2000, while
the RMSE falls.17




   15
       See Rossi-Hansberg et al. (2018), among others, for related evidence; but note that their conclusions are controversial (Gana-
pati, 2018).
    16
       We use a constant number of leaders because they account for a roughly stable share of sales. In unreported tests, we
consider the top 10% of firms and obtain similar results, though this broader group accounts for a rising share of sales.
    17
       Appendix figure 20 presents an additional test, based on the correlation of firm rankings over time. It yields consistent results.

    Leaders clearly have less to worry about today than 30 years ago. Their market shares and leadership
positions are far more persistent today than even 15 years ago. Why might this be? In Gutiérrez and
Philippon (2019), we study competitive pressures directly, focusing on the entry and exit margins. We show
that exit rates have remained stable, while the elasticity of entry with respect to Tobin's Q was positive and
significant until the late 1990s but fell close to zero afterwards. The behavior of entry, exit and turnover is
inconsistent with  , but consistent with .

3.2     Concentration, Productivity and Prices
According to  and  , concentration rises as high productivity leaders expand, increasing industry-level
productivity and decreasing prices. If more productive firms have lower labor shares, the aggregate labor
share also falls. Autor et al. (2017b) document a reallocation from high- to low-labor-share establishments,
while Ganapati (2018) finds that changes in concentration are uncorrelated with changes in prices, but
positively correlated with changes in productivity. Kehrig and Vincent (2017) and Hsieh and Rossi-Hansberg
(2019) make similar arguments for manufacturing and service industries, respectively.

BLS & Compustat. We begin our analysis with relatively aggregated data from the BLS Multifactor
Productivity tables. This dataset includes TFP, prices, wages and labor productivity. We complement it with
Compustat-based concentration measures to obtain the same industry classification in left- and right-hand
side variables. We assess the joint evolution of productivity, prices and mark-ups using regressions of the
form
                                         5 log (Zj,t ) =  5 log (CR4j,t ) + t + jt .

where Z is the variable of interest and 5 denotes a 5-year change. We consider TFP, prices and mark-
ups of prices over unit labor costs (ULC): 5 log µ = 5 log P - 5 log U LC , where 5 log(U LC ) 
5 log(W ) - 5 log(LPt ).
      Table 2 summarizes the results. Columns 1, 3 and 5 are based on pre-2000 changes, and exhibit cor-
relations in line with  and  : positive and significant with TFP, and negative (although insignificant) with
prices and mark-ups. However, the relationship seems to have collapsed after 2000. The correlation between
concentration and TFP turns negative (though insignificant), while the correlation with prices and mark-ups
turns positive.
      To illustrate the transition, Figure 9 plots the evolution of mark-ups and concentration for the Telecom
and Transportation - Air industries. While they exhibit little (or negative) correlation before 2000, both rise
sharply afterwards. This is consistent with the cross-country analyses of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018).

    The BLS multifactor productivity tables provide several advantages. They cover the full economy,
include TFP estimates and follow a consistent segmentation that can be mapped to other BEA datasets. This
allows us to include the evolution of prices, unit-labor costs and mark-ups in the PCA of section 4. However,
using broad industry definitions limits the power of our regressions ­ hence the large confidence intervals
above. Let us now bring in more granular data.

BEA, NBER and Census. We roughly follow Ganapati (2018) and combine concentration data from
the US Economic Census with price data from the NBER-CES database for manufacturing and the BEA's
detailed GDP by Industry accounts for non-manufacturing.18 Combined, these datasets allow us to estimate
real labor productivity and analyze the evolution of mark-ups using the definitions above.
    We estimate regressions of the following form:

                                    5 log (Zjt ) =  5 log (CR4j,t ) + s,t + jt .

where j denotes industries and t denotes years. s,t denotes sector-year fixed effects. Table 3 reports results
for prices and mark-ups. Before 2002, the correlation is small and often insignificant, in line with the
results of Ganapati (2018). After 2002, however, increases in concentration are systematically correlated
with increases in prices. Columns (7) to (9) show a similar effect but instead of sorting on time (pre/post
2002), we sort by ending levels of concentration. When ending concentration is low, there is not much
correlation between changes in concentration and changes in mark-ups. When concentration reaches a high
level, however, the correlation is much stronger, especially in the non-manufacturing sector. See appendix
3 for additional results, including a decomposition of the correlation between concentration and mark-ups
into the underlying components: prices, wages and labor productivity.




   18
      For manufacturing, the NBER-CES database includes nominal output, prices, wages and employment. For non-
manufacturing, the concentration accounts include nominal output, payroll and employment, while the BEA's `detailed' GDP by
industry accounts include prices. The `detailed' GDP by industry accounts include 400 industries, so that our non-manufacturing
dataset is more aggregated than that of Ganapati (2018). We use the more aggregated dataset given the concerns with skewness
described below and because, even at that level of aggregation, the BEA cautions of potential measurement error. That said, our
results are largely consistent.

      The joint evolution of concentration, TFP and prices appears consistent with the  and  theories before
2000. Over the past 15 years, however, concentration is correlated with lower TFP and higher prices. The
evidence is now more closely aligned with the  theory.
      Our data and correlations are consistent with the ones in Ganapati (2018) but our interpretation is quite
different. Regarding prices we agree that the full sample correlation is small, but as we have shown the cor-
relations after 2000 and at high level of concentration are large and positive. The most important disagree-
ment, however, relates to the correlation with productivity. The existing literature has failed to recognize
that, given what we know about firm-level data, we should expect a quasi-mechanical correlation between
concentration and productivity at the level of detailed industries (NAICS level 4 or 5, for instance). We
know that the firm-size distribution is skewed. At NAICS level 5 the top 4 firms account for about 1/3 of
output. We also know that firm-level shocks are large. Therefore changes in industry output at level 5 are
strongly affected by idiosyncratic firm-level shocks. If a large firm experiences a positive shock, industry
output increases and concentration increases at the same time. Therefore, in the regressions run by Ganap-
ati (2018) or Autor et al. (2017b), one would expect a mechanical positive correlation between changes in
CR4 and changes in output or productivity or both (depending on the details of the shocks). At level 4 the
kurtosis of log changes in CR4 is 8.8. Once we move to level 2 or level 3, the law of large number kicks in
and these effects are muted. At level 2, for instance, log changes in CR4 have a skewness of 0 and a kurtosis
of 2.5. In other words, the changes are basically normal. This has nothing to do with synergies or with the
value of concentration per-se. It's just fat-tail econometrics. Ganapati (2018) claims that, since changes in
concentration and changes in industry productivity are positively correlated on average, we need not worry
about the (smaller) impact of concentration on prices.19 The reasoning above suggests that this claim is
incorrect.


3.3       Investment and Profits
Under  and  , the increase in concentration is driven by technological change linked to the rise of intan-
gibles. In that case, aggregate investment would remain in line with Q, while intangible investment would
increase. However, as shown in Figure 10, the growth of the capital stock has fallen across all asset types
since 2000 ­ notably including intellectual property assets. Moreover, the decline in investment is not ex-
plained by Tobin's Q, as shown by appendix figure 24. In fact, investment is near it's historical trough while
Q is near it's historical peak.




   19
        Ganapati (2018) estimates the following relationship

                           5 log (Pjt ) = 0.00992 × 5 log (CR4) - 0.0520 × 5 log (LP ) + s,t + jt ,

which implies that "a one standard deviation increase in monopoly power offsets 1/5 of the price decrease from a one standard
deviation increase in productivity." He argues that "the most pessimistic reading is that after controlling for productivity, monopolies
do increase prices. But this argument assumes that all other conditions including productivity remain constant. In the light of the

    Is the fall in investment pervasive across firms? In table 4, we define leaders by constant shares of
market value to ensure comparability over time.20 Capital K includes intangible capital as estimated by
Peters and Taylor (2016). As shown, the leaders' share of investment and capital has decreased, while their
profit margins have increased. By contrast, laggards exhibit much more stable investment and profit rates.
As shown in appendix figure 25, the increase in leader profits is not fully explained by a reallocation effect
with higher profit firms becoming leaders: profits increased within-firms for leaders and decreased slightly
for laggards.
    Is the decline in investment by leaders linked to concentration? According to  and  , leaders should
increase investment in concentrating industries, reflecting an escape-competition strategy ( ) or their in-
creasing relative productivity ( ). We test this at the firm-level, by estimating the following regression for
firm i that belongs to BEA industry j :

     OIBDP shares are stable which is consistent with stable shares of market value and stable relative discount factors. Because
firms are discrete, the actual share of market value in each grouping varies from year to year. To improve comparability, we scale
measured shares as if they each contained 33% of market value.

Case study: the china shock again.                                              Another way of investigating the role of  for investment is to
examine the behavior of leaders and laggards following the China shock. Figure 11 plots the average stock
of K across Compustat firms in a given year, split by the 1999 NTR gap (see section 2 for details). K
includes PP&E as well as intangibles, as estimated by Peters and Taylor (2016). In low exposure industries,
leaders and laggards exhibit similar growth rates of capital. By contrast, leaders increase capital much faster
than laggards in high exposure industries.



    This figure suggest that leaders react to increased competition from China by increasing investment. We
confirm this by estimating a generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) regression:



                          log(Ki,j,t ) = 1 P ost01 × N T R Gapj × IPt                                                                      (4)

IPt for the post-2001 period. The second term adds an indicator for leader firms to capture differences in
investment between leaders and laggards. The third term includes several industry-level characteristics as
controls, such as capital and skill intensity.22 We include year and firm fixed effects t and µi .
      Table 6 reports the results. It shows that leaders increase investment in response to an exogenous increase
in competition. We consider three different measures of capital: PP&E, Intangibles (from Peters and Taylor
(2016)) and total capital (equal to the sum of PP&E and Intangibles).23 Columns 1 to 3 include all US
incorporated manufacturing firms in Compustat over the 1991 to 2015 period. Columns 4 to 6 focus on
continuing firms (i.e., firms that were in the sample before 1995 and after 2009); and show that leaders
invested more than laggards, even when compared to firms that survived the China shock.
      Our results are consistent with Frésard and Valta (2015) and Hombert and Matray (2015). Frésard and
Valta (2015) find a negative average impact of foreign competition in industries with low entry costs and
strategic substitutes. They briefly study within-industry variation, and find that investment declines primarily
at financially constrained firms. Hombert and Matray (2015) studies within-industry variation with a focus
on firm-level R&D intensity. They show that R&D-intensive firms exhibit higher sales growth, profitability,
and capital expenditures than low-R&D firms when faced with Chinese competition, consistent with our
finding of increased intangible investment. They find evidence of product differentiation using the index
of Hoberg and Phillips (2017). In the Appendix of Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017a, we study the dynamics
of employment and find that leaders increase both capital and employment, while laggards decrease both.
Employment decreases faster than capital so that K/Emp increases in both groups of firms. Since initial
publication of these results in Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017a, Pierce and Schott (2018) obtained similar
results using Census data to cover the entire sample of US firms.
      In summary, leader profit margins increased while investment relative to Q decreased, in line with .
The falling growth rate of the capital stock ­ including intangibles ­ and the decline in leader investment,
particularly in concentrated industries, is inconsistent with  and  .


3.4     Returns to Scale
So far, we have evaluated the different theories indirectly by looking at their predictions about observable
measures. In the case of  , however, we can test the theory directly.
      In Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019), we use industry- and firm-level data to estimate returns to scale.
Industry-level estimates are based on BLS KLEMS data, following the methodology of Basu et al. (2006)
while incorporating the instruments of Hall (2018). These estimates have the advantage of relying on well-
measured inputs, outputs and prices, while following an established literature and set of instruments. How-
ever, the limited data availability implies that we can only estimate long-run average changes ­ such as an
increase from before to after 2000. We perform this estimation and find a small increase in returns to scale
­ from 0.78 before 2000 to 0.8 afterwards.

     22
        These industry characteristics are sourced from the NBER-CES database. We include the (i) percent of production workers,
(ii) log-ratio of capital to employment; (iii) log-ratio of capital to value added; (iv) log-average wage; and (v) log-average production
wage.
     23
        In unreported robustness tests, we confirm that our results are robust to including only balance sheet intangibles or excluding
goodwill in the PT measure.

    We complement industry-level estimates with firm-level estimates based on Compustat, roughly follow-
ing Syverson (2004) and De-Loecker et al. (2019). In particular, we estimate


                               log qit =  [V  log v + K  log k + X  log x] + ,

    where  measures the average return to scale across all firms. v,k and x denote COGS, capital costs and
                                                               PV V
overhead costs (SG&A), respectively. V =                 P V V +rK +P X X
                                                                          ,   denotes the cost share of the COGS (likewise
for K and X       ).24   We again find stable estimates since 1970.
    The relative stability of returns to scale is consistent with a variety of estimates in the literature, including
Ho and Ruzic (2017) for manufacturing in the US; and Salas-Fumás et al. (2018); Diez et al. (2018) across
EU industries. Thus,  cannot explain the aggregate trends ­ though it likely matters for some industries.


4     Industry Evidence
Aggregate trends are interesting, but they obscure the dynamics of individual industries: one size does not
fit all. In this section, we perform a Principal Components Analysis on a wide range of variables related
to competition (and covering all types of measures in Table 1) to obtain a systematic classification of the
drivers of industry-level changes. We follow the industry segments in the BLS KLEMS, and perform the
PCA on the correlation matrix so all measures contribute equally. Because we include census-concentration
ratios, Agriculture and Mining are excluded from the analysis.
    Figure 12 shows the variables included in the analysis and the resulting loadings of the first two principal
components. Together, these components explain 34% of the variance. They have an intuitive interpretation.
PC1 seems to capture the  and  theories of good concentration. It exhibits a positive loading on the level
and changes in concentration (cr4_cen), and a high loading on intangible capital intensity (intan_kshare).
The corresponding industries face significant import competition (import_share), and exhibit stable or de-
clining profits (profit_margin). TFP increases (dtfp_kl), and unit-labor costs fall (Dlogulc). Prices also
fall (Dlogp), but less than unit-labor costs so that mark-ups rise (Dlogmu). Leader turnover falls while the
investment gap is close to zero.
    PC2, by contrast, seems closely related to the  theories of bad concentration. It captures a sharp increase
in concentration despite limited growth in intangibles and negative import competition. Profits rise and the
labor share falls. Mark-ups also rise, but for inefficient reasons: prices rise while productivity and unit labor
costs remain largely flat.




     24
        De-Loecker et al. (2019) perform the same estimation in levels and find an increase in returns to scale from 0.97 to 1.08.
However, levels regressions are likely affected by the inability to control for differences in firm-level prices or accurately measure
intangible capital. For example, an increase in the mark-ups of large relative to small firms would appear as an increase in quantities,
and result in an over-estimation of the increase in returns to scale. The estimation based on changes better controls for this, hence
is likely more robust.

    Figure 13 contrasts the 2012 loadings on PC1 and PC2 for each industry. We highlight the 6 industries
with the highest score according to PC1 and PC2. Durable computer manufacturing, Computer services and
Nondurable apparel exhibit high loadings on PC1 and low loadings on PC2. They appear to remain strongly
competitive despite increases in intangibles and concentration ­ likely as a result of foreign competition
as shown in Figure 14. In fact, Figure 14 confirms the importance of foreign competition for domestic
concentration, and serves as a comforting validation of our PCA.
    Nondurable chemical manufacturing, Information - data and Information - publish present a mix of
intangible-driven concentration and barriers to entry. These industries include Pfizer and Dow DuPont;
Google and Facebook; and Microsoft, respectively. They are good examples of industries with large amounts
of intangible assets ­ including patents ­ where leaders have become more efficient but also more entrenched
over time.
    Information/Telecom, Banking, and Transportation/Airlines score near the top according to PC2. As
discussed in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018), these industries exhibit higher concentration, prices and prof-
itability in the US than in Europe ­ despite using similar technologies. Accommodation/Food (i.e., Restau-
rants) scores near the bottom according to both measures. This is an industry with limited use of intangible
assets that remains largely competitive. The fact that Education is the only real outlier is also comforting.

    The PCA shows that both the  theory and a combination of  and  are important for explaining the
evolution of US industries over the past 20 years. But are they equally important at each point in time?
Figure 15 plots the average PC1 and PC2 scores over time. The conclusions are striking. The average PC1
score ­ reflecting "good" concentration ­ was substantially higher and increased faster from 1997 to 2002.
But PC2 (i.e., barriers to entry) caught up afterwards. By 2012, most industries weighted heavily on PC2
while the average PC1 score remained close to zero (with wide dispersion, of course, as shown in figure 13).


5    Conclusion
Internal Consistency of macro-market power literature We have used a wide range of measures of
competition throughout this paper ­ sometimes independently and sometimes jointly, albeit non-parametrically.
But all of these measures are connected by economic theory. Let us conclude by bringing together estimates
from the macro-market power literature to validate the internal consistency of our conclusions. A decom-
position first made by Susanto Basu in his discussion of DLEU is useful. We describe the decomposition
briefly, and refer the reader to Syverson (2019) for a discussion of the underlying assumptions.
    Consider a standard profit maximizing economy, and rewrite the mark-up by multiplying and dividing
by average costs:
                                               P    P AC    AC Revenue
                                        µ=       =        =
                                              MC   AC M C   M C Cost
The ratio of average to marginal costs, AC/M C , equals the returns to scale for a cost-minimizing firm
                                            Revenue                         1
taking factor prices as given while          Cost     can be written as   1-s   using the profit share in revenues s .

                                                               33
Therefore

                                                                
                                                        µ=          .                                                        (5)
                                                              1 - s
Using equation (5) for two time periods, we obtain

                                             µ2016         1 - s,1980       2016
                                                   =                             ,
                                             µ1980         1 - s,2016       1980

which can be used to assess the internal consistency of the macro-market power literature.
    Let us begin by reiterating the discrepancy raised by Syverson (2019) and Basu (2019). DLEU report
an increase in mark-ups from 1.21 to 1.61 between 1980 and 2016; and an increase in returns to scale from
1.03 to 1.08. Barkai (2017) estimates rising profit shares from 3% to 16% of value added over the same
period, which (roughly) equate to 1.5% and 8% of sales. Plugging in these values, we obtain

                                               1.61        1 - 0.015       1.08
                                                    =                           ,
                                               1.21         1 - 0.08       1.03
                                               1.33 = 1.12.

The relationship appears widely inconsistent but there is an issue with this comparison. The mark-up esti-
mates of DLEU are based on public firms, which likely have higher intangible (and SG&A) intensity than
private firms ­ certainly more than small and medium enterprises. For the reasons discussed in section 2,
this leads to an over-estimation of the rise in mark-ups for the full economy. As a rough approximation, let
us assume that mark-ups of private firms remained stable ­ in line with the median Compustat firm as re-
ported in Figure 8a of DLEU. This is valid if the distribution of high intangible firms, and therefore mark-up
increases, is concentrated at the top. We can then obtain a rough estimate of the change in economy-wide
mark-ups as the product of the Compustat mark-up increase (33%) times the Compustat share of sales in the
total economy (40% as reported by Grullon et al. (2019)). The resulting mark-up increase is then 13.2% ­
which seems consistent with the estimates above. Using our return to scale estimates, the last term would
be 0.8/0.78 ­ again broadly in agreement.25

Explaining the rise in           Estimates from the macro-market power literature appear reasonably consistent
with each other. They include a sharp increase in profits unique to the US, concentrated in the post-2000
   25
     We can perform a similar exercise since 2000, using the results of Diez et al. (2018) which are based on ORBIS and therefore
include private firms. According to their estimates, US mark-ups increased by 12% since 2000 while returns to scale increased
from 0.91 to 0.93. Over the same period, Barkai (2017) reports profit shares of value added rising from 4.5% to 16%. We then have

                                                            1 - 0.023    0.93
                                                  1.12 =                      ,
                                                             1 - 0.08    0.91
                                                  1.12 = 1.09.

   We may also want to consider total economy profit shares, instead of NFC profit shares. Gutiérrez (2017) uses BEA data for the
non-financial private economy. He finds an increase in the profit share from 11% to 21% from 1988-2015, which closely aligns with
Barkai (2017) over the same period. Last, performing the same exercise for Europe with mark-up and returns to scale estimates
from Diez et al. (2018) and profit share estimates from the appendix of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) (accounting only for the
cost of debt to mirror Barkai (2017)), we obtain


                                                              34
period and explained mostly by rising barriers to entry. The next question, of course, is what might explain
the rise in  in the US? Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) argues that this is partly explained by weakening
competition policy (i.e., antitrust and regulation) compared to Europe. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019)
shows that the decline in the elasticity of entry to Q is partly explained by lobbying and increasing federal
and state-level regulations.26 Last, Jones et al. (2019) combines a rich structural DSGE model with cross-
sectional identification from firm and industry data. They use the model to structurally estimate entry cost
shocks, and show that model-implied entry shocks correlate with independently constructed measures of
entry regulation and M&A activities.




                                                             1 - 0.036     0.93
                                                   1.06 =                       ,
                                                             1 - 0.038     0.91
                                                   1.06 = 1.03.

  Again broadly in agreement.
   26
      In unreported tests, we confirm there is a positive relationship between PC2 and industry-level lobbying intensity.

Appendix
A         Appendix for Section 2: Measurement
This section provides additional results related to the mark-up estimates of De-Loecker et al. (2019) (DLEU
hereafter). We begin with a brief discussion of the accounting definition of COGS, and its implications for
mark-up estimation; followed by a discussion of technological change and it's relation to Sales, General and
Administrative (SG&A) expenditures.


A.1        Accounting Definitions
Under the methodology of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), mark-up estimates are unbiased as long as
the variable input used in the estimation is indeed variable, and is consistently defined over time. Finding
such a measure is not trivial, particularly in accounting statements. DLEU use COGS as their variable input
which, according to GAAP, is defined as "the cost of inventory items sold during a given period." This is
clearly defined for businesses that make, buy or sell goods to produce income, such as manufacturing, retail
and wholesale trade. It is much less clear for service and information businesses. Pure service companies
such as accounting firms, law offices, business consultants and many information technology firms have
no goods to sell and therefore no inventory. As a result, they do not even report COGS on their income
statement.27 Some of them report only more granular line items, while others report "Cost of Revenues"
instead. Importantly, cost of revenues includes the cost of delivering a product or service in addition to
producing it, hence is broader than COGS. Such ambiguity in accounting definitions, coupled with changes
in the nature of production, gives firms discretion on what is included in COGS vs. SG&A. Ultimately, this
leads to the inclusion of some (quasi-)fixed expenditures in COGS, as well as changes in the definition of
COGS over time ­ both of which may violate the assumptions underlying DLEU. Two examples:
     Consider Delta Airlines, which does not report COGS in it's annual statements. Instead, Compustat
creates a measure of COGS by combining a series of granular line items. Such items include clearly variable
expenses such as aircraft fuel and landing fees ­ but also quasi-fixed expenses such as aircraft rent expense
(typically associated with long term leases) and head-office salaries and profit sharing expenses (typically
included in SG&A).
     Google (Alphabet Inc), on the other hand, reports Cost of Revenues. The largest component of Cost of
Revenues are traffic acquisition costs (TAC), which are identifiable, direct costs attributable to production.
They roughly match the definition of COGS. However, Cost of Revenues also includes "expenses associated
with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including stock-
based-compensation), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs)." Clearly, data center and operation
expenditures include long term investment in tangible and intangible assets indirectly related to the delivery
of services (e.g., software, organizational capabilities, equipment). Again, this may violate the variable cost
assumption underlying DLEU. Moreover, Google can exercise discretion on what is classified as SG&A

instead of Cost of Revenues. In fact, Google reported stock-based-compensation separate from Cost of
Revenues up to 2005 but combined it after 2006.


A.2    Role of SG&A and Intangibles
The above issues related to the measurement of variable costs ­ as well as the treatment of SG&A ­ pose
significant challenges for the estimation. However, even assuming that COGS is a perfect proxy of variable
costs and that SG&A is properly accounted for in the production function estimation, there is a more funda-
mental issue with the interpretation of mark-ups as a proxy of market power: technological change and the
rise of fixed costs.
    The share of SG&A in total costs has increased over the past 30 years, precisely when the share of
COGS has fallen. Table 7 summarizes this fact, by showing the weighted average share of key income
statement line items as a percent of sales. The COGS-share of sales declined by nearly 7 percentage points,
while the SG&A and depreciation shares increased by 3.5 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively. Thus,
most of the decrease in COGS was offset by a rise in SG&A and DP. But operating profits after depreciation
also increased, by 2.2 percentage points of sales. The increase in SG&A and depreciation are consistent
with a shift towards intangible capital: SG&A includes most intangible-building activities such as R&D,
Advertising and Software-development expenses; and intangibles have higher depreciation rates (Corrado
and Hulten, 2010). Most SG&A expenses are fixed in the short-run, which requires a careful treatment while
estimating production functions. This is the subject of an ongoing debate (Traina, 2018; Karabarbounis and
Neiman, 2018).
    To understand the significance of rising SG&A for mark-up estimation, figure 16 shows the sales-
weighted average of SALE/COGS and SG&A cost-shares (SG&A/COSTS) for firms in the the top quantile
of the SALE/COGS distribution each year. As shown, SALE/COGS increased precisely at the firms where
the SG&A cost-share increased ­ which points towards a major technological change, likely involving a rise
in fixed costs. This has significant implications for the interpretation of mark-ups as a measure of market
power. Two examples.

Notes: scatter plot of the weighted average SALE/COGS and SG&A cost-share across all Compustat firms in the top quantile of
the SALE/COGS distribution, by year.


IBM.       Consider IBM, a firm that transitioned from providing mostly products to mostly services, begin-
ning in 1994. As shown in Panel A of Figure 17, the cost-share of COGS increased from 40 to 60% while
the cost-share of SG&A decreased by a similar amount, precisely as IBM transitioned from a high-overhead,
low-COGS business model (Hardware) to a high-COGS, low overhead business model (Consulting, where
staff expenditures are included in COGS).28 The implied mark-up fell sharply from 4 to 2 (Panel B). Does
this mean that the extent of competition faced by IBM increased sharply from 1965 to 2015? Probably not.
In the long-run, IBM's ratio of SALE to COGS is dominated by it's SG&A intensity, which is in turn dic-
tated by its product mix. It tells us much about IBM's production function and it's share of fixed vs. variable
costs, but less about the extent of (dynamic) competition faced by IBM in product markets. In fact, while
IBM's SALE/COGS ratio fell by 48% from 1965 to 2015, margins (SALE/COSTS) fell by only 10%.

Walmart.       IBM is interesting because the firm transitioned across widely different business models (curi-
ously in the opposite direction of the economy, from a high SG&A to a high COGS model). A very different
example is Walmart: a firm that maintained it's business model but invested heavily in intangible assets
to improve logistics and gain market share (Panel A of Figure 18). This is consistent with IT investments
driving concentration, as described in Bessen (2017). SALE/COGS increased rapidly with SG&A, yet profit
margins (and the relative price of retail trade) actually fell.
    These are specific examples, but as shown in Figure 6 above, the divergence between SALE/COGS and
   28
      The composition of COGS also changed, likely affecting the elasticity of sales to COGS. In 1992, costs associated with
hardware and software sales accounted for 36.9% of sales. By 2016, the same figure dropped to only 8.2% of sales. Costs associated
with services increased from 9.4% to 42.6%. IBM was eventually re-categorized from NAICS 3341 (Computer and peripheral
equipment manufacturing) to 5415 (Computer Systems Design and Related Services) in 1998 and to 5191 (Other information
services) in 2016. It is not clear to us how the change in industry categorization is dealt with by DLEU, but neither using a constant
elasticity nor changing IBM from one industry to another in a particular year is entirely satisfactory ­ though this is a standard
problem whenever industry segments are used.

profits remains at the country-level. As a result, rising COGS-based mark-ups ­ by themselves ­ tell us
little about the long-run evolution of competition and market power. DLEU acknowledge as much, noting
that"technological change will lead to higher mark-ups (due to lower marginal costs), but prices will not
drop because firms need to generate revenue to cover fixed costs. As a result, profits will continue to be low
and higher mark-ups do not imply higher market power." Profits ­ therefore ­ remain the only reliable
measure of marker power; and the one we focus on here and in related work.

where rank (zi,j,t ) is the rank of firm i in industry j at time t according to the measure z . We again find a
sharp increase in persistence after 2000. Figure 21 presents the same results but separating manufacturing
and non-manufacturing sectors.

B.2    Concentration, Productivity and Prices
We are interested in decomposing the correlation between concentration and mark-ups into the underlying
components: prices, wages and labor productivity. In Figure 22 we plot the aggregate evolution of prices and
unit labor costs since 1989. As shown, prices increased faster than unit labor costs, leading to an increase in
mark-ups.

    Figure 23 provides a bin-scatter plot of changes in mark-ups against changes in CR4. As shown, the
relationship is quite robust.

Notes: Concentration from US Economic Census. Mark-ups from the NBER-CES database for manufacturing and the Economic Census (output,
employment and wages) and the BEA detailed GDP By Industry Accounts (prices). See Section 3.2 for details.




    Last, Table 8 reports regressions of the following form using our detailed industry dataset of prices and
productivity:
                                                                5 log (Yjt ) =  5 log (CR4) + s,t + jt .

    where j denotes industries and t denotes years. s,t denotes sector x year fixed effects. To facilitate
comparison to Ganapati 2018, we standardize 5 log (CR4) to have mean zero and variance one. Outcome
variables Yjt are based on the following interlinked outcomes:

                                                              5 log µ = 5 log P - 5 log U LC,                                   (6)
                                                                       = 5 log P - [5 log w - 5 log LP ] .

Panel A includes all industries, while Panels B and C separate manufacturing and non-manufacturing indus-
tries. In line with Autor et al. 2017b and Ganapati 2018, concentration is positively correlated with labor
productivity growth. This is what one would expect in a world dominated by fat-tail firm level demand (or
quality) shocks. An industry grows because some of its firm draw a large positive shock. This mechanically
leads to higher concentration. A doubling of the CR4 is correlated with a 13% increase in labor productiv-
ity. Wages rise by only 3% implying that productivity gains are not passed on to workers. Unit labor costs,
therefore, fall by 10%. In a competitive economy, this would lead to lower prices and increased welfare for
consumers. However, prices remain flat ­ implying a 11% increase in mark-ups29 .



   29
    Our results are fairly consistent withGanapati (2018). Using Table 4 of Ganapati (2018), we obtain a regression beta between
mark-up increases and concentration of 0.05 for non-manufacturing, compared to 0.08 in our data:


                                                                                      48

D.1    Demand System
There is a continuum of industries indexed by j  [0, 1] and a continuum of firms i  [0, Nj,t ] in each
industry. A particular firm is therefore indexed by (i, j ), i.e., i'th firm in industry j .
    Firms' outputs are aggregated at the industry level as
                                          j -1                                              j -1

D.2    Production
The production function of firm i, j is Cobb-Douglass

                                                                  j                    1-

and there is a fixed cost of production j . Firms take the wage W and the rental rate R as given when they
hire capital and labor. The Cobb-Douglass function, like any CRS function, leads to a constant marginal
cost
                                                                            j                        1-j

Cost minimization implies that all firms choose the same (optimal) capital labor ratio

                                                 1 - j ki,j,t   Wt

The average cost is i,j,t yi,j,t + j
    Profits are
                                        i,j,t = pi,j,t yi,j,t - i,j,t yi,j,t - j

If we define the mark-up of price over marginal cost

                                               pi,j,t  (1 + µi,j ) i,j,t

where Aj,t is industry-average productivity and µj is industry-average mark-up.

E       Data Appendix
We use a wide range of aggregate-, industry- and firm-level data, summarized in Table 9 and described
in the rest of this section. We begin by describing the three datasets used repeatedly throughout the paper:
Compustat North America, Compustat Global and US Economic Census Concentration Ratios (section E.1).
We then discuss how these, and the remaining datasets are used to generate specific results.


E.1     Main dataset
E.1.1    Compustat North America

Sample Selection. Our primary firm-level data is based on tables Funda, Company and Exrt_mth from
Compustat North America, obtained via WRDS. Compustat North America includes all public and some
private firms in North America. Data are available from 1950, but coverage is fairly thin until the 1970s.
We apply standard screens (consol = "C", indfmt = "INDL", datafmt = "STD", popsrc = "D"), and ex-

clude firm-year observations with missing year, sales, assets, or gvkey .30 We use the exchange rates in
exrt_mth to convert all financials to USD. We keep all firms for our global analyses, but restrict the sample
to US-headquartered firms with USD currency codes for US-specific analyses (LOC = "USA", CURCD
= "USD"). We complement Compustat with the firm-level intangible capital estimates of Peters and Tay-
lor (2016) (WRDS table total_q); and use CRSP table msf as well as the CRSP-Compustat linking table
(ccmxpf_linktable) to fill in missing stock prices in Compustat, when needed (see replication file for de-
tails).

Industry Segments.          We use the industry codes in the Compustat Company table. NAICS codes are pop-
ulated for all firms that existed after 1985, but are sometimes missing for firms that exited beforehand. We
map those firms to the most common NAICS-4 industry among those firms with the same SIC code and
non-missing NAICS. We also map all retired/new NAICS codes from the 1997, 2002 and 2012 versions to
NAICS 2007 using the concordances in link.
    We then map NAICS codes to BEA and EU KLEMS industries. For BEA industries, we use the mapping
in tab `NAICS codes' of file GDPbyInd_GO_1947-2017.xls. This includes 63 granular industries. We
group `Motor vehicles, bodies and trailers, and parts' and `Other transportation equipment', and keep only
`Hospitals and Nursing' (which groups `Hospitals' and `Nursing and Residential Care facilities') because
only the grouped industries are covered in the BLS' multifactor tables. We exclude Real Estate given the
2000's boom, as well as `Management of companies and enterprises' because there are no companies in
Compustat that map to this category. This leaves 59 industry groupings, summarized in Table 10. Firms
with NAICS codes 999 cannot mapped to BEA industries. These firms are mapped to an `other' industry,
which is included in those analyses that do not rely on aggregate data.
    EU KLEMS (and STAN) industries follow the ISIC Rev. 4 hierarchy. We map firms from NAICS 2007
   30
      We also address selected data issues manually (e.g., outliers in sales growth, especially when reported currency changes). See
replication code for details.


                                                                55
to ISIC Rev. 4 using the concordance available at link as follows: first, we map each NAICS-6 segment
to the most common ISIC Level 2 segment (by number of mappings) based on the the concordance. This
mapping is one-to-one for most NAICS-6 segments; and for the remaining segments there is usually a single
most common ISIC Level 2 segment. For the few cases where NAICS-6 segments map with equal likelihood
to more than one ISIC Level 2 segment, we follow the same methodology but with NAICS-5 codes (and so
on).31 We then map each ISIC Rev. 4 Level 2 segments to the 27 EU KLEMS industries.

Concentration Ratios.         We use the resulting dataset to compute Compustat-based concentration ratios.
Compustat coverage as a share of the economy varies over time (as more firms go public) and across indus-
tries (depending on the nature of production); and the importance of foreign competition varies over time.
To ensure CRs are stable over time and across industries, and account for imports we compute:

impact of FX volatility given that Compustat sales include both domestic and foreign sales. cjt can exceed
1 for exporting industries and may be affected by FX volatility even if `real output' coverage remains flat,
so we cap cM A
           jt at 1.25 (which assumes slightly higher domestic CR relative to global CRs). Last, to ensure
the estimated CRs are robustly estimated, we include only industries where average database coverage after
2000 exceeds 10%. See replication code for details.

Other Definitions.

    · Market Value of Equity (ME): ME is defined as the total number of common shares outstanding
        (item CSHO) times the closing stock price at the end of the fiscal year (item PRCC_F). When either
        CSHO or PRCC_F are missing in Compustat, we fill-in the value using CRSP. If ME is also missing
        in CRSP, we use PRCC_C x CSHO.

    · Market Value (MV): MV is defined as the market value of equity (ME) plus total liabilities (LT) and
        preferred stock (PSTK)

    · Q: firm-level Q is defined as the ratio of market value to total assets (AT). We cap Q at 10 and
        winsorize it at the 2% level, by year to mitigate the impact of outliers. See Gutiérrez and Philippon
        (2017b) for a discussion of alternate definitions of Tobin's Q.

     In some cases, Compustat NAICS codes contain fewer than six digits. In that case, we repeat the process using NAICS-5 to
NAICS-2 codes. Firms that cannot be mapped to an ISIC segment (those with NAICS code 999 are excluded from industry-level
analyses).

    · Total Capital (K P T ): K P T is set equal to PPEGT plus K_INT, where the former is included in
        Compustat and the latter is provided by Peters and Taylor (2016).

    · Firm Age: Firm age is defined as the number of years over which a firm appears in Compustat,
        irrespective of whether the underlying data fields satisfy our exclusion restrictions (i.e., we measure
        age before imposing any exclusion restrictions).

    · Ratios: We also compute a variety of ratios as described in the text (e.g., SALE/COGS, XSGA/XOPR).
        All of these ratios are winsorized at the 2% and 98% level, by year to mitigate the impact of outliers.

E.1.2    Compustat Global

Global concentration measures are based on Compustat Global, which includes most public firms across
advanced economies. Data are available from 1987, but coverage is fairly thin until the late-1990s. We
download tables g_funda, g_company and g_exrt_mth via WRDS. We apply the same screens as for the
US (consol = "C", indfmt = "INDL", datafmt = "STD", popsrc = "I") and exclude firm-year observations
with missing year, sales, assets, or gvkey .32 We use the exchange rates in exrt_mth to convert all financials
to USD. For a few firms, currency codes and financials appear inconsistent ­ particularly when currency
codes change. We therefore drop firms (gvkeys) entirely whenever sales or assets increase or decrease by
a factor of 20 in the same year as the currency code changes. Firms are mapped to countries/regions using
headquarter location (LOC). We then use the same definitions and mapping procedure as for the US.

E.1.3    Economic Census Concentration Ratios

Last, we obtain sales, employment and payroll data by industry from the US Economic Census' Concentra-
tion accounts. The data include breakdowns for the top 4, 8, 20 and 50 firms in each industry along with
industry totals, and are published every five years. All firms operating within a given SIC/NAICS category
in the United States are included. See link for additional details.
    Data before 1992 is based on the SIC system. For manufacturing, we use the retrospective tabulation
based on unified SIC codes published in the 1992 Economic Census. For non-manufacturing, we use the
data as reported, which follows the 1987 SIC system in both 1987 and 1992, though there are small adjust-
ments across years. Data after 1997 is based on NAICS, with each of the 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012 reports
using slightly different NAICS vintages. Like Ganapati (2018), we restrict our sample to consistently de-
fined SIC/NAICS codes over each five-year period. Data for service industries are reported by tax-paying
segments. We keep tax-payable firms because they are reported consistently over time and are closest to our
analysis. Data for wholesale trade are reported as a total and by type of merchant (e.g., merchant wholesaler,
manufacturer). We keep only the total.
    Table 3 shows the coverage of the data. We restrict our sample to the post-1987 period, when concentra-
tion increased. There is continuous coverage for the manufacturing sector over the entire time period at the
4-digit SIC and 6-digit NAICS levels. Coverage for non-manufacturing sectors is spottier. Wholesale trade,
   32
      We also address selected data issues manually (e.g., outliers in sales growth, especially when reported currency changes). See
replication code for details.


                                                                59
retail trade and services are covered since 1987, as well as some transportation and communication sectors.
All major industries except agriculture, mining and construction are covered after 1997.
    We use these data in four ways: first, we use the reported concentration ratios directly in some of our
figures and/or regressions. Second, we compute census-based import-adjusted concentration as

                                                 salejt
                        CR8IA
                           jt = CR8jt ×                     = CR8jt × US Sharejt
                                             salejt + impjt

    where CR8jt and salejt are based on the US Economic Census; and importsjt is based on Peter
Schott's data (set to zero when missing). Third, we aggregate census concentration ratios to BEA industries
since 1997, for use in the PCA analysis. Census concentration measures follow the NAICS hierarchy,
which almost always maps one-to-one to BEA industries. When this is not the case, we first aggregate
(domestic) concentration ratios to BEA industries by taking a sales-weighted average; and then apply the
import adjustment. For some regressions, we interpolate Census concentration measures between economic
census years. Last, we combine the concentration data with price indices from the NBER-CES database
for manufacturing and the BEA's detailed GDP by Industry accounts for our analyses of productivity and
prices. See below for details.


E.2     Details on the Construction of Results
E.2.1    Introduction

Figures 2, Panel A: Profits.     Profits rates are based on OECD table STANI4_2016, which follows ISIC
Rev. 4 segments. Data are available for 37 countries. We focus on the nonagriculture business sector
excluding real estate (D05T82X), and include only advanced economies for which gross profits data are
available since 2000: the EU28 ex. BGR, CYP, HRV, MLT, ROU plus JPN, KOR, NOR, and the USA.
AUS, CHE and CAN are excluded because data are available after 2005. We convert all nominal quantities
to US dollars using the OECD's exchange rates, available at link. We define the gross profit rate as the ratio
of GOPS to PROD. We aggregate across countries by taking the production-weighted average.

Figure 2, Panel B. Concentration.      We then measure concentration using the same calculation as for the
US, with three exceptions: first, we do not adjust for imports. Second, we use the 27 industries defined
in EU KLEMS, instead of BEA industries. Third, we use gross output data from OECD STAN to adjust
for Compustat coverage, instead of BEA gross output data. To ensure consistency between STAN out-
put and Compustat sales, we drop firms in country x industry x years where STAN data are not available.
This means our EU-wide series includes 23 countries (EU28 ex Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Roma-
nia). Concentration is measured at the region x industry-level. We then compute changes since 2000, and
aggregate across industries within a region, weighing by production in constant 2009 prices (STAN item
PRDK). We use constant prices because variations in oil prices can introduce undue volatility to the weights
of petroleum-dependent industries (see Jones et al. (2019)).




                                                     60
Figure 2, Panel C. Labor Share.             Figures reports the value-added weighted average change in the labor
share for the Market Economy based on EU KLEMS (KLEMS LAB/VA). Data for most countries are
available since 1995, but we include countries for which data are available at least since 2000. Thus, the
EU series includes EU28 ex. HRV, HUN, MLT, POL. We then compute changes since 2000, and aggregate
across industries within a region, weighing by value added (EU KLEMS item va).

E.2.2      Measurement Issues

Figure 6: Mark-up vs Profits. GOS/PROD for nonagriculture business sector excluding Real Estate from
OECD STAN, as described above. Compustat series equal to the sales-weighted average of SALE/COGS
across all Compustat firms in a given year x region, included in sample above. Data reported for EU since
1989, but note that a sizable portion of European firms report COGS only after 2005.

Table 7: Summary of Income Statement.                Start from US Compustat sample described above. Keep firm x
year pairs for neither SALE, COGS, SG&A, OIBDP, DP and OIADP are missing. Report the sales weighted
average of the ratio of COGS/SALE, SG&A/SALE, etc across all firms and years in a given decade. All
ratios are winsorized at the 2% level by year.

Figure 16: SALE/COGS vs. SG&A intensity for high-mark-up firms. Start from US Compustat sam-
ple described above. Drop firms with missing SALE/COGS or XSGA/XOPR. Identify firms in the top
25th percentile of the SALE/COGS distribution. Report a scatter plot of the sales-weighted average ratio of
SALE/COGS and XSGA/XOPR across those firms, in each year. As above, SALE/COGS and XSGA/XOPR
are winsorized at the 2% level by year.

Figure 4 and 5.         All the analyses of mark-up measurement using the China Shock are based on NAICS-6
manufacturing industries. We complement Compustat with three additional datasets:

    · Import and Exports: Import and export data are sourced from Peter Schott's website and was first
          used in Schott (2008). Data are available by HS-code x year from 1989 to 2017, but include a mapping
          to NAICS-6 industries which follows the concordance of Pierce and Schott (2012). We use these data
          to estimate import penetration and import-adjusted concentration at different levels of granularity
          (NAICS-6 as well as BEA industries).

    · NTR gap: We also gather Non-Normal-Trade-Relations tariff gaps from the replication file of Pierce
          and Schott (2016). NTR gaps are defined for NAICS level 6 industries.33

    · NBER-CES database: Last, we use the NBER-CES database, which includes output and productiv-
          ity data by NAICS Level 6 manufacturing industry from 1971 to 2011. It also includes measures of
          the production structure in each industry (such as production workers as a share of total employment,
          the log average wage, etc.), which are used as controls in regressions and to test alternate theories of
          concentration.

        NTR gaps are available in file `gaps_by_naics6_20150722_fam50', which includes NTR gaps for each NAICS Level 6 code.


                                                              61
These datasets are merged into the main Compustat sample by NAICS-6 industry x year, which includes
the total capital estimates of Peters and Taylor (2016). See main text for details on the construction of each
result.

E.2.3     Entry, Exit and Turnover

All figures are based on our main Compsutat sample described above. See text for details.

E.2.4     Joint evolution of Concentration, TFP and prices

Table 2: Concentration, TFP, Prices and Mark-ups: BLS industries. Merge Compustat import-adjusted
concentration measures with BLS KLEMS data on prices and productivity. Compute mark-ups and imple-
ment regression.

Table 3: Concentration vs Prices: Detailed industries.      For manufacturing, we merge Economic Census
concentration ratios with sales, prices, employment and payroll data from the NBER-CES database. The
data are based on 4-digit SIC codes before 1997 and 6-digit NAICS after 1997. For non-manufacturing,
merge sales, payroll, employment and concentration data from the Economic Census to prices from the
BEA's detailed GDP by Industry accounts (files GDPbyInd_GO_NAICS_1997-2016.xlsx and GDPbyInd_GO_SIC.xlsx).
These files include 400 industries, with more than 200 corresponding to manufacturing industries. Gana-
pati (2018) uses more detailed accounts, but we focus on this higher level of aggregation because, even for
these accounts, the BEA acknowledges that "the more detailed estimates are more likely to be either based
on judgmental trends, on trends in the higher-level aggregate, or on less reliable source data." Some of the
BEA industries aggregate several NAICS codes. We manually map as many codes as possible, and aggre-
gate concentration ratios by taking a weighted average when needed. We then compute quantities, labor
productivity and mark-ups as defined in the text ­ and estimate the regressions.

E.2.5     Investment and Profits by Leaders vs. Laggards

Table 4: Investment, Capital and Profits by Leaders and Laggards.              Rank firms by market value.
Define a firm as leader if it is the top firm in a given industry or the cumulative market value up to and
including this firm is below 33% of the industry market value. Repeat the exercise for mid-performers (33-
66% of MV) and the bottom 33%. Next, compute the total OIBDP, CAPX + R&D, PP&E and Capital K
(including intangibles as estimated by Peters and Taylor (2016)) by year and by MV group x year. Estimate
the share of a given measure ­ say OIBDP ­ as the ratio of leader OIBDP to total OIBDP in a given year.
Because firms are discrete, the actual share of market value in each grouping varies from year to year. To
improve comparability, re-scale shares by the ratio of 33.33% to the share of market value. Report the
average across all years in a given period.

Table 5: Investment by Leaders We start from our base Compustat sample, mapped to BEA industries.
Deflate capital stock using the industry-level price of capital reported in the BEA's fixed assets tables (see


                                                     62
below for a description). Compute yearly change in (deflated) capital stock and winsorize at the 2% and
98% level by year. Include only firm-year pairs with non-missing PPEGT, K_INT and K_PT. Define leaders
as firms with market value in the top quantile by BEA industry and year. Estimate regression as reported in
the text.

E.2.6    PCA

Our PCA analysis is based on the BEA industries described in Table 10. We define the data sources and
definitions for all measures included in the analysis. The rest of the details are provided in the text.

    · Census Concentration (cr4_cen and Dcr4_cen): The level in census concentration, as described in
        Section E.1 as well as the change since 2007

    · BEA Intangible Capital Share (intan_kshare_bea and Dintan_kshare_bea): ratio of intellectual
        property capital to total capital as measured in Section 3 of the BEA Fixed Assets tables, available at
        link; as well as the change since 1997

    · Intangible Capital Share (intan_kshare_med_pt): Define the firm-level intangible capital share as
        the ratio of internally-developed intangibles K_INT - INTAN (from Peters and Taylor (2016)) to total
        capital (K_INT + PPEGT). Compute the median across all firms in a given industry x year. Similar
        results including externally developed intangibles.

    · Import share (import_share): ratio of imports from Peter Schott's data to the sum of gross output
        and imports.

    · BEA Profit Margin (profit_margin_bea): ratio of net operating surplus to gross output as measured
        by the BEA's GDP by Industry accounts (file GDPbyInd_GO_1947-2017).

    · Compustat Median Profit Margin (profit_margin_med_cp): Define firm-level profit margin as the
        ratio of operating income after depreciation to sales (OIADP/SALE). Compute the median across all
        firms in a given industry x year.

    · US KLEMS inputs:

            ­ Labor Share (ls_kl) defined as the ratio of total labor expenses to gross output minus intermediate
              inputs.
            ­ TFP growth (dtfp_kl) equals the five-year log-change in a given industry's multifactor produc-
              tivity index (MFP)
            ­ Price, ULC and Mark-up growth (Dlogp_kl, Dlogulc_kl and Dlogmu_kl, respectively) defined
              as described in section E.2.4 above.

    · Leader Turnover (lead_turnover_mv): market-value based turnover rate, as defined in section XX
        above.



                                                        63
· Compustat firm-level leader investment gap (ikgap_cp): we roughly follow Crouzet and Eberly
  (2018). Define the net investment rate for firm i in industry j as the log-change in (deflated) total
                 P T ), using the industry-level deflator from the BEA's fixed assets tables. Then,
  capital,  log(Kijt
                  P T ) = Q
  estimate  log(Kijt          ¯jt + 2 log(Ageijt ) + i + t + ijt , where we control for firm-age,
  industry average Q as well as firm and year fixed effects. The year fixed effects measure the annual
  investment gap.
