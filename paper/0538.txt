  Estimated Effects of the October 1979 Change in Monetary Policy
                       on the 1980 Economy


                              ABSTRACT



     The effects of the October 1979 change in monetary policy on the

economy in 1980-1981 are estimated in this paper.     The effects are

estimated from simulations with my model of the u.S. economy.     Standard

errors of the estimated effects are also presented.     The results indicate

that the change reduced real growth, but had little effect on the rate

of inflation.

      ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE OCTOBER 1979 CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY

                            ON THE 1980    ECO~OMY



                                      by
                                  Ray C. Fair



        On October 6, 1979, the Federal Reserve announced what most people

interpreted as a change in monetary policy.      The purpose of this paper

is to estimate the effects of this change on the 1980-1981 economy.       The

effects of the change are estimated from simulations with my model of

the U.S. economy (1976, 1980b).     One of the equations in'this model, which

is difcussed in detail in my (1978b) paper, is an equation explaining

the behavior of the Federal Reserve.       In this equation the Fed is esti-

mated to "lean against the wind," Le.,·to allow short term interest rates

to rise (fall) in response to an increase (decrease) in real economic

activity, in the rate of inflation, and in the past growth rate of the

money supply.   The change in monetary policy is estimated by adding three

dummy variables to this equation:     one each for 1979IV, 19801, and 198011.

The estimated coefficients of these variables are taken to be the esti-

mated effects of the monetary policy change on short term interest rates.

        To estimate the effects of the policy change on the economy, two

dynamic simulations were run for the 1979IV-198lIV period:       a "base" run

that included the Fed behavioral equation with the dummy variables, and
                                                                                                               2



a second run that· included the equation without the dummy variables.

The difference between the predicted values from these two runs for each

endogenous      varia~le      and each quarter is an estimate of the effect of the

policy change on the variable in the quarter.                                Standard errors of the

effects have also been estimated, and these are presented below.                                         The

standard errors were estimated by means of a stochastic simulation pro-

cedure that I have recently proposed (1980a).



I.    The Equation Explaining Fed Behavior

             The equation explaining Fed behavior, estimated for the 19541-

198011 period by two stage least squares, is:

iables that take on a value of one in the relevant quarter (19791V, 19801,

and 198011, respectively) and zero otherwise.                                p     is the estimate of the

first order serial correlation coefficient.                                t-statistics in absolute

value are in parentheses.              A description of the data and the precise
                                                                           3



definitions of the variables are contained in (1976, 1980b).

        Equation (1) states that the current bill rate is a positive func-

tion of the lagged rate of inflation, of the current degree of labor

market tightness, of the current and lagged rates of growth ·of real GNP,

and of the lagged rate of growth of the money supply.   Lagged values of

these variables also have an effect on the current bill rate because of

the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable in the equation.     The esti-

mated effects of the policy change on the bill rate in the three quarters

are 1.58, 1.59, and -2.22.   In other words, the Fed is estimated to have

allowed the bill rate to be higher in 19791V and 19801 (by 1.58 and 1.59

percentage points, respectively) and lower in 198011 (by 2.22 percentage

points) than it would have had it been following its old policy rule.

        It is important to note in interpreting these effects that they

are conditional on the lagged value of the bill rate.   In 1979111, for

example, the bill rate was 9.63, and given this value and the values of

the other explanatory variables in equation (1) for 19791V, the Fed is

estimated to have allowed the bill rate to be 1.58 percentage points higher

in 19791V than it would have under the old rule.   In 19791V the bill rate

was 11.80, and given this value and the other values for 19801, the esti-

mated effect on the bill rate in 19801 is 1.59 percentage points.     Finally,

in 19801 the bill rate was 13.46 and given this value and the other values

for 198011, the Fed is estimated to have allowed the bill rate to be 2.22

percentage points lower in 198011 than it would have under the old rule.

(The bill rate in 198011 was 10.05.)

        For purposes of the simulation work below it is assumed that the

Fed has gone back to its old policy rule starting in 1980111.     The policy

change is thus assumed to have lasted only three quarters.     When more
                                                                              4


data are available, this assumption can be tested by adding further dummy

variables to equation (1) and seeing if their coefficient estimates are

significant.      Some of the statements of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve

in July 1980 are consistent with this assumption, in particular his testi-

mony before the Senate Banking Committee on July' 22, 1980.



II.   The Model

         The model is described elsewhere (1976, 1980b), and so it will

only be briefly discussed here.      The current version consists of   ~7   equa-

tions, 29 of which are stochastic, and has 183 unknown coefficients to

estimate, including 12 first order serial correlation coefficients.          Equa-

tion (1) is part of the model.      The model is nonlinear in both variables

and coefficients.      For present purposes it has been estimated'by two stage

least squares.     The sample period for these estimates was 19541-19801

except for the estimate of equation (1), where it was 19541-198011.          The

covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients, which is needed for the

stochastic simulation results, was estimated using         formula (4) in

Fair and Parke (1980, p. 273).      This matrix, which is of dimension

l83x183, is not block diagonal.      Included among the 183 coefficients are

the three dummy variable coefficients in equation (1).

         The model has two important properties that should be kept in

mind in interpreting the following results.      First, interest rates have,

other things being equal, a positive effect on prices.      In the theoretical

version of the model, which is based on the premise that firms set prices

(along with other decision variables) by solving multiperiod maximization

problems, the interest rate and other cost of capital variables have a positive

effect on the price that the firm sets. This feature is also part of the econometric
                                                                           5



model:   included among the explanatory variables in the price equation

are two cost of capital variables, a bond rate and an investment tax

credit variable.   The second property is that prices are not very sensi-

tive to demand changes except in periods of high economic activity.        In

other words, the tradeoff between output and inflation is very poor in

periods of low to moderate economic activity.     This feature, which appears

to be common to many other econometric models as well, is discussed in

detail in my (1978a) paper.

         It should also be noted that interest rates have a strong nega-

tive effect on demand and output in the model.     There are a number of

channels for this effect.     The two long term interest rates in the model,

a bond rate and a mortgage rate, are linked to the bill rate through standard

term structure equations.     Both the bill rate and the mortgage rate appear

directly as explanatory variables in the consumption equations, with

negative coefficient estimates.     Because of this, the household savings

rate is, other things being equal, a positive function of interest rates.

The bond rate affects prices, as mentioned above, and prices have, other

things being equal, a negative effect on demand.     (Prices appear as ex-

planatory variables in the consumption equations, with negative coefficient

estimates.)   There is also a loan-constraint variable in the model.       This

variable is a function of the level of interest rates and has a negative

effect on consumption in periods of tight money.     Interest rates also

have a negative effect on wealth in the model, through a negative effect

on stock prices, and wealth has a positive effect on consumption.      Demand

affects output in the model, which in turn affects investment and employ-

ment; and so interest rates, by affecting demand, indirectly affect output,

investment, and employment.

III.   The Estimated Effects

         The results for eighb endogenous variables in the model are pre-

sented in Table 1.    The values in the     a   rows for each variable are

actual values for 19791V-198011 and predicted values thereafter.         The

actual values for 198011 are preliminary (they are values available as

of August 1, 1980).     The predicted values are from an ex ante forecast

that I made on August 7, 1980, with the model.

        The values in the      b   rows are the estimated effects of the policy

change on the variables.     It will be easiest to describe how these values

would have been obtained had deterministic simulations been used and then

to explain the modifications needed for the stochastic simulations.            First,

estimated residuals are available for the first three quarters (19791V-

198011), and these residuals were added to the estimated equations and

treated as exogenous.    This means that a perfect tracking solution is

obtained for these quarters when the actual values of the exogenous var-

iab1es (including the dummy variables in equation (1»        are used.   Since

the predicted values beyond 198011 are based on actual values for 198011,

this also means that a simulation run from 19791V through the end of the

forecast period (19811V) will duplicate the predicted values for 1980111

and beyond, provided that the actual values of the exogenous variables are

used for the first three quarters and that the exogenous-variable values

used for the ex ante forecast are used     there~fter.    Call this simulation

the "base" simulation.

        A second simulation can then be run that is identical to the base

simulation except that the values of the dummy variables in equation (1)

are set equal to zero.     This run is an estimate of what the economy would

have been like had the monetary policy change for the three quarters not

been undertaken.    The difference between the values from these two runs

for each endogenous variable and each quarter is an estimate of the effect

of the policy change on the variable in the quarter.       These differences

would be the values of the     b    rows in Table 1 if deterministic simula-

tions had been used.     The modifications for the stochastic simulations

will now be described.

       The differences between the values from the above two runs are

uncertain because they are based on estimated values of the coefficients

rather than the (unknown) actual values.       In a recent study (1980a) I

have proposed a stochastic simulation procedure that can be used to estimate

this uncertainty.   The procedure in the present case consists of drawing

sets of coefficient values from an estimate of the distribution of the

coefficient estimates and for each set running the above two simulations.

If, say, 100 draws are made, then one has 100 estimates of each difference.

These 100 estimates can then be used to compute the mean and standard

error of each difference.     For the results in Table 1, 150 draws were

made, using the above mentioned covariance matrix of the coefficient

estimates for the draws.    The b-row values are the estimated means (over

the 150 values for each variable and each quarter) of the differences,

and the c-row values are the estimated standard errors of the differences.

       The a-row values are subj ect to change in the future.      Many of the

"actuall l values for the first three quarters will be revised, and the

predicted values for the remaining quarters are not likely to be exactly

right (even using my model).       Fortunately, the b- and c-row values are

not likely to be sensitive to the a-row values, and more confidence can

be placed on them than on the a-row values.       Because the model is non-

linear, the multipliers in the      b   rows are a function of the a-row values
                                                                             9



(i.e., of the initial conditions, the exogenous-variable values, and

the realizations of the error terms), but for most macroeconometric models

the effects of the a-row values on the b-row values are small relative

to the size of the b-row values.

          Given the above discussion of the properties of the model, the

b-row results in Table 1 should be as expected, namely that the policy

change affected output negatively but had little effect on the rate of

inflation.     According to the demand pressure variables in the model ,

the policy change was not made in a period of high economic activity.

The unemployment rate in 1979111 was 5.8 percent, and real GNP growth

during the previous four quarters (19781V through 1979111) had been only

1.8 percent.     (The growth rate in 1979111 was 3.2 percent at an annual

rate.)     The estimated effect on real GNP in 198011 is -10.3 billion dollars,

and the cumulative effect over the 9 quarters is -58.8 billion dollars.

The estimated effect on the percentage change in the GNP deflator is -0.34

percentage points in 198011 and -0.03 percentage points by the end of

the period.    The rate of inflation is actually higher in the first two

quarters (and in 1980111 and 19801V), which is due to the positive

interest-rate effect on inflation outweighing the negative demand-pressure

effect.    All the b-row values for inflation are, however, very small,

and the main conclusion from them is that the policy change had very

little effect on inflation in either direction.

          As a consequence of the fall in output, about 400 thousand jobs

are lost by the end of 1980, and the unemployment rate is about 0.3 per-

centage points higher.     The   cumula~ive   fall in corporate profits over

the 9 quarters is 36.1 billion dollars.        The money supply grows less

in the first two quarters and then slightly more for the rest of the
                                                                           10



period.     Although not shown in the table, the cumulative fall in the

money supply over the 9 quarters is 17.2 billion dollars (with a standard

error of 13.7 billion dollars).

          The standard errors in the   c   rows give one a rough idea of how

much confidence to place on the b-row values.       For the first two or three

quarters the standard errors are generally less than half of the estimated

effects.     By the end of the period they are generally greater than the

estimated effects.

          The standard errors in Table 1 are based on the implicit assump-

tion that the model is correctly specified:       the estimated uncertainty

of the multipliers is due only to the uncertainty of the coefficient

estimates.     In the present case there are at least two reasons for be-

lieving that the uncertainty of the multipliers is greater than the

estimates in the table.     First, the model may not have captured adequately

the effects of the credit controls that were imposed during part of the

9 month period.     There is a loan-constraint variable in the model, and

in principle this variable should have captured these effects.       It may

be, however, that the effects were underestimated.      The decline in real

GNP in 198011 (of 8.7 percent, preliminary estimate), for example, was

considerably underestimated by the model.      The model predicted (ex post)

a fall of only 1.4 percent for the one-quarter-ahead forecast and 1.2

percent for the three-quarter-ahead forecast (i.e., the forecast beginning

in 1979IV).     Some of this error may have been due to a failure to capture

all the effects of the controls.       If so, this means that the output

effects in Table 1 should be larger (i.e., more negative).       The inflation

effects, however, are not likely to be affected very much, given that

output has little effect on inflation in this period.       (The ex post
                                                                         11



forecasts of inflation are fairly accurate.    The GNP deflator increased

by 9.93 percent in 198011.    The one-quarter-ahead forecast was 11.38

percent, and the three-quarter-ahead forecast was 10.53 percent.)

         The other reason for questioning the uncertainty estimates in

Table 1 concerns the foreign sector in the model.    In the current version

exports and import prices are exogenous, and so foreign repercussions

of the monetary policy change are not accounted for.    It may be, for

example, that an increase in the short term U.S. interest rate results

in an appreciation of the dollar (depending on how the monetary authori-

ties of other countries respond to the increase in the U.S. rate).       This

will likely result in a fall in U.S. import prices and then over time

to a fall in U.S. domestic prices.    If this effect is in operation, it

means that the effects on inflation of the policy change have been under-

estimated by the model.    Some preliminary work that I have done construct-

i~g   a multicountry econometric model indicate that this effect is probably

small, in part because other countries' short term interest rates respond

to the U.S. rate.



IV.    Conclusion

        The main result of the simulations is easy to summarize.    The change

in monetary policy is estimated to have reduced real growth,without having

much effect on the rate of inflation.    Real growth was reduced because

interest rates have a negative effect on demand and output.    Inflation

was not affected very much because the tradeoff between output and infla-

tion is very poor in periods of low to moderate economic actiVity.       There

is also an offset to the negative demand-pressure effect on inflation

in this case, namely a positive interest-rate effect.    The possible
                                                                       12



misspecification of the model is likely to affect the output multipliers

more than the inflation multipliers.   In particular, because of the

credit controls, the policy change may have had a larger effect on out-

put than is estimated in Table 1.
