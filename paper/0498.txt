     Monetary Information and Macroeconomic Fluctuations


                          ABSTRACT



    This paper Introduces contemporaneously available monetary data

into an "equilibrium" model that combines rational expectations, market

clearing, and incomplete information about monetary disturbances. Data

on the current money stock involve a preliminary estimate that is subject

to a subsequent process of gradual revision. The model implies the

testable hypothesis that aggregate output and employment are uncorrelated

with the contemporaneous measure of money growth implied by the difference

between the currently available estimates of current and past money shocks.

Rejection of this hypothesis provides strong evidence againat the equilibriums

approach to modelling the relation between monetary disturbances and macro—

eocnomic fluctuations.

      Current research in macroeconomics focuses considerable
 attention on models that appeal to incomplete information about
monetary disturbances in an attempt to reconcile assumptions
of rational expectations and market clearing with a relation
between money and macroeconomic fluctuations. Evaluation of
these so—called "equilibrium models" requires understanding of
the precise content in this context of the three key ideas.
 (1) Rational expectations mean that private agents gather and
use information efficiently and, more specifically, that they
behave as if they understand the economy's essential stochastic
structural relations, including the pattern governing the
determination of the stock of money.  (2) Market clearing means
that transactions in individual markets realize all perceived
gains from trade. This assumption has taken two alternative
forms. Specifically, Lucas [1972; 1973] and Barro [1976]
assume that prices and quantities equate spot demands and supplies,
whereas Azariadis 11978) assumes that quantities are set con-
tractually to satisfy perceived Productive-efficiency conditions,
which are similar to spot market—clearing conditions, but that
certain prices are set contractually to satisfy risk—sharing—
efficiency conditions, which mean that wages are not equated to
perceived marginal products. For present purposes, these two
forms of market clearing have the same implications. (3) Incomplete
information means that only local inrormation about prices is
contemporaneously available and that a part of the behavior of
monetary aggregates is neither anticipated nor contemporaneously
perceived. Specifically, equilibrium models assume that monetary
policy is partly stochastic and, with the exception of the
recent work of King f1980], existing equilibrium models also
assume that no data on the current money stock is available.
These models, however, assume that accurate data about past
values of the money stock is currently available.

     The most striking implication of equilibrium models, derived
explicitly by Barro [1976], is a neutrality proposition that says
                             —2—
that macroeconomic fluctuations——specifically, the time pattern
of differences between actual and natural levels of real
variables such as aggregate output and employment-—evolve
independently of those monetary actions that reflect systematic
responses to macroeconomic fluctuations. Because private agents
correctly anticipate systematic monetary policy and understand
how monetary policy affects the market—clearing conditions,
which govern the determination of real variables, their
behavioral responses to systematic monetary policy impact on
market-clearing prices but do not affect the difference
between actual and natural levels of real variables. As a
complement to this neutrality proposition, existing equilibrium
models also imply that the pattern of macroeconomic fluctuations
depends in a significant way on the subset of monetary actions
that is nonsystematic.   Because of incomplete information,
private agents are unable to distinguish random monetary dis-
turbances from relative disturbances. Consequently, their
behavioral responses to random monetary disturbances, in
contrast to th3ir behavioral responses to systematic monetary
policy, produce changes in real variables.

     One troublesome feature of existing equilibrium models
is their cavalier and unrealistic assumptions about the
availability of monetary data.   The Federal Reserve Board
currently issues preliminary monetary data with only an
eight—day lag and then revises this data over a period of months
or years. These revisions result from such factors as com-
putational corrections, semi—annual benchmark changes reflecting
fuller reporting, and conceptual changes reflecting financial
innovations. Existing equilibrium models, however, abstract
from both the existence of contemporaneous preliminary monetary
data and the process of gradual accumulation of revised monetary
data. The neglect of contemporaneous data implies that private
agents act as if they ignore readily available and apparently
relevant information, an implication that seems inconsistent
                            —3—
with the idea of rational expectations. The neglect of the
process of data correction implies, in contrast, that private
agents act as if they have an unrealistically large
amount of information.
     In his recent paper, King [1980] makes a start at
rectifying this problem by introducing contemporaneously available
monetary data into an equilibrium model.
In King's model, this data takes the form of an estimate of the
current money stock, subject to a random error that is fully
corrected in the next period. The important new implication
derived from King's analysis is that real variables such as
aggregate output and employment are uncorrelated with this
contemporaneously available monetary data.

     The model developed in the present paper expands on King's
analysis by taking explicit account of the gradual process of
accumulation of revised monetary data. Our model, like King's
model, includes a contemporaneous estimate of the money stock,
but instead of King's assumption that this estimate is corrected
in the next period, we assume that developing the finally
reported value of the current money stock involves more than
one revision and takes more than one period. Our model also
allows explicitly for systematic monetary policy in the form
of a target monetary growth rate that responds to the past
behavior of aggregate output.
     The main result from the analysis that follows is that,
despite the more complete specification of the accumulation of
monetary data, systematic monetary policy, and their inter-
action, the present model turns out to have implications
similar to those derived by Barro and King.   Specifically, our
analysis implies that aggregate output and employment are
independent of systematic monetary policy and are uncorrelated
with the contemporaneous measure of money growth implied by
the difference between the currently available estimates of
current and past money stocks.
                              —4—
      This latter implication would seem to be a readily testable
 hypothesis, and an obvious conjecture would be that it is not
 consistent with the relevant data. In fact, econometric results
 reported by Barro and Hercowitz 119801 as well as more
 extensive econometric analyses reported in Boschen and Grossman
 [1980] confirm this conjecture. These results provic1e
 apparently strong evidence against the equilibrium approach to
 modelling the relation between monetary disturbances and
 macroeconomic fluctuations.

 1.   Setup of the Model

      In the existing literature, the development of the
 incomplete—information paradigm has focused on various, but
 mutually consistent, stories about information. The following
 setup is based on the story told by Friedman 11968] in which
 the representative worker infrequently purchases many of the
 items that he consumes and, hence, infrequently observes
 their p.i..ices. The representative worker, consequently, does
 not know precisely the extent to which a change in the nominal
 value of his product involves a change in his terms of trade
between leisure and consumption. His subjective belief about
consumption prices and, hence, about the relevant real value
of his productive services is the critical expectational variable
in the model. The incorporation of rational expectations in
the model means that this subjective belief is equal to a true
mathematical expectation conditional on available information.
The structural equations of the model describe the supply and
demand for a representative good, the market—clearing condition
that determines the output and price of this good, the
behavioral pattern of the monetary authority, the nature of
 available monetary data, and the formation of rational
expectations about average prices.

     The current supply of representative good z depends on
the subjective belief of the representative producer of this
                                  —5—
good about the relation between the current price of this good
and average prices. Specifically, we assume the log-linear
form
            S
(1)     yt(z) = a Ip(z) —        Et(z)pt]      +   n(z),
where y(z) is the log of the current supply of good z,
        pt(.z) is the log of the current money price of good z,
        Et(z)pt is the current subjective belief of the
                representative producer of good z about the
                average of the logs of money prices,
        a       is the positive and constant elasticity of supply
                with respect to the difference, pt(z) -
                                                        Et(z)pt,
                and
        ntz)    is the log of the "natural" level of output
                of good z.
     The current demand for good z depends on the value of
aggregate money balances deflated by pt(z) and on a random
disturbance to the relative demands for the various goods.
Specifically, we assume the log—linear form

        ytz) =           —            +
(2)
                   [Mt       Pt(z)]
where
            d
        ytCz)    is the log of the current demand for good z,

        Mt       is the log of the finally reported value of
                 the current money stock,
                 is a positive and constant elasticity of demand
                 with respect to the difference, Mt —
                                                      pt(z), and
                 is a random variable distributed according to

                             N(O,a), uncorrelated serially,
                 uncorrelated with the other random variables in
                 the model, and summing to zero across all goods,
                 i.e.,
                             t
                                 ct =     0.
                               —6—
       A more general formulation of the supply and demand
functions would include the terms,    pt(z) —   E(z)p   and
Mt —   pt(z),   in both of the functions and also would allow for
random disturbances to supply and to aggregate demand. These
and other possible generalizations           would complicate
the algebraic analysis of the model without            changing
the main conclusions regarding the role of monetary information.

       Note that we are careful not to define Mt to be the log
of the true value of the current money stock. This implied
distinction between true values and finally reported values is
necessary to make the setup of the model strictly consistent
with the rational—expectations assumption that private agents
behave as if they know the structure of the economy. Presumably,
individuals can acquire this knowledge only from observational
experience, a process that implies, as regards the relations
between aggregate variables, that, because producers of good z
would not directly experience aggregate variables, these
variables as contained in the specified structural equations
can represent only the most accurate available measurements as
reported in revised and corrected published data. The
construction of this data implies that individuals, like
statisticians and econometricians, c.nnot know the remaining
inaccuracies in this data and, hence, cannot learn from
observational experience the structural relations between the
true values of these quantities.

     The market-clearing condition for good z is that
adjusts to satisfy the equality,

                   s       d
                  y(z) =

where y(z) is the log of the actual current output of good z.
This part of our model is the same as King's model except that
King sets     equal to unity and includes an additional random
disturbance to aggregate demand. For present purposes, these
                                  —7—
differences are inconsequential.            The rest of the
model          specification of available information, of the
determination of Mt, and of the formation of Et(z)pt.
     Currently available monetary data include a preliminary
estimate of the finally reported value of the current money
stock and reported values of the money stocks of previous periods.
These reported values include some estimates that have already
been revised but, like the estimate of last period's money
stock, iot yet finalized. For the current money stock, we
assume a log-linear estimating relation, which is identical to
King' s formulation,

(.4)



where Mt is the log of the latest published estimate of the
           money stock and
           is a random variable distributed according to
                               uncorrelated serially, and
            uncorrelated with the other random variables in
            the model.

     Monetary policy involves a target monetary growth rate,
which incorporates both a constant term and a systematic
response to past differences between actual and natural levels
of aggregate output, and a random factor. specifically,
we assume a log—linear relation of the form,

where       =    +             - n)   and

where           is the log of the current estimate of last period's
                money stock,
                is the aggregate across all goods of the logs of
                output last period, i.e.,      =

        n       is the aggregate across all goods of the logs of
                the natural levels of output, i.e., n =         n(z),
                                                            z
                  is the constant element in systematic monetary policy,
                  is the elasticity of the variable element in
                  systematic monetary policy, and
                  is a random variable distributed according to
                     -
                       N(O,c2), uncorrelated serially, and uncorrelated
                with the other random variables in the model.
      Within the context of equation (5), the random variable,
has at least two possible interpretations, corresponding to
different monetary policy processes. One possible process is that
Mt results from adding c and a random variable, x, directly to
ii_i—_that is,

         Mt =   Mt_i   +       + x.
In this case,         is equivalent to x. A second possible process
is that Mt results from adding            and x to M 1——that is,

         Mt = Mt     1+ t + xt.
This equation is identical to King's formulation of monetary
policy except for the inclusion of      Given a log-linear
estimating relation for Mti in the form

         Mt_1 =    Mti     +

where      is a random variable, we can express the second monetary
policy process as

         Mt =     Mt_i +   t+x        -


In   this case,        is equivalent to the difference, x. -       In
general, these two processes imply different values for    and
for    and hence have different quantitative implications for
the behavior of y. These two processes, however, have the
same implication for the relation between y. and    -
                               —9—
     The assumed rationality of expectations prescribes that
the subjective belief, Et(z)pt, is equal to the true
mathematical expectation of Pt conditional on the information
currently known to producers of good z. Specifically,

(6)     Et(z)pt = E [Pt I   It(z)],
where I(z) is the assumed information set. This set contains
useful knowledge about the structure of the economy that includes
the form of the structural equations (i) - (6), the values
of the parameters, a, , 4), and 4), the natural levels of
output of good z and of aggregate output, n(z) and n, and
the form of the stochastic disturbances, ct(z),  and
The information set also contains useful data that includes
the current price of good z, pt(z), the past level of
aggregate output,       and the monetary data,       and
Note that, by implication, the information set includes the
current value of systematic monetary policy,      The
potentially useful information that is not in It(z) includes
current and past average prices, Pt and          the current level
of aggregate output, y, the finally reported values of the
current and last period's money stock,    and Mt_i, and the
realizations of the stochastic disturbances, c(z),         and
Note that if -1 were in the information set, introduction
of a random disturbance to aggregate demand would be necessary
to prevent individuals from inferring Mt_i exactly.

2.    Solution of the Model

     Theoretical analysis of the model specified by equa-
tions Ci) — (.6) involves finding a solution for the current
output of representative good z and, hence, for aggregate
output that satisfies the market-clearing condition, given
                                    — 10 —


by equation (3), subject to expectations being formed rationally,
as specified by equation (6). The method of undetermined
coefficients, applied in similar contexts by Lucas [1972] and
Barro [1976J, provides a solution procedure. The first step
is to substitute equations (1) and (2) into the market-clearing
condition, given by equation (3), to obtain an equation that
relates ptz). to       Et(z)pt, and other variables,

          pt(z) =   Ca   +   )1   [aEt(z)pt +   Mt   +
                                                         c(z)   —   n(z)].
       The second step is to use either equation (4) or equa-
tion (5) to eliminate Mt from equation (.7). As a check of
the solution, we work out both strategies. Combining equa-
tions (.4) and (.7) gives


(8a)     pt(z) = (ct +       )l   [aEt(z)pt + (J4 —      &) +       Ct(z) -   n(z)].
Combining equations (5) and (7) gives

(8b)     pCz) = (a + )                                              + ct(z) -    n(z)J.

       The third step is to conjecture a solution for p(z) that
is a linear combination of a constant term, which allows for
known variables, and each of the stochastic disturbances,

               =    ll(z)    +      + 1126t + llc(.z).

Aggregating equation (9) across all goods yields a solution for
average prices in the form,

(10)     Pt = 1T +           + ll.
The assumed rationality of expectations means that the subjective
belief, Et(.z)pt, is equal to the true mathematical expectation
of equation (10) conditional on It(z). This expectation is given
by
                                  — 11 —

 (11)      Et(Z)pt =     +
                             llE(z)g + lIEt(z)6t,

where E(z)g and          Et(z)5t are true mathematical expectations
conditional on I(.z).
        The fourth step is to calculate
                                            E(z)g and Et(z)ot.
In forming these expectations, producers of good .z can combine
the known structural equations describing market clearing,
monetary policy, and monetary information, as in equations (8a)
and (8b), to obtain the following two equations between linear
combinations of stochastic variables and linear combinations
of known variables. Rearranging equation (8a) gives

(12)              + c(z) = (c + )pt(z) —   cEt(z)p
                                                         —   + n(z)

Rearranging equation (8b) gives

              + c.(z) = (c + )pt(z) —
(13)
                                           cEt(z)p
                                                     —
                                                         (Mti +   )   + n(z).

Equations (12) and (13) enable the producers of good z to infer
the values of the sums,        +        and      + ct(z).
     Given the linear normal structure of the model, the
relations between the conditional expectations and the known
linear corithinabjons of stochastic variables have the form of
regression equations,

The procedure is to substitute into equation (11) the values of

E(z)g and Et(z)                         given by equation (14), and then to
substitute into either equations (8a) or (8b) the resulting
value of Et(z)pt given by equation (11). Equation (8a) or (8b)

3.   Implications of the Solution

     Equation (17) indicates that current aggregate output,
equals the natural level of aggregate output, n, plus a linear
combination of the realizations of the exogenous random van—
ables that represent the unanticipated part of current monetary
policy,     and the currently unperceived part of current
monetary policy, S. The coefficients of this linear combina-
tion are, as indicated by the expressions for II     and II,

themselves functions of the variances of these random variables,
a2 and 2-, and the variance of the random disturbance to
 g
relative demands, a2.  The calculated value for TI implies

that y is positively related to         This   result obtains
because producers of good z mistake some of the increase in
the money price of good z that results from a positive value
of    to be an increase in the relative price of good z.
The calculated value of II    implies that y is negatively related

to         This result obtains because, as King points out, a high
preliminary estimate of the money stock causes the expectations
of producers of good z about average prices to be too high
and their expectations about the relative price of good z to
be correspondingly too low.

         The correspondence between the solution for y given by
equation (17) and the solution that King obtains for his
model depends on which of the interpretations of    discussed
above is relevant. For the case of        equivalent to x.,
equation (17) is identical to King's solution, except for
the fact that King sets     equal to unity and includes an
additional random disturbance to aggregate demand. For the
case of    equivalent to x - ,' equation (17) also differs
 from King's solution to the extend that       and    differ from
 zero.

       The models of Lucas, Barro, and King imply that fluctuations
of aggregate output relative to its natural level require the
existence of random disturbances from all of the three sources——
relative demands, monetary policy, and contemporaneously
available estimates of the money stock. To confirm that this
conclusion also applies to the present model, consider the
effect of setting either ct(z) or    or    equal to a known
constant. Any one of these changes in the model would mean
that producers of good z either know or are able to infer
   and 6 exactly from equations (12) and (13). In this case,
equation (i4) would not be the relevant for calculating
E(z)g and Et(z)ot. Instead, the solution of the model
would involve setting     E(z)g equal to    and Et(z)5t equal
to     in equation (11). Solving for the undetermined
coefficients would then imply that IT equals unity and that II
equals zero, so that y equals n.
     King shows that in his model the covariance between y and
his contemporaneous measure of money growth,    -       is
                                                                Mt_i,
equal to zero. Now, let us calculate the covariance between
and the contemporaneous measure of money growth,                  —

that applies in the present model. Observe that combining
equations (4) and (5) implies

Thus, we have from equations (17) and (18),

we obtain

     Equation (20) provides the basis for the econometric
tests reported in Boschen and Grossman [1980]. These tests
imply rejection of the hypothesis, represented by
equation (.20), that current aggregate output is independent
of the contemporaneous measure of money growth. Because
this hypothesis seems to be an inescapable implication of
the equilibrium approach to macroeconomic modelling, these
empirical results also imply rejection of this approach.
