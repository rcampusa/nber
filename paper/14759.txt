Choice Inconsistencies Among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part
D Program

                                               ABSTRACT

The Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan represents the most significant privatization of the delivery
of a public insurance benefit in recent history, with dozens of private insurers offering a wide range
of products with varying prices and product features; the typical elder had a choice of roughly 40 stand-alone
drug plans. In this paper we evaluate the choices of elders across this wide array of Part D options
using a unique data set of prescription drug claims matched to information on the characteristics of
choice sets. We first document that the vast majority of elders are choosing plans that are not on the
“efficient portfolio” of plan choice in the sense that an alternative plan offers better risk protection
at a lower cost. We then estimate several discrete choice models to document three dimensions along
which elders are making choices which are inconsistent with optimization under full information: elders
place much more weight on plan premiums than they do on expected out of pocket costs; they place
almost no value on variance reducing aspects of plans; and they value plan financial characteristics
beyond any impacts on their own financial expenses or risk.These findings are robust to a variety of
specifications and econometric approaches. We develop an "adjusted" revealed preference approach
that combines data from consumer choices with ex ante restrictions on preferences, and find that in
a partial equilibrium setting, restricting the choice set to the three lowest average cost options would
have likely raised welfare for elders under the program.

       The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, better known as the legislation that added the

Part D prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, represents the single most significant

expansion of public insurance programs in the U.S. in the past 40 years. The most novel, and

controversial, feature of this legislation was the use of multiple private insurance providers to

deliver this new public insurance product. Unlike the traditional model of government mandated

uniform insurance packages for all enrollees, under the Part D program dozens of private

insurers were allowed to offer a wide range of products with varying prices and product features.

Perhaps most well-known was the extent to which plans covered the “donut hole”, a broad

uncovered range of expenditures in the minimum mandated plan.

       This unprecedented privatization of the delivery of a public insurance product raises a

host of important policy questions. Primary among these is the impacts of allowing choice

across so many private insurance options. The typical elder in our data (described below) faces a

choice of over 40 stand-alone drugs plans, and our estimates suggest that the range of cost from

the most to least expensive option facing an elder is comparable to the mean of those costs.

Choice is clearly meaningful in this context. Yet, to date, we know almost nothing about how

elders are making these crucial choices.

       This paper investigates the choices of elders for the newly formed Part D program in

2006. We analyze data that provides information on the Part D plans chosen and prescription

drug utilization for a large sample of elders in the U.S. These data were collected by Wolters

Kluwer (WK), a “switch agent” that lies between pharmacies that fill prescriptions and the

insurance companies and prescription benefit managers that pay for them. WK collects

information on almost one-third of all third party prescription drug transactions, and we will use

the universe of their data for those over age 65 during 2005-2006 to examine choice of Part D
                                                  2


plan. We match to this data set a comprehensive set of information from the Centers for

Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on the Part D plans available to each person in our data

set.

       Specifically, for each elder whose claims appear in our sample, we model the financial

implications of each of the plans in their choice set, based on both 2005 and 2006 drug utilization

and several different models of expectations. We begin by presenting the basic facts on choice,

documenting that the vast majority of elders are choosing plans that are not on the “efficient

portfolio” of plan choice for that elder. We then turn to more rigorous multinomial models of

individual choice to incorporate non-financial characteristics, preference heterogeneity and

unobserved plan characteristics into our analysis.

       Our findings are striking: along three dimensions, elders are making choices which are

inconsistent with optimization under full information. First, elders place much more weight on

plan premiums than they do on the expected out of pocket costs that they will incur under the

plan. Second, they substantially under-value variance reducing aspects of alternative plans.

Finally, consumers appear to value plan financial characteristics far beyond any impacts on their

own financial expenses or risk. These findings are robust to a variety of specifications and

econometric approaches.

       We attempt to interpret the magnitude of our results by analyzing the impact of restricting

the option set offered to elders under Part D. We develop an "adjusted" revealed preference

approach that combines data from consumer choices with ex ante restrictions on preferences.

We find that in a partial equilibrium setting, restricting the choice set to the three lowest average

cost options would have likely raised welfare for elders under the program.

        Our paper proceeds as follows. Part I provides background on the Part D program and

reviews the growing literature on its impacts. Part II discusses our data sources, and Part III

presents initial results on choice set variation and choice behavior. Part IV describes our choice

framework, and Part V presents results. Part VI shows the welfare analysis based on these

models, and Part VII concludes.



                                            Part I: Background

The Medicare Part D Program

        Medicare, which provides universal health insurance coverage to those over age 65 and to

those on the disability insurance program, was established in 1965. The original program

covered most medical needs for the elderly and disabled, including hospital and doctor costs, but

it excluded coverage for prescription drugs. This omission was not perceived as a major one in

the early years of the Medicare program, but in the 1990s the advancement of prescription drug

treatments for common illnesses among the elderly drew attention to this gap in Medicare

coverage. Medicare recipients, for example, spent an average of $2,500 each on prescription

drugs in 2003, more than twice what the average American spent on all health care in 1965.1

        In 2003, the Bush administration and Congress reached agreement on a far-reaching

prescription drug benefit package at a projected cost to the federal government of $40 billion per

year for its first ten years. The most noticeable innovation of the Part D plan is that this new

Medicare benefit is not delivered by the government, but rather by private insurers under

contract with the government. Beneficiaries can choose from three types of private insurance

plans coverage of their drug expenditures. The first is stand-alone plans called Medicare

 Data for prescription drug spending comes from the Congressional Budget Office (2002). Data for average
Americans’ health spending comes from the “National Health Expenditures” section of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services’ National Health Accounts.

Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) (a plan that just offers prescription drug benefits). In 2006, there

were 1429 total PDPs offered throughout the nation, with most states offering about forty PDPs.

The majority of PDPs are offered by a dozen national or near national companies.

           The second alternative is Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, plans that provide all

Medicare benefits, including prescription drugs, such as HMO, PPO, or Private FFS plans. There

were 1314 total plans nationally in 2006. Finally, beneficiaries could retain their current

employer/union plan, as long as coverage is “creditable” or at least as generous (i.e. actuarially

equivalent) as the standard Part D plan, for which they would receive a subsidy from the

government

           Under Part D, recipients are entitled to basic coverage of prescription drugs by a plan

with a structure actuarially equivalent to the following: none of the first $250 in drug costs each

year; 75% of costs for the next $2,250 of drug spending (up to $2,500 total); 0% of costs for the

next $3,600 of drug spending (up to $5,100 total, the “donut hole”); and 95% of costs above

$5,100 of drug spending. Over 90% of beneficiaries in 2006, however, are not enrolled in the

standard benefit design, but rather are in plans with low or no deductibles, flat payments for

covered drugs following a tiered system, or some form of coverage in the donut hole. The main

requirement for plans is that they must have equal or greater actuarial value than the standard

benefit.2 The government also placed restrictions on the structure of the formularies that plans

could use to determine which prescription medications they would ensure. Overall, Part D

sponsors have great flexibility in terms of plan design.

           Enrollment in Part D plans was voluntary for Medicare eligible citizens, although

Medicare recipients not signing up by May 15, 2006 were subject to a financial penalty if they

eventually joined the program (to mitigate adverse selection in the choice of joining the

program). One group, however, was automatically enrolled: low income elders who had been

receiving their prescription drug coverage through state Medicaid programs (the “dual

eligibles”). These dual eligibles were enrolled in Part D plans by default if they did not choose

one on their own. The Part D plans for dual eligibles could charge copayments of only $1 for

generics/$3 for name brand drugs for those below the poverty line, and only $2 for generics/$5

for name brand drugs for those above the poverty line, with free coverage above the out of

pocket threshold of $3600.3

        Despite reluctance voiced before the legislation passed, there was enormous interest from

insurers in participating in the Part D program. By November 2006, 3,032 plans were being

offered to potential Part D enrollees. Every county in the nation had at least 27 plans available;

the typical county had 48 plans, while some counties featured more than 70 choices, primarily

due to high number of MA plans.4

        Enrollment in the new Part D program was initially fraught with problems, but in the

following months the federal government was able to iron out many of the problems that had

arisen during the initial transition. As of June 2006, there were 10.4 million people enrolled in

stand alone PDP plans, 5.5 million people enrolled in MA plans and about 6 million dual

eligibles.5 Yet 73% of people over 65 felt that the Medicare prescription drug benefit was too


3
  In addition, two other groups receive substantial subsidies – those found eligible for Low Income Subsidy (LIS) or
for Partial Subsidy by the SSA. To qualify for LIS, beneficiaries must have income less than 135% of poverty and
resources less than $7,500/individual or $12,000 couple. This group received benefits comparable to the dual
eligibles with incomes above 100% of poverty. To qualify for Partial Subsidy, beneficiaries must have income at
135%-150% of poverty and resources less than $11,500/individual or $23,000/couple. This group can enroll in
plans with a $50 deductible, a 15% copayment up to the out of pocket threshold, and $2/$5 copayments above that
point. In addition, premiums are fully paid by the government up to 135% of poverty, and then partially subsidized
up to 150% of poverty.

complicated, while 91% of pharmacists and 92% of doctors expressed this concern. When asked

if they agree with the statement “Medicare should select a handful of plans that meet certain

standards so seniors have an easier time choosing,” 60% of seniors answered “Yes.”6

        Despite these reservations, there were no signs of diminished plan choice in subsequent

years. The number of PDPs increased by about 30% in 2007, from 1,429 to 1,875 and remained

at this level in 2008.7

Issues of Elder Choice in Part D

        The use of this private delivery device, with such a multiplicity of choices, is a novel

feature of the Part D legislation. Standard economic theory would suggest that this is a

beneficial plan feature: allowing individuals to choose across a wide variety of plans that meet

their needs, rather than constraining them to a limited set of choices being made by the

government, can only increase welfare in the standard model in a partial equilibrium setting.

        But there are reasons to believe that the standard model is insufficient, particularly for a

population of elders. There is growing interest in behavioral economics in models where agents

are better off with a more restricted choice set, as nicely reviewed in Iyengar and Kamenica

(2006). Recent theoretical work shows that the traditional “more is better” principle may be

reversed in choice set contexts, for example when the presence or absence of options conveys

information (Kamenica, 2006; Kuksov and Villas-Boas, 2005) or when agents have preferences

with regret (Irons and Hepburn, 2003; Sarver, 2005). And a growing body of empirical work

shows that individuals are less likely to participate in markets where they face more choice;

decisions to purchase a good (Iyengar and Lepper, 2000; Boatwright and Nunes, 2001), take a

loan (Bertrand et al., 2005) or enroll in a 401(k) plan (Iyengar, Huberman and Jiang, 2004) are

found to decrease when participation requires choosing from a larger set of alternatives.

       Iyengar and Kamenica (2006) find that not only the decision to participate in a market,

but also the nature of choice itself, is affected by the size of the option set. They investigate

choice over asset allocation in both laboratory and real-world (pension plan choice) settings, and

find that individuals opt for safer investments when faced with a larger range of risky choices. In

particular, they find that the presence of more investment options in a 401(k) plan leads to more

frequent choice of money market or bond options rather than equity investment. Iyengar and

Lepper (2000) also find that satisfaction with choices made falls with the size of the choice set in

several experimental settings.

       These issues may be paramount within the context of the elderly, given that the potential

for cognitive failures rises at older ages. Salthouse (2004) shows clear evidence that the

performance on a series of memory and analytic tasks declines sharply after age 60. Part of the

reason for this may be the rise in incidence of dementia with age; starting at age 60, dementia

rates roughly double every five years (Fratiglioni et al., 1999). A recent study by Agarwal et al.

(2006) shows that in ten different contexts, ranging from credit card interest payments to

mortgages to small business loans, the elderly pay higher fees and face higher interest rates than

middle-aged consumers. These types of findings raise particular concern about choice in the Part

D context.

Previous Studies of Part D Choice

       We are aware of only three previous studies of these issues in the context of Part D. The

first is a set of studies by Dan McFadden and colleagues, as summarized in McFadden (2006).

These researchers surveyed a set of elders about their plans for enrolling in Part D programs, and
                                                  8


evaluate whether enrollment intentions in the plan were “rational” given the penalties for delay.

They find that 71% of potential enrollees were making the appropriate decision (under various

assumptions about discount rates, etc.), while 10% of enrollees did not intend to enroll when it

would be in their interests to do so, and 19% intended enroll when it would be in their interest to

delay. Thus, for most potential enrollees, the decision over whether to enroll seems to be made

rationally.

        Their findings are less sanguine, however, for choice of Part D plan. This survey offered

individuals a choice of the standard plan described above versus alternatives that provide

different levels of insurance coverage (e.g. catastrophic only, complete coverage, etc.), with

corresponding actuarially fair premiums. They find that only about 36% of enrollees choose the

cost-minimizing plan, and they do not place much value on the insurance aspects of more

comprehensive plans. They conclude that “consumers are likely to have difficulty choosing

among plans to fine-tune their prescription drug coverage, and do not seem to be informed about

or attuned to the insurance feature of Part D plans.”

        While this is an interesting set of findings, it provides only a preliminary look at the

crucial issue of plan choice. These conclusions are based on data which do not contain precise

detail about the prescription drugs used by individuals; assumptions about utilization are made

using aggregate imputations from other sources. Moreover, this is based on hypothetical choices

across a set of non-existing plans; individuals may become educated about the program when

they are actually faced with plan choices. Thus, the failures of choice documented by McFadden

(2006) may not hold when we use data on actual individual utilization and choices.

        A recent paper by Lucarelli, Prince and Simon (2008) uses aggregate data on plan market

shares to conduct a study of how plan features impact demand and to undertake a welfare
                                                   9


analysis of choice restrictions. They estimate sizeable welfare losses from limiting the option set

facing seniors. But they do so in a framework which assumes that seniors are choosing

optimally so that by definition restricting the choice set can only be harmful. Without

individualized data on plan choices, they are unable to evaluate the underlying efficacy of plan

choice.

          Most closely related to our work is a recent field experiment by Kling et. al. (2008).

They examine how providing people with information about the relative costs of each of the

available plans in 2007 computed using their 2006 claims impacts their choices. They find that

individuals who receive this intervention are more likely to switch plans, and more likely to end

up with lower predicted and realized costs. Using our richer dataset on patient claims, we are

able to model the individualized risk characteristics of plans in addition to looking just at average

costs. Our model is also more general in terms of sample and implications. While they

investigate the consequences of one particular intervention on a sample of patients at a single

hospital, our model allows us to calculate the potential welfare gains from reforms which change

the structure of the choice set, and to do so for a large fraction of Medicare Part D enrollees.



                                             Part II: Data

          Our primary data source is a longitudinal sample of prescription drug records from the

Wolters Kluwer (WK) Company. They are the largest “switch” operator in the prescription drug

market: they collect the electronic claims from pharmacies and pass them on to the Pharmacy

Benefit Managers (PBMs) and insurance companies that will pay the claims. After adjudicating

the claim, it is passed back through the switch to the pharmacy. WK performs this function for a

large sample of pharmacies throughout the U.S. Once pharmacies are in their sample, there is a
                                                       10


93% chance that they remain enrolled, so this is effectively a longitudinal sample of pharmacies.

On average the claims captured by the WK system represent almost 31% of all 3rd party

prescription claims filled in the U.S.8 The geographic distribution of these data is very closely

representative of the geographic distribution of 3rd party claims as well; the correlation between

the WK market share and the overall 3rd party market share across each of the states is 0.86.

           WK keeps a longitudinal file that tracks prescription drug use for more than 100 million

persons in the U.S. They have made available to us for research purposes a longitudinal sample

of prescription claims for any individuals age 65 and over in 2005.

These data are crucial because they are the only available data (of which we are aware) that

contain information both on specific drug utilization by elders and on plan choice. Information

about specific drug utilization is key because plan costs vary tremendously based on drug

utilization, as we discuss below.

           We begin with a sample of 2.7 million elders who (a) have a Part D claim, (b) are not

employer-insured, dual eligibles or eligible for low-income subsidies/partial subsidies, (c) have

claims for only one region of the country, (d) have no claims with missing payment information,

(e) are in the sample of consistently reporting pharmacies, and (f) have data for both 2005 and

2006. This data file has a rich set of information about every drug claim for individuals in the

longitudinal sample, including information on: month in which the prescription was filled;

county of location of the pharmacy; a de-personalized patient id which allows longitudinal

patient linkages; patient age; NDC code for the drug; quantity measures (days supply, dosage,

package size); patient and insurer payments; price of purchase; and insurer or PBM name.

           WK has created a sample for us that links longitudinally all claims from elders that fill

prescriptions at a pharmacy in their sample. Thus, there are three types of attrition from the
8
    Figure based on data provided by WK for Q3:2006.
                                                        11


sample. First, elders may die (in which case we still observe all of their claims). Second,

pharmacies may enter or leave the sample. This can be addressed by using only pharmacies that

are continuously in their sample.9 Finally, individuals may switch pharmacies. If the switch is

to a pharmacy within the WK sample, then the company does a detailed statistical match to

ensure that the patient is captured and matched to other prescriptions (based on the de-identified

form of data fields such as first name, last name, date of birth, year of birth, gender, health

insurance id and zip code). If the switch is outside of the WK sample, then the individuals will

be lost to this sample.

        Unfortunately, there is no way to capture such transitions. But we can assess their

importance by taking advantage of the fact that Wolters Kluwer provided us with a coverage

level variable which indicates the proportion of pharmacies in each county which are covered by

Wolters Kluwer. We have rerun our models on the 10% of counties where WK covers at least

40% of all third-party prescriptions, and our results are very similar to what we report below.

This suggests that attrition is not significantly biasing our results.

The CMS Plans Database

        We obtain information on availability of Part D plans and specific plan features directly

from four files provided by CMS: the plan information file, the beneficiary cost file, the

formulary file and the geographic locator file. The plan information file lists plan names and

identifiers, and regions/counties in which plans are offered. The beneficiary cost file contains

copays and coinsurance rates for different tiers of each plan. The formulary file contains a list of

all the drugs that are included on the formulary for each plan. The geographic locator file allows

us to identify all the Social Security Administration (SSA) counties that correspond to different

PDP and MA regions.

       The major strength of the CMS data is that it allows us to fully parameterize any elder’s

plan choice set based on their location. We have used these data to build a “cost calculator” that

mimics the calculator provided on Medicare’s web site. This calculator uses a given set of

prescriptions for a given elder to compute their projected out of pocket spending in each plan

available in their county.

Matching patients to their Part D Plan

       One challenging aspect of the WK data is that we know each patient’s county and the

name of the company that provides the Part D plan that is covering each prescription, but not

specifically which Part D plan offered by that company is covering the prescription. For

example, we know that an elder is covered by a Humana product, but not whether it is Humana

Complete, Humana Enhanced, etc.

       Fortunately, we can resolve this matching problem in most cases by using a combination

of county code, company name, and copayment structure. For each claim and each of the plans

within the same company offered in a particular county, we check if the copay that the patient

paid for this claim matches any of the prescribed copays of the plan. We assign a person to a plan

if most of their claims match to the same unique Part D plan. We carry out this exercise for each

month. To confirm that a person has been matched to a correct Part D plan, we look at all the

months together and insist that a person be consistently matched to the same plan in each month

from June 2006 on, since enrollment into Part D plans was open until May 15th 2006.

       Of the approximately 2.7 million individuals in our sample, 776,118 were matched to

Part D plans. The remainder were excluded either because they had a large number of non-Part
                                                          13


D claims (implying that they have some other form of coverage), because they had too few

claims to reliably match, or because their copays were inconsistent with the copays listed for Part

D plans in their region.

         Of the matched individuals, 57.1% were uniquely matched to a Part D plan, 42.9% were

multiply matched (meaning that more than one Part D plan was consistent with their copays).

While the unique matches are clear, excluding multiple matches leads us to misstate the

proportion of enrollment in some plans. This problem is especially severe among Humana plans

because Humana offers several plans which differ only in the deductible and donut hole coverage

and thus cannot generally be distinguished on the basis of copays. While comprising 20% of all

matches, Humana plans are only 10% of unique matches. To deal with this problem, we include

both unique and multiple matches, with multiple matches randomly assigned to one of the plans

to which they are matched with probability equal to the proportion of total national enrollment in

that plan in 2006.10 In fact, if we restrict only to unique matches, our results are considerably

stronger (e.g. the anomalies we document below are heightened as are the utility gains from

restricting the choice set).11

Construction of Out of Pocket Cost Variables

         The total enrollee costs of Part D can be decomposed into premiums, which are known

for certain at the time of plan choice, and the distribution of out of pocket costs given the

information available at the time when plans are chosen.                 Our focus is on estimating the

distribution of costs given all of the information potentially available to individuals at the time

10
  Regional enrollment figures are not available at the plan level in 2006 for most plans.
11
  One might still worry that if we include all matches our results are driven by misassignment of multiple matches,
while if we include just unique matches our results are driven by selecting for plans which are easier to match
(although it seems unlikely that both issues would coincidentally lead to the same estimates). To deal with this
objection, we estimated an earlier version of our models using the full sample of unique and multiple matches and
the correct likelihood function given the random assignment of multiple matches (following Hausman et. al. 1997).
This correction appears to make little difference, in part due to the fact that most multiple matches could be assigned
with a high level of confidence.
                                                  14


when they make their choice. There are three reasons that estimating this distribution is

challenging: first, we only observe realized out of pocket costs for the plan in which an

individual is enrolled; second, we observe only a single realization of out of pocket costs for

each individual (making it impossible to compute a variance measure); and third, we do not

observe all of the information available to individuals at the time when they make their choice.

       To handle the first difficulty, we assume that the set of 2006 claims is fixed and would

remain constant had the individual in question chosen a different plan; that is, we assume no

moral hazard. This assumption allows us to use the calculator to determine what each

individual’s realized costs would be for each plan in their choice set. Given typical estimates of

the elasticity of prescription drug utilization in the range of 0.2 to 0.5, and considering that this

would only impact our results to the extent that individuals have sufficient foresight to take into

account future utilization effects in their plan choices, this is a fairly innocuous assumption. A

formal model and empirical results are provided to justify this claim in Appendix A.

       To handle the second difficulty, we sample realized costs from 200 individuals who are

“identical” to the individual in question at the time when the plan choice is made. In practice, we

define “identical” as individuals with the same decile of 2005 drug expenditures, 2005 days

supply of branded drugs and 2005 days supply of generic drugs; after extensive searching, we

found that this combination provided the best prediction of 2006 prescription drug spending

based on 2005 characteristics. We therefore assign each individual to one of 1000 cells

demarcated by the interacted deciles of these measures. We restrict our sample to individuals for

whom there are at least 200 other individuals in their cell, and we use these 200 individuals in

each cell to compute both our rational expectations measure of utilization in 2006 (described

below) and our variance measure.
                                                  15


       The third difficulty is that individuals may actually know more than can be predicted

given 2005 costs at the time when they make their plan choices. Intuitively, we can attempt to

determine whether individuals know more than can be predicted given 2005 costs by analyzing

whether their choices are sensitive to the component of the variation in realized costs across

plans which cannot be predicted given 2005 characteristics. We develop a formal model of this

approach in Part V.

Final Sample Creation

       Under Part D individuals could enroll not only in a stand alone PDP plan, but also in a

more comprehensive MA plan; we distinguish between individuals matched to MA and those

matched to PDP plans based on copay and exclude the former. We focus just on PDP plans (and

therefore, just on individuals who chose PDP plans) because MA plans involve broader health

care decisions which are beyond the scope of our data (e.g. regarding HMOs and fee-for-service

plans). This exclusion is justified by the “independence of irrelevant alternatives” assumption

that underlies our logit modeling, as discussed (and tested) further below. We also exclude

individuals who have fewer than 500 observations in their state or fewer than 100 observations in

their brand/state cell to increase the speed of estimation of the model by reducing the required

number of brand/state fixed effects; this restriction has no effect on our final results.

       Our final sample consists of 477,393 individuals. The typical patient in this sample is

almost 75 years old, three-fifths are female, and they have an average of 34 claims per year.

Their total prescription drug spending averages $1711 per year. While some individuals were

enrolled in Part D for the full year, others enrolled as late as May. The average total premiums

paid after enrollment was $287 and the average OOP costs paid out over the same period was

$666. This is the sample used in the efficient frontier analysis below. In our conditional logit
                                                         16


models, we randomly subsample 20% of these individuals for computational reasons. We

estimate the more computationally demanding random coefficients models on a randomly chosen

subsample of 15,000 patients.

         The distribution of enrollees across Part D plans is highly correlated in this final sample

with the national facts on PDP enrollment provided by CMS. The correlation between the share

by brand in our sample and the CMS sample is 0.98, and the correlation between the share of our

sample in the top 10 plans is correlated with the CMS reported share in those plans at 0.89 (the

correlation for the top 100 plans is 0.91).



                                       Part III: Facts on Plan Choice

         To motivate our regression framework, Figure 1 shows the basic facts on the relationship

of plan choice to total plan costs. For each individual in the data, we estimate the total cost of

enrolling in each PDP plan in their county, adding both premiums and expected out of pocket

costs. We then estimate the difference in total costs between the plan chosen by that individual

and the lowest cost plan in their county. For this exercise, we use a perfect foresight model of

expectations, using actual 2006 expenditures to estimate the costs that individuals face in each

plan.

         As Figure 1 shows, only 12.2% of individuals choose the lowest cost plan in their state.

Indeed, on average, individuals could save 30.9% of their total Part D spending by choosing the

lowest cost plan rather than the plan they chose. If we redo these calculations using actual 2005

expenditures, or predicted 2006 expenditures based on 2005 expenditures rather than actual 2006

expenditures, we find even stronger deviations from the lowest cost plan.12


12
  It appears that some plans may have offered low premiums in 2006 in order to entice consumers to choose their
plan in the first year of the Part D program before raising their premiums in subsequent years. This behavior should
                                                         17


         Of course, individuals are not simply choosing a fixed payment stream when choosing a

Part D plan; individuals who are highly risk averse may explicitly be choosing plans with higher

mean expenditure to protect themselves against variance in expenditure. Yet this does not seem

to be the case. Even if we only include plan choices where the variance is non-increasing, over

70% of enrollees could have chosen a lower cost plan, and the typical enrollee could have saved

23.3% of their Part D expenditures without raising their variance.13

         The explanation for these facts is shown in Figure 2, which shows the choice set for

individuals in California. The X axis in this graph is the mean of total costs for each plan, and

the Y axis is the average standard deviation in costs (where the standard deviation is computed

using the 1000 cell method, and the average is taken across individuals). In this graph, there is a

clear “efficient frontier” of plans which dominate others in terms of both cost and variance. This

graph masks considerable heterogeneity across individuals: different plans lie on the efficient

frontier for different individuals, so the fact that a plan lies off the efficient frontier in this graph

does not imply that it is suboptimal for each individual. Nonetheless, most of the plans are well

off the efficient frontier, meaning individuals could have either lowered their mean costs or their

variance by picking a different plan.

         As we will document below, one reason for the large amount of choice off the efficient

frontier is that individuals consider plan characteristics in making their choices – but not how

those plan characteristics matter for themselves. This is perhaps best illustrated by a simple

examination of the decision to choose a plan with donut hole coverage. Figure 3 shows the



not impact our analysis except insofar as there are large switching costs because consumers have the option to
switch plans after each year, but one might still wonder to what extent the above results are driven by such plans.
To assess this issue, we repeated the above analysis using the 2007 premiums for all plans and found that the
average potential cost savings fell slightly from 30.9% to 25%.
13
   The fact that this number is smaller than the 30.9% number is because we are searching for cost savings over a
small set of plans, not because individuals are especially sensitive to risk, a point we document further below.
                                                 18


probability of choosing donut hole coverage, and the financial implications of doing so, sorted by

2006 spending percentiles; the results are once again similar for other measures such as 2005

actual spending or 2006 predicted spending. The bottom line shows the percent of the

population at each percentile choosing donut hole coverage; the top line shows the average

savings for individuals in that quantile from switching from the lowest cost plan in their region

which offers donut hole coverage to the lowest cost plan that does not.

       The plans which offer donut hole coverage actually have slightly inferior coinsurances

relative to the lowest cost non-donut hole plans in the initial coverage range, and so the cost of

donut hole coverage is rising with expenditures until the point when individuals become likely to

enter the donut hole.

       The results here are striking: the percentage choosing donut hole coverage is virtually flat

throughout the spending distribution at around 10%. Even if individuals are willing to pay extra

in mean costs for the protection provided by donut hole coverage, it is hard to rationalize the fact

that the same proportion of individuals in the 10th and 85th percentile of the spending distribution

choose donut hole coverage.



                          Part IV: Base Model of Part D Plan Choice

       In this section, we extend the efficient frontier analysis presented above by considering

several discrete choice models. These models serve three general purposes in our setting. First,

they allow us to control for additional plan characteristics such as plan quality. Second, they

allow us to understand more precisely how preferences combine with choice set characteristics

so we can forecast how individuals might choose in counterfactual choice environments. Third,

they allow us to quantify the welfare consequences of choices.
                                                                 19


          We begin by specifying a CARA utility model with normally distributed costs 𝐶 and

constant wealth 𝑊:

            𝑈 𝐶 = − exp −𝛾 𝑊 − 𝐶                   where 𝐶~𝑁 𝜇, 𝜎 2                                    (1)

In this case, indirect utility is given by:

                                         1
            𝑢 𝜇, 𝜎 2 = 𝐸𝑈 𝐶 = −𝛼 exp(𝛾𝜇 + 𝛾 2 𝜎 2 )                                                    (2)
                                         2
                                                                                                   ′
where 𝛼 = − exp(𝛾𝑊) is a constant. A first-order Taylor expansion about the point (𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2 )

yields:
                                      ′                      ′
            𝑢 𝜇, 𝜎 2 ≈ 𝑢 𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2         − 𝛼𝛾𝑢 𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2        𝜇 − 𝜇′
                                                                                                       (3)
             1                ′          ′
            − 𝛼𝛾 2 𝑢 𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2 (𝜎 2 − 𝜎 2 )
             2

Dropping constant terms (since these are irrelevant in the logit model), we obtain:

                                        ′   1          ′     ′
            𝑢 𝜇 ∗ , 𝜎 2 ≈ −𝛼𝛾𝑢 𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2 𝜇 − 𝛼𝛾 2 𝑢 𝜇 ∗ , 𝜎 2 𝜎 2                                      (4)
                                            2

We can write total costs as 𝐶 = 𝜋 + 𝑂𝑂𝑃 and since 𝜋 is known for any given plan,

𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝐶 = 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑂𝑂𝑃 = 𝜎 2 and 𝜇 = 𝐸 𝐶 = 𝜋 + 𝐸 𝑂𝑂𝑃 = 𝜋 + 𝜇 ∗ . Adding an error term, we

can rewrite equation (4) as:

                                  ′               1          ′     ′
            𝑢 = −𝛼𝛾𝑢 𝜇 ′ , 𝜎 2            𝜋 + 𝜇∗ − 𝛼 𝛾 2 𝑢 𝜇∗ , 𝜎 2 𝜎 2 + 𝜖                            (5)
                                                  2

          This maps into a conditional logit model of plan choice where the utility of individual i

from choosing plan j is given by:

            𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝜋𝑗 𝛽0 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ 𝛽1 + 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽2 + 𝒙𝒋 𝜸 + 𝒒𝒃 𝒋 𝜹 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                      (6)

                         ′    ′                    1                  ′   ′
with 𝛽0 = 𝛽1 = 𝛼𝛾𝑢(𝜇∗ , 𝜎 2 ) and 𝛽2 = − 2 𝛼𝛾 2 𝑢(𝜇∗ , 𝜎 2 ). In this equation 𝒙𝒋 represents any

financial plan characteristics which impact choice, 𝒒𝒃(𝒋) represents plan quality ratings and other
                                                     20


non-financial aspects of plans (which vary only across brands), and 𝜖𝑖𝑗 are i.i.d. type I extreme

value random variables.

                                 2𝛽 2
       In this expression, 𝛾 =          allows us to map the ratio of the coefficients on the variance
                                 𝛽1


of costs and the coefficient on the mean of costs into the coefficient of absolute risk aversion.

This assumes that wealth is constant across all states of the world: the only risk facing

individuals is uncertainty about the distribution of out of pocket costs. The same expression

would hold if we added idiosyncratic risk that was uncorrelated with prescription drug

expenditures, but it is not implausible that there would be correlated risks: in states of the world

where prescription drug expenditures are higher, other medical expenditures are higher as well.

Such correlated risks would tend to bias upwards our already low estimates of risk aversion.

       We include in our model several financial plan characteristics beyond premiums, out of

pocket costs, and the variance of out pocket costs. These are: the deductible of the plan; a

dummy for whether the plan covers all donut hole expenditures; a dummy for whether the plan

covers generic expenditures in the donut hole only; and a cost-sharing index. The cost sharing

index is calculated for each plan as the average percentage of expenditures covered by the plan

between the deductible and the donut hole. This variable differs from expected out of pocket

costs in that it has the same value for everyone in the sample for each plan, and because it is not

directly impacted by whether plans have deductibles or donut hole coverage. We also include

two measures of plan quality: the share of the top 100 drugs used by elders that is included in the

plan’s formulary and a quality index. The quality index is computed by CMS on a 1-5 scale by

aggregating consumer ratings at the brand level collected along 17 dimensions which are

categorized as “Customer Service,” “Drug Pricing Information” (availability / rate of price

changes), and “Using Your Plan to Get Your Prescription Filled”.
                                                       21


        Identification is a natural concern in this context. All of the plan characteristics included

in our model may be endogenous due to unobserved demand factors, and they may be biased by

correlation with unobserved plan characteristics. To address this concern, we observe and

include in our model all of the publicly available information that might be used by individuals

to make their choices. We also consider models where we control for a full set of brand

dummies, as well as a full set of interactions of state dummies with brand dummies. When we

include brand dummies, the coefficient on the quality index (which is measured at the brand

level) is no longer separately identified although it can be recovered by a GLS regression of

these dummies on the quality variable. When brand-state dummies are included, coefficients on

plan characteristics such as the premium, deductible and donut hole coverage are identified by

the variation across plans offered by the same brands in a given state.14

        Even with these fixed effects, it is possible that premiums are endogenous because they

are set based on brand-state specific assessments of demand conditions. If premiums are higher

in regions where insurers anticipate more demand for their particular plan (relative to other plans

offered by the same insurer), our estimate of the coefficient on premiums will be biased towards

zero since individuals will appear to be less averse to higher premiums. To the extent that these

factors make high premiums appear less undesirable than they actually are, our conclusion that

premiums are overweighted relative to out of pocket costs would be strengthened, as would our

estimates of the welfare loss due to consumer mistakes.15


14
   For instance, in many states Humana offers a Standard plan with lower premiums but limited coverage, an
Enhanced plan with higher premiums but no deductible, and a Complete Plan which offers superior cost sharing and
full donut hole coverage at much higher premiums.
15
   We did attempt estimating the models reported below using two instruments using the control function approach:
these were the average premium for a given plan in all states where the plan is offered (designed to avert local
demand shocks) and a “marginal cost” instrument constructed using the average covered expenditures for
individuals enrolled in the plan. In both cases, the magnitude of the coefficient on premiums increased in the IV
models. We are not confident that the exclusion restriction is satisfied for either of these instruments, so we
continue to estimate the model without an instrument below.
                                                  22


Restrictions on Preferences

       The model laid out above suggests three natural restrictions on preferences which extend

the efficient frontier concept to the discrete choice setting.

Restriction 1: 𝛽0 = 𝛽1

       This restriction states that the coefficient on premiums should equal the coefficient on

expected out of pocket costs. Controlling for the risk characteristics of plans, individuals should

be willing to pay exactly one dollar in additional premiums for coverage which reduces expected

out of pocket costs by one dollar. If this restriction fails to hold, individuals are not choosing on

the efficient frontier: they could switch to alternative plans with comparable risk characteristics

but lower total costs.

Restriction 2: 𝜸 = 𝟎

       This restriction states that financial plan characteristics other than premiums, expected

out of pocket costs and the variance of out of pocket costs do not impact choices. Individuals

should not care about deductibles, donut hole coverage or copays per se; they should only care

about these factors to the extent that they impact the distribution of out of pocket costs. Once we

control for this distribution, these factors should be redundant.

Restriction 3: 𝛽2 < 0

       This restriction states that individuals should be risk averse.

       While these restrictions follow naturally from utility maximization with full information

and standard preferences, the model from which they are derived makes several important

functional form assumptions: we assume that the distribution of out of pocket costs can be

summarized by its mean and variance, that indirect utility is a linear function of this mean and

variance, and that the errors are i.i.d. type I extreme value. In Appendix B, we show that the
                                                               23


restrictions assumed in the previous section still hold even when these functional forms

assumptions are weakened.16 Of course, it is always possible to write down preferences that

would violate the above restrictions, but these restrictions are generally compatible with

commonly used expected utility functions given the observed cost distributions.

Choice Model Results

         Table 1 reports the results from several conditional logit models. Model (1) includes

only the premium, realized out of pocket costs and the variance of out of pocket costs. As noted

in the discussion of the cost variables, expected out of pocket costs – meaning the individual’s

expectation of out of pocket costs at the time of plan choice – is not directly observed, so we use

realized costs as a proxy for expected out of pocket costs. This proxy has noise (where “noise”

includes the component of realized costs unknown to the individual at the time when the choice

is made) and so its coefficient is biased downwards. We address this problem at length in the

next section and show that it does not much impact our conclusions.

         The cost variables – premiums and out of pocket costs – are measured in hundreds of

dollars. Model (1) therefore shows that a $100 increase in premiums leads to a 32% reduction in

the probability that a given plan is chosen, implying an average elasticity of --0.75.17 There are

two ways to interpret the remaining coefficients. First, we can divide by the premium coefficient

in order to compute the willingness to pay in dollars for a one unit increase in the characteristic.

Second, the coefficient itself can be interpreted as the percentage increase in the probability that




16
   In particular, we simulate choices using the actual distribution of costs and several commonly used utility
functions (CRRA, CARA) with varying levels of risk aversion. In some cases, the restrictions do not hold exactly,
but the violations are much smaller in magnitude than we observe when we estimate the model using actual choices.
17
   The implied elasticity varies across plans based on premium level and market share. The “32%” number given in
                                        𝜕 log 𝑝 𝑖𝑗
the text is derived from the equation                = 1 − 𝑝𝑖𝑗 𝛽. Thus, for 𝑝𝑖𝑗 ≈ 0 which holds for a large number of
                                           𝜕𝑥 𝑖𝑗
plans, we can interpret 𝛽 as the percentage change in 𝑝𝑖𝑗 associated with a one unit change in 𝑥𝑖𝑗 .
                                                 24


a plan is chosen from a one unit increase in the characteristic provided that probability is small

(as it is for most plans).

        Two points about the model (1) results are noteworthy. First, the coefficient on out of

pocket costs is only about ½ as large as the coefficient on premiums, violating Restriction 1.

Second, the coefficient on the variance term is negative and significant, but extremely small,

implying risk aversion substantially less than we obtained in the simulations with CRRA = 1.

        Model (2) adds additional covariates to control for deductibles, donut hole coverage,

average cost sharing, formulary coverage and plan quality. Many of these covariates enter the

model with significant coefficients. When we add plan characteristics, the coefficient on

premiums increases suggesting that it was initially biased downward due to omitted variable

bias. The coefficient on the variance term drops even further once we add a control for the # of

the most popular 100 drugs which are included in the plan’s formulary. This suggests that while

individuals prefer plans which cover more drugs, they do not have sufficient foresight to choose

plans which cover drugs which they (or at least people in their cell) might need in the future but

are not already taking.

        Models (3) and (4) add brand dummies and brand-state dummies respectively. The

coefficient on premiums actually shrinks once we include brand-dummies, but the effects of the

premium remain large; a $100 increase in annual premiums leads to a 50% reduction in the

probability that a plan is chosen, corresponding to an average elasticity of -1.17. The coefficient

on out of pocket costs has similar magnitude across all of the models, which reflects the fact that

it is identified based on individual variation. In columns (3) and (4) the coefficient on the

premium is more than five times as large as the coefficient on out of pocket costs.
                                                 25


       The coefficients on plan characteristics are also very large in all specifications.

Controlling for the out of pocket cost consequences, model (4) – which has the smallest plan

characteristics - suggests that individuals are willing to pay over $300 for full donut hole

coverage, $50 for generic donut hole coverage, about $80 to go from a deductible of 250 to a

deductible of 0, about $80 to go from the plan with the least cost sharing (25%) to the plan with

the most cost sharing (65%), and $12 for each of the top 100 drugs which appear on the

formulary. These numbers are not enormous, but they are an order of magnitude larger than the

results in the simulations, and have non-trivial consequences for the welfare evaluation of plan

choice as we investigate in the welfare analysis section.

       Thus, this formal modeling of choice reveals a violation of all three of the preference

restrictions we laid out above. The coefficient on premium is an order of magnitude larger than

the coefficient on out of pocket expenditures; generalized plan characteristics enter the model

highly significantly, even conditional on individual out of pocket risk; and individuals are not

willing to pay more for plans with lower variance in expected spending.



                     Part V: Modeling the Information Set of Consumers

       In the previous section, we presented results from a conditional logit model of plan

choice and identified three apparent irregularities in choices. Our interpretation is that these

results reflect consumer errors – plan characteristics are more salient than are their implications

for the distribution of out of pocket costs, and individuals are unable to compute the

individualized risk characteristics of the alternative plans. In this section we consider an

alternative explanation: we have misspecified out of pocket costs because we have failed to
                                                26


appropriately model the information available to individuals at the time when they make their

plan choice.

       Thus far we have measured out of pocket costs using the realized cost measure

constructed from 2006 claims. An alternative measure that we consider in this section we label

our “rational expectations” measure. Recall that to create our variance measure we classified all

individuals into 1000 cells defined by deciles of 2005 total spending, generic prescriptions and

branded prescriptions, and ran the 2006 claims of 200 persons in each cell through the cost

calculator for that plan. This procedure generates a distribution of costs for each patient and

plan. Our rational expectations measure is defined as the mean of this distribution. Under the

strong assumptions discussed above (CARA utility and a normal distribution of costs), the mean

and the variance would completely summarize the impact of the cost distribution on utility. Our

simulations in Appendix B show that they summarize this distribution well anyway even if these

assumptions are relaxed.

       It is useful to compare this rational expectations measure to the perfect foresight/realized

costs measure we have been using. The latter measure is “too broad” in the sense that it includes

information not available to individuals at the time when they choose (provided that is, that they

do not know exactly what their drug needs and drug prices will be for the coming year). The

former measure is “too narrow” in the sense that individuals may have private information at the

time they choose beyond what can be inferred from their 2005 costs. If a patient learns they

have cancer just prior to choosing their 2006 plan, they would correctly forecast that their drug

needs would likely exceed the average of those with similar 2005 spending.

       We address these concerns by developing a model with which we can identify the

information available to consumers at the time when they choose. The intuition behind this
                                                        27


model is that we can determine if individuals know more than we can predict given just their

2005 spending by evaluating whether their plan choices are responsive to the component of 2006

spending which is not known in 2005.

        Suppose that utility is given by:

           𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝑢𝑖𝑗∗ 𝛽1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                                                  (7)

where 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ represents expected costs, defined as the individual’s expectations of out of pocket

costs at the time when they make their choice (for ease of exposition, we momentarily ignore the

premium and variance terms). 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ is not observed. However, we do observe realized costs,

which can be written as the sum of expected costs and a noise term, defined as the component of

realized costs unknown to the individual at the time of plan choice:

           𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ + 𝜂𝑖𝑗                                                                                     (8)

where 𝐶𝑖𝑗 denote the realized costs of individual i upon enrolling in plan j, 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ denotes expected

costs, and 𝜂𝑖𝑗 denotes noise. We can further decompose expected costs into the component of

expected costs predictable from 2005 data, 𝜇𝑖𝑗 , and the component which is private information,

𝑒𝑖𝑗 . This yields:

           𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗                                                                                (9)

We assume that 𝜇𝑖𝑗 and 𝑒𝑖𝑗 are independent of 𝜂𝑖𝑗 .18 This assumption implies that individuals

are aware at the time when they make their choices of the component of costs that can be

predicted based on their previous year’s consumption. This “rational expectations” assumption

is substantive, but conforms with the baseline rational choice model that is implicitly tested by

our analysis. We discuss this issue further below.

18
  Combined with the additive structure assumed above, the assumption of independence also rules out the case in
which the degree of uncertainty about costs varies with the level of expected costs. We relax this strong assumption
below by assuming only that      and    are conditionally independent given the measured variance of costs.
                                                      28


        If this were a linear model, the assumption of independence would be sufficient to

identify 𝛽1 . This assumption implies that we have a classical measurement error problem: 𝐶𝑖𝑗 is

a noisy measure of 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ . As usual, this problem can be solved with instrumental variables and in

this case, 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is a valid instrument – it is correlated with 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ and uncorrelated with 𝜂𝑖𝑗 , so

instrumenting for 𝐶𝑖𝑗 with 𝜇𝑖𝑗 would consistently estimate 𝛽1 . Because the model is non-linear,

we need to be more explicit about the form of the measurement error to obtain consistent

estimation. First, we rewrite equation (7) substituting in equation (8):

          𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝐶𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 − 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                                     (10)

We assume further that 𝑒𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁(0, 𝜏𝑖𝑗2 ) and ηij ~𝑁(0, σ2ij ). Combined with equation (9), the

normal updating formula implies:

                                   𝜎𝑖𝑗2                      𝜏𝑖𝑗2 𝜎𝑖𝑗2
          𝑓 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝐶𝑖𝑗 , 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁                  𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ,                                                 (11)
                                𝜎𝑖𝑗2 + 𝜏𝑖𝑗2                 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 + 𝜏𝑖𝑗2

We do not observe 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 or 𝜏𝑖𝑗2 . However, provided we assume that 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝑖, 𝑗 =

𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 |𝑍𝑖 , 𝑗) where 𝑍𝑖 are the variables which define each cell – that is, we assume that

there is no heterogeneity in the variance of costs within cells – we do observe 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 ) ≡

𝜎𝑖𝑗2 . This is the variance we construct from the 1000 cell exercise. This still leaves us with a

separate parameter to identify for each (i,j) pair. We additionally assume that a constant fraction

𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 of the variance of costs within cells is due to private information . That is, we assume that

                                              2
𝜏𝑖𝑗2 = 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 and 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 = (1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 )𝜎𝑖𝑗 . As written, this is a random coefficients model with

one additional parameter beyond the           ’s - 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 , the degree of private information.

        How is 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 identified? Equation (11) suggests a simple intuition. We can think of the

                                                                                                𝛽 1 𝜎2
model as one with a fixed coefficient 𝛽1 on 𝐶𝑖𝑗 and a random coefficient with mean 𝜎2 +𝜏𝑖𝑗2 =
                                                                                                𝑖𝑗   𝑖𝑗
                                                          29

                    2
𝛽 1 (1−𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 )𝜎𝑖𝑗
                        = 𝛽1 1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 on 𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 . Thus, the degree of private information is identified
      𝜎𝑖𝑗 2


by the degree to which the coefficient on 𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 falls short of the coefficient on 𝐶𝑖𝑗 . If

individuals have no information beyond what can be predicted from 2005 costs, we will observe

𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 = 0 , and equation (10) will simplify to:

              𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝐶𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 − 𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                  (12)

If on the other hand individuals have perfect information about 2006 costs, we will observe

𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 = 1, and equation (10) will simplify to:

              𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝐶𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                                                (13)

In the interim case, individual’s choose based on a linear combination of 𝐶𝑖𝑗 and 𝜇𝑖𝑗 , and the

random coefficient on 𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 captures the fact that different individuals with the same 𝐶𝑖𝑗 and

𝜇𝑖𝑗 can have varying amounts of private information.

          This model also has implications for the variance term and the measurement of risk

aversion. The measured variance from the 1000 cell exercise 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 overstates the true variance in

costs because some of this variation represents variation in realized costs which is unpredictable

based on 2005 costs but is known to the individual at the time when they choose. Thus, the

correct variance to use in the model is (1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 )𝜎𝑖𝑗2 , the variance of the noise term. To the

extent that individuals are responsive to the variance term, omitting this correction will tend to
                                                                            1
bias our estimates of risk aversion downward by a factor of                         .19
                                                                         1−𝜏 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐




19
  Note that this model does not directly allow for private information about the variance of costs; in some cases,
individuals may learn that they are at risk of developing a certain condition which would require treatment with
prescription drugs. This knowledge would increase their expected out of pocket costs in the coming year and would
also increase the variance in their forecast. The model above does not allow for this type of information; while the
model allows individuals in the same cell to have different values of expected costs based on their realization of
private information, we continue to assume that all individuals in the same cell in the 1000-cell model face the same
                                                         30


         Reintroducing the variance and the premium term, we obtain:

            𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝜋𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 + 𝐶𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 − 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽2 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                            (14)

where the distribution of 𝜂𝑖𝑗 is given by equation (11).

         Table 2 reports the results from estimating equation (14). For computational reasons, we

estimate this model on a much smaller sample by randomly selecting 15,000 patients from our

earlier sample. Column (1) reports our earlier results, column (2) reports the earlier specification

on the new sample, and column (3) the results from equation (14) which allows for private

information.      The model is estimated using the Laplace approximation developed in Hausman-

Harding (2007) with bootstrapped standard errors, including controls for the various plan

characteristics. This model is identical to the model in equation (6), adding the normally

distributed noise term (which is a function of 𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ) and the variance adjustment.

         The results in Table 2 suggest that there is substantial private information: individual

choices take into account about 60% of the variation in out of pocket costs which cannot be

predicted given their cell. The results also imply that our earlier finding that the coefficient on

realized costs is smaller than the coefficient on premiums is robust to any measurement error

generated from the fact that individuals do not know realized costs at the time when they

choose.20 Moreover, financial plan characteristics such as the donut hole and deductible

continue to enter highly significantly in this model. Therefore, two of the major choice

inconsistencies persist even when we model private information.

         Interpreting the risk-related results in Table 2 requires examining in more detail our

assumptions about what individuals know at the time when they choose. If we take the model in

variance. To the extent that this assumption is false, our model could be viewed as substituting the predicted
variance given the variables used to construct the 1000-cell model for the actual variance.
20
   In other words, in a linear context, instrumenting realized costs for 2006 by predicted costs based on 2005
characteristics does not much change the coefficient on out of pocket costs, indicating little bias from measurement
error in our out of pocket cost coefficient.
                                                  31


this section literally, we would conclude that individuals know much of what their costs will be

to each plan in their choice set in the coming year so there is little insurance motive. Under this

interpretation, the variance in out of pocket costs is small for all plans because there is little

uncertainty. This means that any measured response to the variance term would imply high

levels of risk aversion, and that the standard errors in our estimates of risk aversion are much

larger than we concluded in the model ignoring private information. The risk index in these

models (obtained by dividing the variance coefficient by the premium coefficient and

multiplying by 200) is comparable to what we obtained in our Appendix B simulations for

CRRA = 3 with wealth = 17000.

        The results reported in Table 2 are actually consistent with two models of choice with

private information, however, each of which has very different consequences for our

measurement of risk aversion. The first model – assumed in the preceding analysis - is that

individuals are using all available information to make forward-looking choices of plans for

2006, but are simply mis-weighting premiums and out of pocket costs in making those choices.

The alternative is that individuals are not using all available information, but rather are paying

attention only to a part of their prescription drug expenditures. For that portion to which they are

attentive, individuals are rationally weighting premiums and out of pocket costs in the same way

in making their decision. Yet individuals do not respond to variation in out of pocket costs

beyond that portion. For example, it may be that individuals sometimes check whether plans

cover one particular drug they will need in the coming year out of several that they actually take.

For this one drug, they have foresight – even if they do not currently take the drug, they know

they will need it in the coming year and choose on that basis. Nonetheless, they are insensitive

to variation across plans in the costs of covering the remainder of their drugs.
                                                 32


       In Appendix C, we supplement the model developed in the previous section by

integrating the fact that the coefficient on premiums exceeds the coefficient on out of pocket

costs into our measurement of private information in order to capture the possibility that

individuals might be insensitive to a component of out of pocket costs. Doing so, our estimate of

the degree of private information now shrinks to 20% since we are interpreting the gap between

premiums and out of pocket costs as evidence that some costs are unforeseen. This gap – the

“Fraction Observed” – implies that consumers are inattentive to almost 80% of the variation in

out of pocket costs when they make their choices. Because of this, there is now substantial

variation in the risk facing individuals across plans which reduces the standard deviation in our

measurement of the variance term. As in the base model, we measure the variance coefficient is

close to zero since the choices we observe are interpreted as a small response to substantial

uncertainty rather than extreme sensitivity to a small amount of uncertainty.

       The bottom line from our models of private information is that our conclusions about the

gap between the premium and out of pocket expenditure coefficients, and the powerful role for

general plan financial characteristics in driving choice, are robust to a wide variety of

specifications of out of pocket spending risk. Our conclusion about the low degree of estimated

risk aversion, however, is more sensitive to the precise specification of the model.



                                     Part VI: Heterogeneity

       The independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption that underlies the conditional

logit model places strong restrictions on how elasticities vary across plans and will lead to

inconsistent estimates if preferences are heterogeneous across the population. To address this

concern, we assess the robustness of our model to heterogeneity driven by both observed and
                                                 33


unobserved factors. We first note that our model already allows for a substantial amount of

individual variation: we estimated the coefficients on individualized out of pocket cost

parameters. Nonetheless, it may still be the case that preferences vary in ways not included in

our model. In terms of observed heterogeneity, we have reestimated our model for a number of

separate samples: by gender; by age; and by tercile of the 2005 prescription drug expenditure

distribution. In every case, we find that our results are very similar across all samples. In

particular, each of these samples illustrates the three choice inconsistencies documented thus far:

the premium coefficient is many multiples of the out of pocket cost coefficient; financial plan

characteristics enter significantly; and the estimated degree of risk aversion is very low.

       We therefore turn to considering unobserved heterogeneity. We use the Laplace

approximation developed by Hausman-Harding (2007) to estimate a model with normally

distributed random coefficients on all included characteristics. Our goal here is primarily a

robustness check: does accounting for heterogeneity change any of our qualitative conclusions?

       Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. As before, column 1 is the original model on a

small sample. Column 2 adds random coefficients on premium, perfect foresight OOP, variance

and quality, while column 3 adds random coefficients on all variables. Again, we see that the

choice inconsistencies are present even after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. Further,

the magnitude of the coefficients estimated in the model without heterogeneity (which

correspond to the mean of the random coefficients in this model) is not much affected. We do

estimate significant heterogeneity in the coefficients on premium, quality, the deductible and the

generic donut hole term; allowing for this heterogeneity turns out not to have a significant impact

on the welfare results we report below.
                                                  34


       We can also interpret the results in Table 3 as a test of the IIA assumption. To the extent

that any of the coefficients are significant, this suggests that the IIA assumption does not hold

exactly. Nonetheless, the fact that the magnitude of the coefficients does not change

substantially once we allow for random coefficients suggests that this assumption is not altering

our conclusions.



                                      Part VII: Implications

       Thus far, we have provided evidence of choice irregularities and shown that these

irregularities are robust to the consideration of private information and preference heterogeneity.

In this section, we attempt to determine the implications of these irregularities. We do so in a

strictly partial equilibrium framework, ignoring supply side considerations, computation costs

and many other factors; these are discussed at the end of this section.

       We proceed by defining a normative utility function that differs from the positive

function we estimated above in that it satisfies the proposed restrictions on rationality. That is, if

individuals were fully informed, their choices would be given by the model estimated above but

satisfying three additional restrictions: the coefficient on premiums is equal to that on expected

out of pocket costs; financial plan characteristics other than premiums are excluded from the

utility function once we control for the individual’s expected out of pocket costs; and individuals

exhibit risk aversion in their plan choice. We assume that the coefficient on premiums represents

the marginal utility of a dollar if individuals were fully informed (this in turn determines the

dollar value of quality variables and risk characteristics).

       We begin by extending the results reported in the previous sections to take into account

risk and quality characteristics of plans. We define the normative utility function to include
                                                         35


premiums and out of pocket costs (equally weighted), variance and quality and value the latter

characteristics in terms of dollars of premiums. We then ask: if individuals had chosen the plan

which maximizes this normative utility function rather than the plan which they did in fact

choose, by how much would utility be improved? The answer in this model is about 27% of

total costs – this is comparable to the 30.9% we found when we looked only at cost savings. The

small difference is due to the fact that the lowest cost plans also have slightly lower quality

ratings on average.21

         We can interpret the 27% number as telling us the scope of the potential partial

equilibrium utility gains. If there were some intervention that would make individuals fully

informed and fully rational, this is the amount by which their utility could be improved. An

alternative question is what reforms we could use to attempt to realize some of these gains.

Some possibilities include directly providing individualized information about costs (as in Kling

2008 et. al.) or appointing surrogates such as doctors or pharmacists to play some role in plan

choice. We pursue a different alternative here: can we improve welfare by removing some

options from the choice set to reduce the scope for mistakes, or will individual heterogeneity

mean that removing options inevitably reduces welfare?

         To pursue this exercise, we need to forecast choices in a modified choice environment.

We assume that the positive utility function we estimate on the full choice set also guides

behavior when choosing from the smaller choice set. We then evaluate the utility difference

between the larger and smaller choice sets using a normative utility function which satisfies the

restrictions discussed in the previous section. When positive and normative utility functions


21
   The 27% number uses the measured coefficient on the variance of costs which is close to zero. We can
alternatively impose a coefficient which corresponds to a coefficient of absolute risk aversion of .0003 (roughly
CARA = 3 with wealth of 17,000). In that case, the number rises to 27.6%. The difference is small because the
lowest cost plans offer comparable risk protection to the plans which are actually chosen.
                                                       36


coincide, this is guaranteed to (weakly) reduce utility. When positive choice behavior diverges

from optimizing normative utility functions because individuals are confused or not fully

informed, there may be gains from moving to a smaller choice set.

       Appendix D develops the formal tools we use in this section to perform utility

comparisons in a setting where positive and normative utility functions differ. We show that the

expected consumer surplus (CS) from a given choice set is given by:

                                     𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽
     𝐸 𝐶𝑆 =          𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽              + ln        𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽                             (15)
                                        𝑥 𝛽
                 𝑗                   𝑘 𝑒 𝑖𝑘            𝑘


where 𝛽 denotes the coefficients in the positive model and 𝛽 denotes the coefficients in the

normative model. This equation has a natural interpretation. The second-term is the familiar

log-sum term from logit consumer surplus evaluated on the positive utility function: this is what

CS would be if the positive utility function were also the normative utility function. The first

term corrects the CS calculation for the fact that the log-sum term misevaluates the observed

component of CS. For each plan, this correction is equal to the difference in utility between the

normative and positive utility functions times the probability that the plan is chosen. Throughout

this section, the positive model we use is the one given in column (4) of Table 1, which includes

all plan characteristics and brand-state fixed effects.

       A major problem with carrying out this exercise is the role of omitted characteristics in

the logit model. It has been observed repeatedly in the discrete choice literature that assumption

of independently distributed errors leads to implausible predictions of the welfare impact of

additional choices (Berry and Pakes, 1999; Ackerberg and Rysman, 2002; Petrin, 2002). For

example, Ackerberg and Rysman (2002) point out that even in random coefficients models that

relax the IIA assumption, the fact that errors are independent conditional on the value of the
                                                         37


random coefficients implies implausible welfare gains from additional products because there is

no “congestion”; each additional product is assumed to add an additional desirable characteristic.

         There are a number of ways of approaching this problem. One route suggested by the

analysis of Berry and Pakes (1999) is to consider a random coefficients model with either no

error term or with a one dimensional omitted characteristic. While we continue to use a positive

model with the logit error terms included (in part because we think it plausible that there are

more than one omitted characteristics which have some impact on choice), we begin by

considering a normative model in this spirit which excludes the i.i.d. error terms. In this model,

only observed characteristics (including brand-state dummies) enter the normative utility

function.22

         A middle ground alternative is suggested by Ackerberg and Rysman (2002). In their

approach, an additional parameter is estimated to directly determine the impact of choice set size

on utility. We adopt a version of their approach here in which we use the variation in the number

of PDP plans across states to determine whether PDP plans become more desirable as a whole

relative to MA plans in states where there are a greater number of PDP plans. In particular, we

estimate a nested logit model where PDP plans are one nest and MA plans another, and include

as “top level” regressors the number of PDP plans, the number of MA plans, and an MA plan

dummy. Because our information on the characteristics of MA plans is incomplete, we

aggregate all MA plans into a single “outside option” whose premium is given by the average of

the three most popular MA plans in each state, and we normalize all other characteristics to zero

and include interactions of the out of pocket cost variables with a dummy for the MA plan (to

prevent the specification of the outside option from spuriously contributing to the identification

22
   The results we report here are for the model without random coefficients, although including them does not
impact our results. It would be necessary to include these in a positive model which excludes the error term so that
all choices have a non-zero probability of being chosen.

of these coefficients). We randomly select for inclusion in the sample enough individuals who

chose MA plans so that the proportion matches the proportion in the CMS data in 2006. The

results of this approach are given in Table 4.

         The log-sum coefficient lies between 0 and 1 indicating that the model is consistent with

utility maximization. The model implies that the logit errors overstate the utility gains from

additional plans by a substantial margin. If we normalize the estimated coefficient by the

coefficient on premiums, the model implies that the logit errors overstate the utility losses of

moving from a choice set with 47 PDP plans (the number in CA) to one with 3 plans by almost

$300. This value is difficult to assess in the abstract: the utility gains implied by the logit error

terms from moving to 3 to 47 plans are highly dependent on which three plans we choose. We

can however compare this value to the utility gain implied by the logit errors in the context of a

specific restriction, which we now do.

         In particular, we select the three plans which are predicted using the previous year’s data

to have the lowest average cost in each state for inclusion in the small choice set. Note that this

does not imply that these plans are lowest cost for each individual in the state, let alone the

optimal plans when other factors (such as quality and risk) are taken into account.

         Figure 4 shows the “utility landscape” that results from restricting to the three lowest cost

plans in each state if we omit both brand-state dummies and omitted characteristics from the

normative model.23 The utility landscape shows the distribution that results if we randomly select


23
  We still find welfare gains from the small choice set if we include brand-state fixed effects in the normative
model, although they are reduced on average to 13.8%. We feel they should be omitted from the model for three
reasons. Firstly, they generate implausible variation in the value of identical plans across states – the value of the
Humana fixed effect has a range of almost $900 across states. Secondly, they generate implausibly large variation
across plans. The range of brand-state fixed effects implies that individuals would be willing to pay $1700 (about
170% of total costs) to go from the least desirable to the most desirable plan controlling for all financial
characteristics. The interquartile range is well over $600 (by way of comparison, the coefficient on the quality
variable implies less than a $200 difference between the 25 th and 75th percentile plans). Thirdly, there are no
obvious characteristics of plans beyond financial characteristics and quality which we think would impact
                                                           39


a state in proportion to its population and determine the average percentage change in utility in

that state from moving from the full choice set to the smaller choice set.24 We see from the

figure that restricting to the three lowest average cost plans yields increases in utility ranging

from 0% to 30% in most states. The variation across states stems from the fact that the lowest

cost plans are relatively more inexpensive in some states than others and vary in their relative

quality ratings. The average percentage utility gain is 16.7%. If we instead include omitted

characteristics in the normative model, but adjust utility based on the estimated “number of

plans” term, we find an average utility gain of 14.1%. That is, whether we exclude omitted

characteristics or include them and use a revealed preference approach to estimate the degree of

“congestion”, we find comparable gains.

         Figure 5 examines how the utility increases are distributed across the population. We see

from these figures that the potential gains from moving to a small choice set are not evenly

distributed across people: welfare increases for about 50% of the population, decreases for about

32% and remains constant for about 18%.

         A priori, one might expect that any reduction in utility from this policy would arise due to

individuals purchasing an insufficient amount of insurance. In fact, however, we find that the

plans chosen in the small choice set offer slightly better risk protection on average than the plans

which are chosen in the full choice set. Because of this, we find that the average welfare gains

are actually larger if we impose more substantial risk aversion than we estimated in our model.

The fact that we exclude the lone plan which offers full coverage in the donut hole does



individuals if they were perfectly rational and fully informed. That is, while individuals may (even rationally)
decide to choose the AARP plan because they believe AARP will treat them well and because they are unable to
fully evaluate the implications of plan characteristics for their financial well-being, in light of the fact that we can
make this evaluation, we should no longer count the AARP fixed effect as part of welfare if it was only a heuristic
for factors that we do observe.
24
   We report the results in this form to highlight the fact that we are choosing a different three plans in each state.
                                                  40


adversely impact some of the highest cost individuals. But the fact that all individuals are

insured against catastrophic expenditures with only a modest co-insurance rate (once the donut

hole ends) mitigates any utility losses from this exclusion.

        As noted at the start of this section, these results are subject to a number of caveats. Most

importantly, we ignore general equilibrium considerations. We do so because of uncertainty

about how to specify the institutional structure following a reform which reduced the size of the

choice set. Of course, there are possible reforms which would preserve the competitive nature of

the bidding process while reducing the number of plans ultimately offered to consumers, such as

first stage bidding across plans to offer one of a limited set of plan structures. Our results are

also driven in part by the fact that the three lowest cost plans in each choice set are also among

the best plans in terms of average utility all things considered. If we select three random plans in

each choice set, we find welfare losses from restricting choice.

        On the demand side, our analysis assumes that the estimated choice process is fixed. We

assume that individuals choose according to the same positive utility function regardless of the

size of the choice set – any utility increases from smaller choice sets arise because there is less

scope for error. If individuals are in fact better able to evaluate alternatives in a smaller choice

set, then our analysis would understate the potential gains. Moreover, surveys indicate that

elders spend an average of 3 hours selecting their Part D plan (Kling et. al. 2008), so the dollar

value of the hours saved by dramatically simplifying the choice process may be non-trivial as

well.

                                       Part VIII: Conclusion

        The new delivery mechanism for a public insurance benefit introduced by the Medicare

Part D program is a radical departure from the traditional public insurance model – and an
                                                 41


exciting opportunity to understand the role of choice in the delivery of public insurance. Using a

unique data set we have provided the first evidence on the efficacy of the choices made by

individuals under Part D. While individual choices are consistent with maximizing behavior

such as preferring plans with lower premiums, lower out of pocket exposure and higher quality,

they are inconsistent with the standard model in three important respects: individuals

underweight out of pocket spending relative to premiums; they overweight plan characteristics

beyond their own circumstances; and they do not fully appreciate the risk-reducing aspects of

plans for themselves.

       Our analysis in the last section suggests that given the normative assumptions we have

outlined and given the positive model we estimated in the previous sections, there is substantial

scope for increases in utility if consumers made better choices, and some of these gains could be

realized by restricting to the three lowest cost plans. Our models do not distinguish between the

case of boundedly rational consumers choosing plans they trust as a heuristic given the time-

costs of fully evaluating choices, and the case where consumers simply err in underweighting out

of pocket costs due to a lack of cognitive ability. While this distinction is important for

evaluating the potential efficacy of providing consumers with additional information, it is less

relevant to considering the welfare impact of altering the choice set: in either case, our estimates

imply that consumers would be better off if there were less scope for choosing the wrong plan.

       This analysis is subject to a number of caveats and should only be the first step in a richer

modeling of the implications of choice in Part D plans. In particular, this approach should be

contrasted with the impacts of more benign approaches such as improving the information set

available to seniors and their success in accessing that information set. One interesting question

raised by our analysis is why private firms have not emerged which provide such information.
                                                42


The analysis used here could form the basis of a general equilibrium model which takes into

account the fact that consumer inattention to individualized characteristics may lessen the threat

of adverse selection, but pose new problems as firms choose product characteristics in part to

exploit consumer error. Our analysis underscores the importance of such richer modeling before

the public sector follows this model further, either within Part D or in other public insurance

programs.

Notes: Table shows conditional logit results from estimating the model given in equation (6) by
maximum likelihood. Each column shows coefficients from a single regression. The coefficients
reported are the parameters of the utility function, not marginal effects. Standard errors are in
parentheses. * indicates significance at the 5% level and ** indicates significance at the 1%
level. The first column includes only premium, realized out of pocket cost and the variance
measure. The second column adds controls for the indicated plan characteristics, the third
column adds brand fixed effects and the fourth column adds brand-state fixed effects.
Premiums, out of pocket cost and deductibles are in hundreds of dollars and the variance term
is in millions. The cost sharing variable is computed as the average value of covered
expenditures divided by total drug expenditures for individuals in the choice set. The average
quality variable is a normalized version of the “average rating” index provided by CMS. The risk
index is twice the coefficient on the variance divided by the coefficient on premiums scaled by
100. In the model in the text, this value equals one million times the coefficient of absolute risk
aversion.

Notes: Table shows results from estimating the random coefficients model discussed in the
heterogeneity section, estimated using the Laplace approximation developed in Hausman-
Harding (2007) with bootstrapped standard errors. This model is identical to the model in
equation (6), adding the normally distributed noise term (which is a function of 𝑪𝒊𝒋 − 𝝁𝒊𝒋 ) and
the variance adjustment. Each column shows coefficients from a single regression. The
coefficients reported are the parameters of the utility function, not marginal effects. Standard
errors are in parentheses. * indicates significance at the 5% level and ** indicates significance
at the 1% level. In columns (2) and (3), each set of four rows reports the mean and standard
deviation of random coefficient (and their standard errors). The first column estimates the
conditional logit model on the subsample of 15000 (and is identical to the second column of
Table 2). The second column adds random coefficients on financial characteristics and quality
and the third column adds random coefficients on all variables. Variable definitions are

An additional choice is added to all choice sets and is indicated as chosen for the additional MA

value of premiums for this choice is set to the average of the three most popular MA plans in
the choice set. The values of all other characteristics are set to zero for the MA option. The
model includes an MA constant and interactions between quintiles of OOP costs and quintiles of
variance with an indicator for the MA plan so that the estimation results are not sensitive to
normalization that all OOP cost and variance variables are zero for the MA plan. In addition, the
model controls for the number of MA plans in each choice set. Variable definitions are

                             Appendix A: Utilization Effects

        To evaluate the impact of utilization effects, let us consider a simple model in

which total drug spending 𝑆 is a linear function of the coinsurance rate: 𝑆 = 𝑎 − 𝑏 ⋅ 𝐶𝐼

and out of pocket costs are a linear function of total spending: 𝑂𝑂𝑃 = 𝑆 ⋅ 𝐶𝐼.

        Let 𝐶𝐼0 denote the coinsurance rate of the plan in which the individual was

actually enrolled and 𝐶𝐼1 denote the coinsurance rate of an alternative plan. Thus far, we

have been operating under the assumption that 𝑆1∗ = 𝑎 − 𝑏𝐶𝐼0 and 𝑂𝑂𝑃1∗ = 𝐶𝐼1 (𝑎 −

𝑏𝐶𝐼0 ). Since in fact 𝑂𝑂𝑃1 = 𝐶𝐼1 (𝑎 − 𝑏𝐶𝐼1 ), we have 𝑂𝑂𝑃1 − 𝑂𝑂𝑃1∗ = −𝑏𝐶𝐼1 (𝐶𝐼1 −

𝐶𝐼0 ). Since in fact 𝑂𝑂𝑃1 = 𝐶𝐼1 (𝑎 − 𝑏𝐶𝐼1 ), we have 𝑂𝑂𝑃1 − 𝑂𝑂𝑃1∗ = −𝑏𝐶𝐼1 𝐶𝐼1 −

𝐶𝐼0 . Normalizing the marginal utility of a dollar of out of pocket costs equal to 1, we

have:

         𝑢𝑗 = −𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑗 + 𝛾𝐶𝐼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 = −𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑗∗ + 𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑗 𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0 + 𝛾𝐶𝐼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                    (16)

Our current model omits the 𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑗 (𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0 ) term. This equation suggests that our

current model understates the value of plans with high coinsurances because it omits the

fact that out of pocket costs would be smaller in these plans because consumers would

consume fewer drugs. Of course, so far, this analysis ignores half the picture: the value

of the foregone drugs. This value is given by the area under the demand curve:
                1
𝐶𝐼0 𝑆0 − 𝑆1 + 2 𝐶𝐼1 − 𝐶𝐼0 (𝑆0 − 𝑆1 ). Subtracting this term from the previous

equation, we obtain:
                                                     55


         𝑢𝑗 = −𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑗∗ + 𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑗 𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0 + 𝑏𝐶𝐼0 𝐶𝐼0 − 𝐶𝐼𝑗

          1
         + 𝑏 𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0 𝐶𝐼0 − 𝐶𝐼𝑗 + 𝛾𝐶𝐼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                              (17)
          2
                   1                            2
         = −𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑗∗ + 𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑗 𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0                  + 𝛾𝐶𝐼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗
                   2

If coinsurances differ from the plan that consumers’ actually chose, consumers would

always be better off than we predicted assuming no utilization effects because they are

choosing their utilization optimally.

       What is the magnitude of this coefficient? The elasticity of spending with respect
                                                     1
                                       𝜕 ln 𝑆            𝜕𝑆   𝑏
to the coinsurance rate is given by:            = 𝜕𝐶𝐼
                                                  𝑆
                                                      = −𝑆
                                        𝜕𝐶𝐼

so 𝑏 = −𝑆𝜖. For 𝑏 approximately -0.2 and 𝑆 approximately 1400 (the mean found in our

data over the Part D enrollment period), this gives 𝑏 = 280 if individuals fully internalize

the impact of utilization effects on their plan choices. The magnitude of the omitted

term is extremely small: even if an individual is considering switching from a plan with

30% coinsurances to one with 75% coinsurances (moving from the 1st to the 99th

percentile of what is observed in the data), the welfare difference due to utilization effects
                     1
would be only $21 (2 ⋅ 280 ⋅ .75 ⋅. 452 ). By contrast, the coefficient on cost sharing we

estimate in the data implies that, controlling for the individual financial implications of

plan choice, individuals would be willing to pay between $50 and $200 for an equivalent

increase in coinsurances (dividing the estimated coefficient on cost sharing in our models

by the coefficient on premiums and multiplying by 100 gives the dollar value of

increasing cost sharing from 0% to 100%).

       While it is difficult to analytically sign any bias from omitting the utilization

effect term, we can directly include this term to determine whether it has any impact on
                                                     56


our estimates. This exercise shows the impact it would have on our estimates if we

assumed that individuals did fully incorporate utilization effects, in contrast to our current

analysis where we assume that they lack sufficient foresight to take them into account.

Note that we cannot directly estimate the coefficient on this term because the value of the

term itself depends on which outcome was chosen. Instead, we include the term
                   2
𝐶𝐼𝑗 𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0          constraining the coefficient to be 140 times the coefficient on a dollar of

                                 1
premiums (our estimate of 2 𝑏 above) and evaluate whether this impacts the other

coefficients in our model.25 Doing so, we find almost no impact on our results. The only

noticeable change is an increase by 25% in the coefficient on cost-sharing, implying that

individuals overvalue cost sharing slightly more than we had estimated in the absence of

utilization effects.




25
   Note that even if the functional form assumptions made in this section are inexact, we could interpret this
term as an attempt to capture parametrically the fact that with utilization effects, plans with different
coinsurances become relatively more desirable than we give them credit for being because individuals can
reoptimize.

                                        Appendix B: A Simulation Exercise

            In this section we demonstrate that the choice restrictions we test in our

conditional logit model would be satisfied by a broad range of generalized utility

functions. We start by considering CARA and CRRA utility functions with a range of

values for risk aversion. We then take the cost distributions generated from the Part D

data for each plan and simulate individuals’ choices using the assumed utility function.

Finally, we estimate the conditional logit model using these simulated choices and check

whether the restrictions considered above hold. We add a small amount of noise to each

observation so that the coefficients are identified at small levels of risk aversion.26 The

results of this exercise are reported in Appendix Table 1.

            The CRRA utility function is evaluated at wealth $17,000, the median financial

wealth of those age 65-74 in 2004 (EBRI, 2005). This is a conservative assumption

which will tend to increase the curvature – and thus the degree of misspecification (it is

especially conservative given that our analysis excludes individuals eligible for low-

income subsidies). The absolute magnitude of the coefficients is determined by the

amount of added noise (since this is the only omitted factor). A more informative

measure is the size of each coefficient relative to the coefficient on premiums: this

measure gives the dollar value of a one unit change in the included variable.

            Regarding the first restriction, we see that, provided risk aversion is not too large

(CRRA < 3, CARA < .0001), the coefficient on premiums equals the coefficient on OOP

costs, and the two are very comparable in magnitude even at more extreme levels of risk

aversion. The second restriction appears to hold roughly over the same range: the plan

characteristics are insignificant controlling for the mean and variance of out of pocket
26
     The standard deviation of the noise to 1/20th of the interquartile range of utility.
                                             58


costs provided CRRA < 3 and CARA < .003. Even in the cases when they are

significant, they are small in magnitude relative to premiums. Dividing the coefficient on

each variable by the coefficient on premiums gives the dollar value of a 1 unit increase in

the variable. In the CRRA = 10 case, the results would imply that individuals are willing

to pay $9 for (full) donut hole coverage, would have to be paid $22 to go from a 0

deductible to a $250 deductible, and would have to be paid $8 to accept generic donut

hole coverage (since these values are driven entirely by misspecification there is no

reason the signs should be sensible). The third restriction is satisfied in the sense that we

estimate risk aversion in all cases when the coefficient of risk aversion is greater than 0.

The “risk index” is obtained by dividing two times the coefficient on the variance term by

the coefficient on premiums. We showed above that with CARA utility and normal

noise, this index should approximate to (106 times) the coefficient of absolute risk

aversion. We see in Appendix Table 1 that this approximation seems to get things

roughly correct in our sample (despite the fact that costs are non-normal), although it

begins to break down when risk aversion is grows very large.

maximum likelihood using simulated choices. Each column shows coefficients from a single
regression. The coefficients reported are the parameters of the utility function, not marginal
effects. Standard errors are in parentheses. * indicates significance at the 5% level and **
indicates significance at the 1% level. The sample differs slightly from that in Table 1 because
individuals with greater than 17000 in total costs for any plan are dropped. All simulated
choices are based on the cost distribution generated from the realized costs of 200 individuals in
the same decile of 2005 total costs, decile of 2005 total days supply of branded drugs and decile
of 2005 days supply of generic drugs. The first three columns compute expected utility using a
CRRA utility function with wealth of 17000 and the indicated coefficient of relative risk aversion,
assuming that individuals select the choice which maximizes expected utility. The final three
columns compute expected utility using a CARA utility function with the indicated coefficient of
absolute risk aversion. Variable definitions are otherwise identical to Table 1.

              Appendix C: Modeling Unknown Component of Spending

       As discussed in the text, the results of our private information model are

consistent with two very different normative models of choice with private information.

The first is that individuals are using all available information to make forward-looking

choices of plans for 2006, but are simply mis-weighting premiums and out of pocket

costs in making those choices. The alternative is that individuals are not using all

available information, but rather are paying attention only to a part of their prescription

drug expenditures. For that portion to which they are attentive, individuals are rationally

weighting premiums and out of pocket costs in the same way in making their decision.

Yet individuals do not respond to variation in out of pocket costs beyond that portion.

       To address this point, we make two changes to the model. First, we allow for a

component of predicted costs which – while it can be predicted given 2005 characteristics

– is still unknown to individuals at the time when they make their choice. Since

previously we allowed the coefficient on predicted costs to fall short of the coefficient on

premiums, this modification just allows for heterogeneity across individuals in the

portion of the variance in predicted out of pocket costs which is observed. Second, we

estimate the degree of private information by assuming that if OOP costs were fully

observable, it would be weighted identically with 𝜋𝑖𝑗 in patients’ utility functions.

Conceptually, the estimates in the previous section apply to the case where the small

coefficient on OOP costs reflects misweighting even though out of pocket costs are

known (so there is no uncertainty), whereas the estimates in this section apply to the case

where a component of out of pocket costs remains unknown. We must distinguish these
                                                   61


two cases to determine the appropriate variance in out of pocket costs for each

alternative.

        We begin by decomposing realized costs into predicted costs and the component

which cannot be predicted given 2005 characteristics:

          𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖𝑗 + 𝜈𝑖𝑗                                                                               (18)

Formerly, we assumed 𝜈𝑖𝑗 = 𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 and attempted to determine the magnitude of the

component of 𝑣𝑖𝑗 that was observable relative to 𝜇𝑖𝑗 which we assume was fully

observable. In this model, we make an analogous decomposition, but we write 𝜈𝑖𝑗 =

𝜂𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 to distinguish 𝑒𝑖𝑗 , which is the degree of private information assuming

individuals are aware of predicted out of pocket costs from 𝜂𝑖𝑗 , which is identified

assuming individuals are fully aware only of premiums. We also decompose predicted

costs so that 𝜇𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 where 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁(0, 𝛼𝜇𝑖𝑗2 𝜎𝜇2 ) and 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁(0, 1 − 𝛼 𝜇𝑖𝑗2 𝜎𝜇2 ),

where 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is the component of predicted costs known to the individual at the time of

choice, and 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is the residual component. The variance of 𝜇𝑖𝑗 captures the degree of

heterogeneity in the amount of information possessed by individuals. If this variance is

large, then the same observed predicted costs might correspond to very different observed

predicted costs across individuals and plans. We assume that this variance is proportional

to 𝜇𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖 . This allows for the fact that information about drugs has a multiplicative

flavor: the information that a plan covers certain drugs has a larger impact on your

choices if you consume more of those drugs or if those drugs are more costly.27 The




27
 The multiplicative model is also easier to estimate because it generates a random coefficients model
where the random coefficient has fixed mean and variance across plans for a given individual.
                                                 62


constant 𝜎𝜇2 which determines the degree of heterogeneity in information about predicted

costs across individuals and plans is estimated.

        Define (positive) utility as:

         𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝜋𝑗 𝛽0 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ 𝛽0 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                          (19)

where 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ = 𝜇𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 is the component of out of pocket costs known to the individual at

the time of choice. Substituting in for 𝜇𝑖𝑗∗ , we obtain:

         𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝜋𝑗 𝛽0 + 𝐶𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 − 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                         (20)

As before, we apply the normal updating formula and obtain:

                                  𝜎𝑖𝑗2                      𝜏𝑖𝑗2 𝜎𝑖𝑗2
         𝑓 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝐶𝑖𝑗 , 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁                  𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ,                                      (21)
                               𝜎𝑖𝑗2 + 𝜏𝑖𝑗2                 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 + 𝜏𝑖𝑗2

And:

         𝑓 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝐶𝑖𝑗 , 𝜇𝑖𝑗 ~𝑁     1 − 𝛼 (𝜇𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖 ), 𝛼 1 − 𝛼 (𝜇𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖 )2 𝜎𝜇2                   (22)

                                                                         2
As before, we assume that 𝜏𝑖𝑗2 = 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 and 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 = (1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 )𝜎𝑖𝑗 . As noted, we have

now assumed that the coefficient on the observed portion of OOP costs is 𝛽0 , the same as

the coefficient on premiums. The fact that the observed coefficient on realized costs is

less than 𝛽0 in the original conditional logit model is rationalized by two factors: first,

part of predicted costs is unobserved (the 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 term) and second, part of the difference

between realized and predicted costs is unobserved (the 𝜂𝑖𝑗 𝛽0 term). Note that we can

interpret the 𝜇𝑖𝑗 term as a random coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖 with mean 𝛽0 1 − 𝛼 and

variance 𝛽0 𝛼 1 − 𝛼 𝜎𝜇2 .
                                             63


       In both cases, we determine the portion of the variance explained by the

unobserved factor by determining magnitude of the coefficient relative to the magnitude

of the coefficient on premiums. 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 is now defined so that the coefficient on

𝐶𝑖𝑗 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is 𝛽0 1 − 𝜏𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐 . Likewise, 𝛼 is identified by the fact that the coefficient on

is 𝛽0 1 − 𝛼 .

       Appendix Table 2 reports the results from estimation of this model. A few points

are notable. First, our estimate of the degree of private information now shrinks to 20%

since we are interpreting the gap between premiums and out of pocket costs as evidence

that some costs are unforeseen. This gap – the “Fraction Observed” – implies that almost

consumers are inattentive to almost 80% of the variation in out of pocket costs when they

make their choices. Because of this, there is now substantial variation in the risk facing

individuals across plans which reduces the standard deviation in our measure of the

variance term, which we now measure to be close to zero (the point estimate is very small

but would actually indicate risk-loving behavior). This model controls more flexibly

than previous models for the full impact of out of pocket costs on choice (taking into

account both heterogeneity in the degree of private information and in the fraction of

predicted out of pocket costs which is observed). The fact that the magnitude of the

premium coefficient increases by about .2 suggests that this coefficient was previously

biased downwards by the failure to adequately account for this heterogeneity.

Notes: Table compares conditional logit results with results from estimating the random
coefficients model given in equations (20), (21) and (22) using the Laplace approximation to the
likelihood function developed by Hausman and Harding (2007) with bootstrapped standard
errors. Each column shows coefficients from a single regression. The coefficients reported are
the parameters of the utility function, not marginal effects. Standard errors are in parentheses.
* indicates significance at the 5% level and ** indicates significance at the 1% level. The first
column estimates the conditional logit model on the subsample of 15000 (and is identical to the
second column of Table 2). The second column again reports the results from the model with
no unknown component of spending (the third column of Table 2) and the third column

estimates the model with an unknown component of spending. The “Percent Private
Information” field corresponds to the variable 𝝉𝒇𝒓𝒂𝒄 in the model in the text. The fraction
observed field corresponds to the variable 𝜶 and the standard deviation observed field
corresponds to 𝜷𝟎 𝜶 𝟏 − 𝜶 𝝈𝟐𝝁 . Variable definitions are otherwise identical to Table 1.

         Appendix D: Mathematical Details of Utility Analysis with Mistakes

        In this section, we derive the formulae used to compute utility when positive and

normative utility functions differ. We assume that choices are given by the positive

utility function:



          𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                                 (23)

Whereas they are evaluated using the normative utility function:

          𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗                                                                 (24)

We assume in all of our models that the marginal utility of income is constant and given

by the estimated coefficient on premiums (𝛽0 ). In the case where omitted characteristics

are excluded from the normative utility function (𝜖𝑖𝑗 = 0), the analysis is

straightforward. Utility depends only on the characteristics of the plan which is chosen,
                                                                              𝑢 𝑖𝑗
and since we assume a constant marginal utility of income, this is given by          . To
                                                                              𝛽0


evaluate the utility gains from moving to a small choice set, we compare the plan chosen

from the full choice set with choices simulated using equation (23) in the small choice

set.

        The case where omitted characteristics do continue to enter normative utility is

more involved. In this case, 𝜖𝑖𝑗 = 𝜖𝑖𝑗 . For simplicity, we normalize 𝛽0 = 1. As is

standard in discrete choice models, we compute the expected value of consumer surplus:
                                               67


          𝐸 𝐶𝑆 = 𝐸(max 𝑢𝑖𝑗 )

              𝐽                                                                              (25)
          =       𝐸(𝑢𝑖𝑗 |𝑢𝑖𝑗 > 𝑢𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗)𝑃(𝑢𝑖𝑗 > 𝑢𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗)
              𝑗


The second term in the summation is the ordinary logit probability computed from the

positive utility. To simplify the first term, we use the fact that if 𝑋1 , … , 𝑋𝑛 are

independent type I extreme value random variables with scale parameter 1 and location

parameters 𝜇1 , … , 𝜇𝑛 respectively, then the conditional distribution of 𝑋𝑖 given that 𝑋𝑖 is
                                                                                        𝑛
the maximum of 𝑋1 , … , 𝑋𝑛 is also type I extreme value with location parameter ln      𝑗   𝑒𝜇 𝑗 .

We can rearrange the first term so that:

     𝐸 𝑢𝑖𝑗 𝑢𝑖𝑗 > 𝑢𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗 =

     𝐸(𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 |𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 > 𝑥𝑖𝑘 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗)                                 (26)

     𝐸(𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 |𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 > 𝑥𝑖𝑘 𝛽 + 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗)

Substituting in using the above result, we obtain:
                                                                  68


     𝐸 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 > 𝑥𝑖𝑘 𝛽 + 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + 𝜖𝑖𝑘 for all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗 =


     ln 𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽 +         𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽 −𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽 +𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽       =
                     𝑘≠𝑗




     ln 𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽 1 +              𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽 −𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽        =
                           𝑘≠𝑗                                                            (27)



     𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + ln 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽 𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽 +                   𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽         =
                                                𝑘≠𝑗



     𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 + ln             𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽
                              𝑘

Substituting this back into the expression for expected consumer surplus, we obtain:

                                                 𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 𝛽
     𝐸 𝐶𝑆 =           𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽 − 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽                              + ln       𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽      (28)
                 𝑗                               𝑘    𝑒 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 𝛽          𝑘


This equation has a natural interpretation. The second-term is the familiar log-sum term

from logit welfare evaluated on the positive utility function: this is what welfare would be

if the positive utility function were also the normative utility function. The first term is

the “mistake term”. This term corrects the utility calculation for the fact that the log-sum

term misevaluates the observed component of utility. For each plan, this correction is

equal to the difference in utility between the normative and positive utility functions

times the probability that the plan is chosen.
