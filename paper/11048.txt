Does Food Aid Harm the Poor? Household Evidence from Ethiopia
James Levinsohn and Margaret McMillan
NBER Working Paper No. 11048
January 2005
JEL No. F1, O1

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses household-level data from Ethiopia to investigate the impact of food aid on the poor.

We find that food aid in Ethiopia is "pro-poor." Our results indicate that (i) net buyers of wheat are

poorer than net sellers of wheat, (ii) there are more buyers of wheat than sellers of wheat at all levels

of income, (iii) the proportion of net sellers is increasing in living standards and (iv) net benefit

ratios are higher for poorer households indicating that poorer households benefit proportionately

more from a drop in the price of wheat. In light of this evidence, it appears that households at all

levels of income benefit from food aid and that – somewhat surprisingly – the benefits go

disproportionately to the poorest households.

In developing countries, food aid undermines local agriculture and creates dependence
on imports. Many of the US’s biggest markets – from Egypt to Colombia and Nigeria –
once received large amounts of food aid. The arrival of US surpluses effectively drove
down local prices, undermined investment in farming and created this dependence on
imports.”

Kevin Watkins, Head of Research, Oxfam (The Independent, October, 18, 2003)

“Food aid is a unique resource for addressing hunger and nutrition problems,
addressing emergency food needs, supporting development programs, and directly
feeding vulnerable groups. The United States is continuing its efforts to better target and
increase the effectiveness of its food aid programs, while continuing their fundamental
humanitarian nature.”

Ann M. Veneman, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, (Economic Perspectives, March, 2002)



        Food aid is supposed to provide relief for the poor. Yet, by increasing the supply
of food, food aid may actually reduce prices and farmers’ incomes and ultimately
discourage domestic production2,3 . In developing countries, since the poor tend to be

  Though food aid can take several different forms, some part of all types of food aid (including emergency
relief) is sold on local markets and therefore either competes against domestic production or reduces the
demand for commercial imports (Abbott et al, 2003).


                                                                                                          2
farmers and concentrated in rural areas, most people assume that the negative impact of
food aid will be felt disproportionately by the poor. However, most food aid is a
byproduct of policies designed to aid farmers in rich countries, by disposing of surplus
agricultural commodities. Thus, far from being created to help the poor, these policies are
actually part of the overall agricultural policies of the rich countries. Such policies have
been severely criticized during the most recent round of WTO negotiations, and many
researchers claim that food aid policies are responsible for keeping the poor, poor.


        However, as Panagariya notes (Arvind Panagariya, 2002), the claim that these
interventions in agriculture in the OECD countries are hurting poor countries is not
grounded in facts. Forty-eight of the world’s sixty-three poorest countries were actually
net food importers during the period 1995-97 (Valdes and McCalla, 1999), thus, the
removal of wealthy countries’ subsidies on food products would lead to welfare losses for
most of the world’s poorest countries. This still leaves unanswered the question of what
happens to the poorest members of the poor countries. Within any country, households
that are net buyers of cereals would be hurt by a price increase, while households that are
net sellers of cereals would see their welfare increase with cereals prices. Thus, the effect
of a change in price on the poor depends on whether poor households are net buyers or
net sellers of cereals. Therefore, one way to study the impact of these policies on the poor
is to use the household as the unit of analysis.


        Broadly speaking, the existing research on food aid can be divided into two areas
– research on the disincentive effects of food aid and research on the efficacy with which
food aid has been targeted. The work on the disincentive effects of food aid typically uses
aggregate data to estimate country-level supply and demand equations. These estimates
are then used to derive multipliers for determining the cumulative impact of food aid on

3
  The idea that food aid could harm the poor was raised as a theoretical possibility by Nobel laureate
Theodore Schultz (Schultz, 1960). In the United States, the potential disincentive effects of food aid were
officially recognized by the Bellmon Amendment to Public Law 4803 which sets out the following criteria
for approving a food aid program: “1. The distribution of commodities in the recipient country will not
result in a substantial disincentive or interference with domestic production or marketing in that country;
and 2. Adequate storage facilities are available in the recipient country at the time of exportation of the
commodity to prevent the spoilage or waste of the commodity.” (Amendment to Section 401 (b) of United
States Public Law 480, 1977)


                                                                                                         3
domestic production and trade via the impact of food aid on the domestic price (see for
example Bezuneh et al, 2003)4 . Less work has been done on the issue of targeting, at least
in part because household data on the receipt of food transfers is usually unavailable
(Jayne et al, 2002). The work that has been done typically uses household data and asks
who is getting food aid and why. Our work is most closely related to recent work by
Jayne et al (2002) who study the targeting of food aid in rural Ethiopia. These authors use
nationally representative rural household data from Ethiopia collected in 1996 to study
the extent to which food aid is targeted to poor households and communities. They find
that food aid does not tend to go to the poorest households and that there tends to be
inertia in the distribution of food aid.


        We ask a slightly different question – does food aid have the potential to help the
poor in Ethiopia? In other words, who are the poor and are they selling the items
distributed by food aid programs. In theory, food aid could still hurt the poor if it lowered
prices for poor net sellers of food and markets were sufficiently segmented that it didn’t
lower prices for poor net buyers of food. This theoretical possibility seems practically
implausible for at least two reasons. First, according to Harrison (2002), there is a high
degree of serial and spatial correlation between producer and consumer prices of grain 5 .
And second, though Jayne et al (2002) and Dercon et al (2003) find evidence of imperfect
targeting, they do find that poorer households are significantly more likely to receive
food aid. They also find that women, children and the elderly are more likely to receive
food aid.


        In addition, we use more recent data (1999/2000) and a sample that includes not
just rural households, but also urban households. Including urban households is
particularly important for our study because one of the criticisms of food aid is that it is
used to feed the relatively better off urban residents at the expense of poor rural farmers.

4
  A body of work similar to this although using less sophisticated econometric techniques is reviewed by
Maxwell and Singer (1970) who conclude that price disincentives can be avoided by an appropriate mix of
policy.
5
  One drawback of the analysis by Harrison (2002) and others is that they are based on prices between
major wholesale centers. According to Gabre-Madhin, there is some evidence that markets in remote areas




                                                                                                       4
Finally, we obtain empirical estimates of the likely impact of food aid on cereals prices
using a standard supply and demand framework.


         We choose to focus on Ethiopia for several reasons. Ethiopia receives more food
aid than almost any other country in the world. Food aid reached 15% of annual cereal
production in 2003 and typically represents between 5 to 15 percent of total annual cereal
production (Jayne et al., 2002, WFP, 2004). At the same time, it is widely recognized that
raising the productivity and profitability of smallholder agriculture is essential for
poverty reduction in Ethiopia. In 1992, the Ethiopian government launched its’ poverty
reduction strategy of Agricultural Development Lead Industrialization (ADLI). The
centerpiece of this strategy has been a massive extension program aimed at diffusing
agricultural technology dubbed PADETES for Participatory Demonstration and Training
Extension System. Recent work by the Ethiopian Economic Association (EEA)6 suggests
that the results of ADLI have been somewhat disappointing. For most crops, average
yields have remained stagnant, in spite of increased imports of agricultural inputs.
Average farm size has declined and prices have fallen, leaving many farmers worse off
than they were when ADLI began (Hamory and McMillan, 2002). While it is unlikely
that food aid alone is responsible for the failure of PADETES, it is conceivable that food
aid has contributed to the decline in prices.


         Interestingly, at the most recent meetings of the Ethiopian Economics Association
(June, 2004), in a presentation titled “Globalization, Its’ Promises and Perils to the
Ethiopian Economy,” author, Amdetsion GebreMichael claimed that:

“One major problem facing farmers has been the absence of appropriate policy
instruments to stabilize farm gate price and to safeguard the income of small farmers. In
the case of cereal prices, the absence of such a policy combined with uncoordinated food
aid flows, has led to depressed cereal farm gate prices – often to levels below costs of
production.”




are not as well integrated. In future work, we plan to test this hypothesis using HICE data on unit values
appropriately adjusted for quality.

                                                                                                             5
GebreMichael goes on to argue that the downward pressure on cereals prices owing in
part to the uncoordinated delivery of food aid has undoubtedly reduced farmers’
incentives to enhance productivity and increase output. The author provides no evidence
for this statement, but does cite a report by a consultant to the World Bank that makes the
same claim (Harrison, 2002).

        We take the household as our basic unit of analysis and we ask whether
households are net buyers or sellers of the basic foodstuffs typically distributed in the
form of food aid. The first order approximation of the welfare effect of food aid is net
production of the commodity multiplied by the change in the price of the commodity
caused by food aid (see Deaton (1989, 1997) for a more detailed discussion). Thus, if a
household buys more wheat than it sells, we call that household a net buyer of wheat.
Since food aid is expected to depress food prices,            food aid will benefit net food buyers
and harm net food sellers. To determine the poverty impact of food aid, we then classify
households according to expenditure per capita on an adult equivalency basis and ask
whether the households classified as poor are net buyers or net sellers of food.


        Finally, we obtain some rough estimates of the magnitude of the price change
caused by food aid and hence the magnitude of the first order welfare effects of an
increase in the price of food. To do this, we use supply and demand elasticities for
cereals, combined with information on total cereals production and cereals food aid to
identify the equilibrium price and quantity of cereals in the absence of food aid. Using the
equilibrium price and quantity in the absence of food aid and the observed prices and
quantities, we obtain an estimate of the aggregate welfare effects of the price change
associated with eliminating food aid 7 . In future work we hope to refine this analysis by
using the household data to compute regional elasticity estimates and by using regional
data on food aid and food production to compute welfare effects by region.

 The Ethiopian government has no official restrictions on commercial imports of wheat or other grains.
However, Ethiopia imports virtually no grains on a commercial basis. In 1999, commercial imports of
wheat amounted to only six percent of all wheat imports – these were imported by four large food
processing companies based in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia does not import wheat or any other grain on a
commercial basis because transport costs are prohibitive. Thus, “dumping” of food aid will depress market
prices. This hypothesis has been tested and confirmed in a recent review of grain marketing in Ethiopia
(Harrison (2002)).



                                                                                                            6
        Our household data come from two surveys conducted by the Central Statistical
Authority (CSA) of the Government of Ethiopia. The Household Consumption and
Expenditure Survey 1999/2000 is a nationally representative survey that covers 17,332
households. The Welfare Monitoring Survey is also nationally representative and covers
25,917 households. Our food aid data comes from Ethiopia’s Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Committee and the World Food Programme. Our data on national cereals
production comes from the CSA.


        Our results indicate that (i) net buyers of wheat are poorer than net sellers of
wheat, (ii) there are more buyers of wheat than sellers of wheat at all levels of income,
(iii) the proportion of net sellers is increasing in living standards and (iv) net benefit
ratios are higher for poorer households indicating that poorer households benefit
proportionately more from a drop in the price of wheat. In light of this evidence, it
appears that households at all levels of income benefit from food aid and that – somewhat
surprisingly - the benefits go disproportionately to the poorest households. Several
caveats must be kept in mind. First, even the non-parametric regressions are averages by
income category and so could mask underlying trends. The extent to which these
averages reflect the true effects of price changes on poverty depend on whether these
averages truly represent the typical household, or whether there is a significant amount of
variation among poor households even at the poorest income levels. Second, it is
important to note that we do not attempt to quantify the possible dynamic effect of higher
food prices. It is possible that higher food prices, by increasing the incentives to invest in
agriculture, could eventually lead to lower food prices.


        In interpreting our results, it is also important to note that we are considering only
the effects of food aid that is imported into the country and not food aid that is purchased
from local farmers and redistributed. An increasing amount of food aid is purchased
locally. However, the most donors do not purchase any food aid locally but rather
purchase the food from their own farmers for distribution in Ethiopia. It may be that local




                                                                                             7
purchase is a preferable alternative for Ethiopians, however, at least so far, it has not been
deemed a politically feasible option for the majority of the donating countries.


           Recently, the United States has been heavily criticized for refusing to purchase
food aid locally. However, it is important to note that this appears to be a widespread
sentiment not reserved for the United States. For example, in 1999, 663 thousand metric
tonnes of wheat food aid were imported into Ethiopia while only 30 thousand metric
tonnes of wheat food aid were purchased locally. Of the 663 thousand M/T that were
imported, only 21% came directly from the United States – 31% came from the World
Food Programme, and 32% from the European Community. In 2000, the numbers look
similar – 1,074 thousand M/T of wheat food aid were imported and only 59 thousand
M/T were purchased locally 8 .


           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our
methodology. Section 3 describes our data and presents descriptive statistics. Section 4
presents our results. Section 5 considers the impact of food aid on cereals prices and
Section 6 synthesizes our conclusions.

2.         Methodology

         The approach we use follows Deaton (1989) and considers the impact of changes in
cereals prices on the distribution of income. In general, households that are net sellers of
cereals will gain from higher prices while net buyers will lose. Changes in these prices
will affect the distribution of real income between urban and rural areas as well as the
distribution within sectors depending on the relationship between living standards and the
net consumption and production of cereals.


         Many rural households are both producers and consumers of these products and the
empirical strategy takes this into account. Following Deaton (1989) we model the effects
of price changes using an indirect utility function in which the household's utility is



8
    See Table 3 for details and sources.


                                                                                               8
written as a function of its income and prices. (Note that we ignore savings.) These
effects can be summarized in the following way:


                           ∂W
(1)                                 = ∑ θ h ( xh , z h ) ph ,cereal ( y h,cereal − ch ,cereal ) / xh
                       ∂ ln pcereal   h




where, W is the social welfare function, theta captures the social marginal utility of
money, h is household, x is the household's total consumption, z are household
characteristics, y is household production of the food crop and c is household
consumption of the food crop. The general approach is to calculate net benefit ratios for
each household and to examine the distribution of these ratios in relation to living
standards and region9 . As noted by Deaton, higher food prices are likely to redistribute
real income from the urban to rural sectors. What is less obvious is how price changes
redistribute real income between the rich and poor within the rural sector.


       Note that these are only the first order effects of price changes that ignore both the
partial equilibrium effects of food price changes on quantities demanded and supplied as
well as the general equilibrium effects on employment patterns, wages, the price of other
factors and technological innovation. Accounting for these effects would require a
general equilibrium model similar to that employed by Porto (2003).


       Our approach is best thought of as a good approximation to what would happen in
the short run (see Panagariya 2000, Barett 1996). We focus on these short run changes for
several reasons. First and most importantly, using short run changes seems to be most
appropriate for studying the impact of price changes on the poor, who as Barrett and
Dorosh (August 1996) say are "likely to be teetering on the brink of survival" and less
able to take advantage of supply side effects of price changes. We are also limited by our
data. To the extent that food aid drives prices down, food aid may act as a disincentive to
food production over the long run. We do not have time series data and so are unable to

Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy, World Bank 1997.


                                                                                                        9
directly test this hypothesis. However, for all five cereals produced in Ethiopia, there is
an upward trend in production over the period 1980-2000 (Hamory and McMillan, 2001).


      As we mentioned earlier, it is important to disaggregate the analysis. Though the
agricultural sector might benefit as a whole from higher food prices, aggregation could
disguise a highly concentrated intrasectoral distribution of the benefits and costs of food
price changes. Following standard procedure, we use per capita consumption as a
conditioning variable. In future work, we intend to condition on land holdings and per
capita income.


      Our approach is to study the way in which the net benefit ratio varies according to
living standards. The ratio is unitless and measures the elasticity of real income with
respect to a price change. The manner in which the net benefit ratio varies across the
income distribution tells us something about how the price change affects households
across the distribution of income. For this reason, we estimate the net benefit ratio
relative to measures of per capita expenditure or the conditional expectation of the net
benefit ratio given a household's expenditure.


      Note, that we could simply run a linear regression with the net benefit ratio as the
dependent variable and per capita expenditure as the explanatory variable. However, to
avoid the problems associated with specifying a functional form, we choose instead to
analyze the net benefit ratios using the nonparametric techniques introduced by Angus
Deaton (1989). The advantage of using nonparametric techniques is that it "lets the data
do the talking." Readers are directed elsewhere for a comprehensive treatment of the
nonparametric techniques employed here.


      We also estimate density functions of the per capita expenditure (adult equivalent)
according to whether individuals are net buyers or sellers of cereals. In the univariate
case, the best way to conceptualize what we are doing is to imagine first creating a
histogram where the heights of the bars represent the proportion of the population falling
within a given band. The problem with the histogram is the arbitrariness of the choice of



                                                                                              10
the number of bands and their width. Kernel estimates of the density function allow us to
"smooth" the histogram and place confidence intervals around the distribution. In the
univariate case, the kernel estimate of the density function of per capita expenditure, x, is
given by:


                         ∧
                                     1    ( x − x )
                        f ( x) =
                                               n
(2)                                    ∑K                i


                                    nh     h 
                                              i =1




Where n is the number of households, h is the bandwidth, and K is the kernel. The kernel
function K and the bandwidth h are chosen with the efficiency bias tradeoff in mind. A
larger bandwidth will generate a smoother estimate and reduce the variance but increase
the bias.


      To determine whether an increase in the price of food would be regressive or
progressive, we use a non-parametric regression. This regression is the conditional
expectation corresponding to the joint densities computed for expenditure and net benefit
ratios and hence contains no new information. However, the regression does provide the
answer to the question of by how much the people at each level of per capita expenditure
would lose from the increase in the price of food. Since the net benefit ratio expresses the
net benefit as a fraction of total household expenditure, a flat line would indicate that all
rural households benefit proportionately, an upward sloping line that richer households
benefit proportionately more and a downward sloping line that poor households benefit
disproportionately. The kernel regression estimator can be written as follows:


                                          (x − x )                   x − x 

        Our household data is taken from two nationally representative surveys
administered by Ethiopia’s Central Statistical Authority during the period 1999/2000, the



                                                                                            11
Welfare Monitoring Survey (WMS) and the Household Income, Consumption and
Expenditure Survey (HICES). The WMS was introduced in 1994 with the explicit
purpose of monitoring poverty in Ethiopia and is conducted every two years. The WMS
2000 covered 25,917 households and 123,735 individuals. The HICES, also introduced in
1994, covers a subset of the households surveyed in the WMS and collects more detailed
information on consumption and expenditure by product by household than the WMS.
One of the primary purposes of the HICES is to provide a basis for computing national
accounts statistics. The HICES covered 17,332 households in 1999/2000.


          Table 1 describes the size and structure of the two datasets employed to study
whether or not households are net buyers or sellers of various crops. Both datasets
employ standard clustered samples, derived from a two-stage sampling procedure. The
first stage of sampling selected a random sample of small geographic units called
enumeration areas (EAs), or neighborhoods of around 200 (100) households in urban
(rural) areas. In the second stage, random samples of 12 to 35 households were selected
from within each EA, as described in the table. The sample frame for both of these
datasets excludes the non-sedentary populations concentrated in the regions of Afar and
Somali. For details on sample design and data collection, see CSA (2001) and CSA
(1999).


          Ethiopia’s sedentary population is about 14% urban and 86% rural (CSA 2001a).
According to the CSA, urban includes the capitals of Regions, Zones and Weredas, any
locality that is within an Urban Dweller’s Association (or Kebele), any locality with 2000
or more residents, and any locality with 1000 or more residents whose residents are
“primarily engaged in non-agricultural activities.” Our merged dataset includes 8,212
urban and 8,308 rural households. Ethiopia is administratively divided into eleven
regions, called Killils. Certain killils correspond with urban areas, such as Addis Ababa,
Harari, and Dire Dawa. The other killils contain a combination of urban and rural areas.


          Our measures of total expenditure are taken from the HICES. Because the version
of the HICES that provides information on prices and quantities of crops purchased and



                                                                                           12
sold is not yet available to the public, we use information from the WMS on total income
and total expenditure by crop to compute net buyer status. The WMS includes two
measures each for income and expenditure: for each cereal, it records the income in the
past month, income in the past six months, expenditure in the past week, and expenditure
in the past month. We use income in the past six months supplemented by income in the
past month times six when income in the past six months is missing and expenditure in
the past month times six supplemented by expenditure in the past week times 24 when
expenditure in the past month is missing to measure net expenditure. Because the WMS
covers only a subset of the HICES, we end up with a sample of 16,520 households after
merging the two datasets.


        To obtain measures of income and expenditure that can be meaningfully
compared across households, we adjust for variations in regional prices and household
composition. First, we deflate nominal values of income and expenditure by a regional
price index computed by the CSA and reported in the “Poverty Profile of Ethiopia.”
(WMU, March 2002). Next, it is useful to recognize that the same total household
expenditure may feed more (fewer) members of a family with relatively more (fewer)
children (adults) and relatively more (fewer) women. Thus, we convert our measure of
real household expenditure to a measure of real per capita expenditure on an adult
equivalency basis using the East African adult equivalency scale developed by Dercon10 .


        The WMS 2000 was conducted from January to February, 2000. Therefore, the
variable for six-month income covers the main harvesting season, which is September to
December. Thus, the six-month income variable that we use to calculate net expenditure
measures income from the latter half of the year and so includes the harvest months as
well as the months immediately preceding the harvest, when cereals are least plentiful.
Therefore, it is likely to be “representative” of annual cereals consumption. However,
because the period of data collection immediately follows the harvest, the weekly and

Dercon.



                                                                                                         13
monthly expenditure variables may overstate average cereals consumption. However,
since prices of cereals are likely to be lower during this same period, this bias is likely to
be minimal.


        The HICES was conducted to capture the seasonality aspect of agriculture in
Ethiopia. Each household was visited 8 times – 4 times (once a week over the period of a
month) during the rainy or lean season when stocks are low (June 11, 1999 – August 7,
1999) and then 4 times during the harvest period when stocks are plentiful (January 3,
2000 – February 26, 2000) 11 . Monthly totals for the two periods are then averaged to
obtain monthly annual average household consumption expenditure and income.


         Table 2 presents means of the main variables of interest. We use total real
household expenditure per adult equivalent (rexpae) as our primary measure of household
living standards. It is measured as total consumption expenditure per adult equivalent per
year adjusted for regional variations in prices. Not surprisingly, judging by this standard,
urban households enjoy a higher standard of living than rural households. In addition,
there are marked variations across regions with Addis Ababa recording the highest rexpae
of 2,232 birr and Tigray recording the lowest rexpae of 1,310 birr. Using the 1999
average nominal dollar birr exchange rate of 8.23, these translate into $271 and $159
respectively. The poorest regions in Ethiopia (Amhara, Oromiya, SNNPR and Tigray)
also produce the majority of the nation’s cereals. However, these regions are vast and
agro-ecological conditions and hence poverty varies widely within the regions. Note also
that the poorer regions tend to have larger households and that there appears to be no
systematic variation in the age of household heads.


        The second and third panels of Table 2 show the regional distribution of total real
annual income and expenditure from the various cereals and coffee. We include coffee as
a point of interest since it is widely consumed in Ethiopia and is Ethiopia’s largest source
of export earnings. For each crop, three items are reported: the mean across all


11
  There are two rainy seasons in Ethoipia. The main rainy season – meher – falls between May and
September. The secondary rainy season – belg – falls between Feruary and May.


                                                                                                   14
households, the mean across only households who report receiving income from that crop
and the percent of households reporting positive income from this crop. Based on these
data, it appears that households tend to earn income from only one or two cereals,
probably based on agro-ecological conditions. Looking at panel two, we see that rural
households rely much more heavily on income from cereals than do urban households
with 21% of rural households reporting positive income from teff, 12% from wheat, 10%
from barley, 24% from maize, 11% from sorghum and 12% from coffee. For urban
households, these same figures are 2%, 1%, .6%, 3% 1% and .8% respectively.


         Panel three presents information on total real expenditure per household. On
average, expenditures exceed income for all crops and a much larger share of the
population reports positive expenditures on the various crops with more than half
reporting that they spent some money on teff, for example. There is a marked difference
between urban and rural with a much larger percent of the urban population (76%)
reporting expenditure on the most expensive cereal, teff, than the rural population (33%).
The most widely consumed cereals in the rural sector are maize (57%), sorghum (40%),
teff (33%), wheat (32%) and barley (22%). The most widely consumed cereals in the
urban sector are teff (76%), wheat (39%), maize (28%), sorghum (22%) and barley
(14%).


         Panel 4 presents data on budget shares for all households and then only for those
households who report spending anything on that particular item. These figures indicate
that households spend a large fraction of their annual income on cereals ranging from
26% to 12% for rural households and 16% to 5% for urban households. Thus, changes in
cereals prices can have substantial welfare effects and reduction in cereals prices is likely
to transfer real income from urban households to rural households. Only 12% of rural
households in the survey received any income from wheat, the only cereal imported in
the form of food aid, and it is these households that stand to gain from an increase in the
price of wheat.




                                                                                           15
       The fact that mean expenditures on cereals exceed mean income from cereals
naturally leads to the following question - what are the other sources of income in
Ethiopia? Also using these data, Peacemaker-Arrand (2004) reports that rural respondents
predominantly describe themselves as subsistence farmers, with 87% reporting that the
households’ main source of income is subsistence farming. Interestingly, she finds that
the most widespread source of income among these rural households is livestock. Only
4.1% of rural households support themselves with formal employment, while 2.4% rely
on “casual labor.” Moreover, the picture is very different in urban areas where the
majority of households’ report main income source as formal employment, while an
additional 10% rely on casual labor. Interestingly, she also finds that urban residents rely
more on pensions, rent and family remittances than rural households.


       Our data on food aid come from the World Food Programme (WFP) and
Ethiopia’s Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Centre (DPPC). Table 3 presents cereals
production and cereals food aid from 1995 to 2001. Several facts are worth noting. First,
virtually all imported cereals food aid comes in the form of wheat. Second, though the
US provides a substantial share of the wheat food aid (42.5% in 1999), the majority of the
imported wheat comes from a variety of other donors, mostly European. This is notable
because of the European’s tendency to blame these phenomenons on the U.S. Third,
although some food aid is purchased locally, the majority of food aid is imported and the
majority of food aid is wheat. Over the period 1995-2001, an average of 20% of cereals
food aid was purchased locally. Locally purchased food aid consists primarily of wheat,
maize and sorghum and accounts for a tiny fraction of the total production of each of
these commodities. By contrast, 663 thousand tonnes of wheat food aid were imported in
1999 while only 1,114 tonnes were produced locally. Thus, wheat food aid accounted for
more than a third of the total supply of wheat and potentially had a significant effect on
the price of wheat.


4.     Who Benefits from Food Aid?
       Since all imported cereals food aid is wheat, we now restrict our attention to the
impact of an increase in the price of wheat that would likely result if there were no food



                                                                                             16
aid. The averages reported in Table 2 do not tell us anything about production and
consumption patterns of wheat according to income level. We are specifically interested
in the impact of changes in the price of wheat on the poor, thus, we need to know whether
the poor earn more or less income from wheat than rich households. We would also like
to know whether they spend more or less on wheat than rich households. In what follows,
we examine the living standards of buyers and sellers of wheat. We also examine who is
most likely to benefit in proportional terms from a reduction in wheat prices.


           Figures 1 through 3 show estimates of the distribution of real per adult equivalent
expenditure across households that are net buyers of wheat and across households that are
net sellers of wheat. Since the distribution for the entire population is almost identical to
the distribution of net buyers, we do not overlay this density function on Figures 1
through three. Rather, the densities for the entire population are presented in Appendix 1.
Figure 1 is the distribution for the entire population, Figure 2 is the distribution for the
rural population and Figure 3 is the distribution for the urban population. All three graphs
show the estimated density functions of the logarithm of household per adult equivalent
expenditure by whether a household is classified as a net seller or buyer of wheat. The
log transformation is chosen because the distribution of expenditure per capita is strongly
positively skewed and taking logs introduces something closer to symmetry.


           The most striking feature of Figure 1 is the similarity of the two distributions. The
modal net seller is only slightly wealthier than the modal net buyer: modal expenditure
per capita per adult equivalent of the net buyer is 1,096 Birr ($134) 12 compared to 1,211
Birr ($148) for net sellers. Though the patterns are similar, the differences are slightly
more pronounced once the sample is split into urban and rural. Figure 2 shows that for
rural households, modal expenditure per capita per adult equivalent of the net buyer is
1,096 Birr ($134) compared to 1,339 Birr ($163) for net sellers. Figure 3 shows that the
differences are most pronounced for urban households where the modal expenditure per
capita per adult equivalent of the net buyer is 1,212 Birr ($148) compared to 2,981 Birr
($364) for net sellers. Figures 2 and 3 confirm the fact that urban households tend to

                                                                                                            17
enjoy a higher standard of living and that there is more diversity among the urban
population.


       Figures 4-11 show results of non-parametric regressions of buyers and sellers of
wheat by expenditure category. Each graph contains two lines. The line that is connected
by squares shows the proportion of households out of all households that report spending
any money on wheat. The line that is connected by diamonds shows the proportion of
households out of all households that report earning any income from selling wheat.
These are the results of two separate non-parametric regressions where the dependent
variable takes a value of one if the household reports purchasing (selling) any wheat and
zero otherwise and the explanatory variable is expenditure per adult equivalent divided
into thirty quantiles. The bottom third of the expenditure per adult equivalent distribution
ranges between 1,113 Birr ($136) and 2,302 Birr ($$281), the middle third of the
distribution ranges between 2,417 Birr ($295) and 3,718 Birr ($453). The top third of the
distribution ranges between 3,933 Birr ($480) and 10,762 ($1,312). For each quantile,
these graphs tell us the proportion of households that report spending any money on
wheat and the proportion of households that report purchasing any wheat. The graphs
provide more detail on the structure of our data. In Figure 4, we report this information
for the entire country. We then present results for rural and urban populations and for
several regions separately.


       All eight figures show that at all levels of income, there are more buyers than
sellers of wheat. This is important because it means that at all levels of living standards,
more households will benefit from food aid (a reduction in wheat prices) than will be
hurt. This is consistent with the fact that Ethiopia is a net importer of food. However,
even though Ethiopia is a net food importer, it is not the case that among the poor, the
majority of households are net sellers of food. Thus, it is not the case that food imports
benefit only the relatively better off urban population.


       For the population as a whole, the proportion of households that sells wheat
hovers around 10% until it drops sharply at the very highest levels of income. The



                                                                                               18
proportion of households that purchase wheat tends to increase with income starting at
around 25% and tapering off at around 35% until it too falls – though less sharply – at the
very highest levels of income.


       Figure 5 shows that among the rural population, the proportion of households that
sell wheat is increasing in income. The proportion of households that buys wheat is also
increasing in income and goes from around 20% for the poorest households to almost
40% for the wealthiest households. Figure 6 shows that among urban households, there is
no significant relationship between living standards and the proportion of buyers and
sellers of wheat – except at the very highest levels of income where both taper off. A
comparison between figures 5 and 6 yields some interesting insights. There is much more
diversity among rural households and – at all levels of income – more rural households
are engaged in selling wheat than are urban households.


       Figures 7 through 11 confirm that the importance of wheat also varies by region.
Figure 7 confirms the statistics in Table 2 which suggest that wheat is most important in
Tigray where more than 11% of households report earning income from wheat and 49%
of households report spending any money on wheat. Interestingly, Tigray is also the
poorest region and the region from which most of the current government originates. The
pattern of income in Tigray appears to be slightly different from the pattern for the rest of
the country. The proportion of households reporting income from wheat increases with
income and then begins to taper off after the tenth quantile suggesting that more poorer
households in Tigray rely on wheat as a source of income than do richer households –
though the differences are not large (20% vs. 15%). On the income side, the pattern is
similar, with one interesting difference: even among the very poorest households –
roughly 40% spend money on wheat. This compares with between 10 and 30% for the
remaining regions and 20% for the country as a whole. Thus, Tigray is the region most
likely to be affected by changes in wheat prices.


       The next step is to combine the information on income and expenditure of wheat
and to examine net sellers of wheat by expenditure category. Net sellers of wheat are the



                                                                                           19
households that would be hurt by the reduction in wheat prices associated with food aid.
Figure 12 presents these results for the entire population while Figure 13 presents results
for the rural population and Figure 14 for the urban population. These figures are results
of a non-parametric regression where the dependent variable takes a value of one if the
household is a net seller and zero otherwise and the explanatory variable is expenditure
quantiles. The shape of the line in Figure 12 is clearly driven by the households in the
upper tail of the expenditure categories, so we turn immediately to Figures 13 and 14
which are easier to interpret. Figure 13 shows that there is a positive relationship between
whether or not a household is a net seller of wheat and living standards. Among the rural
population, contrary to popular wisdom, there are more net sellers of wheat among the
richer households and the relationship is close to linear. Figure 13 also makes it clear that
roughly 85% of the poorest households are net buyers of wheat. Figure 14 shows that net
seller status among urban households is also increasing in income for the first two terciles
of the distribution. Among the wealthiest urban households net sellers of wheat drop off
quickly. Not surprisingly, a comparison of Figures 13 and 14 show that at all levels of
income, there are proportionately more net sellers among the rural population.


        Figures 15-17 show results of regressions of the net benefit ratio on quantiles of
per adult equivalent expenditure 13 . The net benefit ratio is defined as total household
expenditure on wheat per year less total household income from wheat per year divided
by total household expenditure per year. Thus, a ratio greater than zero indicates that the
household is a net buyer of wheat and expresses the household’s deficit as a fraction of
total household expenditure. These figures show by how much Ethiopians at each level of
living would benefit from a reduction in the price of wheat. Since the ratio expresses the
net benefit as fraction of total household consumption, a flat line would show that all
rural households benefit proportionately, thus, the change is neither regressive nor
progressive. Our data show that a reduction in the price of wheat would benefit poor
households disproportionately and hence be progressive. This is true for the population as
a whole (Figure 15), for the rural population (Figure 16) and for the urban population


13
  Note that these figures exclude households who report both zero income from wheat and zero
expenditure on wheat.


                                                                                               20
(Figure 17). These figures also suggest that the magnitude of the deficit as a share of total
expenditure is fairly large for the poorest households (slightly higher than 8%) close to
insignificant for the richest households (between 1 and 2%).


       In summary, our analysis indicates that (i) net buyers of wheat are poorer than net
sellers of wheat, (ii) there are more buyers of wheat than sellers of wheat at all levels of
income, (iii) the proportion of net sellers is increasing in living standards and (iv) net
benefit ratios are higher for poorer households indicating that poorer households benefit
proportionately more from a drop in the price of rice. In light of this evidence, it appears
that the average household at all levels of income benefits from food aid and that –
somewhat surprisingly - the benefits go disproportionately to the poorest households.
Several caveats must be kept in mind. First, even the non-parametric regressions are
averages by income category and so could mask underlying trends. The extent to which
these averages reflect the true effects of price changes on poverty depend on whether
these averages truly represent the typical household, or whether there is a significant
amount of variation among poor households even at the poorest income levels. Second,
we have not considered dynamic effects. It is possible that higher wheat prices could
increase the incentive to invest in agriculture and eventually lead to lower wheat prices.


       We have established that food aid is likely to help the poor disproportionately. We
have also established that for the poorest households, the deficit is large at around 8% and
so the overall impact of food aid on household welfare can have a substantial impact on
the poorest households. What we still do not know is whether food aid has a significant
impact on prices. We turn now to this issue.


5.     Does Food Aid Depress Wheat Prices?

       To answer this question, we use the supply/demand framework presented in
Figure 18. For simplicity, we assume constant-elasticity demand and supply functions,


                       D=k0 P -ε       and S= k1 Pν




                                                                                               21
where k0 and k1 are parameters, P is the market price of wheat, and ε and ν are demand
and supply elasticities, respectively. Our estimate of P is a production weighted regional
average of wheat producer prices for 1999. Our estimate of the elasticity of supply is 0.45
and is based on Soledad Bos (2002) . Our estimate of the elasticity of demand is based on
Regmi et al (2001), who found that low-income countries have own-price elasticities of
demand for cereals of about -.6. Using these estimates and the observed quantities of
wheat produced and consumed in Ethiopia, we are able to calibrate the model. The
resulting supply and demand for wheat in Ethiopia are given by,


                       D= 41,325P -.6 and S= 104P.45.


        Using these estimates of the supply and demand functions, we find that the price
of wheat would be $295 per metric tonne in the absence of food aid compared with an
average observed price of $193 per metric tonne in 1999. We also find that the price
increase would lead to an increase in producer surplus of around 125 million US dollars
and a reduction in consumer surplus of around 159 million US dollars. Overall, the
increase in the price of wheat leads to a net welfare loss of approximately 34 million US
dollars. There were roughly 12 million households in Ethiopia in 1999 of which 4.3
million reported spending money on wheat and .8 million reported earning income from
wheat. Therefore, on average, the loss in consumer surplus works out to roughly 37 US
dollars per household per year for households that consume wheat and the gain in
producer surplus works out to roughly 157 US dollars per household per year for
households that sell wheat. In Ethiopia, where the poverty line is roughly 1057 Birr
($132), these effects are quite large.


   6.      Conclusions


        The argument against developed countries’ agricultural subsidies is largely
motivated by a desire to improve the living standards of the world’s rural poor. Yet, for
countries like Ethiopia that are net food importers, a rise in food prices leads to a net
welfare loss. This might be acceptable if, in the process, real income were being



                                                                                            22
transferred from the relatively better off urban population to the rural poor. However, our
analysis suggests that this is not the case. Although households at all levels of living
standards benefit from a reduction in food prices, the benefits are proportionately larger
for the poorest households. Rough estimates of the welfare impact of the price changes
associated with food aid suggest that the impacts on net sellers and net buyers of these
price changes is substantial.


        Because of the magnitude of the average welfare effects per household, we
believe that this issue warrants further attention. In particular, it will be important in
future work to confirm that prices in remote areas follow the same pattern as prices in
major retail centers. To understand better where the price effects of food aid are being felt
and how the magnitude of these effects varies across locations, it will also be important
to compare food aid deliveries to local production by region or wereda. A somewhat
more difficult issue has to do with the timing of food aid deliveries. If food aid is not
delivered in a timely manner, it could aggravate the cyclicality of prices associated with
the harvesting and lean seasons due to inadequate storage. The most difficult issue has to
do with the disincentive effects of food aid. Again, given the magnitude of the price
changes associated with food aid and the associated per household welfare implications,
this seems like an issue worth exploring.

Notes: $193 is the production weighted (by region) average of producer prices for wheat
received in Ethiopia in 1999 converted at the average nominal exchange rate of 8.23 Birr/US
dollar. 1,114 is total thousands of tonnes of wheat produced in Ethiopia in 1999. 1,777 is total
thousands of tonnes of wheat consumed in Ethiopia in 1999 or 1,114 plus food aid equal to 663
thousand tonnes of wheat. $295 is the price that would prevail in the market if food aid wheat
were not imported. It is obtained assuming constant elasiticity of supply and demand functions,
an elasticity of supply of wheat equal to .45 and an elasticity of demand for wheat equal to -.6.
