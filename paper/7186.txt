                                                   1. Introduction

           Adherence to fixed parities and convertibility of national currencies into gold served as a

signal of financial rectitude or a “good housekeeping seal of approval” during the classical gold

standard era from 1870-1914. Peripheral countries that adhered faithfully to the gold standard

rule had access at better terms to capital from the core countries of Western Europe than did

countries with poor records of adherence (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996)1. In this paper we extend

the approach developed in that paper to ascertain whether the “good housekeeping seal” was also

an important institution under the interwar gold exchange standard, which prevailed only from

1925 to 1931.

           In simplest terms, the “good housekeeping seal” hypothesis views the gold standard as a

commitment mechanism. Adherence to the fixed parity of gold required that members follow

domestic monetary and fiscal policies and have other institutions of financial probity (such as

having a monetary authority which holds gold reserves) consistent with long-run maintenance of

the peg. It also signaled to potential overseas lenders that the borrowers were “good people”.2

           An important part of the hypothesis is that the gold standard should be viewed as a

“contingent rule” or a rule with escape clauses. Members were expected to adhere to

convertibility except in the event of a well-understood emergency such as a war, a financial

crisis, or a shock to the terms of trade. Under these circumstances, temporary departures from

the rule would be tolerated on the assumption that once the emergency passed, convertibility at

the original parity would resume (Bordo and Kydland, 1995).

    Our approach is similar to but not the same as the signaling hypothesis first developed by Spence (1974).



                                                            2
         An implication of the contingent rule is that the countries which returned to gold parity at

a devalued parity after an emergency would be judged as having “weak resolve” and countries

which never returned to gold or never adhered would be even worse. In other words, following

the gold standard rule served as a signal, other things equal, to lenders that these loans would be

safe, both in the sense that they would not be defaulted upon and in the sense that they would not

be repaid in a devalued currency. Hence they would charge a lower risk premium to these

borrowers than to borrowing countries which were not good gold standard adherents.

         In Bordo and Rockoff (1996) we tested this hypothesis for 9 widely different capital

importing countries. We found that the risk premium charged on loans in London was lowest for

a group of orthodox gold standard countries that never left gold, slightly higher for those

countries that temporarily devalued, and still higher for those countries that temporarily left gold

and permanently devalued or that never adhered. In this paper we extend this methodology to

the interwar gold exchange standard.

         The interwar gold exchange standard generally has a bad press. It only lasted six years

before collapsing in the debacle of the Great Depression. It is viewed as a flawed attempt to

restore the glories of the classical gold standard. Its flaws included the fact that the principle

member, the United States, did not deflate sufficiently after the inflation of World War I to

restore the real price of gold to its pre-war level, hence imparting a deflationary bias on the

system once other countries restored convertibility (Johnson, 1997). It was also flawed because

the United Kingdom rejoined gold at an overvalued parity while France did the opposite. Most

important however was the fact that the US and France each followed policies of sterilizing gold

inflows that exacerbated the underlying disequilibrium.3


3
  Other flaws stressed in the literature include: the use of multiple reserve countries; an incipient “Triffin dilemma”
that the use of foreign exchange as a substitute for increasingly scarce gold would expose the center countries to a


                                                           3
         Despite its flaws and bad press, there is compelling evidence that capital markets in the

1920’s were as well integrated between the core countries (the US, UK, France and Germany) as

they were before the War (Officer 1998, Hallwood and MacDonald, 1998). Also, as we

elaborate below, the core counties and most nations attached the highest importance to restoring

the gold standard. The gold standard which was restored however was based on somewhat

different rules than the pre-war variant. It was a gold exchange standard based on the

recommendations of the Genoa Conference of 1922 in which members were encouraged to

substitute foreign exchange in dollars or pounds for scarce gold, and the central reserve countries

(the US, UK, and later France) were to hold reserves only in the form of gold. Also, gold

adherence was explicitly a part of a package of financial orthodoxy encouraged for all members.

The packages, first imposed as a part of the League of Nations’ stabilization arrangements for the

former belligerents, included an independent central bank, a balanced budget and gold

convertibility. The package was extended through the efforts of Montagu Norman, Benjamin

Strong and Edwin Kemmerer to many peripheral countries.

         In sum, one would expect that the “good housekeeping seal” hypothesis should hold in

the interwar as it did before World War I. Several important differences between the two

regimes however (aside from the flaws of the gold exchange standard) will influence our

approach to testing it. The first change is that the mantle of principle lender was passed from the

UK to the US, so that most lending to the periphery originated in New York, rather than London.

The second difference is that most countries went back to gold at devalued parities. The third is

that most countries used foreign exchange as a substitute for gold reserves.


speculative attack as their outstanding liabilities increased relative to their gold reserves; and a lack of credibility
compared to the classical gold standard. Because most countries after World War I were concerned with domestic
policy goals (the level of real output and employment) their resolve to defend their parities in the face of speculative
attack was weakened (Eichengreen, 1992).

       Section 2 of the paper discusses the restoration of the gold standard in the early 1920’s,

focusing on the diplomatic efforts by the British, and the development of a new order in

international finance. Following the Cunliffe Report (1918), the official position was to restore

the halcyon days of the pre-war when London was the world’s principal capital market. The

efforts to return to gold were strongly supported by the US. The process we describe includes

concerted policies by the League of Nations and the financial powers to stabilize many countries

and private missions to establish central banks. Although the British were the strongest

advocates of a return to the “status quo ex ante”, they were faced with the growing reality, based

on the fact that to finance World War I they had cashed in their overseas assets and borrowed

heavily from the US, and after they returned to gold at the original parity in April 1925 that they

were under continuous balance of payments pressure, that they did not have the resources to

restore the lending network that they had before the war. This was manifested in a series of

embargoes on foreign lending in the 1920’s. For these reasons, and as an extension of its lending

activity to the belligerents that developed during World War I, the US stepped into the breach.

       Section 3 describes the evolution of the US role as principal foreign lender. The rise of

the US reflected both an extension of wartime lending and its emergence as the strongest

economic power. We also consider the indictment that US lending standards were not as strict as

those of the British. Although many of the loans issued in the 1920’s were defaulted upon in the

1930’s, the shock of the Great Depression likely was the main reason for the poor performance.

       Section 4 presents our empirical evidence for the “good housekeeping seal” hypothesis.

Based on data for 40 countries for 9 years, we estimated a pooled cross-section, time series

regression of the interest rates of countries borrowing in the US on several measures of gold

standard adherence (whether a country adhered to gold, whether it devalued and whether it was




                                                 5
on a gold exchange or gold bullion standard) and a set of macroeconomic and other institutional

fundamentals. The results strongly confirm those found for the classical gold standard. They

show that countries that adhered to gold at whatever parity received better terms than those that

did not, and that countries that did not devalue when they returned to gold did better than those

that did. Section 5 concludes.



                                 2. Restoring the Gold Standard

Economic, Political and Social Conditions as World War I Ended.

       At the end of World War I, the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany and many

other nations, belligerents or neutral, had swollen money supplies, large debts, large immediate

expenditure needs and moderate levels of taxation. All of the belligerents had increased taxes

during the war but most of the financing for the war's immense budgets derived from new

government debt and money creation. While post-war expenditure needs were lower, even war

time levels of taxation were quite inadequate.

       Perhaps the most troublesome element affecting economic life was the demand for

reparations. The European Allied victors expected post-World War I reparations would cover

government budget gaps, especially the severely war damaged countries of Belgium and France.

Reparations were also expected to help pay the inter-Allied loans from the United States as the

war’s net creditor. For Germany the threat and extent of the highly disputed reparations clouded

any attempt by its new government to create a stable fiscal and monetary environment for its

economy.

       An important new element in post-war European politics of finance was that Europe's

working classes had become a much more significant force in national politics. All of the




                                                 6
warring states had made great efforts to gain the support of the working classes and their

organizations. Having disproportionately suffered in the war's human toll, some political

accommodation to these new voices was certain. Perhaps as important, the 1917 Russian

revolution established a communist government which openly encouraged the working classes of

Europe to overthrow their capitalist systems.

         Finally, all of the warring states and many of the neutrals had been subjected to

significant wartime inflation. Except for the United States, the gold standard was suspended by

all of the belligerents and many neutrals. From 1914 to 1919 the cost of living multiplied by 1.7

times in the United States, 2.2 in the United Kingdom, 2.7 in France, and 4.0 in Germany.4

Through a variety of currency and capital controls Great Britain had uniquely managed to

maintain the dollar-pound exchange rate very close to the pre-World War I level throughout the

war. However, in March 1919, four months after the war ended Britain was forced to let the

pound float.

Considering the Post-War Monetary Standard in 1918-1919

         It was thus under these conditions that the question of a post-World War I international

monetary system and standard was considered by contemporaries. Although there were a few

dissenting voices, the dominant view of governments and central banks in Europe and elsewhere

was that a return to the pre-World War I gold standard was highly desirable.

         The clear expression of this desire in Great Britain was the Report of the Cunliffe

Committee. The committee produced an interim report in August 1918 and a brief final report in

December 1918, just after the November Armistice.5

                                                          7
         The August 1918 Interim Report firmly held that Britain should return to the gold

standard without delay. The Committee was concerned with the adverse balance of payments,

the "undue" growth of credit, and the prospect of a drain leading to a note issue convertibility

crisis. Conditions which the Committee thought would be necessary for a return to the gold

standard included a cessation of government borrowing, rehabilitation of an effective Bank of

England discount rate, and the restoration of the rules governing the currency and note issues and

their required reserve backing in the Bank of England's Banking Department.

         With regard to gold, the Cunliffe Committee felt that there was no need for an early

resumption of internal circulation of gold or bank gold holdings. Gold imports should be free of

restriction while permission for gold exports should be obtained from the Bank of England.

£150 million in gold would be a suitable reserve.6

         In the event, the British balance of payments and fiscal pressures proved too much for the

rapid implementation of the Cunliffe recommendations. In late March 1919 official support of

the wartime $4.76 pound was removed and the next month gold exports were prohibited by law.

         Coinciding with the movement to fluctuating exchange rates, the Treasury began to free

the capital market from wartime controls. In March 1919 a Treasury notice revised the guidelines

for new issues for the still operating wartime Capital Issues Committee. Overseas issues were

now permitted, preference being given to those new issues whose proceeds were expended in the

United Kingdom, those assisting United Kingdom trade, and Dominion issues. Then, in August

and November of 1919 the Defense of the Realm regulations which mandated government

regulation of the capital market were repealed.



6. The final report was issued December 3, 1919; it briefly reasserted the conclusions of the Interim Report: Final Report
of Cunliffe Com. (Cd. 464).

         Yet, in early 1920 Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, began to use a

policy instrument which heretofore had never been a Bank of England's peacetime policy tool,

that is, privately arranged capital embargoes.7 Its earliest use seems to have been an embargo on

short-term foreign government borrowing, most likely to facilitate the British Treasury's short-

term debt refunding operations.8 This first private embargo proved effective; unlike 1919 and

1921 there were no foreign government issues in London in 1920.9 Interestingly, some European

short-term government borrowers who would have been welcomed in London (or Paris) in the

recent past found funding in New York during the embargo year.10 This development heralded

the shifting of the mantle of the world’s center for international finance from London to New

York in the following years.

         Of the major economies of the world, only the United States was on a fully functioning

gold standard, as it had been, with very limited restrictions, throughout the war.11 Britain was

with the overwhelming majority of nations in the immediate post-war years in carrying on its

international transactions with a floating exchange rate. Like Britain these other nations were

buffeted by variable exchange rates, inflation and difficult government fiscal problems, and this

was a state of financial affairs which did not sit well with their governments or the financial

world.

and the Philippines were on a gold exchange standard. China was on a silver standard.

Brussels and Genoa: The International Conferences of 1920 and 1922.

       In 1920 at Brussels and 1922 at Genoa, conferences were convened to seek solutions for

Europe's evolving post-war financial disorders. At these conferences the first attempts were

made to reestablish the international gold standard. Neither of these conferences led the

participating nations to move together to implement this goal. Yet, the financial policies

concerning national fiscal and currency stabilization which were articulated in the resolutions of

these conferences represented a strongly held consensus view on how stabilization might

individually proceed, if not in international concert. It is also noteworthy that everyone attending

these conferences accepted that fiscal and currency stabilization was a necessary preface for the

currency link to gold. Thus, it seems fair to suggest that the Brussels and Genoa conferences

articulated a path, a set of fiscal and banking principals and practices which, if implemented,

would make the restoration of the gold standard much easier.

       Brussels. It was the Council of the League of Nations that called for a Commission on

Currency and Exchange to meet in Brussels. Given the reluctance of the U. S. Congress to allow

the United States to join the League, American participation consisted of an unofficial observer

from the United States Treasury. Even so, as the principal post-war international creditor,

American views influenced the proceedings and resolutions, especially Washington's negative

view towards the establishment of an international central bank or international credit bank.

Until Allied debts to the United States were properly scheduled, private, short-term lending from

the United States was the method for dealing with European financial needs approved by

Washington.




                                                10
         The resolutions of the Brussels Commission viewed the growth of inflation as a key

cause of disorganization of business, dislocation of exchanges, the increase in the cost of living

and labor unrest, and thus a phenomena making it much more difficult to return to pre-war gold

parities.12 Inflation could be stopped by abstaining from increasing the currency. The chief

cause of excessive currency expansion was excessive government expenditure. Governments

had to limit their current expenditures to their current revenues and avoid all "superfluous"

expenditures. Banks, especially Banks of Issue, "should be freed of political pressure and should

be conducted solely on lines of prudent finance."13 Additional credit creation and new floating

government debt should cease; repayment or funding should begin.

         With regard to an international monetary standard, Brussels' Resolution VIII stated that a

return to the gold standard was highly desirable, but it was impossible to forecast when the older

countries would be able to return "to their former measure of effective gold standard or how long

it would take the newly formed countries to establish such a standard".14 "Deflation, if and

when undertaken, had to be carried out gradually and with great caution."15

         A notable resolution of the Brussels Conference was a call for the creation of central

banks in countries where none were currently in place and " .. if the assistance of foreign capital

were required for the promotion of such a Bank some form of international control might be

required."16 This latter phrase was all that remained of the hotly debated ideas for an

unofficial delegate, among others. But, it does adumbrate the idea, if not the specifics, of the

League's later financial missions which were to begin in 1922.

        Genoa. The Genoa Conference of April-May 1922 was the second international

conference called by the Council of Allies to address the continued national and international

financial instability. Called with the support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and Japan,

it was hoped, again unrequited, that the Americans would send official representation. Perhaps

the most active planning for the Genoa Conference was undertaken by the Bank of England and

the U. K. Treasury, with a fairly heavy input from Montagu Norman, the Bank's Governor.17

Draft proposals brought to Genoa by the British delegation were among those accepted by the

conference's Financial Commission.

        A set of widely agreed upon economic and political conditions for national fiscal and

currency stabilization, quite similar to the Brussels' list, formed an important part of the final

conference resolutions. The most controversial Genoa proposals were three important

resolutions concerning international monetary arrangements, quickly named the gold exchange

standard. These were: (1) central banks should conduct their credit policy so as to avoid undue

fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold; (2) central banks were to cooperate continuously


17. A draft of proposed resolutions was circulated and shared with, among others, Benjamin Strong, the Governor of
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 1914-1928. Strong was Norman's closest American contact with the Federal
Reserve System and New York's financial markets. Strong's links to the Bank of England stemmed from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York's role as the U.S. Government's official agent for international transactions from 1916
onward. Norman, in turn, was one of the most knowledgeable Britons in high office on U. S. monetary and business
affairs. Before Norman joined the Bank of England first as Deputy Governor, 1918-1920, and then Governor, 1920-
1944, he had been an associate and then partner of Brown-Shipley, an American mercantile/private banking firm with
British partners. His rise through the ranks of Brown-Shipley involved several extended stays in the U. S. Norman's
American background and contacts must have impressed the Directors of the Bank when he was offered the Deputy
Governorship in 1918, a background which could only help in dealing with Britain's principal wartime creditor and the
world's largest industrial power. From the beginning of Norman's Bank career, Strong and Norman carried on a frequent
and extremely frank correspondence. Indeed, Norman had visited the United States in September 1921 to improve the
Bank of England's relations with the Federal Reserve System, both beginning and ending his stay with Strong in New
York: Clay (1957); Chandler (1958); Sayers (1986 [1976], ).



                                                         12
with each other; and (3) central banks were divided into two groupings - (a) the central countries

which were to hold their international reserves entirely in gold and (b) the other nations

(unnamed) which were to hold their international reserves partly in gold and partly in foreign

exchange, that is, short-term credits on the center countries. International reserves, in other

words, could be highly liquid credits placed in the center countries.

        In formulating these proposals Norman and the Bank of England saw the world's supply

of gold as limited. Britain herself had taken gold coin out of circulation to conserve Britain's

holdings. However, it was also the case that these gold exchange standard proposals served

national British interests, as was recognized by the U. S. and France, the other "central"

economies.

        The British could expect to have a very large share of these short-term credits deposited

in London by the world's lesser central banks. Regardless of any temporary embargo on long-

term foreign borrowers, Britain remained the dominant market for short-term credit funding of

world trade in the early 1920s. Furthermore, these London sterling deposits of foreign banks

could be a very accessible source of temporary reserves for the Bank of England when, as

happened in the years 1906-1910, the Bank was subject to pressures from Britain's balance of

payments.18



The Return of Gold, 1922-1931.

        In 1919, there were five nations in the world on the gold standard, the United States,

Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama and the Philippines. Notably, the latter four were closely linked to the


18. For example, the Bank of Japan's London reserves were regularly borrowed by the Bank of England at least from
1905 onward: Sayers (1986 [1976], 40-41); Suzuki (1994, 167-170). During these same years, the Bank of Japan kept
foreign currency reserves in New York, Berlin, and Paris.



                                                       13
U. S. By end of 1922 Costa Rica, Salvador and Lithuania had restored their link to the standard.

Of these seven, Cuba and the United States were on a gold coin standard, the rest were on a gold

exchange standard. At the peak of the interwar gold standard in 1929, forty-six nations were part

of the gold standard system. China remained on the silver standard while Russia, Turkey,

Portugal and Spain continued to maintain fluctuating exchange rates. Thus, in a much shorter

space of time than characterized the spread of the gold standard in the 19th century, most of the

world's nation states and their empires had rejoined the gold standard.

       Obviously, there were economic incentives for such return. Restoring the gold standard

meant the direct and indirect costs of exchange rate fluctuation were sharply minimized which,

in turn, could have important effects on the costs of short- and long-term finance and the volume

of trade. Moreover, a nation on the gold standard was a nation which was likely to keep its

government expenditures in line with its tax revenues and thus not meet any large portion of its

expenditures with paper money creation. Furthermore, a gold standard government was likely to

think that international commerce and finance was a valuable aspect of national economic and

social progress. Finally, a gold standard country was not likely to single out foreign businesses

for differential treatment in taxation or in courts of contract law.

       Even with these advantages for a nation state the immediate economic costs of restoring

the gold standard might be quite high, often involving ending an inflationary fiscal policy with

significant output and employment effects. It was also politically difficult, particularly in nations

where the working classes were finding their voice on matters of taxation and government

expenditure and the wealthy classes were unwilling to accept an altered burden. As Eichengreen

(1992) makes abundantly clear, new taxes and new expenditures supported by newly widened

voting franchises and stronger working class parties were a significant and widespread stumbling




                                                  14
block in attempts to restore the gold standard during the 1920s. Indeed these factors as well as

the extent to which the price level had to decline, determined whether countries would return to

gold at the prewar parity or at devalued rates.

        When the gold standard was restored in the 1920s it usually involved several stages, with

national fiscal and currency stabilization coming first, often accompanied by the creation or

reform of the central bank. Then, the nation might move to de facto exchange rate stabilization

in terms of gold, with de jure exchange rate stabilization somewhat later.

International Financial Missionaries

        In the early stages of national fiscal and currency stabilization and sometimes in the later

process of gold standard restoration, the speed and character of the process was frequently and

importantly affected by foreign missions. The 1920s must be the most intense decade of

financial missionary activity the world had ever seen. The League of Nations sent financial

missions to advise Central and Eastern Europe. British, American, and French central bankers

officially and unofficially offered advice and financial help. The American economist

Kemmerer and other private financial experts were widely used in Latin America and elsewhere.

        The common ideology of these missions was forged in the Brussels and Genoa meetings

and defined more sharply through each mission's experience. Brown later summarized these

ideas, calling them a program of cooperation: "to balance national budgets and stop inflation; to

direct the flow of long term capital to countries financially and economically disorganized by the

war and to safeguard that capital; to generalize and develop the institution of central banking and

safeguard the independence of central banks; to adopt measures of gold economy; to reach a

settlement of past debts".19


19. Brown (1940, 346). The ideas can be repeatedly found in League of Nation reports and annuals. What is equally
important is their frequent mention in the correspondence of Norman and Strong in the 1920s. Perhaps the most famous

         The League of Nations Missions. In August of 1922 Austria asked the Allied Powers for

financial help and was referred to the Council of the League of Nations. A mission was set up to

investigate Austria's financial problems and make recommendations. Norman was deeply

involved from the start, having a hand in the appointment of several members of the Austrian

mission. In March 1923 new statutes for an Austrian central bank emerged and the Bank of

England issued a 12-month loan (March 1923). Three months later in June, a long-term, League-

backed loan was floated in London, New York, Paris and elsewhere and the Austrian currency

was formally linked to gold. Norman saw the Austrian mission as a demonstration of the kind of

cooperative international financial help which could work and be replicated elsewhere.20

         Hungary came to London seeking similar help in March 1923 and was referred to the

League. With a settlement of a reparation issue arranged in March 1924, two months later a

bridging short-term loan was taken by the Bank of England, a large long-term, League-backed

loan was placed internationally, and a fixed link to gold emerged.21 League long-term loans

were also the outcome of stabilization missions to Greece (1924, 1928), Danzig (1925, 1927),

Bulgaria (1926, 1928) and Estonia (1927). In total £81.2 million in long term, League of Nation

backed, loans were placed. Britain absorbed 49.1% and the U. S. 19.1%. Austria, Belgium,

Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland

absorbed shares of 1-6%.22 Norman and Strong's support of this type of international

cooperation was clearly evident.

        Key Country Support for Key Country Restorations. The return of the gold standard in

the financially troubled principal European economies in the 1920s was also generally supported

by international advice and cooperation. However, in these important cases the international

aspects of their return were directly in the hands of the principal financial powers. Such was the

circumstance for Germany (1924) and Britain (1925). Two financial powers of the second rank,

Belgium (1925) and Italy (1927), were also helped by the principal financial powers. The

principal exception to cooperation among the key monetary powers concerns the French run up

to de facto restoration in December 1926 and its de jure restoration in June 1927. As

Eichengreen has recently suggested, the particularly acute fiscal and currency crisis in France

created a very strong attachment to a purely gold reserve which conditioned their de facto return

to gold in December 1926 and de jure return in June 1927 and their attempt to pursue this created

riffs with the British and others.23

        As early as 1919, Strong suggested to Norman that if the principal financial powers first

cooperated to stabilize their own government finances and restore the gold standard amongst

themselves, it would then be far easier for the other nations to find guidance and resources to

stabilize and restore the gold standard following the principal financial powers.24

        Indeed, American involvement was crucial in the 1923 international commission to help

Germany deal with her reparations obligations and get beyond the national and international log

jams that produced its devastating post-war hyperinflation. Its outcome, the Dawes Plan,

depended critically on official U. S. support and private U. S. participation in the Dawes Loan of

800 million gold marks of foreign currency. Negotiated over the summer of 1924, it was issued

in New York, London, Paris and other European capital markets in October. The United States

absorbed half of the loan ($110 million) and the United Kingdom took a quarter; France,

Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland took the rest. In the same month, the

new gold mark was repegged to gold.

        Britain's own return to gold in April 1925 was strongly supported by Strong and the New

York capital market. A fundamental condition for such a return was a deflation of British prices

relative to the United States, which proved elusive despite secularly high unemployment rates,

the Bank of England's vigilant positioning of its discount rate and occasional foreign loan

embargoes. However, the longer Britain waited the more likely it was that the foreign exchange

reserves of newly stabilized currencies would be deposited in New York, not London. Indeed, in

the winter of 1924-1925 first Australia and South Africa and then Switzerland and the

Netherlands put Britain on notice that they wished to complete their post-war financial

stabilization by restoring the gold standard.25

        On April 28, 1925, Churchill announced that Britain was back on the gold standard at

$4.86 to the pound. The Bank of England had £153 millions in gold reserves, virtually the

amount recommended by the Cunliffe Committee. Significantly, credits of $300 millions had

been arranged, if needed, consisting of a $100 million credit from J. P. Morgan and other

American banking houses and a $200 million repo line of gold from a number of Federal

Reserve Banks for two years.

        As things evolved, the American credits were not used but Norman did find it necessary

to arrange a private embargo on foreign loans from November 1924 to facilitate the expected

return and an embargo on colonial loans was added two months after the April 1925 restoration.

their currencies in 1924, Sweden and Germany establishing a de jure link to gold.

Only in November 1925 was the situation thought sufficiently stable to lift the embargoes.26

These embargoes most likely hastened the decline of the London international capital markets

and the shift to the unfettered environment of New York.

        The Money Doctors. The third international force for monetary stabilization was the

missions of Princeton economist Kemmerer and other private consultants. Since Kemmerer

regularly corresponded and met with Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the

State Department concerning his missions, it would appear that he was comfortable operating

within the parameters of American monetary and diplomatic policy. Yet, the governments hiring

Kemmerer clearly wanted an independent U. S. consultant, not a seconded official of the U. S.

central bank or its diplomatic corps. That these governments wanted a foreigner suggests that

they were trying to avoid petty political attacks directed at native experts; that they wanted a U.

S. consultant suggests they wanted access to American financial markets. Kemmerer, it was well

known, had excellent contacts with Dillon, Reed. In the 1920s, Kemmerer headed or jointly

chaired missions to Peru (1922), Colombia (1923), Guatemala (1924), South Africa (1924-1925),

Chile (1925), Poland (1926), and Bolivia (1927), as well as serving on the Dawes Commission to

Germany in 1925.

        Kemmerer's agenda was virtually the same as the missions of the League of Nations:

fiscal stabilization, creating an independent central bank, and stabilizing the currency in terms of

gold, de facto and de jure.27 Measured by whether Kemmerer's missions resulted in the

restoration or establishment of a gold standard, the evidence suggests that it was usually the case




26. From June to November 1925 only one Empire loan was issued in London and not one foreign government loan was
issued during the whole of 1925: Atkin (1977, 51).

                                                      19
that within a year of a Kemmerer mission, the local currency was stabilized in terms of gold.28

With regard to the effects the Kemmerer missions had on enhanced foreign dollar loans,

Eichengreen found a significant effect on national government loans within three years of a

Kemmerer mission.29

        Kemmerer's efforts may have indirectly had a significant effect on the return to gold of a

key economy. The advice of the Vissering-Kemmerer commission formed an important basis for

the South African government's decision to inform Great Britain that South Africa wanted to

return to gold as soon as possible. As was noted earlier, the privately expressed desire of South

Africa, Australia, Switzerland and the Netherlands to return to gold in late 1924 and early 1925

put substantial pressure on Great Britain to speed its own return in April 1926.

        Thus with the efforts of the great powers, especially the United Kingdom and the United

States, the League of Nations, and private missions, the gold standard was restored as a gold

exchange standard. Many countries accompanied their return to convertibility with deliberate

actions to attain fiscal probity including establishing a central bank and a balanced budget. Also

because of the severity of the wartime inflation and dislocations and the rising power of labor,

many countries returned to gold at devalued parities. The United Kingdom was a principal

advocate and architect of the restoration of the gold standard, presumably to restore its position

as the world’s premier capital market. Yet as events unfolded, she was denied this role and the

mantle shifted to New York. This transformation reflected the United Kingdom’s weakened

financial status after the war manifested in embargoes on international lending and the decision

to return to gold at the original parity which overvalued sterling.

3. The Mantle Shifts

         Prior to World War I the United States was a debtor nation, similar to Canada, Australia,

and other developing countries that were absorbing European capital and exploiting their natural

resources. There was, however, considerable U.S. foreign investment, especially towards the end

of the nineteenth century. Most, was direct investment by American corporations that were

expanding their operations abroad. There was also some foreign portfolio investment.30 The

rapid growth in both direct investments and foreign security holdings in the period 1900 to 1914,

moreover, suggests that the United States would have become a major foreign investor, and

would have changed from debtor to creditor, even in the absence of World War I.31

         World War I, however, accelerated this transition. The outbreak of the war in Europe

brought foreign governments into the American market seeking loans. During the period of U.S.

neutrality these loans were generally short term. Indeed, the volume of short-term lending grew

so rapidly that in January 1917 the Federal Reserve felt compelled to warn the banks against

acquiring too many foreign short-term loans.

         American entry into the war led to massive foreign loans by the US government. The

mechanism was simple. The Treasury itself became the purchaser of long-term bonds issued by

the Allies. During the war the Capital Issues Committee controlled sales of foreign securities on

private markets.

       After the war, U.S. foreign investment boomed. Europe had been devastated by the war

and needed capital to restore plant and equipment. Europe also needed capital to reconstruct

financial relationships; going on the gold standard meant holding gold or foreign exchange

convertible into gold. Britain, although a victor, and possessing lending institutions built up over

centuries, was drained by the war. America was ready to replace Britain as the center of lending

for developing countries.

       Table 1 shows the basic dimensions of U.S. foreign lending during the twenties. Over the

years 1919 to 1932 some $5.2 billion (at face value) in national and provincial government

securities, our focus in this paper, were floated in the American market. At market prices the

figure would be closer to $5 billion. The total, which includes corporate and municipal securities

as well as nationals and provincials, was about $9 billion at face value. Most of these were long-

term (more than five years) bonds. These were dollar bonds, so that exchange risk was being

assumed, at least from a legal point of view, by the borrower.

       Issues were substantial even in 1919. National and Provincial issues peaked in 1924,

while total issues, driven by corporates, peaked in 1927. National and Provincial flotations

declined sharply in 1929 as investors focused on the soaring returns in the stock market, revived

in 1930, and then collapsed as the Great Depression took hold. The purpose of the loans changed

over the twenties. The earliest loans were refunding loans needed to finance short-term

obligations incurred during the war, and reconstruction loans needed to finance rebuilding of

capital damaged in the war, especially railways. Later came stabilization loans, including the

Dawes plan loans to Germany which helped establish the post-hyperinflation German currency.

And last came what might be called development loans, directed at a wide range of countries,

with the purpose of providing social overhead capital.




                                                 22
           The list of countries that sought and obtained dollar loans in the American market in the

twenties is a long one. It included major European powers such as France and Germany, smaller

European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania, South American countries such as Argentina,

Brazil, and Chile, and many others. These bonds were distributed by a small number of

investment banking houses. J.P. Morgan & Co. was the most important, serving as the lead firm

on perhaps half the issues. The others important players were Kuhn, Loeb; Dillon, Read;

National City Company; and J.W. Seligman.

           The central factor behind the growth of the market was simply that there was good

business to be done. Foreigners wanted to borrow; Americans (and few others) had capital to

lend. Behind the scenes the U.S. government offered encouragement. Foreign lending was seen

as a way of promoting a stable political equilibrium in Europe, and of extending American

influence in other regions. Beginning in 1921, the State Department reviewed proposed

flotations.32 Generally, the Department offered no objection to a proposed loan, but there were a

few exceptions based on political considerations. The Department for example, did not object to

Japanese loans if the money was to be used in Japan, but it did object if the money would be

used in Manchuria.

           During the Great Depression many of the foreign governments that the United States had

lent to in the twenties defaulted, including Germany, Bulgaria, Brazil, Cuba, and China. Many

municipal and corporate borrowers, of course, defaulted as well. Inevitably, it was argued that

lending standards had been lax in the twenties, that they had fallen even further as the lending

“mania” progressed, and that the resulting defaults had contributed to the severity of the

Depression. On the surface it seemed that although the United States had taken over the role of


32
     Cleveland and Huertas, (1985, 147).



                                                   23
principal overseas lender from the British, they had not acquired the expertise that the British had

accumulated over a century of practice. It also suggests that US lenders may not have followed

the same criteria to evaluate foreign loans as the British.

       A number of pieces of evidence were adduced to show that standards had been lax. First

there was the quantitative evidence. By the end of the 1930s billions of dollars worth of bonds

were in default, and the majority were issues made later in the twenties rather than earlier. There

was also an abundance of qualitative evidence. One oft-repeated story concerns the son of the

President of Peru who was later convicted of “illegal enrichment” in connection with a Peruvian

issue. Another frequently repeated story concerns Cuba. Initially it’s foreign borrowing was

intended to complete a road running from one end of Cuba to the other, a badly managed project

perhaps, but one that could be justified as a productivity increasing investment in social overhead

capital. Later, as the willingness of Americans to lend became evident, the Cubans borrowed for

less justifiable purposes – a new Capitol with a gilt dome.33 And, as with the stock market, one

could cite many warnings by wise men that speculation was running wild in the foreign bond

market, and that a day of reckoning was at hand.

       The problem with this evidence, of course, is that it is hard to know what would have

happened in the absence of the Great Depression. Although some borrowers would have

defaulted, the number defaulting would have been far smaller, fewer scandals would have been

detected, and the warnings of the Casandras would have been forgotten. Foreign loans in the

twenties did contain substantial risk premiums. To say whether those premiums were

“reasonable” would mean knowing a reasonable estimate of the probability of an extremely

unlikely event: a collapse of the American financial system in which the Federal Reserve failed

to act as lender of last resort followed by a prolonged world-wide depression.




                                                  24
           Some attempts have been made to address the standards issue. Friedman and Schwartz

(1963, 245-8) provide a perceptive analysis of the standards debate, and of the studies, such as

Mintz (1951), available at the time.34 Friedman and Schwartz argue that the real problem might

not have been excessively low credit standards in the 1920s, but rather excessively high

standards in the early 1930s, especially at the Federal Reserve.

           The critics of U.S. foreign lending in the 1920s, both at the time and since, seem to have

assumed that it should have been relatively straightforward for lenders to assess the quality of a

foreign issue, a matter mostly of judging the particular project that was to make use of the

borrowed capital, combined, perhaps, with some judgment about the weight of the borrowers’

total debt burden. Judging the soundness of the issue of a sovereign borrower, however, involves

a difficult problem of asymmetric information. The real question is how much a particular

country will be willing to suffer in hard times to repay obligations contracted in good times, a

piece of information that is hard for lenders to know, whether the borrower is a local

businessman or a sovereign nation.

           Our research explores how the US capital markets in the 1920s attempted to solve the

asymmetric information problem. Our hypothesis is that the US lenders looked at whether a

country had made the effort to go on the gold standard, as was the case when Great Britain was

the principal lender, and if possible to do so at the prewar price of gold.




33
     Lewis, 1938, pp. 383-87.
34
  Mintz computed an annual default index based on the ultimate status of a borrower, rather than of a particular
loan, thus adjusting for loans that were not defaulted because they had been substantially repaid before the
depression, and concluded that standards had fallen in the late 1920s.

4. Methodology, Data, Econometric Evidence

         In this section we present evidence for the “good housekeeping seal of approval”

hypothesis for the interwar period. Our approach is to estimate a very simple pooled cross-

section time series regression for 40 countries and seven years of data.35 The regression tests to

see if adherence to the gold standard affected the interest rate that was charged on dollar

denominated loans to sovereign borrowers in the U.S. capital market, holding constant other

fundamentals. We also ascertain whether in addition to adhering to gold convertibility it mattered

whether a country had devalued its currency before restoring the gold standard.

         This methodology is somewhat different from that followed in Bordo and Rockoff

(1996). In that study which covered the classical gold standard period 1870 to 1914 we had a 40

year sample of data for only 9 countries. In that study most of the variation came from the time

dimension in contrast to this study which relies mainly on the cross-section variation.36

         The interest rates which we use come from a study by Cleona Lewis (1938).37 She

presented a comprehensive tabulation of new issues in the U.S. markets and the rates charged for

approximately 40 countries.38 Its likely that these were not the only countries that were

borrowing in international markets. But this was, as discussed in section 3, the most important

bond market in the interwar period. The data is organized so that we only use observations for

years in which the countries actually borrowed. We do not know why they did or did not borrow.

A decision not to borrow might reflect bad credit, and an inability to borrow at low rates, or

38
   The countries in our sample are (in Europe) Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Rumania, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia; (in the New World) Canada and Newfoundland, Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti,
Panama, El Salvador; and (in the rest of the world), Australia, China, the Dutch East Indies, Japan, Liberia, and the
Phillipine Islands.


                                                         26
simply an abundance of domestic savings. During this period there were also a number of

important stabilization loans offered under the auspices of the League of Nations as mentioned in

section 3 above. In the empirical work described below we omit these loans because they do not

fit exactly into the framework of our hypothesis—they were made by private lenders but were

officially backed on political grounds to help countries stabilize their inflation rates and return to

gold. We also did our calculations including these loans in the sample and the results were quite

similar.

           We used a number of institutional variables to isolate various dimensions of the “good

housekeeping seal” hypothesis. These include dummy variables to ascertain whether it mattered

whether a country was on or off gold, whether it had devalued, whether it followed a gold

exchange standard or a pure gold standard, whether a gold coin or gold bullion standard.

           The third set of variables is a set of macroeconomic fundamentals that one might think

would be important in judging a country’s ability to service its debts. These variables include a

measure of monetary policy (the rate of growth of the stock of money less the rate of growth of

real output), the inflation rate, a measure of fiscal policy (the ratio of government expenditures

less receipts relative to GNP), the ratio of the current account deficit relative to GDP, the rate of

change of the exchange rate, the central bank discount rate, the ratio of gold reserves to total

reserves, and the ratio of total reserves to imports. The definitions are shown in Table 2.

           Before we examine the regressions it is useful to look at the interest rates for our sample

of countries dividing the sample into the countries that were on gold and off gold in the years

1920-1929.39 As can clearly be seen from figure 1 the interest rate for gold standard adherents

was less than for non-adherents. Before 1925 the difference is about 100 basis points and


39
     The sample presented in these figures excludes stabilization loans.



                                                            27
afterwards closer to 200. A further demarcation, as shown in figure 2, divided the sample into 3

groups: off gold, on gold and devalued, and on gold and not devalued. From figure 2 it can

clearly be seen that interest rates for the last group are considerably lower than for the other

groups.40 Furthermore, after 1925 the interest rates for the on gold and devalued group is about

100 basis points below the off-gold group. These results suggest that good gold standard

orthodoxy commanded a very high premium. But even attempting to go back to gold at a

devalued parity was better than not doing so.

           The advantage to a country of returning to gold can be seen in many individual cases.

Thus for example Canada paid 5.53 percent when off gold and 4.65 percent when on gold;

Australia paid 6.9 and 5.17; Chile 8.05 and 6.75; Denmark 6.93 and 4.8, and Italy 7.8 and 6.25.

Indeed figure 3 shows for the whole sample, the interest rates paid in the two years before going

back onto gold and the rates paid in the three years after. As is clearly evident there is a dramatic

decline.

           We turn now to the regression results. In Table 3 we regress the interest rates on the on-

off gold dummy, the dollar amount of the issue scaled by GDP, and a number of macroeconomic

variables. All the regressions also include year dummies which to save on space are not

presented. The first equation is the simple benchmark equation which includes only the gold

adherence dummy. As can be seen, this variable is significant and has the predicted negative

sign. Equation 2 adds in the size of the issue and the following fundamentals: inflation, fiscal

policy, foreign trade, and the exchange rate. As in equation (1) the gold adherence dummy is

significant, indeed it is more significant and negative, and two of the other variables are

significant, inflation and the exchange rate. We have also included the White t statistics which

adjust for possible heterocedasticity. These results are similar, although the significance of the

40
     Some new countries did not have a prewar parity to go back to. They are omitted from the sample at this point.

                                                           28
on-off dummy is higher and the exchange rate is now significant at the 5 percent level, but with a

perverse sign. Equation (3) substitutes our measure of monetary policy for the inflation rate. As

in the previous regression this variable is significant.

        In Table 4 for the gold standard adherence dummy we substitute two dummies: countries

that were on gold that did not devalue, and countries that were on gold and did devalue. The on-

gold not devalued dummy is significant at the 1 percent level and is considerably stronger than

the on-gold dummy in Table 3. Also as in the previous table the inflation variable is strongly

significant. The only other variable that is significant is the exchange rate in equation (3).

        Finally, Table 5 repeats the equations from the previous two tables, except that we add in

two additional fundamental variables: the ratio of gold reserves to total reserves and the ratio of

total reserves to imports. The key finding in this table, as in table 4, is that the on-gold-not-

devalued dummy comes in with the right sign, is strongly significant, and large in magnitude

(over 200 basis points).41

        As a test of the robustness of our results we ran a similar set of regressions (but do not

present the results here) on a different set of interest rates. These are long term bond yields for

ten countries used in Bordo and Schwartz (1996). Our results were quite similar to those in Table

3, but somewhat weaker.

        In sum, the results for our measures of gold adherence, especially orthodox gold

adherence-- that is returning to the prewar parity-- we believe provides strong support for the

“good housekeeping seal” hypothesis. As in our earlier study the variables that one might at first




41
   We ran regressions similar to those in Tables 4 and 5 including dummy variables to ascertain whether it mattered
if a country was on a gold exchange or pure gold standard and whether it was on a gold coin or gold bullion
standard. It did not appear, however, that these further distinctions had a significant impact. Finally we ran the
regressions using one year lags on the fundamental variables. The results were similar.


                                                         29
think should serve as fundamentals, with the principal exceptions of inflation and monetary

policy, did not turn out to be that strong.



                                              5. Conclusion

       Although this paper tests the “good housekeeping seal of approval hypothesis” that two

of us worked on previously, we were all somewhat skeptical that it would apply to the 1920’s.

The interwar monetary system has generally received a bad press. It got off to a bad start, as

many countries delayed in returning to gold, and many returned at devalued parities. It lasted for

only a brief period before ending in the disaster of the Great Depression. Moreover, it was not a

true gold standard, but rather a gold exchange standard which by definition made it more fragile.

It has been characterized as having major fundamental flaws which led to a deflationary bias, and

most importantly it has been indicted because members had less of a credible attachment to gold

orthodoxy. Yet there is significant recent evidence which suggests that when the gold standard

functioned, arbitrage in the short-term capital markets was as efficient as it had been before

1914, and there were substantial long-term capital flows in the 1920’s.

       Yet despite these reservations, the regression results we report in section 4 were very

encouraging for our hypothesis. The on-gold-off-gold dummy was as significant as what we

found for the pre-1914 period, and the fact that the coefficient on the on-gold-never-devalued

dummy was even stronger suggests that adherence to gold standard orthodoxy was highly prized

by US lenders. However, the fact that adhering to gold even at a devalued parity was valued

suggests that the markets attached importance to being part of the fixed exchange rate system

independent of following gold standard orthodoxy.




                                                   30
       The general insignificance of the other fundamentals, with the principal exceptions of

inflation and monetary policy, echoed what we found in our earlier study. We do not have a

ready explanation, but it is possible that the markets preferred the gold standard seal over data

that had only recently become available, and that they could not easily evaluate.

       While we believe these results to be compelling, a number of reservations are in order.

These include the fact that we could have tested for the influence of other fundamentals such as

the political variables considered by Eichengreen (1992) and Simmons (1994): left wing versus

right wing governments, longevity of the government, and so on. Or other variables such as

prior commercial linkages between the lenders and the borrowers, geography, and a common

language, and culture.

       While our results show that countries would have received a large gain by going back to

gold at the prewar parity it is understandable why they chose not to do so. In most cases

returning to the prewar parity would have required substantial deflation and likely declining real

activity. In the face of a dramatically changed political economy with the rise of the left and the

power of organized labor, the costs of pursuing such a strategy likely outweighed the benefits

that we have identified in terms of the spread between the coefficient on the on-off-gold dummy

and the on-gold-never-devalued dummy. A case in point is France which even at the lowest

point of postwar inflation in 1919 would have had to deflate by a multiple of the amount that the

British and Americans deflated.
