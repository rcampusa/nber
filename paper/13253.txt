                                                 ABSTRACT

We develop a basic framework to understand the organization of highly creative activities. Management
faces a fundamental tradeoff in organizing such activities. On the one hand, since creativity cannot
be achieved by command and control or by monetary incentives, internal/contractual production of
creative products is plagued by hazards arising from their fundamental characteristics: extremely high
input, output and market uncertainty, and the inherent informational advantages of creative talent.
 Procuring highly creative products in the market place, though, exposes the distributor to a fundamental
risk: independently produced creative goods are generic distribution-wise. Thus, in procuring creative
products in the marketplace, distributors face the unavoidable winner's curse risk. Since this risk is,
to a large extent, independent of the creative nature of the product, the higher the creative content,
the higher the relative hazards associated with internal or contractual production. Thus, internal/contractual
production of creative goods will tend to be less prevalent the higher the creative content associated
with its production. We apply this insight to the evolution of the U.S. film industry in the mid-XXth
century. We exploit two simultaneous natural experiments -- the diffusion of TV and the Paramount
antitrust decision forcing the separation of exhibitors from distributors and prohibiting the use of block-booking.
 Both events increased the demand for creative content in movies. We develop empirical implications
which we test by analyzing in detail the decision by distributors to produce films internally or to procure
then in the market place, in the face of an increase in the demand for creative content.

Creativity: the ability to make or otherwise bring into existence something new, whether

a new solution to a problem, a new method or device, or a new artistic object or form.1



All productive activities have a creative component. Some activities, however, have a

higher need for creative input. Consider, in particular, a productive activity whose output

requires the creation of a final product whose nature must be intrinsically different than

all previously produced products. Artistic products are a classic example. For a new

theatre production to attract large audiences, it has to be substantially different from any

other theater piece previously produced. The same also applies to other artistic media

such as radio shows, TV series, and movies. Highly creative activities also abound

outside of the arts. Consider, for example, the myriad of new products, technologies,

business models and ideas that originated during the dot com era and in today’s Web 2.0

to realize that extreme creativity flourishes in business.

           Creativity, however, has serious organizational drawbacks. For one, high level

creativity, in contrast to humdrum work, cannot be forced or coerced. The standard

writers’ block syndrome, where a writer is unable to fill up a blank page, can be applied

to software engineers, product designers, theater directors, movie producers, academics,

consultants, or indeed any worker who is faced with an impending highly creative task.

The fundamental organizational problem with “the block” is that it cannot be solved by

command and control (i.e., instructing the worker what to do) or by monetary incentives

– the two foundational principles of organizational economics. High level creativity, in

short, can only be fostered, it cannot be commanded.

           Creativity also generates particular informational asymmetries between creative

talent and management arising from the three fundamental characteristics of creative

work initially identified by Caves (2000). First, infinite variety, meaning that the possible

solutions to a particular need or demand (whether a book, film, software design, etc.) are

impossible to define ex-ante (i.e., in advance) and to count ex-post. In other words, a

given general task has infinite potential solutions. Second, nobody knows, meaning that

creative output is shroud in extreme uncertainty about its marketability. Third, art for

art’s sake, which underscores the fact that creative talent enjoy the creative process itself.

The interactions among these three features make highly creative work extremely

difficult to manage.

           Consider a manager attempting to determine whether a particular creative product

or design is the most appropriate to the problem at hand. Given the “infinite variety”

characteristic of creative work, management may have to undertake the creative process

all over again, with its time and cost implications, to determine the appropriateness of the

original outcome.

           Although creative talent may have strong opinions about the appropriateness of its

proposed solution, and management may have serious difficulties in second guessing

talent, in fact most movies do not get screened, most books do not sell and most new

products fail (the “nobody knows” feature). The “infinite variety” and “nobody knows”

features of creative products make the finished product’s success a highly unpredictable.

           Informational asymmetries are further aggravated by the fact that creative talent

may enjoy the creative process. In fact, “Art for Art’s Sake,”2 the quintessential feature

of creative talent, may explain why, for example, so many highly creative outcomes end
2
    See Caves (2000).

up failing, and why the return to artistic endeavors is below average.3 Thus, on the job

enjoyment, coupled with strong differences in the appraisal of the quality of creative

output between creative talent and management, generate particular and specific

managerial problems, making the cost of creative activities very difficult to control.

The Hazards of Internal Creative Production

Internal creative production is subject to particular types of hazards, which bear both

similarities and differences to the production of humdrum goods.

Creative Talent Hold-Up

Creative outputs are inherently uncertain. When a manager requests the development of

a particular creative output such as a book, movie, or a video game, the manager cannot,

by definition, define the output that she is actually seeking. If the output could be defined

to a high degree of specificity, then the manager would have already undertaken the

creative activity itself. Thus, the product is typically defined in very general terms,4 and

although management may provide some restrictions on inputs, creative talent is in a

much better position to know what inputs are in fact required to achieve the general task.

        Given the nature of sequential production, where development costs are sunk

early on, and subsequent improvements are needed to achieve a satisfactory outcome,

Caves’ (2000) Ten Ton Turkey syndrome, where costs easily escape managerial control,

appears naturally. Since a certain amount of investment is already sunk, informational

asymmetries place management in the position of either having to contribute new funds

to a project or discontinue it. Given that creative output is shroud in uncertainty about its

  See, Pew Internet Report (2004), showing that while artists are more educated than the average population
have nevertheless an annual income below average. See, also, Dekom (2004) reporting that the average
internal rate of return in the motion picture industry is negative (at around -5%).

  This is not too different from defense procurement of new weapon systems. See Oudot (2006).


                                                     4
                                    The Organizational Implications of Creativity



marketability (Caves (2000)’ “nobody knows” property of creative activities) as long as

management’s expectations of the project’s marketability are unaffected by its

development cost, management may often find it optimal to follow creative talent’s

recommendations and commit additional investment to the project.

           In sum, internal production is subject to a serious hold-up hazard based upon the

inherent informational asymmetry between talent and management, and management’s

inability to force the creation of high quality work that will have a certain commercial

success. The consequence is a systematic inability to keep cost tied to initially predicted

production budgets through internal production.

Dynamic Hazards

Creativity transactions are also plagued with dynamic hazards, hazards that arise with the

implementation of creative work over time. Two fundamental features of creative work

are at play here: infinite variety and nobody knows. First, the creative process is, by

definition, particular and unique (infinite variety). Although a creative output – say a

new video game – may be completed and released, infinite variety implies that creative

talent may have also found a better or more interesting game concept which did not

disclose to management, and from which she may be able to profit in later employment.

Management, then, may be subsidizing future career opportunities of its creative talent.5

           Second, although ex-ante the “nobody knows” feature of creative production

applies, ex-post an actor may become identified with his or her character, and future

attempts to exploit that character may encounter hold-up by the creative talent. Similarly,




5
    This is the problem of “tacit” knowledge, with its intellectual property implications.


                                                         5
                                              Gil and Spiller



a successful product – say a great game or movie – does not assure that a sequel will be

equally successful. The “nobody knows” feature applies at all times.6

        In sum, creative production is subject to transaction hazards quite different from

the standard transaction cost framework. The hazards we emphasize here are those

associated with the fundamental features of creativity: extremely high input, output and

market uncertainty, and the inherent informational advantages of creative talent.

Producing and distributing creative products require organizational adaptation to those

hazards.

A Basic Organizational Response: Talent Internalization of Creative Production

Transaction costs call for internalization7 of production when the hazards associated with

a transaction are hard to manage via contract (Williamson, 1979). The transaction

hazards discussed earlier are all associated with the production of highly creative

products in circumstances where talent is not the residual claimant of its work – in other

words, they are associated with the hiring of creative talent. Depending on the level of

creativity required, these hazards may become extreme, and may lead to serious hold-up

problems and conflicts between creative workers and management.

        Talent internalization, that is, making talent the residual claimant, may not be

feasible in team production when the creative components are relatively distributed

among talent. For example, talent internalization in game software development with

multiple components, where each component has to be developed by separate talent, may

not be feasible, as the contribution of each creative individual becomes inextricably


6
 See De Vany and Walls (1999) on the effect of movie stars on box office.
7
 By internalization of production we mean both in-house production and contracting a specific project to
another party. This is in contrast to buying a finished creative output from a completely independent
production process.


                                                    6
                             The Organizational Implications of Creativity



interlinked with the others. On the other hand, in activities where the creative component

may be more highly concentrated, talent internalization may solve much of the hazards of

creative internal production. For example, books are written by independent writers who

internalize to a large extent the risks of creative writing. Musicians tend also to perform

at risk. Although record labels may provide long term contracts that mitigate creative

risk, in most cases music performers bear most if not all the risk. In contrast, orchestra

musicians work as hired labor. Their creativity, however, is eliminated to cater to the

necessary output, so despite their highly skilled role, their labor is more attuned to

humdrum rather than to creative work.

       Talent internalization in teams, although incomplete, may still be hazard reducing

if a major component of talent takes over the residual rights. In this case, informational

asymmetries between other talent providers and talent/manager are reduced, leading to

better cost control and more on-time delivery. Talent internalization, though, exposes

talent to the risks associated with the infinite variety and nobody knows features of

creative work.

Hazards of Procuring Independently Produced Creative Products

A distributor of creative products may find it appealing to procure its product from

independent talent producers. It saves the hazards of managing “Art for Art’s Sake”

talent and pushes upstream Caves’ “Ten Ton Turkey” problem. On the other hand,

independently produced creative goods, while very particular and hopefully unique, are

generic distribution-wise. In fact, any distributor can distribute them. Consider, for

example, a new cookbook by a major chef. There are multiple publishers that could

enhance their portfolio of cookbooks with such a book. In fact, unless there are some




                                                  7
                                               Gil and Spiller



prescient features associated with particular editors, no publisher has better information

concerning the potential market for this book. The “nobody knows” rule applies here as

well. If a publisher, however, attempts to obtain the distribution rights to that book, it

will have to out-compete all other publishers. The publisher who out-competes all others

is, though, assuming same printing and distribution costs throughout the industry, the

publisher who thinks it can sell more. In other words, it is the most optimistic of all. In

fact, with many publishers competing for the book, the winning publisher is likely to

regret obtaining it. This is, essentially, the winner’s curse associated with a common

values auction.8

         Although the winner’s curse is a common occurrence in auctions for goods such

as paintings, used cars, and wines, as long as the buyer is a final user, it is of no

significant consequence. The auction winner takes home a nice painting after paying a

bit too much, but still paid below her reservation price. Buying products for resale in

common value auctions, however, has a different implication. The winning buyer will

have paid more than its competitors were willing to pay for that product. Since each

bidder may be thought of as being a random draw on a common information set, on

average winning bidders in common value auctions may be unable to resell the product at

a profit.9

         Distributors may develop strategies to buy creative products without falling into

the winner’s curse. They may refuse to participate in auctions, and may require creative

producers to negotiate with them on a one-to-one rather than a one-to-many basis.10


8
  See Kagel and Levin (1986).
9
  This may explain why art merchants do not normally buy at auctions.
10
   An example of this process is visible in the Sundance Film Festival where often a private screening is
arranged to a previously selected distributor, who is given the right to make a preemptive purchase offer.


                                                      8
                                  The Organizational Implications of Creativity



Distributors may also enter into a long term arrangement with independent producers of

creative products, which limits the producers’ ability to negotiate with other

distributors.11 These arrangements, however, highlight the significance of the hazards of

producing creative products internally.

The Fundamental Managerial Trade-off in Creative Goods Production

Management faces a fundamental trade-off in the acquisition of creative goods. It can

attempt to enter into internal or contractual arrangements for the production of those

goods, but such arrangements will be subject to extreme talent informational asymmetries

and potential hold-ups. On the other hand, buying finished creative products for

commercial purposes is subject to different degrees of the winner’s curse. Since the

winner’s curse is to a large extent independent of the creative nature of the product, the

higher the creative content, the higher the risks associated with internal or contractual

production. Thus, our main organizational insight is that

           internal/contractual production of creative goods should be less prevalent than

           their outright purchase the higher the creative content associated with its

           production.

For the remainder of this article, we apply this insight to the evolution of the U.S. film

industry in the middle of the XXth century.

The US Movie Industry in the 1940s and 1950s

Movie production is the quintessential creative process. Movies have to provide

audiences with a uniquely different experience each time, and their making is associated

with so much creativity that virtually the only predictor of commercial success is their

first week box office performance. Budget size, the quality of all individual inputs, and
11
     This is the case, for example, of the relation between the Weinstein Co. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.


                                                       9
                                               Gil and Spiller



the film’s cast do not guarantee the market appeal of the final product.12 In fact, the sum

of the parts may be lesser, equal to or greater than the whole. Also, the sum of the same

parts may yield very different outcomes if released at different points in time. Given the

extreme uncertainty of demand (the “nobody knows” principle), the “infinite variety”

prevalent in the industry, and the fact that artists in this industry are likely to be among

the most extreme representatives of the “art for art’s sake” principle, it is surprising –

and encouraging for the future of the industry – that we find rationality in the way the

movie industry manages to exercise control over the production process.

        This article focuses specifically on the organizational decisions of movie

production and distribution companies on an individual project level. Production

companies must decide for each film whether to execute distribution in-house or

outsource to another distributor. Similarly, distribution companies must decide whether

to produce in-house, co-produce (including funding), or purchase films on the open

market.

        As discussed earlier, the higher the desired creative content of the good, the lower

the hazards of open market acquisitions relative to internal or contractual production. It

is also in this sense that the movie industry serves as an interesting case study of the

organizational implications of an increase in the required high-level creative content of its

product.

        Until the late 1940s, the U.S. motion picture industry was dominated by the “Big

Five” studios that integrated production, distribution, and exhibition.13 These firms


12
  See De Vany (2004).
13
  These were Paramount, Warner Bros., Loew’s (MGM), Twentieth Century-Fox and RKO. To these, we
need to add the “Little Three” (Universal, Columbia, and United Artists) to complement the set of relevant
players (Balio, 1990).


                                                     10
                                    The Organizational Implications of Creativity



directly controlled theaters accounting for 50 percent of total domestic film rentals, and

all the theaters were required to abide by the practice of “block booking,” where films

could only be purchased in prepackaged groups. These “blocks” included a mixture of

both high and low quality films, leaving theaters with little choice but to agree to

purchase since the Big Five produced and distributed roughly three quarters of the top

grossing “A” films (Balio 1990). The quality of the worst of these films purchased was

occasionally so poor that theaters simply shelved them instead of showing them to the

public (Strick 1978). It is widely believed that block booking helped theaters save on

search costs and assure a constant flow of films onto their screens.14 Similarly,

distributors saved on bargaining costs and were able to market a range of movies that

varied widely in quality and genre since the size of the block was also important to

theaters. With demand from theaters guaranteed through direct control and block

booking, motion picture production was organized under the “studio system,” resembling

a large-scale manufacturing operation with routinized production processes (Storper and

Christopherson 1987).

           After years of strong box office attendance, the motion picture industry began a

rapid and dramatic decline in the post-World War II period. Average weekly movie

attendance declined 50% from $90 million in 1946 to $45 million in 1956 (Stuart 1982).

This had a traumatic impact on the profits of the motion picture studios, with the

combined profits of the ten largest production operations falling 74% from $121 million

to $32 million during the same period (Balio 1985). The weekly habitual moviegoers

that the motion picture industry relied upon were disappearing, and audiences grew more

discriminating about the films they chose to see (Wasko 1982).
14
     See Kenney and Klein (1983).


                                                         11
                                           Gil and Spiller



           There were two major external shocks that led to the downturn in the motion

picture industry during this period. The first was the Supreme Court ruling on U.S. vs.

Paramount Pictures, Inc. et al in 1948 which forced the separation of exhibition from the

production and distribution businesses owned by the Big Five. With exhibitors now able

to freely purchase films, independent producers began to take rental market share from

the Big Five producer-distributors (Stuart 1982). The ruling also banned restrictive trade

practices such as block booking, and the added insurance such mechanisms provided to

producers and distributors vanished with them. Every movie produced and distributed

would now have to be sold individually, and not at all if the quality was too poor.15

           The second major shock was the spread of television. Americans owned only

14,000 television sets in 1947, but by 1954 ownership reached 32 million. By the end of

the 1950s, almost 90 percent of American homes owned a television set. The marginal

cost of viewing television was insignificant relative to a movie ticket once a set was

purchased, and the variety and convenience provided by the new visual medium made it a

competitive substitute for motion pictures (Balio 1985). Confronted with the

combination of both shocks, major producers and distributors began to face an

increasingly competitive environment for films.

           Increased competition drove distributors in the industry to increase their demand

for higher quality movies. This increased the demand for creativity for both in-house as

well as independent productions. Producers responded by increasing the amount of

resources and creative inputs invested into the production process of hopefully higher




15
     See Balio (1990) and Wasko (1982).


                                                 12
                                The Organizational Implications of Creativity



quality movies.16 Production was refocused away from lower budget “B” films and

concentrated instead on producing a smaller number of big budget “A” films, with

significant investments in a variety of new technologies including color, 3-D, and

stereophonic sound.17

        In the following sections we specify the empirical organizational implications of

the increased demand for creative content, describe the data used here, and conduct

empirical tests of our hypotheses.

Empirical Implications for Make-or-Buy Decisions in the US Movie Industry in the

1940s and 1950s

The testable implications follow the fundamental managerial trade-off in the production

of creative goods stated above and rewritten here:

        “Internal/contractual production of creative goods should be less prevalent than

        their outright purchase the higher the creative content associated with its

        production.”

We define five testable implications within the context of the movie industry in the

middle of the XXth century and the special circumstances that we have described in the

previous section.

        The first empirical implication is that the increase in demand for creativity should

lead to a greater decrease in the amount of internal production for the “Paramount”

distributors (the Big Five plus Universal, Columbia and United Artists) than for the “non-

Paramount” distributors. Even though all distributors should have decreased internal

16
   This does not mean a change in the taste of American movie-goers over this time. The two shocks
presented here basically mean that the demand for creativity by distribution and production companies
increased because now they had to compete against television and each movie had to compete with all other
movies, as they were not sold in blocks any longer.
17
   See Balio (1990), Stuart (1982) and Kindem (2000).


                                                     13
                                               Gil and Spiller



production activity, because of the increased competition from television, the distributors

involved in the Paramount antitrust case were further affected, as their use of block

booking as contractual practice was not allowed from 1948 on.18 Thus, their demand for

creativity after 1948 must have increased by more than that of other “non-Paramount”

integrated distributors.

         A second empirical implication arises from the fact that the demand for creativity

was also affected by theater ownership. By owning theaters, distributors were able to

assure release of their less appealing movies even if no independent theaters demanded

them. Therefore theater divorcement by the five integrated “Paramount” distributors (the

Big Five) must also have decreased the proportion of internal/contractual production in

these firms in relation to other non-forwardly integrated firms. This must hold across

years within the group of “Paramount” distributors and when compared to other

distributors.

         A third empirical implication arises from the volatility over time in the make-or-

buy decision. When demand for creativity is relatively low, changes in movie portfolios

can be adjusted mostly by internal production/contracting. With increased demand for

creativity, unexpected changes in the required movie portfolio must be satisfied

opportunistically by internally producing/contracting or acquiring a movie as needed.

Thus, with the increase in the demand for creativity, we should observe an increase in the

volatility of make-or-buy decisions. Thus, our third empirically testable implication is

that increases in demand for creativity among “Paramount” distributors resulting from the

block booking ban and theater divorcement must bring an increase in the volatility of

their make/or buy decisions.

           A fourth empirical implication arises from the need to use other firms’ assets to

produce more creative films. During the 1940s and 1950s studios utilized long-term

contracts with their actors and actresses19 who specialized in different genres. The

increased demand for creative content increased the demand for assets and agents that

were held under long-term relationships with other studios, and originated the

collaboration of different studios in the production of a movie. Thus, our fourth empirical

implication is that we should observe an increase in the number of co-productions

(movies produced by more than one studio) when the demand for creativity increases and

studios are not able to adjust their production technologies fast enough (which we argue

is the case).20

           Finally, we would expect that all these changes in the production process would

have an effect on the overall quality of movies in the industry due to the reorganization of

production and the use of more creative inputs in each individual movie. The fifth

testable empirical implication is then that the increase in demand for creativity should, in

fact, bring about higher quality movies. In particular, this shift should have increased the

quality of movies produced in-house relative to the quality of movies produced by

independent firms and distributed by integrated distributors.

           In the following section we present the data used to test these implications and

describe the organization of the industry during the two decades under study.

Data Description

In this study we combine information from two data sets. The first data set comes from

the American Film Institute catalog.21 From this data set, we obtain information on movie

length in minutes, production companies and distributors. A movie is defined as a co-

production if more than one studio takes part in the production process.

           The second information source is the IMDBPro data set.22 From this data set we

use information on movie characteristics such as genre, IMDB ratings, award

nominations, and production budgets for a limited number of movies.

           In total we have information for 8126 movies that convert to 8848 movie-studio

pairs (due to co-productions). All films in our study were released between 1940 and

1960. These movies were distributed by approximately 300 distributors and produced by

roughly 1250 production companies.

           As shown in Figure I, II and III below, the structure of the industry did not remain

constant across these two decades. Figure I shows that the number of movies released

decreased from 500 in the early 1940s to roughly 200 by the end of the 1950s. The figure

also segments the number of movies by type of organizational form governing the

distribution of a movie. The number of movies produced by independent studios

(regardless of the distribution channel) was roughly constant (see blue and red lines),

whereas the number of movies produced internally by integrated distributors decreased

substantially and is responsible to a large extent for the wide decrease in the industry.

                  Figure I already provides evidence concerning the first empirical implication, as

the number of movies produced internally by integrated distributors decreased

substantially with the increase in creativity demand.

                  Figure II provides the evidence on the number of producers by organizational

form. Figure II shows that the number of independent producers increased significantly

after 1946 and peaked again after 1956. The number of integrated producers did not

change over the two decades under study.23 When combining the evidence from Figure I

and Figure II, we can see that the decrease in the number of movies produced by

integrated producers did not follow from a decline in the number of integrated producing

companies. As Figure I shows, the overall decrease in number of movies released in the

  In Figure II we define “Integrated Producers Outsourcing” as those production companies that had their
own distributing branch and did use other companies to distribute some of their movies. Similarly, we
define “Integrated Producers Not Outsourcing” as those producers that distribute all their movies through
their own distributing branch.

internally by the integrated distributors.

         Finally, Figure III presents the number of distributors by organizational form.

Figure III shows that the distribution market did not shrink either. Even though the

number of distributors defined as “Integrated Distributors Not Outsourcing” decreased

significantly from 10 to 2 between 1940 and 1960,24 the number of independent

distributors more than compensated for this decrease by increasing from 7 to 25 during

the same period. The number of “Integrated Distributors Outsourcing” remained roughly

constant around 10 since 1946.

         The decrease in the number of movies released and the increase in the number of

production and distribution companies are jointly explained by the disintegration of

dominant firms in the 1940s followed by a massive entry of independent producers

through co-productions. The data also suggest that the increase in demand for creativity

decreased the number of movies distributed by existing distribution companies by more

than the decrease in the market size for movies, and thus allowed other (new

independent) distributors to enter the market.

Empirical Implementation

In this section we describe the methodology we use to test for the implications outlined

earlier. We combine regression and graphical analysis to bring evidence on the validity of

our testable implications.

         Make-or-Buy Decisions

The first and second testable implications state that the increase in demand for creativity

will lower the amount of internal production, and that block booking banning and theater

divorcement will magnify this effect. To test these implications we use a difference-on-

24
  In Figure III, we define an “Integrated Distributors Outsourcing” as a distributor that distributes movies
of its own and movies produced by others, and “Integrated Distributors Not Outsourcing” as distributors
who do not distribute movies produced by others.


                                                      19
                                           Gil and Spiller



differences approach where we not only compare make-or-buy decisions before and after

the increase in demand for creativity due to the introduction of television, but also

compare make-or-buy decisions across different types of distributors (“Paramount” and

“non-Paramount” distributors) to test for the second implication. We estimate OLS

regressions of the the share of internally produced movies over all movies distributed by

distributor j in year t (VIjt) using specification (1):

        VIjt = α0 + α1*Paramountj + α2*Post_1948t + α3*Paramountj*Post_1948t +

                       + α4*Theaters?jt + δj + δt + ujt,              (1)

where the explanatory variables are a dummy variable “Paramountj” that takes value 1 if

distributor j is one of the eight distributors in the Paramount antitrust case and 0 if

otherwise; a dummy variable “Post_1948t” that takes value 1 if year t is after 1948, and 0

otherwise; the interaction of the previous two; and a dummy variable “Theaters?jt” that

takes value 1 if distributor j owned theaters in year t, and 0 otherwise. We also add to the

analysis distributor and year fixed effects to control for differences in unobservable

characteristics across firms and years.

        Directly related to the first testable implication is the question of how distributors

adjust to changes in genre popularity. They may adjust to these changes by either

producing movies of new genres internally or by buying from independent producers, and

these rates of adjustment may be determined by previous decisions of genre

specialization. For this reason, we study vertical integration decisions by genre and

distributor by estimating specification (2) such that

              VIjkt = α0 + α1*#Movieskt + α2*#Moviesjt +                      (2)

                    + α3*#Movieskt*δt +α4*#Moviesjt*δt + δjk + δt + ujkt,




                                                 20
                             The Organizational Implications of Creativity



where now the dependent variable VIjkt is the share of movies of genre k distributed by

distributor j in year t that is internally produced. The two main explanatory variables are

the total number of movies in genre k in the industry in year t #Movieskt and the total

number of movies distributed by distributor j in year t #Moviesjt. We also include in the

regression analysis genre-distributor and year fixed effects, as well as the interactions of

the two main explanatory variables with year fixed effects. The total number of movies

distributed by each distributor j in a given year t proxies for scale effects at the firm level

and the total number of movies of genre k in year t in the industry captures changes in

demand (popularity) across genres in different years.

       The third empirically testable implication states that an increase in demand for

creativity will increase the volatility of make-or-buy decisions because internal

production is no longer a low cost alternative to high cost outside movies. To study the

evolution of the volatility of production and distribution decisions by producers and

distributors, we compute a measure of volatility of the number of movies produced or

distributed that can be compared across firm types and years and investigate its evolution

from 1940 to 1960. Take, for example, the volatility of the number of movies produced

by a production company. To compute such a measure of volatility, we first estimate

OLS regressions using specification (3):

                  Number of Moviesjt = α0 + δj + δt + ujt,                   (3)

where the dependent variable is the number of movies produced by producer j in year t

(but in other instances will be the number of movies distributed by distributor j in year t),

and the right-hand side of the regression equation only contains a constant and firm and

year fixed effects. From specification (3), we obtain the residuals and the predicted




                                                  21
                                         Gil and Spiller



values of the dependent variable and create a third variable that is the result of dividing

the estimated residual by the predicted value. We call this third variable the standardized

residual. The standardized residual becomes an approximation of the percentage variation

from the mean of the dependent variable that is comparable across firms and years. We

then calculate the standard deviation per year, group of firms and decision that we are

comparing. The standard deviation of the standardized residual is our measure of

volatility. We repeat this same exercise for all make-or-buy decisions for integrated

producers and integrated distributors.

       To examine the third testable implication, we create a series of volatility for

number of movies produced by integrated and independent producers, and number of

movies distributed by independent and integrated distributors. For integrated distributors

only, we create a series reflecting the volatility of number of movies bought and made

and we break these series into volatility of those distributors with theaters and those

without. We plot these series and observe their different behavior across time.

       Co-Productions

Our fourth testable implication is that the increased demand for creativity will increase

the number of co-produced movies. To explore this implication we calculate the share of

co-produced movies per organizational form (independent distributor, independent

movie-integrated distributor, and integrated movie-integrated distributor) and plot it

against time.

       Supply of Creativity

The fifth testable implication states that the changes in the organization of production that

followed the increase in demand for creativity had an effect on the use of creative inputs




                                               22
                             The Organizational Implications of Creativity



and the supply of creative output. To test this last implication, we study the evolution of a

few variables such as production budgets, the number of genres a movie qualifies for,

IMDB ratings and nominations for Oscars, Golden Globes and international film

festivals.

        More creative inputs under a period of higher demand for creativity will become

more expensive and therefore we study the evolution of production budgets under

different organizational forms to test whether integrated distributors reacted more to the

increase in demand for creativity than independent distributors did. For this purpose, we

undertake two types of analysis. We first graph the evolution of the average movie

production budget by organizational form across time and then estimate OLS regressions

of the product budget in US$ of movie i (Budgeti) in specification (4):

             Budgeti = α0 + α1*Post_1950?i + α2*[Indep Movie, Integ Distrib]i +

   + α3*[Integ Movie, Integ Distrib]I + α4*[Indep Movie, Integ Distrib]i*Post_1950?i +

               + α5*[Integ Movie, Integ Distrib]i*Post_1950?i + ui,          (4)

where the unit of observation is a movie and the explanatory variables are a dummy

variable “Post 1950?” that takes value 1 if movie i was released after 1950 and 0

otherwise, a dummy variable [Indep Movie, Integ Distrib] that takes value 1 if movie i

was distributed by an integrated distributor but produced by a different firm and 0

otherwise, and a dummy variable [Integ Movie, Integ Distrib] that takes value 1 if movie

i was produced and distributed by the same firm and 0 if otherwise. We also include

interactions between the organizational form dummies and “Post 1950?” This

specification takes as a control group movies produced by independent producers and

distributed by non-integrated distributors in the 1940s.




                                                  23
                                        Gil and Spiller



       We also examine graphically the time series of the average number of genres per

movie, IMDB ratings, nominations to the Oscars’ four main categories, nominations to

best picture at the Golden Globes, and awards from the Berlin, Cannes and Venice

international film festivals. These are movie characteristics that are proportional to movie

complexity and movie quality. The number of genres per movie is a direct measure of

movie complexity given the genre studio specialization commented above. IMDB ratings

are direct measure of the audience opinion on a given movie quality. Finally, the

nominations to different award, in the US and abroad, are a different measure of movie

quality.

Empirical Results

In this section we show the results of applying the methodology described in the previous

section. We divide the results into different subsections that illustrate the consequences of

the increase in demand for creativity on make-or-buy decisions on levels of internal

production, volatility, incidence of co-productions and the supply of creativity

respectively.

       Make-or-Buy Decisions

We start by testing the first and second empirical implications that posit an increase in

creativity demand will decrease the incidence of vertical integration. The first empirical

implication indicates that the increase in demand for creativity should decrease internal

production more in “Paramount” distributors than in “non-Paramount” distributors. We

test this by running OLS regressions on specification (1) below. We show the results in

Table I below.

Results from column (1) show that all firms as a group decreased their percentage of in-

house production after 1948 by 9 percentage points. This result is a combination of the

effect on “Paramount” and “non-Paramount” firms as can be seen in columns (5) and (6).

The former decreased vertical integration by 19 percentage points after 1948 while the

latter did not change their behavior much.25 This result is consistent with the first testable

implication.

           The second testable implication is that forward integrated theaters will decrease

internal production after separating from their theaters. We test this by adding to the OLS

regressions in Table I a dummy variable that equals 1 if the distributor owns theaters and

0 otherwise. This variable varies across distributors and within distributors across time.

Results in Table I show that forward integrated distributors distributed 20 to 50

percentage points more of in-house production when they owned a theater branch (see



25
     Most of the Non-Paramount firms are not integrated. Thus, the relevant results are those in column (5).

consistent with the prediction of our second testable implication.

       In Table II we show the results of estimating specification (2). This table sheds

light on how distributors adjust make-or-buy decisions to changes in movie genre

popularity within their chosen movie portfolio. The results indicate that bigger

distributors are more likely to integrate more production across all genres. The results

also show, controlling for year fixed effects, that sudden positive changes in genre

popularity are negatively correlated with the share of in-house production (see columns

2-4). This is consistent with the notion that distributors adjust to unexpected demand

changes for certain genres in demand by licensing movies produced elsewhere.

       The third testable implication is that an increase in creativity demand will increase

volatility in make-or-buy decisions. Therefore, we study if this is the case for decisions

in the number of movies produced and distributed for producers and distributors

respectively, and the number of movies made and bought for integrated distributors only

with and without theaters. We use as a measure of volatility the standard deviation of the

percentage deviation over the predicted value of the number of movies produced or

distributed (depending on the case).

                 Figure IV above shows the evolution of the volatility of the number of movies

produced between 1940 and 1960 for integrated (with a distribution branch) and

independent producers (without a distribution branch). The graph shows that decisions of

integrated producers are more volatile than decisions of independent producers during the

whole period. This higher volatility is the result of integrated producers’ ability to use

internal production as an adjustment margin to available external production. We also

observe that the volatility of decisions of both types increased substantially in the late

1950s as we predicted.

                 Figure V below compares the volatility in the number of movies distributed by

independent and integrated distributors.

This figure shows that the volatility of integrated distributors is consistently higher than

that of independent distributors, and that the gap between the two increased from 1955 to

1960. There is also an increase in the volatility of integrated distributors that may be due

to the increase in demand for creativity and its organizational implications as described

above.

                             Since Table II suggests that firms adjust their internal production to changes in

genre popularity, we hypothesize that the observed increases in volatility could come

from unexpected changes in genre popularity. For this reason, we repeat the exercise in

specification (3) adding a genre fixed effect. Thus, the left-hand side variable represents

a measure of volatility that controls for genre composition. Figure VI plots this volatility

series. Figure VI shows that the volatility of the number of movies distributed by

independent and integrated distributors is low and equal across distributor types until the



                                                                                                         28

early 1950s. The volatility of both increased equally in the 1950s. The contrasting

evidence in Figure V and Figure VI indicates that independent and integrated distributors

adjust equally within genres, but integrated distributors have an easier time adjusting

across genres, explaining why the volatility of the number of movies distributed overall

by integrated distributors is higher than that of independent distributors.

                             We can also analyze, for integrated distributors, the volatility of the number of

movies made versus the volatility of the number of movies bought. Figure VII below

shows that during the 1940s the volatility of movies distributed was due primarily to the

number of movies bought. As the demand for creativity increased, the volatility of

movies bought decreased drastically, while the volatility of movies made increased,

suggesting that the margin of adjustment shifted from outsourcing to in-house production.

                        As in the previous case, we compute the volatility of movies made and movies

bought controlling for genre (Figure VIII below) and observe that, controlling for genre,

the volatility of movies made increased from 1953 on.26 Figure VIII, when compared to

Figure VII, suggests that integrated distributors not only adjust their movie portfolio

across make-or-buy decisions but also across decisions on what genres to market.

      There was a volatility spike in 1948, but the sustained increased took place in the 1950s.

                      Next we examine differences in volatility in make-or-buy decisions between

integrated distributors that were forward integrated into exhibition in the early 1940s and

integrated distributors that were never integrated into exhibition in our sample. We do

this because owning theaters allowed these distributors to assure release of many of their

movies that may not have found an alternative outlet. We show volatility series of both

distributor types in Figure IX.

                Figure IX above suggests that the volatility of movies made and bought for

distributors with theaters was lower than for those that owned no theaters. It is also

notable that these four series converge to the same levels since the owners of theaters

were forced to separate from their exhibition branches as part of the 1948 Supreme Court

resolution in the Paramount antitrust case.

                 Finally, we analyze the volatility of movies made and bought for integrated

distributors with and without theaters controlling by genre. We show the volatility series

in Figure X above. We observe that the volatility of movies made and movies bought

across distributors with and without theaters is the same. This evidence combined with

the evidence in the previous figure (without controlling for genre) suggests that

distributors with theaters adjust better across genres than distributors without theaters.

                 Co-Productions

The fourth testable implication states that an increase in demand for creativity will lead to

an increase in the incidence of co-productions. Co-productions allow firms not only to

share production costs but also share ideas and skills that eventually turn into more

creative movies. The increase in co-productions at the end of the 1940s and throughout

the 1950s was the first step towards the production process that takes place currently,

where separate inputs are added together for the making of a movie and disintegrated



                                                                    33

afterwards. During the 1940s, assets (actors, studios, script writers, etc) still belonged to

studios, so co-production was the most flexible way to combine different assets for

different movies.

                               Figure XI below depicts two regularities. The first regularity is that the percentage

of co-productions increased substantially after 1950 and increased under all

organizational forms. The second regularity is that even though the series of co-

production of independent movies distributed by integrated distributors is more volatile

than the other two series before and after 1950, all three series appear to have become

more volatile after 1950.

                               Both regularities are consistent with the fourth testable implication that an

increase in the demand for creativity (roughly after 1950) led to an increase in the

number of co-productions. Integrated distributors co-produced more movies and

distributed more co-produced independent movies. The general increase in demand for



                                                                            34

creativity also increased the number of movies co-produced by independent producers

and distributed by independent distributors.

       Supply of Creativity

The fifth empirical implication states that the reorganization of production due to the

increase in the demand for creativity will have an effect on the use of creative inputs and

the supply of creative output. In particular, we expect to observe changes in production

costs (more creative inputs are more rare and therefore more expensive), the number of

genres per movie as a way to measure movie complexity and creativity, and award

nomination and IMDB ratings as a way to measure for movie quality.

       We start the analysis by examining time series of production budgets in Figure

XII. We have production budget information for a selected sample of 518 movies from

IMDB. Figure XII shows the evolution of average movie production costs in our sample.

We observe that costs across organizational forms are very similar during the whole

sample period. Also, costs of independently distributed movies were consistently lower

than costs of movies distributed by integrated distributors during the 1950s.

               Next, we show in Table III the results of estimating specification (4). Column (1)

shows, not surprisingly, that movies in our sample were on average more expensive to

produce during the 1950s than in the 1940s. This increase is probably caused by both the

increase in demand for creativity and the inflation during those years. Column (2) also

shows that movies produced by an integrated distributor are generally more expensive

than movies produced by independent producers. Finally, column (3) that movies

distributed by integrated distributors (produced in-house or outsourced) were the primary

driver of production budget growth during these two decades, reflecting the tendency

towards higher quality required from those distributors.27

               These findings are consistent with our fifth testable implication. Because of the

increase in demand for creativity, studios demanded more creative inputs that were more
27
  Our results also show that independently produced movies distributed by integrated distributors cost less
to produce than movies distributed by independent distributors and less that those movies produced and
distributed by integrated studios. These results are at odds with Robins (1993). In his paper, Robins finds
that in the case of Warner Brothers films produced by independent producers actually cost more than those
produced in-house.

expensive, and therefore spent more per movie production during the 1950s. The budgets

in in-house productions increased and independently produced movies distributed by

integrated studios cost more.

        We can also examine other creative dimensions of movies such as the number of

genres per movie, and nominations for Oscars and other awards. 28 The number of genres

that a movie is categorized into is a good measure of movie creativity since studios

specialized in the production of specific genres in the 1940s (see Chisholm (1993)), and

therefore producing a movie that qualified for other genres involved the use of new and

existing assets and expertise in novel ways.



28
  The IMDB movie ratings can be seen as another measure of creativity. These ratings range between 0
and 10, and are self-reported. However, because they are self-reported, they engender two major
weaknesses. First, there is no rating for a considerable number of movies, possibly because these movies
are of poor quality or because they are older and current raters are not aware of them. Also, older movies
from independent distributors may be less commercialized than those of integrated distributors that have
survived over the years, which may affect ratings in a way completely unrelated to movie quality. For these
reasons we decided not to report these results here. Results are available upon request.

                            Figure XIV shows the percentage of movies with an Oscar nomination by

organizational form (the Oscar nominations considered here are Best Picture, Best

Director, Best Actor and Best Actress). Note that independent movies and movies

produced and distributed by integrated distributors exchanged relative positions in

consecutive years up to 1947. After 1947, “integrated” movies did consistently better

than independently distributed movies with the exception of 1960. The “success” rate of

independent movies distributed by integrated firms is the most volatile of the three series

and goes from 0 nominations to the top number of nominations in consecutive years.

In Figure XV we add to the Oscar nominations the number of nominations for best movie

in a series of other award ceremonies and international film festivals (Golden Globe,

Berlin, Cannes and Venice).30 These other awards were created during the period of time

under study, which explains the series’ increase in the late 1950s for all three

organizational forms. Despite this limitation, we are still able to observe how movies

under different organizational forms perform relative to each other.

                             As in Figure XIV, even after the introduction of new award nominations and

international film festivals which may have included other criteria and maintained greater

independence from the power circles in Hollywood, the success rates of “integrated”

movies are higher than that of independent movies during the 1950s. In this figure, even

the success rate of independent movies distributed by integrated distributors is




30
  It is important to show how nominations on other award ceremonies evolved because Oscar nominations
may have been driven by circles of power in Hollywood. Foreign film festivals are independent of this and
are more likely to nominate films only for their artistic value and not connections.

consistently higher than that of independent movies distributed by independent

distributors.



Conclusions

In this paper we investigate the organizational implications of creativity. Among all the

issues that organizations need to deal with when managing creative inputs, we

concentrate on make-or-buy decisions. The perils of outsourcing for distributors arise

from the unavoidability of the winner’s curse in an environment in which distributors are

undifferentiated and the nobody knows principle operates equally across the board. We

compared this to the hazards of internal production where control over production

processes and costs may be drastically hindered when managing increasingly more

creativity-intense goods. Thus, when the demand for creativity is low internal production

becomes relatively more attractive, while when the demand for creative content is high,

the gap between both options narrows.

        Since we seldom find scenarios where an increase in demand for creative content

is visible and measurable, this is a difficult empirical prediction to test. In this paper, we

use data from the US motion picture industry during the 1940s and 1950s where, due to

two simultaneous shocks (the introduction of television and judicially imposed changes

in the contractual structure of the industry), the demand for creative content increased.

We find that the number and percentage of movies produced in-house declined

significantly during this period. Also consistent with the organizational implications that

we derive, we show that the volatility of make-or-buy decisions increased during the

1950s relative to the 1940s. We show that part of the difference in volatility between




                                                  41

independent and integrated distributors is explained by the ability of integrated

distributors to adjust within and across genres due to changes in genre popularity, as well

as changes in overall demand for creativity. We are also able to document an increase in

the number of co-productions that took place from 1950 onward and argue this was

another method to increase the use of creative inputs into the production process. Finally,

we look at outcomes of creative outputs and show that these changes in the organization

of production had consequences on production budgets, the number of genres per movie,

award nominations, and IMDB ratings.

       Although we show patterns in the data that demonstrate that increases in demand

for creativity had major consequences on the way the industry organized production, we

cannot easily identify which of the two major shocks drove which changes. Future work

should address and differentiate the effect of the introduction of television from the effect

of changes in contractual practices on organizational decisions. Similarly, we focused

primarily on make-or-buy decisions and co-productions, but organizations have many

other dimensions that creativity is likely to have organizational implications for.

Examples include pay for creativity or authority and decision delegation in the presence

of creativity within an organization. These are all topics for future creative research.
