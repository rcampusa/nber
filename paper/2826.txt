                 THE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS OF INFLATION
                     ON HOUSING CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT


                                   ABSTRACT




    In a mean-variance portfolio choice model, each of 3,578 households

from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances has calculated preferences over

housing, other consumption, and risk.   Each household is constrained such

that any owner-occupied housing in portfolio must match housing services

consumed.   Corporate taxes are modeled in some detail, and regression

coefficients are used to estimate the adjusted gross income, itemizable

deductions, and statutory marginal tax rate of each household.

     General equilibrium simulation results indicate that inflation does not

necessarily increase total owner housing.     Top-bracket households increase

their owner housing, while others switch into bonds.     The greater number of

households in low-brackets implies that the homeownership rate can fall even

if the amount of owner housing rises.

                 The General Equilibrium Effects of Inflation
                     on Housing Consumption and Investment

                       James Berkovec and Don Fullerton1



    Traditional models of housing and taxation find that inflation raises

the cost of business capital, reduces the cost of homeownership, and shifts

capital toward owner-occupied housing.    Results froa theoretical (Feldstein,

1982) and econometric (Summers, 1981) models suggest that inflation raises

the net return to housing.    In a general equilibrium model with multiple

consumers, Hendershott and Hu (1983) simulate the amount of the shift toward

houaing.   In a partial equilibrium model with housing supply, Poterba (1984)

finds that a large fraction of housing price appreciation can be explained

by its preferential tax treatment with inflation.

     In general, the cost of business capital rises because of historical
cost depreciation, FIFO inventory accounting, and the taxation of nominal

capital gains.    The cost of housing falls, essentially because nominal

interest payments are deducted while capital gains are untaxed.

     In this paper, we show that these conclusions do not necessarily hold.

We use a very disaggregate general equilibrium model of household portfolio

choice.    Inflation does not raise the cost of business capital in this

model, deapite nominal depreciation and capital gains taxes, because the

greater interest deductions at the 46 percent corporate rate outweigh the

combined taxation of household nominal interest receipts.       In the "open

economy" model, where the real interest rate is fixed by international flows

of debt, inflation actually reduces the net cost of funds and thus the

corporate cost of capital.    High tax brackets are still encouraged to own

housing, but low brackets shift into bonds.   Aggregate housing does

increase with inflation in this model.

     The model assumes perfect markets in a single period with fixed labor,

fixed wealth, constant returns to scale production, and no excess profits.

It makes four important contributions, however.   First, any owner-occupied

housing in a portfolio is constrained to match that household's consumption

of housing services in utility.   Second, rather than rely on 10 or 20

"representative" consumers, we calculate preference parameters for each of

3,578 observations from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances and evaluate

supplies and demands for each household at each trial price vector.    Third,

we integrate econometric estimation of parameters with calibration methods

that insure overall consistency of the benchmark equilibrium.   Fourth, we

model the actual 1983 tax law including detailed provisions of the corporate

tax system, estimation of each household's adjusted gross income, endogenous

decisions to itemize deductions, determination of each household's tax

bracket at each iteration, and calculation of tax paid from the schedule.

     These contributions turn out to be important for our results.     In the

"closed economy" version of our model, inflation helps the poor by raising

the real interest rate and hurts the rich by reducing their real after-tax

returns.   The sama relative effects appear in the "open economy" version.

Also, tenure choice in our logit model is determined primarily by income and

                                                                taxes and
demographic factors, while the amount of housing is affetted by

relative returns.   This distinction is important for an increase in the rate

 of inflation, because the greater number of households in low tax bracketa

 causes a slight decrease in the total number of owner-occupants, while the

                                                       increase in the total
 greater wealth in high tax brackets leads to a slight

 amount of owner housing.

I, The Model

     Each household allocates its fixed wealth to a vector of assets A,

including positive or negative riskless deht                    D     and nonnegative amounts of

risky corporate equity            E, rental housing          R, and owner housing        OH.   The

vector of net returns is           r —                                Following Slemrod (1982)
                                              (r0, rE rR     r0).

risk aversion, and       2        is the variance          of income.     This variance is

calculated from     A'XA, where                 is    a pre-specified varisnce-covsrisnce

matrix that is affected by taxes.                   Observed rental holdings do not follow a

strict mean-variance framework, so we add a household specific intercept                              1
to rental holdings.         Also, because the typical taxpayer holds only a subset

of these assets, we consider the choice among eight "regimes," with and

without holding each of the three risky assets.                       The household first chooses

the best allocation of wealth and consumption within each regime, and then

it chooses the regime with the highest overall utility:

the choice about whether to owner-occupy.                           First order conditions are used

to solve for demands in the four renter regimes, but the extra constraint

that    H —      OH     prevents analytical solution in the four owner regimes.                        Thus

we iterate to find the utility maximizing amount of housing for each of the

four owner regimes for each household, for each trial price vector.

        In the competitive corporate sector, output is produced according                              to:

that    L        is fixed, we can solve for capital demand and the equilibrium wage.

        Taxes include a flat 10 percent payroll tax on business use of labor,

and a corporate tax at rate                   u      (— .46) on income from five assets including

equipment, structures, land, inventories, and intangibles.                               Each asset

depreciates at exponential rate                       d   and receives allowances with present

value       z.       Following Hall and Jorgenson (1967),                     the coat of capital is:

        The Survey of Consumer Finances provides much information on asset

holdings, but no data on personal taxes.                            We found 20 income and demographic

variables that appeared both in this survey and in the Treasury Department's

individual tax file, an extensive elaboration of 195,000 actual tax returns

that includes imputations for house value, rent paid, itemizable deductions

of nonitemizers, and other information.                         The Treasury was able to run 24 OLS

regressions for us, using the 20 selected variables to predict adjuated

gross income after exemptions, and to predict itemizable deductions; for

single, married, and head of household filers; for renters and for owners;

and for both the 1983 law and the Tax Reform Act of 1986.                                  See Berkovec and

Fullerton (1988) for more detail on the model and the 1986 Act.

     For each household            in our sample, we apply the Treasury coefficients to

obtain AOl and itemizahle deductions.                          The latter is compared to the

standard deduction, and the remaining tax base is applied to the statutory

rate brackets to determine the marginal rate                                  r   and actual tax paid.   The

four real net rates of return for that household are then:

     We use Treasury coefficients and all initial asset holdings for taxable

income in the base case, but equstions (5) govern changes in simulation.                    In

the variance-covarisnce       mstrix, each row and each column involving equity is

multiplied by [e(l-g)+(l-e)(l-r)], those involving rental housing are

multiplied by (l-g)/(l-rz), and those for owner housing are unaffected by

taxes.    We use Newton's algorithm to solve for              r, r,    q   snd a tax scalar

also used for          and the the wage derives from equation            (3).

     The initial real interest rate and inflation rate are each set at 5

percent.     Based on Ibottson and Siegel (1983), we set the real return to

equity at 12 percent.        The assumed rent is II percent, yielding 7.2 percent

after maintenance, depreciation, and property tax.                 Our 198& paper provides

the variance-covariance matrix and describes how each household's holdings

are used to solve for its        a,   fi,   and   y.   The   6.   are assumed to be

functions of exogenous variables such as wealth, age, and household size.

These parameters are estimated by a logit model which is used to predict

regime probabilities for each household as a function of the exogenous

variables and of       13.   calculated from equation (1).           These probabilities are

 then used in the simulations.          That is, each household is weighted by regime

probabilities as well as by corrected sample weights.                  The probabilities in

 the benchmark equilibrium aggregate to a 62 percent homeownership rate

 overall, with a range from 38 percent for households with incomes under

 $5,000 per year to 89 percent for those over $200,000 per year.

         Finally, the government in this model collects taxes, provides lump-sum

 transfers to each household, provides rental housing, uses debt, and buys

 some corporate output.        Each of these amounts is fixed in the simulations.

The government's rental housing is set as the otiginal difference between

household ownership and household demand; its debt is set as the original

difference between household supply and corporate demand; its purchases are

set as the original difference between tax revenue and other expenses.



IT. Results

     In the base case, untaxed households earn 10 percent nominal interest

before   5   percent inflation, while top bracket households earn 5 percent

after-tax before 5 percent inflation (for a zero real net return).      Still,

owner housing constitutes the largest asaet for all income groups up to the

top ($200,000/year) group, which holds more equity and rental housing.

     Table 1 shows selected results from the closed economy model where the

5 percent inflation was changed to zero or 10 percent, with no other changes

in parameters or tax rules. These simulations give some indication of the

effects of inflation through a given tax system, and the zero inflation

simulations indicate the effects of a policy change to complete indexation.

     Most results are expressed as ratios of the simulated value to the base

value, so the first row indicates that no inflation (or full indexation)

would reduce the real interest rate received by untaxed households by 45

percent, and that an increaae from S to 10 percent inflation would increase

their real return by 57 percent.      Since untaxed households receive the

actual market returns which are shown at the bottom of the table, these

percentages correspond to real interest rates of .0275,     .05, and .0796, for

inflation rates of zero, 5, and 10 percent, respectively.      Since inflation

increases the real return to debt without a big effect on other assets, it

increases the capital income and utility of low—bracket households.
                                       -8-




    At the other end of the income scale, inflation reduces the reel net

interest rate from .014 at no inflation to   -   .010 at 10 percent inflation.

The table shows that the real net rate of return for top-bracket households

falls for all four assets (but it falls least for owner-occupied housing).

Inflation reduces their capital income and utility.      Thus the first general

result we wish to emphasize is that moderate inflation seems to have a

progressive effect in the redistribution of capital income.       (The wage rate

does not change very much, but we have not modeled other effects such as

sticky wages, trensfers, or prices.)

     In the closed economy model, the effect of inflation on the nominal

interest rate (3i/Dir) must be greater than one in order to maintain a real

after-tax interest rate.    Empirical estimates suggest that interest rates

rise only point-for-point with inflation, however.       To capture this

alternative, we model a stylized "open" economy where the real interest rate

is fixed at 5 percent by international flows of debt (Hansaon and Stuart,

1986).   Equity and housing returns still vary, as they must be owned

domestically.    Our first result about the progressive effect of inflation is

also clear in the open economy version of our model.

     The bottom of the table for the closed economy indicates thst inflation

raises the corporate cost of capital                           We capture the

effect of historical cost depreciation, but this effect was over-estimated

in models with only depreciable assatg such as equipment and structures.

The weight on these assets is reduced here by the addition of inventories,

land, and intangibles.     We use only LIFO inventory accounting, assuming that

firma would minimize taxes, and we include the taxation of purely nominal

capital gains.    In this model, these tax-increasing effects of inflation are

almost completely offset by the tax-reducing effect that nominal interest is

deducted at the corporation's 46 percent rate and included by households at

much lower rates. If firms were allowed to increase their debt/equity ratio,

we might expect the cost of capital to fall.    In the open economy model,

fixed real interest rates mean that inflation actually reduces the cost of

finance and cost of capital. Thus our second general point is that inflation

does not necessarily raise the cost of business capital.         It does not even

increase the relative return to homeowning for low-tax brackets, although it

does increase the relative return to homeowning for high-tax brackets.

     The middle part of the table indicates that untaxed households nearly

eliminate their interest bearing assets at no inflation, and double them at

high inflation.     Equity and rental holdings are reduced the most at high

inflation.    Because of the incentive to hold bonds, the number of homeowners

in this bracket falls by 4 percent while the amount of owner housing falls

by 9 percent.     Thus low-income groups do not experience the incentive

effects of inflation discussed for high-bracket groups in most of the

literature.     Whether inflation increases owner housing becomes an empirical

question that depends on the relative number and wealth of households in

each tax situation.     It also becomes important   to measure   carefully the

actual marginal tax rates they face.

     Our model includes 3,578 weighted individual households, each with

specific asset holdings, adjusted gross income, and marginal tax rate.           We

cannot show disaggregate results here, but the table shows the two extremes.

In the 50 percent marginal rate bracket, when inflation reduces all real net

returns except that of owner housing, households reduce bond holdings

dramatically.     They would like to switch most capital into owner housing as

an asset, but they are constrained in this model to consume an equal amount

of housing services.     This constraint turns out to be important, because it
                                      -10-




limits the high-bracket shift into owner housing.      Thus they add more rental

housing to portfolios and increase owner housing by only 15 percent (when

inflation increases to 10 percent).     The next part of the table indicates

that low and high tax brackets offset each other in such a way that none of

the four assets changes much in total.       The third general point we wish to

emphasize is that inflation does        increase   the capital allocated to owner

housing in this model.   However, it does increase owner housing by 10

percent in the open economy version of our model.

     Our estimation of the logit model reveals that households are more

likely to shift in and out of equity or rental housing than they are to

shift in and out of homeownership.     As might be expected, income and

demographic characteristics are the major determinants of tenure choice.

The fourth main point of our paper, revealed in the table, is that taxes

have a small effect on homeownership rates but more effect on housing per

owner (but housing prices are held fixed in this model).       This distinction

is missed by Rosen and Rosen (1980) and others who estimate the effect of

relative price changes on homeownership rates only.

     Finally, our model emphasizes the importance of using individual

households and their separate amounts of wealth.        When inflation increases

from 5 to 10 percent, low-bracket households shift out of owner housing

while high-bracket households shift into owner housing.       The sheer number of

low-bracket households causes a decrease in the total number of owners,

while the wealth of the high-bracket households leads to a slight increaso

in the amount of owner housing.
