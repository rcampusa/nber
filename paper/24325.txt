                                         ABSTRACT

Measures of economic uncertainty are countercyclical, but economic theory does not provide
definite guidance on the direction of causation between uncertainty and the business cycle. This
paper proposes a new multi-country approach to the analysis of the interaction between
uncertainty and economic activity, without a priori restricting the direction of causality. We
develop a multi-country version of the Lucas tree model with time-varying volatility and show
that in addition to common technology shocks that affect output growth, higher-order moments of
technology shocks are also required to explain the cross country variations of the realized
volatility of equity returns. Using this theoretical insight, two common factors, a ‘real’ and a
‘financial’ one, are identified in the empirical analysis assuming different patterns of cross-
country correlations of country-specific innovations to real GDP growth and realized stock
market volatility. We then quantify the absolute and the relative importance of the common factor
shocks as well as country-specific volatility and GDP growth shocks. The paper highlights three
main empirical findings. First, it is shown that most of the unconditional correlation between
volatility and growth can be accounted for by the real common factor, which is proportional to
world growth in our empirical model and linked to the risk-free rate. Second, the share of
volatility forecast error variance explained by the real common factor and by country-specific
growth shocks amounts to less than 5 percent. Third, shocks to the common financial factor
explain about 10 percent of the growth forecast error variance, but when such shocks occur, their
negative impact on growth is large and persistent. In contrast, country-specific volatility shocks
account for less than 1-2 percent of the growth forecast error variance.

1        Introduction

It is well-established that empirical measures of uncertainty behave countercyclically in the US
and most other countries.1 This negative correlation can be seen in Figure 1 which shows
the country-specific contemporaneous correlations between stock market realized volatility and
real GDP growth for all countries in our panel together with their 95-percent error band. As
can be seen, for most countries, there is a strong negative association between volatility and
GDP growth. On average, this correlation is about −0.3, ranging from a maximum of slightly
more than −0.5 for Argentina to a minimum of just above zero for Peru. These correlations
are statistically significant in the case of most countries, with the exception of Austria, China,
Indonesia, Peru, and South Africa.

 Note. Correlations between (log) realized stock market volatility and real GDP growth. The dots represent the
 country-specific contemporaneous correlations, and the lines represent 95% confidence intervals. See equation
 (64) in Section 5 for a definition of realized volatility at quarterly frequency and Section 6 for a description of
 the data. Sample period: 1993:Q1-2011:Q2.


        Interpreting correlations in economic terms is difficult because causation can run in both
directions. From a theoretical standpoint, uncertainty can cause economic activity to slowdown
and even contract through a variety of mechanisms, both on the household side via precaution-
ary savings (Kimball, 1990) and on the firm side via investment delays or other forms of frictions
    1
    For the evidence on the US see, for example, Schwert (1989a) and Schwert (1989b) using the volatility of
aggregate stock market returns; Campbell et al. (2001), Bloom et al. (2007), and Gilchrist et al. (2013) using the
volatility of firm-level stock returns; Bloom et al. (2012) and Bachmann and Bayer (2013) using the volatility
of plant, firm, industry and aggregate output and productivity; Popescu and Smets (2010) and Bachmann et al.
(2013) using the behavior of expectations’ disagreement. For the evidence on other countries see, for instance,
Baker and Bloom (2013), Carriere-Swallow and Cespedes (2013), and Nakamura et al. (2017).

(see for instance Bernanke (1983), Dixit and Pindyck (1994) and, more recently, Bloom (2009)),
or financial frictions (Christiano et al., 2014, Gilchrist et al., 2013, Arellano et al., 2012).2 But
it is also possible that uncertainty responds to fluctuations in economic activity. For instance,
Bansal et al. (2005) show that fluctuations in expected growth directly affect asset valuations,
and information regarding future expected growth is encoded in current asset valuations. In-
deed, the theoretical literature highlights mechanisms through which spikes in uncertainty may
be the result of adverse economic conditions. Examples based on information and financial
frictions include Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006), Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012), and
Ilut et al. (2017).3 Theory, therefore, does not provide a definite guidance as how to inter-
pret the countercyclical nature of empirical measures of uncertainty. In this paper, we employ a
multi-country approach to the analysis of interaction between uncertainty and economic activity,
without restricting the direction of economic causation a priori.

    We first develop a simple multi-country version of the Lucas (1978) tree model with time-
varying volatility in which output or dividend growth rates are determined by a global technology
(or global growth) factor. We show that country-specific equity returns are driven by two shocks,
the first being the innovation to the global technology factor and the second being the innovation
to its volatility. In effect, we develop a consumption-based international asset pricing model
where at least two factors are needed to explain the cross country differences of equity returns,
even though only one factor is sufficient to explain cross country differences in output growth.

    This theoretical insight forms the basis of our econometric identification strategy. We mea-
sure uncertainty and activity with realized equity market volatility and real GDP growth, and
assume that volatility and growth can be driven by two common factors, as well as country-
specific volatility and growth shocks. We identify the two common factors by assuming that
innovations to volatility and growth have different patterns of correlations across countries.
Specifically, we suppose that one of the factors, which we label as “real”, is sufficient to model
cross-country correlations of output growth innovations, but a second factor, which we label
as “financial”, is also needed to model the cross-country correlations of volatility innovations.
   2
     Pricing frictions and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates can also amplify the impact of a volatility
shock (Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011), Basu and Bundick (2017), Born and Pfeifer (2014)).
   3
     Theoretically, the impact of uncertainty on activity could even be positive. For example Mirman (1971) shows
that, if there is a precautionary motive for savings, then higher volatility would lead to higher investments. Oi
(1961), Hartman (1976) and Abel (1983) show that if labor can be freely adjusted, the marginal revenue product
of capital is convex in price; in this case, uncertainty may increase the level of the capital stock and, therefore,
investment. However, these theories are not consistent with the countercyclical nature of uncertainty measures.




                                                         3
Specifically, we assume weak cross-country dependence of growth innovations and strong cross-
country dependence of volatility innovations (in the sense of Chudik et al., 2011). This is
equivalent to assuming that volatility innovations share at least one more strong common factor
than growth innovations. As the paper shows, under this condition, the real common factor is
proportional to world GDP growth, measured as the weighted average of country-specific growth
rates.4 Also, if it is further assumed that the volatility series share only one additional strong
factor as compared to the growth innovations, the loading matrix on the global factors becomes
triangular, with country-specific volatilities loading contemporaneously on both the real and
financial factor, and country growth rates loading only on the real factor. Under this condition,
the second factor, common only to the volatility series, can then be identified in our model
and measured in the data as the residual of a OLS regression of world volatility on world GDP
growth.

    Our identification assumptions are in accordance with patterns of cross-country correlation
that we document in the data, as well as statistical tests of the cross-country dependence of
the estimated country-specific volatility and growth innovations. For instance, for each country
in our sample, Figure 2 plots the average pair-wise correlation of volatility and output growth
series, together with the average across all countries.5 It can be seen that the average pair-wise
correlation across all countries for the volatility series is more than twice the average for the
growth series, at 0.58 and 0.27, respectively (the two dotted lines). This evidence suggests that,
indeed, the volatility series are much more correlated across countries than the growth series.6
We also find even more striking differences when we consider the cross-country dependence of
the volatility and growth innovations (See Section 7.2).

    To measure economic uncertainty, we build on the contributions of Andersen et al. (2001,
2003) and Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002, 2004) and compute realized equity price
volatility for a given quarter by using daily returns for 32 advanced and emerging economies
representing more than 90 percent of the world economy. We also consider several other proxies
for uncertainty and argue that they are either not suitable for the purpose of our analysis, or
    4
      Our identification assumption is compatible with the view that the global financial cycle (e.g. Rey, 2013)
is stronger than the international business cycle (e.g., Kose et al. (2003)), with realized equity market volatility
co-moving more closely across countries than real GDP growth does.
    5
      The average pair-wise correlation of a variable x for country i (i.e., each bar in Figure 2) is defined as the
average bilateral correlation of xit with xjt for all j 6= i. See equation (65) in Section 6 for a more formal definition.
    6
      We note here that these patterns of cross-country correlations are consistent with those documented by
Tesar (1995), Colacito and Croce (2011), and Lewis and Liu (2015) for consumption growth and equity returns,
respectively.

 with the remaining countries in the sample for volatility and GDP growth series, respectively. The dotted
 lines correspond to the overall average across all countries, equal to 0.55 and 0.27 for volatility and GDP

 contemporaneous correlation between xit and xjt for all j 6= i. See equation (64) in Section 5 for a definition of
 the realized volatility measure and Section 6 for a description of the data. Sample period: 1993:Q1-2011:Q2.


not readily available for a large number of countries over a sufficiently long period needed for
our analysis, or that they are closely associated with realized volatility.

   The empirical analysis yields a rich set of findings. Here we highlight three main results.
First, and most importantly, we find that the bulk of the negative correlations between volatility
and output growth observed in the data can be accounted for by the real common factor.
While unconditionally volatility behaves countercyclically for all but one of the 32 countries
in our sample, when we condition on the real factor, the correlations between volatility and
growth innovations become statistically insignificant in all but two emerging economies, and
quantitatively much smaller in all countries (changing sign in more than half of the cases). This
result does not depend on any auxiliary assumptions made, including that volatility series share
only one additional strong factor, and suggests that part of the explanatory power attributed
to uncertainty shocks in empirical studies of individual countries, considered in isolation from
the rest of the world economy, might be due to omitting such a real common factor from the
analysis.

   Second, the paper shows that the time-variation of country-specific volatility is explained
largely by shocks to the financial factor (with a share of forecast error variance larger than 60%)
and innovations to country-specific volatility series themselves (with a share of forecast error
variance of about 35 percent). Shocks to the real common factor and to country-specific growth

                                                         5
innovations explain less than 5 percent of volatility forecast error variance. We interpret this
evidence as suggesting that the endogenous component of country-specific volatility is small, or,
equivalently, that volatility measured at quarterly frequency is largely an exogenous process.

    Third and finally, we find that shocks to the common financial factor explain about 10%
of the forecast error variance of output growth, even though they have strong and persistent
contractionary effects. In contrast, country-specific volatility shocks explain only 1 − 2 per-
cent of country-specific forecast error growth variance. These results illustrate the quantitative
importance of distinguishing between common and country-specific volatility shocks. In our
empirical model, the forecast error variance of output growth is explained mainly by innovations
to country-specific growth rates themselves (with a share of at least 60% percent) and the real
common factor (with another 25% percent of the total).

    The paper is closely related to three strands of empirical literature on volatility and growth.7
The first strand acknowledges that uncertainty may be endogenous and could be driven by the
business cycle (See, for instance, Ludvigson et al. (2015), Clark et al. (2016), and Berger et al.
(2017)).8 A key difference relative to these contributions, is that our identification assumptions
apply to a cross-section of countries, as opposed to a single country considered in isolation from
the rest of the world, or the global economy analyzed as a single, closed economy. Also, our
identification strategy is simpler and consistent with observable cross-country correlation prop-
erties of the data and the estimated country-specific innovations as opposed to unobservable
theoretical conditions. Interestingly, despite the different approaches taken to proxy for uncer-
tainty and to separate endogenous responses to the business cycle from exogenous changes, we
reach similar conclusions that the endogenous component of country-specific volatility is small,
and exogenous shifts in uncertainty can be quite harmful for output growth. According to our
analysis, however, the latter applies only to the global component of uncertainty that cannot
be identified separately in the empirical frameworks that focus on individual countries, taken in
isolation from the rest of the world economy.

    A second strand of the literature has an international focus as in our paper. For instance,
Carriere-Swallow and Cespedes (2013) estimate a battery of 40 small open economy VARs for
advanced and emerging economies in which the US VIX index is assumed to be exogenous and
   7
     The literature is voluminous. See Bloom (2014) for a recent survey. Here we focus only on studies directly
related to our paper.

     Diebold and Yilmaz (2010) is an early attempt to separate macroeconomic and financial uncertainty without
addressing endogeneity issues.



                                                      6
identification is achieved imposing country-by-country restrictions. Baker and Bloom (2013)
study an unbalanced panel of 60 countries, documenting the counter-cyclicality of different
proxies for uncertainty, such as stock market volatility, sovereign bond yields volatility, exchange
rate volatility and GDP forecast disagreement, and use measures of disaster risk as instruments.
Hirata et al. (2012) estimate a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR), with factors computed based
on data for 18 advanced economies, and use a recursive identification scheme in which the
volatility variable is ordered first in the VAR. Carriero et al. (2017) estimate a large Bayesian
VAR with exogenously driven stochastic volatility to quantify the impact of macroeconomic
uncertainty on OECD economies. Hirata et al. (2012), Carriere-Swallow and Cespedes (2013),
Carriero et al. (2017) therefore, restrict the direction of economic causation from the outset of the
analysis assuming that the uncertainty proxy used is exogenous. In addition, in our framework,
countries interact with each other not only via the common factors, but also via an unrestricted
variance-covariance matrix of the country-specific volatility and growth innovations. In contrast,
in the above studies, economies can interact only via common factors or variables like the VIX
index, but do not interact with each other via other spillover channels.

   Our paper also relates to contributions in the finance literature. The closest analogous
to the framework we propose are mean-variance frontier models—discussed, for example, by
Black (1976) and French et al. (1987). In those models, however, the focus is on possible causal
relations between the stock market return and its volatility, via leverage effect or other channels.
We model the contemporaneous relation between country-specific GDP growth and stock market
volatility. We argue that one can think of GDP as the ‘dividend’ or the ‘cash flow’ associated
with the country stock market index. In this sense, the novelty of our modeling approach is
to work in the dividend-volatility (or cash flow-volatility) space rather than return-volatility
space. Indeed, our identification strategy exploits the fact that country-specific dividend growth
processes (the country GDP growth rates) are less correlated across countries as compared to
the cross-market correlation of equity volatilities.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the theoretical multi-country
model and derives country-specific equity returns and volatilities and shows how they are re-
lated to the underlying world technology factor and its higher moments. Section 3 considers
the econometric issues involved in identification of the real and financial factors using a static
version of our econometric multi-country model. Section 4 extends the analysis to a dynamic
setting. Section 5 considers the use of realized volatility as a proxy measure for uncertainty in

                                                 7
a multi-country setting. Section 6 reports key stylized facts of the data, including evidence on
the cross-country correlation structure of volatilities and output growth. Section 7 reports the
main empirical results of the paper on the comparison between unconditional and conditional
correlations between volatility and growth. Section 8 reports forecast error variance decompo-
sitions and discusses the corresponding empirical results. Section 9 presents impulse responses,
and Section 10 concludes. Some of the technical proofs and details of the data and their sources
are provided in the Appendix. Derivation of impulse responses and variance decompositions,
together with additional empirical results as well as selected country-specific results are reported
in a separate online supplement to the paper.

2    Equity Returns and Volatility in a Multi-country Business
     Cycle Model

In this section we set up a simple theoretical model of the business cycle with time-varying
volatility that will help to guide the empirical analysis. To this end we consider a multi-country
version of the Lucas (1978) tree model augmented with time-varying volatility that establishes a
link between changes in volatility and business cycle fluctuations via a common (global) risk-free
rate. Specifically, consider a world consisting of N economies (countries) indexed by i = 1, 2, ...N ,
of similar but not necessarily identical relative sizes, wit = O(N −1 ), where ΣN
                                                                                i=1 wit = 1. We

shall also assume that these economies have the same preferences, but are exposed differently
to a world growth factor, assumed to be exogenously given. The world growth factor is largely,



                                                  8
but not exclusively, driven by technological factors.

    Each economy i is inhabited by an infinitely-lived representative agent endowed with a
stochastic stream of a single homogeneous good Yi,t+s , s = 0, 1, 2, ..., viewed as the economy’s
measure of real output or GDP. It is assumed that the country’s output growth rate, ∆yit =
ln (Yit /Yi,t−1 ) fluctuates around a deterministic steady state, gi , driven by country-specific, εit ,
and global, ft , shocks, namely
                                            ∆yit = gi + γ i ft + εit .                                         (1)

Despite its simplicity, the assumed growth process is consistent with multi-country versions of
the international real business cycle models of Backus et al. (1992) and Baxter and Crucini
(1995), and it is at the core of typical new open-economy DSGE models.9

    To simplify the exposition we assume that εit for i = 1, 2, ..., N are serially uncorrelated and
independently distributed across i. Also, without loss of generality, we assume that ft and εit
are uncorrelated. However, richer time series dynamics, as well as weak forms of cross-country
dependence, could be allowed for. Indeed, empirically, we model the dynamics of country-specific
equity market volatility and the business cycle jointly as factor augmented vector autoregressive
processes, weakly correlated across countries. But to simplify the derivations and obtain a
closed form solution we assume εit ∼ IIDN (0, σ 2εi ), and ft follows a stationary first order auto-
regressive process with conditionally heteroskedastic errors. More specifically


                                               ft = φf ft−1 + ν t ,                                            (2)


where φf < 1, ν t ∼ IIDN (0, σ 2ν ), and


                                  V art−1 (ν t ) = Et−1 (ν 2t ) = af + bf ν 2t−1 ,                             (3)

tional expectations and variance operators with respect to the non-decreasing information set,
It−1 , which contains at least all country specific variables as well as the global risk-free rate (see
below for further details). Note here that ν t is conditionally heteroskedastic, but unconditionally
   9
     For instance, in section A.1 of the paper Appendix, we show that (1) can be justified as the ergodic limit
process to which a stochastic multi-country version of the neoclassical growth model converges. In that case, ft in
(1) can be interpreted as the (stochastic) rate of world technology growth. But in our empirical model it captures
also other common forces driving world growth over the business cycle.

homoskedastic with V ar (ν t ) = σ 2ν = af /(1 − bf ) > 0.10

       The representative agent of country i can trade freely a globally available risk-free bond
and N risky equity claims defined on the country-specific entire endowment streams, Yi,t+s ,
for s = 0, 1, 2, ...∞. International asset markets are complete in Arrow-Debreau sense so that
country-specific consumption growth is equalized across countries, and one can use the world
endowment growth in the stochastic discount factor of country i’s representative agent.11

       The representative agent in country i has constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) period

2.1      Derivation of the Risk-free Rate

We now use the above first order conditions to relate the growth factor, ft , to the asset returns.
We begin with the risk-free rate and using (1), we note that


                                             ∆ ln Yw,t+1 = ln(1 + gw,t+1 ),

                        N            PN
where gw,t+1 =          i=1 Yi,t+1 /  i=1 Yit           −1 is the world output growth, which can also be written
equivalently as

                                     PN                              PN                     N
                                       i=1 (Yi,t+1 −     Yit )         i=1 Yit gi,t+1
                                                                                            X
                       gw,t+1 =           PN                     =     PN               =         wit gi,t+1 ,

where gi,t+1 = (Yi,t+1 /Yit ) − 1, for i = 1, 2, ..., N are country-specific growth rates, and wit =
Yit / N

      j=1 Yjt is the size of country i in the world economy at time t. Also since gi,t+1 and gw,t+1

                                                                 11
are small they can be well approximated by


                                gw,t+1 ≈ ln (1 + gw,t+1 ) = ∆ ln (Yw,t+1 )

                                gi,t+1 ≈ ln (1 + gi,t+1 ) = ∆ ln (Yi,t+1 ) = ∆yi,t+1 ,


which yields
                                                                             N
                                                                             X
                                        gw,t+1 ≈ ∆ ln (Yw,t+1 ) ≈                   wit ∆yi,t+1 .
                                                                              i=1

Using this result in (8) and then in (9) now yields

                                         f                                  1

Finally, using the country-specific output growth equations (1) we also have

where gwt =            i=1 wit gi ,   γ wt =         i=1 wit γ i ,   and εw,t+1 =           i=1 wit εi,t+1 .    Note that gwt and
γ wt are included in the information set It . Under the assumptions that ft+1 and εi,t+1 for
i = 1, 2, ..., N are Gaussian, then conditional on It , ∆yw,t+1 is also Gaussian and we have:

Setting β = 1/(1 + r)) and using the above result in (11) we obtain

                        f
                                !
                   1 + rt+1                                               %2  2                                  

But under (2) and (3),


                                  Et (ft+1 ) = φf ft , and V art (ft+1 ) = af + bf ν 2t .

Furthermore, since by assumption the idiosyncratic shocks, εit , are cross-sectionally independent
and wit = O(N −1 ), we also have V art (εw,t+1 ) = O(N −1 ). Therefore, overall we have:

This expression shows how the global risk-free rate responds to changes in the composition of
                                                                                                  

in level of growth factor increases the risk-free rate, whilst a rise in the expected volatility of
the global factor reduces it.

       We now show how the above equation for the risk-free rate can be used to relate equity return
volatility and output growth, but to simplify the exposition we abstract from time variations in
the weights and set wit = wi . So in what follows we use the following simplified version of (14):

2.2      Country Equity Returns and their Realized Volatility

Consider now the first order conditions for the equity returns given by (10), which are non-linear
in current and expected future output growth. To obtain an analytical solution we make use of
the approximate present-value relation for stock market returns derived by Campbell and Shiller
(1988) (CS, henceforth), and note that in our set up Dit = Yit . Let κit = Pit /(Pit + Yit ) and,
following CS assume that κit is approximately constant over time and set to κi with 0 < κi < 1.
Then using result (2’) of CS we have


                                          ri,t+1 = ∆yi,t+1 + δ it − κi δ i,t+1 ,                                   (16)


where ri,t+1 = ln (Ri,t+1 ) = ln (Pi,t+1 + Yi,t+1 ) − ln(Pi,t ) is the realized gross log-return on
country ith equity, yit = ln(Yit ), and δ it = ln(Yi,t /Pit ).14 Further, CS show that irrespective of the
asset pricing model considered, under rational expectations and assuming that the transversality
  14                                                                          f
    In their derivations CS use bt , dt and rt , for our ri,t+1 , di,t+1 and rt+1 , respectively. See their equations (1)
and (5) and the related discussion in CS.

      The above return equation has a number of interesting features. First, the returns are
explicitly related to the innovations in the underlying growth factor, ft , and its volatility. Second,
the factor loadings in (21) vary across countries partly reflecting the different responsiveness of
their growth process to ft , as well as the relative importance of Dit in Pit + Dit , as captured
by parameter κi . This heterogeneity is present even though the risk preference parameter, %,
is assumed to be identical across countries. Third, crucially for our empirical analysis, while

least two common shocks, ν t and χt , are required to explain the cross country differences of
equity returns.16 The innovations ν t and χt , can be viewed as first and second order moment
shocks, respectively. The conditional covariance of these two shocks is given by Covt−1 (ν t , χt ) =

our model.17

    In our empirical application, we consider the relationship between output growth and realized
volatility of equity returns across countries, computed from squares of daily returns within a
quarter to match the available data on output growth–see Section 5 below. To link the above
theoretical results to our empirical analysis, denote output growth and equity returns for a given
day τ within a quarter t with ∆yit (τ ), and rit (τ ), respectively, for τ = 1, 2, ..., D, where D is the
number of trading days within a quarter (which we assume to be fixed across t for convenience).
In this set up, the underlying daily growth factor and country-specific shocks are given by ft (τ )
and εit (τ ). So, in terms of daily changes, the theoretical output growth and equity return
equations can be written as


                                     ∆yit (τ ) = gi (τ ) + γ i ft (τ ) + εit (τ ),                            (24)

    It is clear that while individual country returns depend linearly on the first and second order
moment innovations, ν t and χt , volatility depends on non-linear functions of these innovations
and their cross products, and their impacts cannot be identified separately from that of higher
order moments of shocks. The presence of these higher order terms, however, induces strong
cross sectional dependence (in the sense to be made precise in the following section) in country
realized volatilities even if the effects of the growth innovation, ν t , on rit and σ 2it are eliminated.
In the next section, we will exploit the difference in the degree of cross sectional dependence
of the country output growth rates and realized volatilities, after controlling for the effects of
the common growth factor shock, ν t , to identify such innovations from the data, and we will
combine all higher order terms in a single common financial shock. In practice, one would expect
additional factors such as market imperfections, speculative bubbles and other forms of financial
frictions to influence realized equity market volatilities. We therefore view our theoretical model
more as a benchmark providing insights for the empirical analysis that follows, rather than a
true characterization of the data.



3      A Static Multi-Country Econometric Framework

We now build on the theoretical insights that underlie the growth and volatility equations,
(1) and (27), and develop a suitable multi-country econometric framework for the empirical
analysis of cross country and time variations of the relations between growth and volatility. We
begin with a static specification, omitting dynamics and deterministic components to simplify

                                                                    16
the exposition. We also start by positing the following single unobservable common factor
representation


                                                 vit = λi ft + uit ,                                  (28)

                                               ∆yit = γ i ft + εit ,                                  (29)


for i = 1, 2, ..., N ; t = 1, 2, ..., T , where as before ∆yit is real GDP growth,18 and vit = ln(σ it ) is
the log of realized stock market volatility for country i during period t (measured in quarters).

       The common factor representation in (28)-(29) is general and motivated by both empirical
evidence and standard economic theory. From an empirical perspective, as noted in the intro-
duction, realized equity price volatility and output growth share a large and negative contempo-
raneous correlation at the country level, for most countries in our sample. This correlation is a
robust stylized fact of the data documented also by Baker and Bloom (2013), Carriere-Swallow
and Cespedes (2013), and Nakamura et al. (2017). From a theoretical perspective, as shown in
the previous section, one can think of ft as a common world growth factor (e.g., technology),
which affects all countries GDP growth rates and equity price volatilities contemporaneously,
which we will call ‘real’ factor in the rest of the paper. In view of our theoretical derivations in
the previous section, ft could be viewed as a pure ‘level’ or ‘first moment’ factor in the sense of
Gorodnichenko and Ng (2017).

       It is worth noting that without further restrictions on the cross section correlations of uit and
εit , it is not possible to be sure about the number of common factors affecting output growth and
volatility. In our theoretical derivations, we assume εit to be cross sectionally weakly dependent
and derive uit in terms of level and higher-order moments of ft . It follows that most likely εit and
uit will be correlated, and due to the remaining common component affecting uit , it is also likely
that uit will be cross sectionally strongly correlated. This interpretation is also in the spirit of
the Arbitrage Pricing Theory of Ross (1976) and Chamberlain and Rothschild (1982) applied to
second moments.19 In our empirical application we will find that while ft is sufficient to render
the cross-country correlations of εit to be weak (required in our theoretical derivations), we need
at least one more common factor to span the cross-country correlations of the uit , which we saw
in the previous section can be affected by higher order moments of ∆yit . In the paper, we will

       We also refer to ∆yit as ‘output growth’ or ‘growth’ for brevity.

refer to this second factor as “financial” and interpret it as a combined higher moment factor.

   This econometric specification is not tied to any particular asset price model, but incorpo-
rates two practically relevant features: time-varying volatility and heterogeneity in the form of
country-specific loadings on the common factors. There are also dynamic features that need to
be taken into account that vary across countries due to geographical location, institutions, and
history. We will consider heterogeneous dynamics across countries in Section 4.


3.1   Identifying the Real Factor

The main idea is to achieve identification of ft and its loadings, λi and γ i , by placing restrictions
on the cross-country correlations of uit and εit , while leaving their within-country correlations
unrestricted. To illustrate the strategy, denote global volatility and global GDP growth by
v̄ω,t and ∆ȳω,t , respectively, and suppose that they are measured by the weighted cross-section
average of country-specific volatility and growth measures:

                                                          N
                                                          X
                                               v̄ω,t =          ẘi vit ,                          (30)
                                                          i=1
                                                          XN
                                            ∆ȳω,t =            wi ∆yit ,                          (31)

where {ẘi } and {wi } are two sets of aggregation weights, which can be the same or differ for
each variable. We make the following assumptions on the common factor, ft , and its loadings,
λi and γ i ), the weights, ẘi and wi , and the country-specific innovations uit and εit :


Assumption 1 (Common factor and factor loadings) The common unobservable factor ft has
zero mean and a finite variance, normalized to one. The factor loadings, λi and γ i , are dis-
tributed independently across i and from the common factors ft , for all i and t, with non-zero
means λ and γ (λ 6= 0 and γ 6= 0), and satisfy the following conditions, for a finite N and as

Assumption 2 (Weights) Let w = (w1 , w2 , ..., wN )0 and ẘ = (ẘ1 , ẘ2 , ..., ẘN )0 be the N × 1
vectors of non-stochastic weights with N

                                        i=1 wi = 1 and  i=1 ẘi = 1. These weights need not to

be fixed and could be time-varying but predetermined. The growth weights, w, must be granular,
in the sense that:
                                                   wi
                            ||w|| = O(N −1 ),          = O(N −1/2 ),      ∀i.                        (34)
                                                 ||w||

The volatility weights ẘ are also assumed to be granular for ease of exposition, but this assump-
tion could be relaxed.

Assumption 3 (Cross-country correlations) The country-specific innovations, uit and εit , have
zero means and finite variances, and are serially uncorrelated, but can be correlated with each
other both within and between countries. Furthermore, denoting the variance-covariance matrices
of the N × 1 innovation vectors εt = (ε1t , ε2t , ..., εN t )0 and ut = (u1t , u2t , ..., uN t )0 by Σεε =
V ar (εt ) and Σuu = V ar (ut ), respectively, it is assumed that:


                                        %max (Σu ) = O(N ),                                          (35)

                                        %max (Σε ) = O(1).                                           (36)


   Assumption 1 is standard in the factor literature (see, for instance, Assumption B in Bai and
Ng (2002)). It ensures that ft is a strong (or pervasive) factor for both volatility and growth
so that it can be estimated consistently either using principal components or by cross-section
averages of country-specific observations (see Chudik et al., 2011).

   Assumption 2 requires that individual countries’ contribution to world growth or world
volatility is of order 1/N . This is consistent with the notion that, since the 1990s, when our
sample period starts, world growth and world capital markets have become progressively more
diversified and integrated as a result of the globalization process.

   The first part of Assumption 3 is also standard and leaves the causal relation between the
idiosyncratic components, uit and εit , unrestricted. In our model, the correlation between uit and
εit captures any contemporaneous causal relation between country-specific volatility and growth,
conditional on ft , on which we do not impose any restrictions for the purpose of identifying ft .

   The second part of Assumption 3 is crucial to identify ft as the following proposition demon-
strates. The assumption states that the volatility innovations are strongly correlated across
countries, while growth innovations are weakly correlated across countries. Weak cross-country

correlation in turn means that, asymptotically, as N becomes large, the average pair-wise cor-
relations across countries of growth innovations tends to zero, since the largest eigenvalue of
their variance-covariance matrix is bounded in N .20 On the other hand, strong cross-country
correlation means that the average pair-wise correlation of volatility innovations does not tend
to zero because the largest eigenvalue of Σu grows with the size of the cross-section, N . As we
shall see, this key assumption is in accordance not only with the empirical properties of the data
displayed in Figure 2, but also with the properties of the innovations that we obtain from the
model estimation.21

Proposition 1 (Identification of the real factor) Under Assumptions 1-3, for N sufficiently
large, ft can be identified (up to a scalar constant) by ȳω,t = N
                                                                P
                                                                 i=1 wi ∆yit .


Proof. Consider the model (28)-(29) for i = 1, 2, ..., N . Under Assumptions 1-3, and using the
definitions in (30)-(31), the following model for the global variables obtains:


                                              v̄ω,t = λft + ūω,t ,                                           (37)

                                            ∆ȳω,t = γft + ε̄ω,t ,                                            (38)


where ε̄ω,t = ẘ0 εt , and ūω,t = w0 ut . Furthermore:


                                V ar (ε̄ω,t ) = w0 Σε w ≤ w0 w %max (Σε ) .
                                                              
                                                                                                              (39)


Thus, under Assumption 3, we have:


                                    V ar (ε̄ω,t ) = O w0 w = O N −1 ,
                                                                  
                                                                                                              (40)


and hence:
                                                             
                                             ε̄ω,t = Op N −1/2 .                                              (41)

Using this in (38), since under Assumption 1, γ 6= 0, we have:

                                                                  
                                       ft = γ −1 ∆ȳω,t + Op N −1/2 ,                                         (42)
  20
     See Section 6.2 for a formal discussion of the links between pair-wise correlations and weak and strong cross-
sectional dependence.
  21
     As noted already, patterns of cross-country correlations like the one assumed here, but for consumption
growth rather than GDP growth and equity returns rather than equity volatilities, have been documented by
Tesar (1995), Colacito and Croce (2011), and Lewis and Liu (2015).


                                                        20
which allows us to recover ft form ∆ȳω,t up to the scalar 1/γ.


This is a key result in our paper and several remarks are in order:


Remark 1 (Estimation of ft ) As ft is pervasive or strong, we can estimate it with either as
the first principal component of the observations {∆yit , for i = 1, 2, ..., N ; t = 1, 2, ...., T } or by
cross-section averages of ∆yit , obtaining asymptotically equivalent results.


   Indeed, Figure S.2 in the online supplement shows that the first (static) principal component
and the cross section average of ∆yit provide estimates of ft that are very close, with a correlation
of 0.9. In the present context the use of the cross-section-average (CSA) estimator of ft has
two advantages. First, it can be directly interpreted as global GDP growth. Second, under
Assumptions 1 and 3 the CSA estimator of ft is consistent so long as N is large, whilst the
principal component estimator requires both N and T to be large (See section 19.5.1 of Pesaran
(2015)).


Remark 2 (Principal component on the panel of volatility series) The cross-section average or
the principal component of the panel of volatilities series vit does not identify ft .


   This is because the volatility innovations, uit , are assumed to be strongly correlated across
countries, which in turn means that the largest eigenvalue of Σu will grow with the size of the
cross-section (i.e., %max (Σu ) = O(N )), and V ar (ūω,t ) = w0 Σu w will generally not converge
to zero. Under Assumption 3, only the principal component or cross-section average of output
growth can be used to identify ft .


Remark 3 (Principal component on the combined panel of growth and volatility series) For the
same reason, applying principal component analysis to the panel of volatility and growth series
does not identify ft , either.


   Indeed, Figure S.3 in the online supplement shows that the first principal component of
the combined panel of volatilities and growth series does not coincides with ft estimated as
the cross-section averages of ∆yit , and its correlation with ∆ȳω,t is −0.43. The first principal
component extracted from the panel of vit and ∆yit captures a linear combination of ft and any
additional common factors that exclusively affect the volatility series.


                                                   21
   Before concluding this discussion, it is worth noting that, whilst theoretically we need N →
∞, in practice N need not be too large for the theory to work reasonably well. The notion of
N → ∞, is best viewed as a counterfactual that considers the extent to which the strength of the
connections among units declines with N . In our experience, working with many cross-country
panels, N around 30 is often sufficiently large.


3.2   Identifying the Financial Factor

The main empirical result of the paper does not require explicit identification of the additional
strong factors assumed to be exclusive to the volatilities, vit . But doing so permits exploring
other properties of the data that underpin the second and the third main empirical results
summarized above. With this in mind, recall that, under condition (35) of Assumption 3, the
cross-section of volatility innovations, uit , must at least share one additional strong common
factor that is not shared by the growth innovations. By assuming, without loss of generality,
that the uit share only one additional strong factor, we can identify it from the data, up to an
orthonormal transformation of the factor loadings in the country-specific volatility equations.
A formal statement of this result is provided in Proposition 2 below and established under the
following assumptions:


Assumption 4 The volatility innovations, uit , in equation (28) can be decomposed into a sec-
ond, strong, common, unobservable factor, gt , and a weak country-specific shock (or idiosyncratic
component) η it , namely:
                                                uit = θi gt + η it ,                             (43)

where η it is cross-sectionally weakly correlated.


   The above assumption is compatible with (35) and specifies a one-factor structure for uit .
Letting the variance-covariance matrix of the N × 1 vector η t = (η 1t , η 2t , ..., η N t )0 be Σηη =
V ar (η t ), under the above assumption, we must also have (as N → ∞)


                                              %max (Σηη ) = O(1),                                (44)


and
                                   N
                                   X                                   N
                                                                       X
                            N −1         θ2i = O(1),     and      θ=         ẘi θi 6= 0.        (45)
                                   i=1                                 i=1


                                                        22
As the next proposition shows, the latter conditions allow us to identify gt from the data, as a
liner combination of ∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t , up to an orthonormal transformation.

Proposition 2 (Identification of the financial factor) Under Assumption 4, the system of equa-
tions (28) and (29) can be written as:


                                           vit = λi ft + θi gt + η it ,                           (46)

                                       ∆yit = γ i ft + εit .                                      (47)


where i = 1, 2, ...N , and a second strong factor, gt , can be identified up to a liner transformation
as N → ∞. Specifically,
                                                         
                                      −1           λ                 
                             gt = θ         v̄ω,t − ∆ȳω,t + Op N −1/2 .                          (48)
                                                   γ

This result follows from substituting (42) and (43) into (37) and applying the same reasoning
applied to εit in Proposition 1 to η it .

   As we noted earlier, we label gt a ‘financial’ factor to highlight its role in capturing all higher-
order terms in equation (27) once we account for the common real factor shock, ft , as well as
any bubble component, financial friction, or time-varying risk preference component that might
be present in the volatility data. In effect, our identification assumptions distinguish between
a first, level factor, ft , common to both the growth and volatility series, and everything else
common only to the volatility series, lumped together in gt . Moreover, we will see below in
Proposition 3 that a consistent estimate of gt can be obtained as the residual of a regression
of v̄ω,t on ∆ȳω,t . As such, gt captures the orthogonalized effect of the common component to
all volatility series once the effect of the factor which is common to both volatility and growth
series is filtered out. It is not a pure second-moment factor factor in the sense of Gorodnichenko
and Ng (2017), but a composite higher-order factor.

   Finally, note that as can be see from (46)-(47), the different patterns of cross-country corre-
lations assumed for volatility and growth innovations implicitly provide restrictions on the factor
loadings of the growth equations on the gt factor, and yields country models that have a recur-
sive structure in terms of ft and gt , and hence their associated estimates based on cross-section
averages. Notice, however, that the identification assumptions made do not require a recursive
structure for the country-specific variables, ∆yit and vit .

3.3    Consistent Estimation of Orthogonalized Real and Financial Factors

For consistent estimation of the real and financial factors we note that under Assumptions
(1)-(4), from equation (42) and (48), we have:


                                 ft = αf ∆ȳω,t + Op (N −1/2 )                                                     (49)

                                 gt = α1g v̄ω,t − α2g ∆ȳω,t + Op (N −1/2 ),                                       (50)


for t = 1, 2, ...T , where αf = γ −1 , α1g = θ−1 , and α2g = λ/γθ. It is clear that, for N sufficiently
large, ft and gt can be consistently estimated point-wise (at each t) by a linear combination of
∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t , without requiring T to be large. Given the recursive structure of the relation
between (ft , gt ) and (∆ȳω,t , v̄ω,t ), it follows that ft can be estimated up to a scalar constant by
average world GDP growth. In contrast, gt is identified as a linear combination of ∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t
that is unique only up to an orthonormal transformation. It is also evident from (49) and (50)
that gt and ft are correlated. The next proposition illustrates that we can proxy gt by setting
it equal to the residual of a regression of v̄ω,t on ∆ȳω,t for all t, and thus making it orthogonal
to ft , without requiring additional economic restrictions.

Proposition 3 (Consistent estimation of orthonormalized factors in the static case) Let ζ̂ t and
ξ̂ t be consistent, orthonormalized estimators of ft and gt , respectively, where ft and gt are defined
by (42) and (48). Then, ζ̂ t can be obtained by re-scaling ∆ȳω,t so that its variance is 1, while ξ̂ t
can be obtained as the standardized residual of a least squares regression of v̄ω,t on ∆ȳω,t .

Proof. Consider equation (49) and (50) and set the coefficients αg = (α1g , α2g )0 , such that
T −1 Tt=1 ζ̂ t ξ̂ t = 0. This yields:
    P
                                            PT
                                      α̂2g   t=1 ∆ȳω,t v̄ω,t
                                           = P T
                                                              ,
                                      α̂1g            2
                                               t=1 ∆ȳω,t

which is the OLS estimate of the coefficient on ∆ȳω,t in a regression of v̄t on ∆ȳω,t . Next, set
αf and α1g so that ζ t and ξ t to have unit in-sample standard deviations. Thus:
                                                                             !

Finally, use ∆ȳω,t − ∆ȳω and v̄ω,t − v̄ω , where ∆ȳω = T −1                                    t=1 ∆ȳω,t         and v̄ω = T −1    t=1 v̄ω,t

in the above formulae to ensure that ζ t and ξ t have zero means.22

    Proposition 3 accomplishes two objectives. It derives an observable proxy for gt and it
makes sure that the resultant estimator is orthogonal to the proxy for ft , which will turn out
to be useful when we estimate error variance decompositions and impulse responses. This is
achieved simply by choosing coefficients for the linear combination of v̄ω,t on ∆ȳω,t such that the
observable common factors have zero-means, unit variance and are orthogonal to each other.23


Remark 4 (World economy as a single-country model versus a multi-country representation)
Model (28)-(29) applies to all N countries. Consider a generic country i, like for instance the
United States, or a closed system like the whole world economy. If we focus on one country in
isolation from the rest of the world, or consider a single country global model, we cannot identify
the parameters of (28)-(29), even assuming that the innovations uit and εit are orthogonal to
each other and ft is known, unless we exclude ft from one of the two equations.


    To see this, note that the covariance matrix of vit and ∆yit is given by:
                                                                                               
                                                    λ2i   +   σ 2u,i              λi γ i
                                       Θi =                                                    .                                         (51)
                                                          λi γ i           γ 2i    +   σ 2ε,i

This provides three independent restrictions, but (28)-(29) contains four free parameters, (λi , γ i ),
and (σ 2u,i , σ 2ε,i ). Identification of the model parameters requires at least one additional restriction
at the country level–for instance, λi = 0 or γ i = 0, even if it is assumed that innovations uit and
εit are orthogonal to each other.
  22
     These mean corrections will be applied automatically if intercepts are included in the country-specific models
(46) and (47).
  23
     In the present static set up, ζ t corresponds to the growth factor shock ν t introduced in Section 2; but ξ t need
not correspond directly to the growth factor volatility innovations, χt , also defined in Section 2. This is because
realized volatilities could also be affected by other factors besides growth factor volatility innovations.




                                                               25
    To summarize, the key feature of our identification strategy lies in the fact that no restric-
tion is imposed at the individual country level. Restrictions apply only to the cross-section
correlations of a large number of countries under consideration. Specifically, we propose a novel
approach that exploits the differences in the degree of cross-country correlations for the two
series of innovations. The growth innovations are assumed to be cross-sectionally weakly cor-
related, while the volatility innovations are assumed cross-sectionally strongly correlated. As a
result, the effect of country-specific growth innovations on the global variable ∆ȳω,t vanish if
N is reasonably large, while the effects of the country-specific volatility innovations on v̄ω,t do
not vanish even if the cross section dimension is large. Under these assumptions the matrix of
contemporaneous factor loadings is recursive, which enables us to obtain consistent estimates of
the common orthogonal real and financial factors from the data simply by means of OLS, as in
a Cholesky decomposition of the variance-covariance matrix of ∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t , ordering ∆ȳω,t
first. Importantly, however, our identification assumptions are not consistent with an alternative
ordering of the factors in the Cholesky decomposition where v̄ω,t is included first. Furthermore,
our strategy does not apply to a single country, or to the world economy viewed as a single
closed-system. The identification strategy used here is general and can be applied to any panel
of time series with the necessary cross-section correlation properties. With this approach, we
can identify more factors provided that we consider more cross sections of variables with the
appropriate structure of correlation across countries. What is crucial is to adopt a multi-country
approach covering a large number of countries, as opposed to considering single country models
in isolation.



4    A Dynamic Multi-Country Heterogeneous Model

Whilst the static model considered so far is helpful for illustrative purposes, in empirical appli-
cations it is important to take dynamics, possibly differing across countries, into account. As we
shall see, allowing for dynamics that differ across countries, while requiring additional regularity
conditions and derivations, does not alter our main results.

    Consider the following first-order dynamic version of the static model (46) and (47):


                    vit = aiv + φi,11 vi,t−1 + φi,12 ∆yi,t−1 + λi ft + θi gt + η it ,          (52)

                  ∆yit = aiy + φi,21 vi,t−1 + φi,22 ∆yi,t−1 + γ i ft + εit .                   (53)


                                                  26
In matrix notation we have:


                  zit = ai + Φi zi,t−1 + Γi ft + ϑit ,    for i = 1, 2, ..., N ; t = 1, 2, ..., T,              (54)


where zit = (vit , ∆yit )0 and:
                                                                                                       
            aiv                 φi,11 φi,12                   λi θ i                 ft                  η it
  ai =            , Φi =                    , Γi =                 , ft =           , ϑit =            .
            aiy                 φi,21 φi,22                   γi   0                 gt                  εit

The matrix Γi of contemporaneous factor loadings is assumed to be triangular as per Assump-
tions 3 and 4. To accommodate the dynamic nature of the model, we now make the following
additional assumptions:


Assumption 5 (Innovations) The country-specific shocks, ϑit , are serially uncorrelated (over
t), and cross-sectionally weakly correlated (over i), with zero means, positive definite covariance
matrices, Ωi , for i = 1, 2, ..., N .


Assumption 6 (Common factors) The 2×1 vector of unobserved common factors, ft = (ft , gt )0 ,
is covariance stationary with absolute summable autocovariances, and fourth order moments,
distributed independently of the country-specific shocks, ϑit0 , for all i, t and t0 .


Assumption 7 (Factor loadings) The factor loadings λi , θi , and γ i (i.e., the non-zero elements
of Γi ) are independently distributed across i, and of the common factors, ft , for all i and t, with
non-zero means λ, θ, and γ, and second-order moments. Furthermore:
                                                                      
                                                              λ θ
                                         Γ = E (Γi ) =                .                                       (55)
                                                              γ 0

Assumption 8 (Coefficients) The constants ai are bounded, Φi and Γi are independently dis-
tributed for all i, the support of % (Φi ) lies strictly inside the unit circle, for i = 1, 2, ..., N , and the
inverse of the polynomial Λ (L) = ∞                 `                     `
                                       P                                    
                                           `=0 Λ` L , where Λ` = E Φi exists and has exponentially

decaying coefficients, namely kΛ` k ≤ Kρ` , where K is a fixed constant and 0 < ρ < 1.


    These assumptions complement, extend and generalize those made earlier for the static case
and allow us to derive consistent estimates of unobservable factors ft and gt in a heterogeneous


                                                         27
factor-augmented VAR, as summarized in the proposition below. The important additional
condition is to control the effects of aggregation of dynamics across the units by requiring that
Λ` = E Φ`i exists and has exponentially decaying coefficients. But it is easily seen that this
            

latter condition holds only if it is further assumed that supi E kΦi k < ρ < 1. It is also worth
noting that Γ defined by (55) is invertible since γθ 6= 0 under Assumption 7.


Proposition 4 (Consistent estimation of unobservable factors in a dynamic heterogeneous multi-
country model) Consider the factor-augmented bivariate VAR models for country i = 1, 2, ..., N
given by (54),and suppose that Assumptions 5-8 hold. Then:

                                             ∞
                                             X                              
                 ft = bf + γ −1 ∆ȳω,t +            c01,` z̄ω,t−` + Op N −1/2 ,                          (56)

where bf and bg are fixed constants, z̄ω,t = (v̄ω,t , ∆ȳω,t ), {wi , for i = 1, 2, ..., N } are fixed weights
that satisfy the granularity Assumption 2, and c01,` and c02,` are the first and the second rows
of C` = Γ−1 B` , where Γ = E (Γi ), B` is defined by Λ−1 (L) = B0 + B1 L + B2 L2 + ....,
Λ (L) = ∞        `              `
       P                          
         `=0 Λ` L , and Λ` = E Φi , for all i.



Proof. See Appendix A.3.

    Notice here that, as shown in Pesaran and Chudik (2014) and Chudik and Pesaran (2015),
if slope heterogeneity is not extreme (i.e., if the coefficient matrices Φi do not differ too much
across i) and C` decays exponentially in `, the infinite order distributed lag functions in z̄ω,t
can be truncated. In practice, Pesaran and Chudik (2014) and Chudik and Pesaran (2015)
recommend a lag length ` equal to T 1/3 , where T is the time dimension of the panel.

    Notice also that ft and gt are unobservable, while for estimation purposes we need observable
factors. However, as ft is identified up a scalar, while gt is identified up to a linear combination
of v̄ω,t and ∆ȳω,t , we can continue to proceed similarly to the the case of the static model, as
the next proposition illustrates.


Proposition 5 (Consistent estimation of the orthonormalized factors in the dynamic case)
Consider a pth order truncated approximation of the unobservable factors in equation (56) and

where f = (f1 , f2 , ..., fT )0 , g = (g1 , g2 , ..., gT )0 , Z̄ω = (τ T , z̄ω,−1 , z̄ω,−2 , ..., z̄ω,−p ), z̄ω,−l = (∆ȳω,−l v̄ω,−l ),
∆ȳω,−l = (∆ȳω,1−l , ∆ȳω,2−l , ..., ∆ȳω,T −l )0 , ∆ȳω = ∆ȳω,0 , v̄ω,−l = (v̄ω,1−l , v̄ω,2−l , ..., v̄ω,T −l )0 ,
v̄ω = v̄ω,0 , and p denotes a suitable number of lags (or truncation order).24 Consistent esti-
mators of the common shocks, denoted ζ and ξ, can be obtained as residuals from the following
OLS regressions:


                                             ∆ȳω = Z̄ω Ĉ1 + ζ̂,                                                        (60)

                                                v̄ω = λ̂ζ̂ + Z̄ω Ĉ2 + ξ̂.                                               (61)


where Ĉ1 is the OLS estimator of the regression coefficients in the regression of ∆ȳω on Z̄ω ,
and λ̂ and Ĉ2 are OLS estimators of the regression coefficients in the regression of v̄ω on ζ̂ and
Z̄ω .


Proof. See Appendix A.4.


Remark 5 Since ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t are the residuals from regressions of ∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t on an intercept
and the lagged values z̄ω,t−1 , ...., z̄ω,t−p , it follows that ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t will have zero (in-sample) means
and, for a sufficiently large value of p, will be serially uncorrelated. Therefore, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t can be
viewed as estimators of the global innovations (or shocks) to the underlying factors, ft and gt .
Note however that, unlike the theoretical innovations ν t and χt , defined by (22), which could be
correlated, the estimators ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t are orthogonalized.


Remark 6 In a dynamic setting, the orthogonalized components of ∆ȳω,t and v̄ω,t ordering
∆ȳω,t first, are not the same as our global shocks ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , because this would ignore the
contributions of z̄ω,t−` for ` = 1, 2, ..., p to the estimation of ft and gt . As the factors depend on
lagged variables, it is important to make sure that the past values of z̄ω,t are filtered out.


       Given the orthogonal factor innovations, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , obtained from equation (60) and (61), by
  24
       The inclusion of τ T in Z̄ω ensures that the filtered factors have zero in-sample means.

substituting them in (54) we can investigate their impact and relative importance for country-
specific volatility and growth based on the following regressions:25

These country-specific equations can be estimated consistently by least squares so long as N and
T are sufficiently large. As in the static case, large N is required so that the probability order
Op (N −1/2 ) in equations (58) and (59) become negligible. Large T is required to ensure that
the dynamics are estimated reasonably accurately. We are now ready to present our empirical
results, but before doing so we need to discuss how we measure volatility in our multi-country
setting.



5         Volatility Measurement

As a proxy for uncertainty we use realized equity price volatility. Realized volatility has been
used extensively in the theoretical and empirical finance literature and implicitly assumes that
uncertainty and risk can be characterized in terms of probability distributions.26 Specifically,
we use a measure of quarterly realized volatility based on the summation of daily squared stock
price returns. This is a natural application of within-day measures of volatility based on high
frequency within-day price changes.27

         Denote the daily equity price of country i, measured at close of day τ in quarter t as Pit (τ ).
The realized volatility for country i in quarter t is computed as:

                                                        Dt
                                                        X
                                              σ 2it =          (rit (τ ) − r̄it )2                                             (64)
                                                        τ =1


where rit (τ ) = ∆ ln Pit (τ ), and r̄it = Dt−1
                                                        PDt
                                                           τ =1 rit (τ )   is the average daily price changes in the
quarter t, and Dt is the number of trading days in quarter t. Note that we have now divided
    25
     We describe how we can compute the relative importance of these factors for the forecast error variance
decomposition of country-specific variables, and the impulse response function of the country specific variables to
these shocks in the online supplement to the paper.
  26
     It therefore abstracts from Knightian uncertainty, where one cannot attach probabilities to outcomes.
  27
     See, for example, Andersen et al. (2001, 2003), Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002, 2004))



                                                                30
the right hand side of (64) by Dt so that our measure of realized volatility is consistent with
quarterly GDP growth. Note that, for most time periods, Dt = 3 × 22 = 66, which is larger
than the number of data points typically used in the construction of daily realized market
volatility in the empirical finance literature.28 Finally, note that, because variances have right-
skewed distributions, but logarithmic variances tend to have near Gaussian distributions, in our
empirical application we will be working with the logarithm of realized volatility measures, i.e.
vit = log(σ it ).

    The realized volatility of asset prices is not the only way of measuring ‘risk’ or ‘uncertainty’.
If we consider a panel of country equities (e.g., of firms or sectors within a country), a different
measure of uncertainty can be computed as the cross-sectional dispersion of equity prices within
each country. In Section S1 of the online supplement we show that, under fairly general as-
sumptions, and for Dt relatively large (as in our sample), the cross-sectional dispersion of equity
returns within country i is closely related to the realized volatility of the country equity returns.
So, in our application, we will focus on the realized volatility of country equity indexes.29

    Realized volatility and cross-sectional dispersion encompass most measures of uncertainty
and risk proposed in the literature that could be used to implement our identification strategy.
Schwert (1989b), Ramey and Ramey (1995), Bloom (2009), Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011)
use aggregate time series volatility (i.e., summary measures of dispersion over time of output
growth, stock market returns, or interest rates); Leahy and Whited (1996), Campbell et al.
(2001), Bloom et al. (2007) and Gilchrist et al. (2013) use dispersion measures at the firm-
level stock market returns; Bloom et al. (2012) use cross-sectional dispersion of plant, firm, and
industry profits, stocks, or total factor productivity.

    In the finance literature, the focus of the volatility measurement has now shifted to implied
volatility measures obtained from option prices, like the US VIX Index (see for example Berger
et al., 2017). However, a key input for the implementation of our identification strategy is
the availability of country-specific measures of uncertainty for a large number of countries over
a long period of time, and implied volatility measures are not yet available for a meaningful
number of countries.30 The literature has also used uncertainty measures based on expectations
  28
     In the case of intra-day observations, for example, prices are usually sampled at 10-minutes intervals which
yield around 48 intra-daily returns in an 8-hour trading day.
  29
     Daily returns are computed abstracting from dividends, which are negligible by comparison to price changes.
  30
     Figure S.5 in the supplement plots the US realized volatility measure we constructed with the VIX index during
the period over which they overlap and shows that the two measures co-move very closely with a correlation of
about 0.9.

dispersion.31 While the measure proposed by Rossi and Sekhposyan (2015) is available for a
large number of countries, the time series dimension is unbalanced and often not long enough
for our purposes. Finally, model based measures, such as those in Jurado et al. (2015) and
Ludvigson et al. (2015) could in principle be computed for all countries in our sample, but the
data requirements to construct such measures for many countries over a sufficiently long time
period are prohibitive.



6         Data and Selected Stylized Facts for Volatility and Growth

This section briefly describes the data set we use in the empirical analysis and reports some
stylized facts based on the unconditional moments of the data. Specifically, we consider the
degree of persistence in the growth and volatility series, that is relevant for our model specifi-
cation; and examine the patterns of cross-country correlations, which play an important role in
our identification strategy.

         The sources of the data and their sampling information are reported in Appendix B. To
construct a balanced panel for the largest number of countries for which we have sufficiently
long time series, we first collect daily stock prices for 32 advanced and emerging economies from
1979 to 2011. We then cut the beginning of the sample in 1993, as daily equity price data are
not available earlier for two large emerging economies (Brazil and China) and for Peru. Better
quality quarterly GDP data for China also became available from 1993. Our results seem to be
robust to excluding these three countries and starting the sample in 1988. Moreover, some steps
of the empirical analysis, like the estimator of factor innovations (ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t ), can be implemented
with the unbalanced panel from 1979 without any significant consequence for our main findings.


6.1         Persistence

A battery of summary statistics on the realized volatility series and the real GDP series (in
levels) supports our model specification in terms of the log-level of realized volatility and the
log-differences of real GDP. As Table S.1 in the online supplement shows, the levels of realized
volatility, even though persistent, tend to be mean-reverting. Table S.2 in the supplement shows
that the first order auto-correlation coefficient for realized volatility is on average about 0.6. Also
standard ADF tests reject the null hypothesis of unit roots in the volatility series. In contrast,
    31
         See, for instance, Zarnowitz and Lambros (1987), Popescu and Smets (2010), Bachmann et al. (2013).


                                                         32
the persistence of real GDP levels is very high (on average around 0.99). Moreover, the null of
a unit root for the level of log-GDP cannot be rejected by standard ADF tests for any of the 32
countries in our sample.


6.2     Cross-country Correlations

The differential pattern of cross-country correlations of the growth and volatility innovations
is crucial for our identification strategy. Here we consider the properties of the observed time
series as displayed in Figure 2. In order to gauge the extent to which volatility and growth
series co-move across countries, we use two techniques: standard principal component analysis
and pair-wise correlation analysis across countries.

   In a panel of countries indexed by i = 1, 2, ..., N , the average pair-wise correlation of country
i in the panel (ρ̄i ) measures the average degree of co-movement of country i with all other
countries j (i.e., for all j 6= i). The average pair-wise correlation across all countries, denoted
by ρ̄N , is defined as the cross-country average of ρ̄i over i = 1, 2, ..., N . This statistics relates
to the degree of pervasiveness of the factors, as measured by the factor loadings. To see this,
consider equation (29) of our model, ∆yit = γ i ft + εit , where V ar(ft ) = 1, and V ar(εit ) = σ 2εi .
The average pair-wise correlation across all countries is given by:
                                                                                                     

         The attraction of the average pair-wise correlation, ρ̄N , lies in the fact that it applies to
multi-factor processes, and unlike factor analysis does not require the factors to be strong. In
fact, the average pair-wise correlation, ρ̄N , tends to be a strictly positive number if ∆yit contains
at least one strong factor, otherwise it tends to zero as N → ∞. Therefore, non-zero estimates
of ρ̄N are suggestive of strong cross-sectional dependence.32 For completeness, and to show that
our analysis is robust to using an alternative methodology, in what follows, we also use standard
principal component analysis.33

         Country-specific average pair-wise correlations of volatility and GDP growth are reported
in Figure 2. Recall that the average pair-wise correlation across all countries for the realized
volatility series is 0.56. In contrast, the average pair-wise correlation across all countries for the
growth series at 0.27 is much smaller. As we can see, the pair-wise correlations of volatility and
growth have a similar values for different countries, but there is a clear difference between the
two variables. This suggests that both variables may share at least one strong common factor,
even though volatilities seem to co-move more across countries than the GDP growth rates.

         Principal component analysis yields similar results. The first principal component in our
panel of realized volatility series explains 65 percent of the total variation in the log-level of
volatility, whilst the first principal component of the growth series accounts for only around 30
percent of total cross-country variations. Thus, both in the case of the pair-wise correlation
and principal component analysis, the results point to a much higher degree of cross-country co-
movements for the volatility series than for the growth series. As we will see, these differences are
even more pronounced in the case of the estimated innovations series obtained using equations
(62) and (63).



7         Estimated Common and Country-specific Components

The preliminary analysis above is compatible with the common factor model proposed in the pa-
per, suggesting a stronger degree of cross-country co-movements for volatility series as compared
to the growth series. The summary statistics reported also support the model specification in
terms of log-level of volatility and log-difference of growth. Now we will use our multi-country
factor-augmented VAR model, (62) and (63), to interpret the observed negative association
    32
     Formal tests of cross-sectional dependence based on estimates of ρ̄N are discussed in Pesaran (2015) and
reported, for our panel of countries, in the next section.

between volatility and growth.

   We begin by estimating the global factor innovations, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , using (60) and (61). We then
estimate country-specific VAR models conditional on these innovations and obtain estimates of
the country-specific growth and volatility innovations, εit and η it . The necessary computations
are carried out by applying OLS to (62)-(63) for each i separately. Finally, we compute and re-
port conditional pair-wise correlations across countries for country-specific volatility and growth
innovations to evaluate our identification assumptions, and within-country correlations between
volatility and growth innovations to assess the model’s ability to capture the countercyclical
nature of realized volatility. It is important to note that we will also estimate country-specific
volatility innovations, uit , by conditioning only on ζ̂ t rather than both on ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t in (62)-(63).
Thus, we will present results for estimated values of both η it and uit as the latter are derived
under weaker assumptions.


7.1    Estimated Global Real and Financial Shocks

The global shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , are recovered from the OLS estimation of (60) and (61). Figure
3 plots them when estimated using the unbalanced panel from 1979 (thin lines with asterisks),
and when we use the balanced panel from 1993 (thick solid lines), so as to better illustrate their
time profiles. The figure also reports one-standard deviation bands for the shocks. Note that
the shocks are standardized and have zero means and unit in-sample variances. They are also
serially uncorrelated and orthogonal to each other.

   The figure shows that the largest common real shock was after the second oil shock in 1979,
and during the fourth quarter of 2008 after the Lehman’s collapse. Also note that, after a very
large positive shock in the second quarter of 2009, the size of the subsequent impulses declines
persistently, which is consistent with the anemic global recovery experienced in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis. The sizes of largest absolute values of common financial shocks,
ξ̂ t coincide with the 1987 stock market crash and the 2008 Lehman’s collapse. Our estimates
of global financial shocks co-move positively, but not closely, with the US measures of financial
volatility, risk and investor sentiment. In general, ξ̂ t series is more volatile and by construction
less persistent as compared to the these (raw) US measures. The correlation of ξ̂ t with the US
Baa-Treasury credit spread and Excess Bond Premium of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) is 0.20

(2015) is about 0.4, and with the US VIX index is 0.5. This evidence suggests that our series
of global financial shocks has distinct information content as compared to a number of related
US-specific measures.

    In the online supplement to the paper, we compare the above results with those obtained
using the principal components. Specifically, we first show that, when we recover ζ̂ t using
principal components applied to the panel of growth rates, ∆yit , we obtain virtually the same
results, as expected and highlighted in Remark 1 above. Second, we show that when we run

supplement to the paper, we show that one can approximately recover ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t by applying the
principal component analysis in a recursive manner, provided the recursive estimation is carried
out with ∆yit first, followed by vit , and not vice versa.


7.2      Cross-country Correlations of Volatility and Growth Innovations

Although the restrictions behind our identification assumptions cannot be formally tested, our
multi-country approach permits us to investigate the extent to which the implications of the
identified model are in line with the identification restrictions made.35 To this end, we explore
the cross-country correlations of the estimated residuals from the dynamic regressions (62) and
(63), with and without conditioning on the financial shocks series, ξ̂ t .36

       Panel A of Figure 4 plots, for each country in our sample, the average pair-wise correlation
of the volatility innovations (ûit ) and the growth innovations (ε̂it ), when we condition only on
ζ̂ t in model (62)-(63). Panel B reports the same statistics when we condition on both ζ̂ t and
ξ̂ t in model (62)-(63).37 The statistics reported are the same as in Figure 2. The blue (darker)
bars are the average pair-wise correlations of the country-specific growth innovations (ε̂it ). The
yellow (lighter) bars are for the country-specific volatility innovations (ûit and η̂ it , respectively).

       Panel A of Figure 4 shows that, if we condition only on ζ̂ t in (62)-(63), the volatility inno-
vations display average pair-wise correlations comparable to those of the data reported for all
countries in Figure 2. In contrast, the pair-wise correlations of the growth innovations are neg-
ligible, with an average across all countries of 0.03.38 Panel B of Figure 4 also shows that, if we
condition on both ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , the cross-country correlations of the volatility innovations are now
negligible, as in the case of the growth innovations, with an average pair-wise correlation across
all countries equal to 0.02. For instance, in the specific case of the US, the average pair-wise
correlation of the volatility innovations is equal to 0.6 conditioning on ζ̂ t alone. But it drops
to −0.05 if we condition on both factor innovations. By comparison, the US average pair-wise
  35
     Note that we can estimate ζ t and ξ t consistently by means of the OLS regressions (60) and (61) only under the
identification assumptions made. As a result, whilst we can directly estimate pair-wise correlations of volatility
and growth series, we can not examine cross-country pair-wise correlations of their innovations without imposing
these identification conditions.
  36
     Recall that, in this case, we run OLS on (62) without conditioning on ξ̂ t in the regression.
  37
     The same growth innovations are obtained in the two exercises.
  38
     Notable exceptions are China and India.

 Note. Country-specific average pair-wise correlation of volatility (yellow, lighter bars) and GDP growth (blue,
 darker bars) innovations conditional on ζ̂ t only (Panel A) and on ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t (Panel B). The volatility measures
 are based on (64). The dotted lines are the averages across all countries, equal to 0.52 and 0.03 for volatility
 and growth in Panel A; and equal to 0.02 and 0.03 for volatility and GDP growth in Panel B, respectively.
 Sample period: 1993:Q1-2011:Q2.


correlation of the growth innovations is −0.02.

   Figure 4, therefore, illustrates that after conditioning on ζ̂ t —which is common to both growth
and volatility series—not much commonality is left in the case of growth innovations, but the
volatility innovations share additional strong factors. Moreover, after conditioning on both ζ̂ t
and ξ̂ t , the volatility innovations also appear weakly correlated because of the near-zero average
pair-wise correlation across all countries, thus suggesting that only two common shocks are
necessary to span their correlations across-countries as we assume. It is, therefore, interesting
to test whether the two sets of innovations also satisfy a formal definition of weak and strong
dependence, as we assumed deriving them.

       To test for weak and strong cross-section dependence, we estimate the cross-sectional de-
pendence (CD) test statistic of Pesaran (2015) and the exponent of cross sectional dependence
(α) proposed in Bailey et al. (2016). The CD statistic is normally distributed with zero-mean
and unit-variance under the null of zero average pair-wise correlations. So, the critical value
is around 2. When the null is rejected, Bailey et al. (2016) suggest estimating the strength
of the cross-section dependence with an exponent, denoted α in the range (1/2, 1], with unity
giving the maximum degree of cross dependence. Any value above 1/2 and below 1, but signifi-
cantly different from 1, suggests weak dependence.39 So, in what follows, we present estimates
of α for the volatility and the growth innovations, together with their confidence intervals. For
comparison, we also report the same estimates for the (raw) growth (∆yit ) and volatility (vit )
series.

          Note. CD is the cross-sectional dependence test statistic of Pesaran (2015). α̂ is the estimate of
          the exponent of cross-sectional dependence as in Bailey et al. (2016), together with its 90-percent
          confidence interval (‘Lower 5%’ and ‘Upper95%’).


       The results are summarized in Table 1 and are in accordance with the identification assump-
tions made. The CD test statistic for the growth series is 29.64, with the associated α exponent
estimated at 1.00. The CD statistic for the volatility series is even higher at 57.00 with an
estimated α of 1.00. The CD statistics and the estimates of the α exponent confirm with a
high degree of confidence that both series are cross-sectionally strongly correlated, containing
at least one strong common factor. Conditional only on ζ̂ t , the CD statistic for the country-
specific growth innovations (ε̂it ) drops to 5.07, close to its critical value under the null of zero
  39
   When estimating α one also needs to take into account the sampling uncertainty which depends on the relative
magnitude of N and T , and the null of weak cross dependence depends on the relative rates of increase of N and
T.

average pair-wise correlations, with its exponent of cross-sectional dependence estimated to be
0.80, and is significantly below 1. In sharp contrast, the CD statistic for the country-specific
volatility innovations (ûit ) remains close to that of the raw volatility series at 57.31 with an
estimated α close to unity. However, when we condition on both ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , the CD statistic for
the volatility innovations (η̂ it ) also falls to 2.13, with an estimated α of 0.65 and a 95 percent
confidence interval of [0.57, 0.73], while the CD statistic and α are the same as before for the
growth innovations (ε̂it ). The battery of test statistics in Table 1, therefore, accord well with
the assumptions made that the volatility innovation share at least one more (Assumption 3),
and only one more (Assumption 4) strong factor, than the growth innovations.


7.3      Country-specific Correlations Between Volatility and Growth Innova-
         tions

We have shown already that realized equity price volatility is countercyclical in almost all coun-
tries in our sample. Figure 5 suggests that this association is almost entirely accounted for
by the global output growth innovations, ζ̂ t . Figure 5 compares unconditional and conditional
contemporaneous correlations between volatility and growth. For ease of comparison, Panel
A displays again the correlations of volatility and growth series reported in Figure 1. Panel B
shows the correlation between ûit and ε̂it conditional on ζ̂ t only, as in (63)-(62). Panel C, reports
the correlation between η̂ it and ε̂it , conditional on both ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t .

       Figure 5 shows that ζ̂ t can account for most of the unconditional association between volatil-
ity and growth at quarterly frequency reported in Panel A.40 Conditioning on ζ̂ t , the correlation
between volatility and growth innovations weakens substantially for all countries and it is no
longer statistically significant in all but two cases, which happen to be very volatile emerging
economies. In the case of the US, for instance, the conditional correlation does not vanish, but
drops to less than half its unconditional value and is not statistically significant. Panel C of
Figure 5 shows that conditioning explicitly on ξ̂ t does not alter these results. This is intuitive,
as ξ̂ t is common only to the volatility series.

       These results suggest that volatility and growth share an important common component at
quarterly frequency, and that conditioning on ζ̂ t captures most of this dependence. This implies
that some of the explanatory power attributed to uncertainty shocks in empirical studies of

   Recall that this result does not depend on the granularity of the volatility weights in Assumption 2 and on
Assumption 4.

individual countries, considered in isolation from the rest of the world, might be due to omitting
such a common factor from the analysis.

    How can we interpret this evidence? While we are agnostic on which specific structural
model may or may not generate the pattern of cross-country correlations that we have assumed
in our identification strategy and documented above, given our theoretical model, it is reasonable
to interpret the common growth innovations, ζ̂ t , as reflecting variations in the global risk free
rate. Specifically, in Section 2.1 and 2.2, using a simple multi-country model, we showed that
expected world growth is tied to the world risk-free rate, and changes in expected world growth
can affect both country volatilities and country growth rates at the same time. Lower expected
world growth means a lower world risk-free rate, and hence higher country risk premium and
country volatility, but also lower country growth. Our real common factor, therefore, drives
both variables.

    Note, however, that the evidence reported above does not imply that changes in volatility
over time are mostly driven by ζ̂ t . That is, while these shocks can account for most of the
contemporaneous co-movement between volatility and growth, they do not necessarily explain
a significant share of the observed time variations in global innovations to volatility. Indeed, as
we will see in the next section, ζ̂ t explains a relatively small share of the variation of volatility
over time, with a much larger share explained by ξ̂ t .



8     Volatility and Growth Forecast Error Variance Decomposi-
      tions

Forecast error variance decompositions are routinely used to quantify the importance of a given
shock for the time-variation of the endogenous variables at different time horizons, relative to
other shocks in the model. Our factor augmented multi-country VAR model can be readily used
to decompose the forecast error variance of country volatility and growth in terms of the common
shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , as well as the 64 vector of country-specific shocks, η̂ it and ε̂it for i = 1, 2, ...., 32.
While the global real and financial shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , are orthogonal to the country-specific shocks
and to each other by construction, the country-specific shocks η̂ it and ε̂it are left unrestricted,
and can be correlated, both within and between countries, even conditional on ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . In
order to compute and interpret forecast error variance decompositions, we therefore have to deal



                                                        42
with this source of within country interdependence.

   Consider first the correlation between volatility and growth innovations within each country.
We saw in Figure 5 that the contemporaneous within-country correlation between η̂ it and ε̂it
is very small and not statistically significant for all but two emerging market economies, once
we condition on the global shocks ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . Nonetheless, even assuming the estimated reduced
form covariance matrix were truly diagonal, this would not imply that innovations η̂ it and ε̂it
can be interpreted as ‘structural’ country-specific volatility and growth shocks. As it is well
known there always exists an orthonormal transformation of η̂ it and ε̂it that lead to the same
forecast error variance decomposition.

   It is, therefore, important that the 64×64 matrix of correlations among all 32 countries and
both variables is considered in a full multi-country set up. Our results show that, conditional
on both real and financial common shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t , the country-specific innovations ε̂it and η̂ it
are weakly correlated across countries (Figure 4). The average pair-wise correlations of volatility
and growth is negligible, and even in the case of China and India they were well below 0.2. As we
discussed above, weak cross-sectional dependence means that, as N grows, the overall average
pair-wise correlation tends to zero. This further means that, while some pairs of correlations
can be different from zero, not all pairs can be so. In practice, this means that most correlation
pairs will be very small and the overall covariance matrix must be sparse.

   We exploit the sparsity of the correlation matrix of country-specific shocks by making al-
ternative assumptions regarding the causal relations between the country-specific innovations
η̂ it and ε̂it , and show that the inference we draw is reasonably robust to different estimates of
the country-specific error correlation matrix. As a first approximation, we assume that the only
source of interdependence among all growth and volatility series are the global real and financial
shocks ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . This implies assuming that country-specific volatility and growth shocks have
no contemporaneous impact on growth or volatility series within and across countries. Despite
its apparent severity, this assumption seems justified by our empirical finding that there ex-
ist very limited conditional within-country correlations and weak cross-country correlations as
summarized above.

   We then check the robustness of the results from this ‘benchmark’ scenario, by comparing
them with those obtained under weaker assumptions. While maintaining the assumption of zero
conditional correlations between countries, we assume that country-specific volatility shocks can



                                                   43
have a contemporaneous causal impact on growth variables but not vice-versa, in line with much
of the existing empirical literature as reviewed in the Introduction. This is done by allowing for
a block-diagonal error covariance matrix in the full multi-country model, in which the only non-
zero off-diagonal elements are the estimated covariances between volatility and growth errors of
each country block. These within-country blocks are factorized with a Cholesky decomposition,
ordering volatility before growth.

      Finally, as a third possibility we refrain altogether from interpreting country-specific volatil-
ity and growth shocks as structural, and make use of a general unrestricted error covariance
matrix subject to the sparsity condition, both within and across countries and compute the
generalized forecast error variance decompositions (GFEVD) of Pesaran and Shin (1998), rather
than orthogonal forecast error variance decompositions that require Cholesky ordering of the
shocks. However, before computing GFEVDs, we use the regularized multiple testing threshold
estimator of the error covariance matrix proposed by Bailey et al. (2017) and described in more
detail below, to obtain a consistent estimator of the 64×64 error covariance matrix for the full
multi-country model. This regularized estimator exploits the sparsity of the underlying error
covariance matrix.

      In what follows we report results for these three alternative specifications of the covariance
matrix of the innovations ε̂it and η̂ it . As we wish to quantify the relative importance of both the
real and the financial common shocks, all results are based on (62)-(63) that include both ζ̂ t and
ξ̂ t . Specifically, Figure 6 reports the forecast error variance decompositions (FEVDs) obtained
assuming the 64×64 error covariance matrix is diagonal; Figure 7 reports the results obtained for
a block-diagonal error covariance matrix and a Cholesky decomposition within each block; and
Figure 8 reports the generalized FEVDs (GFEVDs) obtained using the regularized estimator
of the error covariance matrix.41 Each figure reports the ‘average’ variance decomposition,
weighting country-specific decompositions with PPP-GDP weights. We shall now summarize
the error variance decompositions that result from these three alternative specifications.

figure shows that country volatility is driven largely by common financial shocks (blue area with
vertical lines) and country-specific volatility shocks (red area with crosses). Combined together,
these two shocks explain about 95 percent of the total variance of realized volatility over time.
Real common shocks (purple area with diagonal lines) explain less than 5 percent of the total
volatility forecast error variance. Country growth shocks, as well as all other 31 country-specific
foreign growth shocks in the full model, play essentially no role. These results, therefore, suggest
that country volatility is largely driven by global financial shocks and its own country-specific
innovations. In other words, according to these results, the component of volatility driven by
common or country-specific output shocks, and hence the ‘endogenous’ component of country-
specific volatility in the sense of Ludvigson et al. (2015) is very small.

   It is worth noting that these estimated shares of the forecast error variance of volatility
are similar to the central estimates of Ludvigson et al. (2015) for the US. In that study, the
share of macroeconomic shocks in the forecast error variance of financial volatility is estimated
at just above 5 percent in the long run. However, while Ludvigson et al. (2015) attribute this
to the US business cycle (as proxied by a shock to US industrial production), we attribute a
similar outcome to the global real shock, which can be interpreted as an international business

for country-specific volatility.42

    Consider now the forecast error variance decomposition of GDP growth reported on the right
hand side of Figure 6. The figure shows that, on average, the forecast error variance of country
specific GDP growth is driven mostly by country-specific growth shocks and global real shocks,
with a combined share approaching 90 percent of the total in the long run (green areas with
squares and purple area with diagonal lines, respectively). The country-specific growth shock
explains more than 60 percent of the total forecast error variance in the long-run, while the real
global shock on average explains around 30 percent of the total growth forecast error variance.
This is in line with existing results in the international business cycle literature (see, for instance,
Kose et al. (2003)).43

    Global financial shocks explain about 8-10 percent of country-specific growth forecast error
variance, on average, in our sample. The importance of these shocks picks up gradually over the
forecast horizon and stabilizes within two years. In contrast, the own country-specific volatility
shock, explains only a small share of the total forecast error variance of GDP growth, with a
weight of about 1 − 2 percent, while the combination of all other 31 country-specific volatility
shocks in the model explain only a small share of country growth variance. These results clearly
illustrate the quantitative importance of distinguishing between common and country-specific
volatility shocks.


8.2    Block-Diagonal Covariance Matrix and Orthogonal Decomposition

We now maintain the assumption of zero correlations of country-specific shocks (after condi-
tioning on the common shocks) across countries, but allow for a possibly non-zero correlation
between volatility and growth within each country. Specifically, we assume that, at the coun-
try level, a volatility shock can affect growth within a quarter but not vice versa. This is the
assumption typically made in the empirical literature on volatility and the business cycle. So,
  42
     Results for specific countries, including the United States, are reported in the online supplement. As can
be seen from Figures S.6 to S.9 also in the online Supplement, countries behave pretty similarly, with some but
limited heterogeneity. The results for the United States, in particular, are similar to those for the average economy
reported here.
  43
     Notice that these results imply that countries’ business cycles remain largely unexplained within our econo-
metric model. Indeed, in the data, there are many shocks at work, and this is captured in our relatively simple
empirical framework by the large share of growth forecast error variance accounted for by the own country specific
growth shocks.

here, we are ‘identifying’ exogenous country-specific volatility changes with a Cholesky decom-
position of the within-country covariance matrix. We do so by ordering volatility first in the
model (62)-(63).

   The results for this specification are given in Figure 7 and can be seen to be virtually identical
to the estimates obtained for the diagonal error covariance matrix reported in Figure 6. This
is perhaps not surprising given that the correlations between the country-specific innovations,
once the effects of the common shocks are removed, are very small as in Figure 5.


8.3    Thresholding the Error Covariance Matrix and Generalized Decomposi-
       tion

We finally allow for a fully estimated (64 × 64) correlation matrix, both within and across
countries, and compute the GFEVDs. However, given the large size of this matrix, we regularize
it by computing a threshold estimator following Bailey et al. (2017), who developed a procedure
based on results from the multiple testing literature. Specifically, we first test for the statistical
significance of each of the 2016 distinct off-diagonal elements of the (64 × 64) matrix. We then


                                                          47
set to zero all those elements that are not statistically significant, using suitably adjusted critical
values to allow for the large number of tests that are being carried out. We then finally compute
the GVEDs by using the regularized estimates as derived in the online supplement to the paper.

       Table 2 below lists all the non-zero correlation pairs. As can be seen, only 50 out of 2016
total off-diagonal elements are statistically different from zero. Of these, about half are positively
correlated and the other half are negatively correlated, with an average value that is close to
zero. Most notably, there is no surviving within-country contemporaneous correlation between
volatility and growth, except for India. There are also very few significant GDP-GDP correlation
pairs (i.e., ε̂it with ε̂jt ), with no obvious regional pattern of co-movements. There are a few
significant pairs of volatility-volatility correlations (i.e., η̂ it with η̂ jt ), but involving only a handful
of countries, with no evidence of a dominant role for the United States. Finally, there are a few
significant GDP-volatility correlation pairs (i.e., ε̂jt with η̂ it ) for a few countries, like Belgium,
China, France, Italy and the Netherlands, again revealing no specific patterns.

       The estimated generalized forecast error variance decompositions (GFEVDs), reported in
Figure 8, are consistent with those obtained assuming a diagonal or block-diagonal error co-
variance matrix.44 Relative to the results with diagonal or block-diagonal covariance matrix in
                                                                                                 P
Figures 6 and 7, the contribution of foreign country-specific volatility (growth) shocks,            η̂ j
 P
( ε̂j ), to domestic volatility (growth) is now larger, but the spillover effects of foreign volatility
shocks to growth (and foreign growth shocks to volatility) remain negligible. Moreover, global
financial shocks and domestic country-specific volatility shocks continue to explain the bulk of
the forecast error variance of volatility. Similarly, real global shocks and the country-specific
growth shocks remain the main drivers of the forecast error variance of growth.




  44
       Notice here that the GFEVDs need not to sum to 100 as the underlying shocks are not orthogonal.

     We interpret the above results as strong evidence of robustness of our conclusions reached
by assuming a diagonal or block-diagonal covariance matrix. In particular, it remains the case
that common or country-specific output growth shocks have no important role for volatility,
and home and foreign country-specific volatility shocks have little quantitative consequence for
output growth.

9     The Transmission of Global Real and Financial Shocks

The last step of our empirical analysis is the computation of impulse responses of country-
specific volatility and growth to global real and financial shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . While forecast error
variance decompositions speak to the importance of a particular shock for the time-variation
of the endogenous variables relative to other shocks in the model, impulse responses provide
information on the size of the effects of the shocks and their transmission across variables and
countries.

     Figure 9 displays a weighted average of the country-specific impulse responses using PPP-

GDP weights (solid line), together with two-standard deviation error bands (shaded areas). The
error bands are computed based on the dispersion of the impulse responses across countries.45
We focus on the effects of positive unit (one-standard deviation) real and financial shocks, ζ̂ t
and ξ̂ t .46

 Note. Average impulse responses to one-standard deviation real and financial shocks, ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . The solid
 lines are the PPP-GDP weighted averages of the country-specific responses. The shaded areas are the two
 standard deviations confidence intervals. See equations (S3.12) and (S3.13) for the derivations and Figure S.12

    Panels (A) and (B) of Figure 9 display the average across countries of the volatility and
growth responses to a real global shock. These figures show that a positive real global shock
increases output growth and lowers volatility. This reflects an endogenous volatility response
to the fundamental improvements in the world economy. Note that the error bands around the
average responses are very tight, reflecting relatively homogeneous country responses. In fact, as
can be seen from Figure S.12, provided in the online supplement, the impulse responses have a
similar shape for most countries. The average impact of this shock on country volatilities is one
order of magnitude smaller than its impact on country output growth, but it is quite persistent,
  45
     The derivation of the average impulse response functions to common factor shocks and their error bands is
provided in the online supplement S3, equations (S3.12) and (S3.13). The estimated country-specific responses
to the two common shocks are reported in Figure S.12 in the online Supplement to the paper.

     Recall that these shocks are orthogonal to all other shocks in the model and to each other by construction.

taking more than three years for the effects of the shocks to vanish completely. Panel (B) also
shows that, on average, country growth loads positively on ζ̂ t , with persistent effects up to 8-10
quarters, as one would expect. Country output growth increase by about half a percentage point
following a one-standard error change in ζ̂ t . This is consistent with the existing evidence on the
international business cycle, which attributes an important role to a world factor, along with
regional and country-specific factors, in driving the business cycle (e.g., Kose et al. (2003)).

    Panels (C) and (D) of Figure 9 report the responses of volatility and growth to a positive
global financial shock, ξ̂ t . These average responses suggest that a positive shock to ξ̂ t is ‘bad
news’ for the world economy, as volatility increases and growth declines. For a one-standard
deviation shock to the common financial factor, volatility increases by 25 basis points, while
growth declines by about 15 basis points within two quarters after the shock.47 Although
smaller than the growth response to the real common factor shock in panel B, the average
growth response to the global financial shock in panel D is of the same order of magnitude, and
hence quantitatively sizable. The average responses to the common financial shock are also very
persistent, but there is much more heterogeneity in the country growth responses, as can be seen
from Figure S.12 provided in the online supplement. Therefore, these impulse responses suggest
that, even though common financial shocks may not explain a very large share of the forecast
error variance of output growth over time, they can cause large and persistent global recessions.

    Impulse responses to country-specific shocks have qualitatively similar pattern of transmis-
sion but, as one would expect given the forecast error variance results, are quantitatively much
smaller than responses to common shocks.48

    The pattern of shock transmissions in Figure 9 is consistent with country volatility increasing
in response to the large declines in the world output in the second part of 2008, and the world
recession being amplified by the exceptionally large common financial shock in the fourth quarter
of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009. The transmission in Figure 9 can also help in explaining
the seemingly puzzling coexistence of high policy volatility (as in Baker et al. (2016)) and low
equity market volatility after the beginning of the Trump administration with a combination of
a real and a financial shock partially offsetting each other.

     Note that the delayed growth response to the global financial shock follows from our identification assumptions,
but it is not imposed directly on country-specific models.

10      Conclusions

Empirical measures of uncertainty behave countercyclically in most countries of the world, but
economic theory suggests that causation can run both ways. In this paper, we study the in-
terrelation between realized equity price volatility and GDP growth without imposing a priori
restrictions on the direction of economic causation. We develop a multi-country version of the
Lucas tree model with time-varying volatility and derive expressions for country-specific output
growth, equity returns and their realized volatilities in terms of innovations to a global technol-
ogy or growth factor and its higher–order moments. We show that both a level (or first-order)
common component and higher-order common components are required to explain the cross
country variations of realized volatility, but only the level common component is required for
explaining cross-country differences in output growth. Using this theoretical insight, we estimate
a multi-country econometric model in output growth and realized volatilities for 32 countries
over the period 1993Q1-2011Q2. Common real and financial shocks are identified assuming that
volatility and growth are driven by two common factors. By taking a multi-country approach,
as opposed to studying a single economy in isolation, we can identify and estimate these two
factors. Our identification strategy exploits different patterns in the correlations of volatility
and output growth innovations across countries. Evidence based on the cross-country correla-
tions of the raw data and estimated innovations accords with the assumptions made to achieve
identification.

     Empirically, we report three main sets of findings. First, shocks to the real common factor
account for most of the unconditional correlation between volatility and growth in all but few
emerging market economies. Second, the share of forecast error variance of volatility explained
by the real common factor shock and by country-specific growth shocks is less than 5 percent.
Third, shocks to the financial common factor explain about 10 percent of the growth forecast
error variance, while country-specific volatility shocks explain only about 1-2 percent of country-
specific growth forecast error variance. Moreover, when a shock to the financial common factor
is realized, its negative impact on country-specific growth is large and persistent as typically
estimated in the existing literature.

     These results imply that the endogenous component of country volatility is small and that
uncertainty is more important for the business cycle when the shocks are global in nature.

Appendix: Derivations and Data Sources

A     Mathematical Derivations

A.1     Country-specific Growth Process

One way to motivate the output growth specification, (1), is as follows. Assume a standard Cobb-
Douglas production function in terms of output per worker and denote (Yit /Lit ) = exp(ỹit ), real
GDP per capita, Ait = exp(ait ) the country-specific level of technology, Lit the labor force, and
Kit the capital stock in country i so that we have:

                      ỹit = ln(Yit /Lit ) = ait + αi ln(Kit /Lit ) = ait + αi log(kit )

for i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Further assume that the processes for Lit and ait are exogenously given by

                      ln(Lit ) − ln(Li,t−1 ) = ni , and ait = ai0 + g̃i t + γ i at + eit

where growth of labour force, ni , is assumed to be fixed, ai0 is an initial condition, g̃i is a
deterministic growth component of ait , at is the log-level of a stochastic common technology
factor, and eit is the country-specific technology shock, with γ i measuring the extent to which
country i is exposed to the global technology factor at . A key result from the stochastic growth
literature is that, for all i, log(kit ) is ergodic and stationary, in the sense that as t tends to infinity,
log(kit ) tends to a time-invariant random variable, namely log(kit ) = log(ki ) + τ it , where τ it is a
stationary process representing all country-specific forces driving the country’s business cycles
(see, for instance, Lee et al., 1997). So we have:

                             ỹit = ai0 + αi log(ki ) + gi t + γ i at + eit + τ it .

Taking first differences we obtain,

                                          ∆ỹit = g̃i + γ i ft + εit ,                                (A.1)

where ft = ∆at = at − at−1 , and εit = ∆eit + ∆τ it . In terms of log output, yit = ln(Yit ), we now
obtain equation (1), with ∆yit = yit − yi,t−1 , gi = g̃i + ni .


A.2     Country-specific Equity Excess Return

We first note that using (20) in (18) and (19) we obtain

                                     Et (∆yi,t+j+1 ) = gi + γ i φj+1 ft ,

we also obtain the following expression for country-specific excess returns

which yields Et ri,t+1 − rt+1 = 2 % γ af + O N              . Therefore, in our multi-country model
with complete markets, country-specific risk gets diversified completely, and excess return pre-
dictability only arises if N , the number of countries participating in global risk sharing, is not
large enough. However, there is still a non-zero risk premium for equity holdings so long as
%2 > 0. Recall that af > 0, γ 2 > 0.

A.3     Proof of Proposition 4 (Consistent estimation of factors in a dynamic
        heterogeneous multi-country model)

Proof. Using the country-specific models given by (54), and solving for zit in terms of current
and past values of factors and shocks we have:
                                                  ∞
                                                  X
                                     zit = µi +             Φ`i Γi ft−` + κit ,                        (A.5)
                                                      `=0

where
                                                      ∞
                                                            Φ`i ϑi,t−` , and ϑit = (η it , εit )0 .
                                                      X
                                    −1
                  µi = (I2 − Φi )        ai , κit =                                                    (A.6)
                                                      `=0

Assumption 8, ensures that the infinite sums are convergent. Pre-multiplying both sides of (A.5)
by (wi ) and summing over i yields:
                                                      ∞

where                              PN                           PN
                          z̄ωt =     i=1 wi zit , µ̄ω       =     i=1 wi µi ,

                                                                          PN                           (A.8)
                          A`,N =       i=1 wi Φi Γi ,       and κ̄ωt =          i=1 wi κit .

Under Assumption 5, κit are cross-sectionally weakly correlated and the weights w = (w1 , w2 , ..., wN )0
are granular. By results in Pesaran and Chudik (2014), it readily follows that:
                                                    
                            κ̄ωt = O (kwk) = O N −1/2 , for each t.                                    (A.9)

Under Assumptions 7 and 8, we also have

                                   E Φ`i Γi = E Φ`i E (Γi ) = Λ` Γ,

and since Φi and Γi are distributed independently across i, using again results in Pesaran and
Chudik (2014) we have:

                              N

Using (A.9) and (A.10) in (A.7) we now have:
                                                      ∞
                                                      X                        

But under Assumptions 7 and 8, Γ and Λ (L) are both invertible and:

Proof. Consider equation (58) and (59) in the main text. Let MZ̄ω = IT − Z̄ω Z̄0ω Z̄ω                   Z̄0ω ,
and note that:

                                      MZ̄ω f    = MZ̄ω ∆ȳω
                                      MZ̄ω g = MZ̄ω v̄ω − λMZ̄ω ∆ȳω

since MZ̄ω Z̄ω = 0. We set the first normalized vector of innovations, denoted by ζ̂, to MZ̄ω f ,
namely ζ̂ = MZ̄ω ∆ȳω , and set the second factor, that we label ξ̂, as the linear combination of
                                  0
MZ̄ω f and MZ̄ω g such that ζ̂ ξ̂ = 0. This can be achieved selecting λ so that:

                                0
                              ζ̂ ξ̂ = ∆ȳω0 MZ̄ω MZ̄ω v̄ω − λMZ̄ω ∆ȳω = 0.
                                                                      


The value of λ that solves this equation is given by:

                                                      ∆ȳω0 MZ̄ω v̄ω
                                               λ̂ =                   .
                                                      ∆ȳω0 MZ̄ω ∆ȳω

Note that λ̂ is the OLS estimator of the coefficient of the regression of MZ̄ω v̄ω on MZ̄ω ∆ȳω .
Hence, the orthogonalized factors are

                                       ζ̂ = MZ̄ω ∆ȳω ,
                                        ξ̂ = MZ̄ω v̄ω − λ̂MZ̄ω ∆ȳω .

      Note that for any matrix A, kAp k ≤ kAkp , and for any random variable X, kE(X)k ≤ E kXk.

In practice, this implies that ζ̂ can be recovered as residuals from the OLS regression of ∆ȳω
on an intercept and z̄ω,t−` , for ` = 1, 2, ..., p:

                                             ∆ȳω = Z̄ω ĉ1 + ζ̂                        (A.13)

While ξ̂ can be recovered as residuals from the OLS regression of v̄ω on ζ̂, an intercept, and
z̄ω,t−` , for ` = 1, ..., p:
                                           v̄ω = λ̂ζ̂ + Z̄ω ĉ2 + ξ̂                    (A.14)

B     Data Sources

For equity prices we use the MSCI Index (excluding dividends) in local currency. We collected
daily observations from January 1979 to June 2011, but the panel of countries is unbalanced
with only 16 economies starting from the beginning of the sample. A balanced panel was also
constructed with 32 countries from 1993:Q1. The data source for the daily equity price indices
is Bloomberg. The countries included in the sample are the following: Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,
Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United
Kingdom, and United States.
    The list of Bloomberg tickers is as follows: MSELTAG, MSDLAS, MSDLAT, MSDLBE,
MSELTBR, MSDLCA, MSELTCF, MSELTCH, MSDLFI, MSDLFR, MSDLGR, MSELTIA,
MSELTINF, MSDLIT, MSDLJN, MSELTKO, MXMY, MSELTMXF , MSDLNE, MSDLNO,
MSDLNZ, MSELTPR, MSELTPHF, MSELTSA, MGCLSA, MSDLSG, MSDLSP, MSDLSW,
MSDLSZ, MSELTTHF, MSELTTK, MSDLUK, MSDLUS.
    Real GDP data come from standard sources. The data set is balanced and good quality
quarterly data are also available for all countries from 1993:Q1. For more details see:

S1        Realized Volatility versus Cross-sectional Dispersion

As noted in the paper, if we consider a panel of country equities (e.g., of firms or sectors within a
country), a different measure of uncertainty can be computed as the cross-sectional dispersion of
equity prices. In this section we show that this concept is closely related to the realized volatility
measures we consider. To illustrate the point with the data that we use in our application, we
derive results at the ‘country-specific versus world level’ rather than ‘firm-specific versus country
level’.50 Specifically, we compare the cross-sectional dispersion of equity returns across countries
with the realized volatility of ‘world’ equity returns.
      Define the daily cross-country dispersion of equity returns as:
                                             v
                                             u
                                             u     Dt X

and the daily realized volatility of world equity returns as:
                                             v
                                             u

quarter t, and Dt is the number of trading days in quarter t; and wi is the weight attached to
country i. To establish the relation between these two measures it is easier to work with their
squares:

                                                         rit (τ ) = β i ft (τ ) + εit (τ ),

where the factor is strong in the sense that (see Bailey et al., 2016)

cross-sectionally weakly correlated, and serially uncorrelated with zero means and finite vari-
ances. Also let:

where σ 2ft = h2ft − f¯t2 ≥ 0, is the variance of the common factor. This expression shows
that, under fairly general assumptions (and for N and Dt sufficiently large) we would expect
the cross-sectional dispersion measure to be closely related to asset-specific measures of realized
volatility when the factor loadings, β i , are not too dispersed across countries. The results also
show that the relative magnitudes of the cross section dispersion and realized volatility measures
                                                 2

    Figure S.1 compares world realized volatility (σ rvt , light thick line) and cross-sectional dis-
persion (σ cdt , dark thin line), computed as in equations (S1.2) and (S1.1), respectively, with
equal weights. Their sample correlation over the 1979:Q1 to 2011:Q2 period is 0.92. Figure
S.1 suggests that the two measures are very closely related, which is in line with the evidence
provided by Bloom et al. (2012).


S2     Comparison with Principal Components

S2.1     Principal Component versus Cross-sectional Averages

In what follows we compare the cross-sectional average of the GDP growth rates (∆ȳω,t ) with the
first principal component of the individual output growth series {∆yit , i = 1, 2, ...., N ; t = 1, 2, ...., T },
                         y                                                                           y
which we denote by P C1,t  . As can be seen from Figure S.2, the two series (∆ȳω,t , and P C1,t         )
move very closely and have a correlation coefficient of 0.9.




                                                       S4
S2.2     Principal Components of the Combined Panel of Output Growth Series
         and Realized Volatilities

As stated in Remark 2 and 3 in the main text of the paper, applying principal component
analysis to the panel of all volatility series or all volatility and growth series would not permit
identifying ft . To see this, we extract the first two principal components from the full panel
                                                                         vy            vy
of growth rates (∆yit ) and volatilities (vit ), which we label by P C1,t   and P C2,t    , respectively.
We then fit a VAR(1) model to these two PCs, and compute orthogonalized residuals from this
                                                                            vy
VAR with a Cholesky decomposition placing the first PC, namely P C1,t          , first (as discussed in
                                                                        vy           vy
Section 3.3). We denote these orthogonalized residuals by P C1,t and P C2,t . Figure S.3 plots
    vy                                         vy
P C1,t together with ζ̂ t (top panel) and P C2,t together with ξ̂ t (bottom panel), and shows that
the two series behave in a very different fashion, with correlations of −0.43 and 0.43 respectively.


S2.3     Applying Principal Components Recursively

While principal components extracted from the panel of all volatility and growth series do not
permit identifying ft , here we show how principal component analysis can be used to obtain
estimates of the real and financial factors reported in the paper. As discussed in the paper, we
need to follow a recursive procedure where the order of the recursion plays a crucial role. We
need extract the first principal component from the panel of GDP growth rates, which as before
                    y
we label by P C1,t    , and as noted earlier recovers a consistent estimator of ζ t (up to an scalar).
Next, we obtain the first principal component from the combined panel of output growth rates
                                      vy
and volatilities and label it as P C1,t  . Then, we estimate a VAR(1) in the principal components
     y       vy 0
(P C1,t , P C1,t ) to remove any serial correlation, and orthogonalize the residuals of this VAR with
a Cholesky factorization of the variance-covariance matrix of this VAR’s reduced form residuals,
                                                                                     y          vy
           y
with P C1,t   ordered first. Denote the resultant orthogonalized residuals by P C1,t and P C1,t .
                            y                                                vy
    Figure S.4 plots P C1,t together with ζ̂ t (top panel) and P C1,t together with ξ̂ t (bottom
panel), and shows that they move in tandem, with correlations of 0.82 and 0.97, respectively.
Note, finally, that if we were to do a Cholesky factorization of the residuals from the same VAR
                                                             vy      y
but with the variables ordered in reverse, namely (P C1,t       , P C1,t , )0 , the resultant orthogonalized
residuals will not closely follow ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . We conclude from this exercise that principal compo-
nent analysis could be used to obtain qualitatively similar results that we report in the paper if
applied in the recursive manner proposed here.

The high-dimensional VAR in (S3.2) can now be written as a standard FAVAR(p) model in 2N
variables:
                                             p
                                             X
                     zt = (Φ + ψ 1 W) zt−1 +   ψ ` Wzt−` + βυ t + ϑt .             (S3.3)
                                                                 `=2

For example, when p = 1 we have the FAVAR(1):

                                        zt = (I2N − Ψ1 L)−1 (βυ t + ϑt ),

where Ψ1 = Φ + ψ 1 W and

                                 zt = (I2N − Ψ1 L)−1 βυ t + (I − Ψ1 L)−1 ϑt .

Note that by construction υ t and ϑt are orthogonal, and for sufficiently large p, they are serially
uncorrelated. Hence, the impulse response of shocks to elements of υ t and ϑt can be computed
using the following moving average representation:
                                                ∞
                                                X                       ∞
                                                                        X
                                        zt =          An υ t−n +              Cn ϑt−n ,                              (S3.4)
                                                n=0                     n=0

where An = Ψn1 β, and Cn = Ψn1 , for n = 0, 1, 2, ....


S3.1      Responses to Common and Country-specific Shocks

Let ei be a selection vector such that e0i zt picks the ith element of zt . Also let sf = (1, 0)0 and
sg = (0, 1)0 , the vectors that select ζ t and ξ t from υ t , namely:

                                               s0f υ t ≡ ζ t ,        s0g υ t ≡ ξ t .                                (S3.5)

Recall now that ζ t and ξ t have zero means, unit variances and are orthogonal to each other.
Then the impulse responses to a positive unit shock to ζ t or ξ t are given by:

                      IRi,ζ,n = e0i An sf       and IRi,ξ,n = e0i An sg                 for n = 0, 1, 2, ...,        (S3.6)

where An is given by the moving average representation, (S3.4)
     To derive impulse response functions for country-specific shocks, namely the j th element of
ϑt , we need to make assumptions about the correlation between volatility and growth innovations
within each country and across countries. Since the elements of ϑt are weakly correlated across

                                                                 S8
countries, they have some, but limited correlations across countries (see Figure 4). We also
documented that, conditional on the common factors ζ t and ξ t , the country correlation of
volatility and growth innovations are statistically insignificant for all except for four countries.
    As a first order approximation, therefore, we will assume that the covariance matrix of ϑt
in (S3.3) is diagonal. Under this assumption, the impulse response function of a positive, unit
shock to the j th element of ϑt on the the ith element of zt is given by:

                                                       ω̂ jj e0i Cn ej ,
                                                      p
                                        IRi,ϑj ,n =                                              (S3.7)

where Cn is given by the moving average representation, (S3.4), ω̂ jj is the (estimate) of the
variance of the j th country-specific shock and ej is a selection vector such that e0j zt picks the j th
element of zt .
    The above impulse responses can be compared to the generalized impulse responses of Pe-
saran and Shin (1998). The latter are given by:

                                                     e0 Cn Ω̂ej
                                         GIRi,ϑj ,n = ip        ,                                (S3.8)
                                                         ω̂ jj

where Ω̂ = (ω̂ ij ) is the estimate of the covariance of ϑt . The generalized impulse responses
allow for non-zero correlations across the idiosyncratic errors. The two sets of impulse responses
coincide if the covariance matrix of ϑt is diagonal.


S3.2       Forecast Error Variance Decompositions

Traditionally, the forecast error variance decomposition of a VAR model is performed on a
set of orthogonalized shocks, whereby the contribution of the j th orthogonalized innovation to
the mean square error of the n-step ahead forecast of the model is calculated. In our empirical
application this is not the case as —even if the country-specific volatility and growth innovations
η it and εit are weakly correlated across countries— some pairs of innovations can still display
some non-zero correlation. An alternative approach is to compute Generalized Forecast Error
Variance Decompositions (GV D) of Pesaran and Shin (1998). The Generalized Forecast Error
Variance Decompositions consider the proportion of the variance of the n-step forecast errors
of the endogenous variables that is explained by conditioning on the non-orthogonalized shocks,
while explicitly allowing for the contemporaneous correlations between these shocks and the
shocks to the other equations in the system.
      Let GV Di,ζ,n and GV Di,ξ,n be the share of the n-step ahead forecast error variance of the
ith   variable in zt that is accounted for by ζ t and ξ t , respectively, and GV Di,j the variance share

    Note that the different assumptions we make on the covariance matrix of all country-specific
shocks, Ω̂, have implications for the error variance decompositions. Specifically, when we assume
that (i) Ω̂ is diagonal or (ii) Ω̂ is block-diagonal with Cholesky-orthogonalized blocks, the
relative importance of shocks to country volatility and growth for all countries (η it and εit , for
j = 1, 2, ...., 2N ) and shocks to the two common factors ζ t and ξ t , is easily characterized as
V Di,ζ,n + V Di,ξ,n + 2N
                       P
                          j=1 V Di,j,n = 1. That is the GVD formula coincides with the standard
VD formula. In contrast, when we consider an unrestricted covariance matrix Ω̂, the sum of the
variance shares does not necessarily add up to 1.


S3.3    Average Impulse Responses and Forecast Error Variance Decomposi-
        tions

As a summary measure of the effects of shocks to the common factors we report the following
average measures. Denote the impulse response (or forecast error variance decomposition) of a
particular shock on the j th variable in country i at horizon n by Xi,j,n . Let w = (w1 , w2 , ..., wN )0
be a vector of fixed weights such that ΣN    i=1 wi = 1. Then the average impulse response (or

S4     Country-specific Results

In this section we report selected country-specific results, including summary statistics, and the
individual forecast error variance decompositions.
    Figure S.5 plots the US realized volatility measure we constructed with the VIX index (during
the period over which they overlap). The chart shows that the two measures co-move very closely
with a correlation coefficient of around 0.9.

                                      RV US Equity (left)     VIX Index (right)



     Note. ‘RV US Equity’ is the US realized volatility measure defined by (64). The VIX Index is
     the quarterly average of the daily Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index from
     Bloomberg. Sample period: 1990:Q1-2011:Q2.


    Figures S.6 to S.11 report forecast error variance decompositions for each country, for both
volatility and growth, computed with different assumptions on the covariance matrix of the
volatility and growth innovations. As can be seen the estimates are very similar across countries
and for all the three schemes assumed for the error covariances.
   Figure S.12 plots the country-specific impulse response of volatility and growth to a positive,
one-standard-deviation shock to the common shocks ζ̂ t and ξ̂ t . We can see from Figure S.12
that for most countries the impulse responses have a very similar profile.

Tables S.1, S.2, and S.3 report the summary statistics for the realized volatility series, the log-
level of real GDP, and the log-difference of real GDP for each country in our sample. These
results support the use of GDP growth and log-level of realized volatilities as stationary series
in our empirical analysis.
