Juvenile Punishment, High School Graduation and Adult Crime: Evidence from Idiosyncratic
Judge Harshness

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper contributes to the debate on the impact of juvenile punishment on adult criminal
recidivism and high school completion. We link the universe of case files of those who were
convicted of a crime as a juvenile between 1996 and 2012 in a southern U.S. state to the public
school administrative records and to adult criminal records. The detail of the data allows us to
utilize information on the exact types of crimes committed, as well as the type and duration of
punishment imposed, both as a juvenile and as an adult. We exploit random assignment of cases
to judges and use idiosyncratic judge stringency in imprisonment to estimate the causal effect of
incarceration on adult crime and on high school completion. Incarceration has a detrimental
impact on high school completion for earlier cohorts, but it has no impact on later cohorts,
arguably because of the school reform implemented in the state in the late 1990s. We find that
incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on future violent crime, but it lowers the propensity to
commit property crime. Juvenile incarceration increases the propensity of being convicted for a
drug offense in adulthood, but this effect is largely driven by time spent in prison as a juvenile.
Specifically, juvenile incarceration has no statistically significant impact on adult drug offenses if
time spent in prison is less than the median, but longer incarceration increases adult drug
conviction, arguably because longer prison stays intensify emotional stress, leading to drug use.

1        Introduction

Since the seminal work of Becker (1968) and Ehrlich (1973), the fundamental theoretical predictions

of the economic model of criminal behavior have been con rmed by a large number of studies. The

certainty of punishment, represented by an increased probability of arrests or increased police force, has

been shown to exert a signi cant deterrent e¤ect on crime. This impact has been documented in a variety

of empirical designs, using data from di¤erent settings ranging from New York City (Corman and Mocan

2000) to Buenos Aires (Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004), to London (Draca et al. 2011). Similarly,

it has been shown that the severity of punishment has a deterrence e¤ect on criminal propensity. The

most commonly used measure of punishment severity is the sentence length received by the o¤ender.

The analysis of the impact of sentence lengths on criminal proclivity, however, is complicated by the fact

that longer sentences can reduce crime through two channels. First, longer sentences can decrease crime

because they incapacitate the o¤enders and thus prevent them from committing new crimes while in

prison. Second, longer sentences provide a signal to the marginal criminal regarding enhanced sanctions,

and therefore alter the behavior of potential criminals. This second, deterrence, channel is particularly

important to identify both from an academic and policy point of view.

        Recently researchers employed creative strategies and novel data sets to identify the deterrent e¤ect

of prison sentences. For example, Drago et al. (2009) exploited an Italian clemency program as a natural

experiment. The program released inmates from prisons but if the released prisoners were to commit a

crime within the ve years of their release, they would serve the residual of the original sentence plus

the sentence of their new crime.1 Drago et al. (2009) found support for general deterrence; that is, an

increase in the expected sentence reduced recidivism of released inmates. Abrams (2012) used cross-state

variation in the timing of the enactment of sentence enhancement laws and found that add-on gun laws,

that increased the sentence length of crime with guns, generated a ve percent reduction in robberies with

    1
    That is, one month of the original sentence is transformed into one additional month of sentence to be added to any
future crime

guns. Similarly, Kuziemko (2013) reported that prison time reduced recidivism of convicted criminals in

the state of Georgia. Bhuller et al. (2016) found that in Norway prison time reduced the propensity to

re-o¤end in the future. On the other hand, Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2013) reported that in Argentina

prisoners who were assigned to an electronic monitoring system were less likely to recidivate in comparison

to those who received prison sentences.

   The di¤erence in the conclusions between studies analyzing prisoners from Argentina (Di Tella and

Schargrodsky 2013) and Norway (Bhuller et al. 2016) may be the result of the di¤erential treatment

received by prisoners while incarcerated. Speci cally, Bhuller et al. (2016) argue that the reduced

propensity to re-o¤end after the release from prison in Norway is due to the rehabilitation of inmates

while they were in prison. Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2013), on the other hand, explain that the prison

conditions in Argentina are arguably among the worst in the world and that those prisoners who stay

in prison are exposed to rough conditions. Inmates have ample opportunity to learn from each other to

enhance their criminal skills and they become hardened criminals when they leave the prison. This can

explain the higher re-o¤ending rates of these who are imprisoned in comparison to those who wear an

electronic monitoring bracelet without entering prison in Argentina.

   The argument about the possibility of incarcerated individuals enhancing their criminal human capital

while in prison, thus becoming more skilled criminals upon leaving the prison is formalized by Mocan

et al. (2005). The potential for enhancement of criminal human capital while in prison is even more

important for juveniles. Bayer et al. (2009) provide evidence on this point, as they report that juvenile

o¤enders in Florida are inuenced by their peers while serving time in prison. Similarly, Aizer and Doyle

(2015) analyze juvenile delinquents in Chicago/Cook County and nd that incarceration as a juvenile

leads to a reduced propensity to complete high school and enhanced probability of serving time in an

adult correctional facility, suggesting that criminogenic e¤ects of juvenile imprisonment may outweigh its

deterrence e¤ect. In contrast, Hjalmarsson (2009) analyzed data on adjudicated or convicted juveniles

from the state of Washington and reported that incarceration in juvenile facilities reduced recidivism and



                                                     
that this deterrence e¤ect was observed for a variety of sub-groups of juveniles.

       Our paper makes contributions to the debate on the impact of juvenile punishment on adult crime in

di¤erent ways. First, we bring together a number of important research design attributes employed by

previous work. For example, similar to Hjalmarsson (2009), we analyze the administrative records of an

entire state, rather than one jurisdiction in the U.S. Speci cally, we analyze the universe of juveniles who

were incarcerated in the state of Louisiana between 1996 and 2004. To address the potential endogeneity

of juvenile incarceration, we exploit random assignment of defendants to judges and construct an indicator

of judge stringency in incarceration, which is employed as an instrument of juvenile incarceration (Aizer

and Doyle 2015 and Bhuller et al. 2016).2 Under certain assumptions, this estimation strategy generates

the Local Average Treatment E¤ect (LATE) of juvenile incarceration.

       We link the case les in the juvenile justice system to public school records and adult incarceration

records of the state of Louisiana to observe juvenile o¤enders educational attainment (high school com-

pletion) and their future criminal activity (adult criminal conviction). The detail of our data set provides

information not only on the types of crimes these individuals committed as a juvenile, but also on the

types of crimes they committed as an adult. This aspect of our data, which was also available in the data

used by Aizer and Doyle (2015), but not in those employed by Bhuller et al. (2016), generates important

insights into the di¤erential e¤ect of juvenile punishment on adult crime, which has not been noticed by

previous research. Speci cally, we show that juvenile punishment has heterogeneous impacts on various

types of adult crimes. We         nd that having been incarcerated as a juvenile has no impact on future

violent crime, but it has a deterrent e¤ect on future property crime. On the other hand, incarceration as

a juvenile increases the propensity of being convicted for a drug o¤ense in adulthood.

       A key component which has been missing from data sets employed by previous research is information

on time spent in prison as a juvenile. Another contribution of our paper is the ability to have access

to information not only on juvenile o¤enders sentence type (incarceration or probation) but also on

   2
    Using a similar identi cation strategy and in a related context, Dobbie et al. (2017) examine the e¤ects of pre-trial
detention on the probability of future crime and employment.


                                                           
actual amount of time served in prison. This information allows us to conduct a detailed analysis of the

impact of the extensive and intensive margins of punishment (the impact of having been sentenced to

go to prison, as well as time served in prison) on future criminal activity. This investigation generates

interesting insights, and points to a particular mechanism regarding re-o¤ending. For example, we nd

evidence that the positive impact of juvenile imprisonment on adult drug conviction is largely driven by

time spent in prison as a juvenile. Juvenile incarceration has no statistically signi cant impact on adult

drug o¤enses if time spent in prison is less than the median time (209 days), but that longer incarceration

signi cantly increases adult drug conviction and the estimated impact is considerably larger.

   Another advantage of our data set is that it contains information on sentence types assigned to

adult convictions in the form of probation versus incarceration. This information allows us to infer the

seriousness of adult drug convictions. For example, using this information we determine that most drug

convictions are related to drug use rather than drug sales or drug tra¢cking because the overwhelming

majority of those who are convicted of drug charges as adults are put on probation, rather than being

incarcerated.

   Given that the positive impact of juvenile punishment does not exist for any crime category other

than drug convictions, and that the overwhelming majority of adult drug convictions are related to drug

use rather than drug sales or tra¢cking (because they receive probation, rather than prison time), these

results arguably suggest that longer time spent in prison in youth leads to adult drug o¤enses because of

the emotional stress endured in long prison stays.

   When we analyze the impact of juvenile incarceration on high school completion we nd that while

incarceration had a detrimental impact on high school completion propensity in cohorts born before 1983,

it has no impact on later cohorts (younger students), arguably because of the school reforms implemented

in Louisiana made it more di¢cult to obtain a high school diploma. The Louisiana School and District

Accountability system was adopted by the states Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in

June 1998. The state identi ed 10- and 20-year goals for all public schools and required schools to



                                                     
demonstrate progress toward these goals with the intent of improving educational outcomes (Eren and

Depew 2016). As part of this new accountability system, students are required to pass standardized

tests known as Graduation Exit Exam (GEE) in core subjects beginning with the 2000-2001 academic

year. Students who do not meet the minimum requirements in all portions of the high school exam are

not able to obtain a high school diploma. Although the existing evidence is far from being conclusive,

a number of studies found adverse e¤ects of similar high school exit exams on graduation rates, in

particular for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (see, for example, Dee and Jacob 2007). The

graduation rates of the non-incarcerated are historically higher than the graduation rates of those who

have been incarcerated. We provide suggestive evidence that GEE (and therefore, the new accountability

system) has disproportionally impacted non-incarcerated delinquents without any meaningful e¤ect on

incarcerated juveniles. Put di¤erently, our analyses suggest that the increased graduation standards have

not inuenced those who were incarcerated (the graduation rates of whom were already low), but that

these new standards have reduced the graduation rates of the non-incarcerated. This implies that the

gap in the graduation rates between these two groups has been narrowed and became indistinguishable

from zero after the implementation of GEE.

    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the juvenile justice system in Louisiana, and

Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the empirical methodology and the instrument. Section

5 presents the results, provides robustness analyses and various extensions, including the analysis of high

school completion. Section 6 presents the conclusions and puts our ndings in context of other evidence

on the subject, obtained from other settings.



2    Juvenile Justice System in Louisiana

In Louisiana, youth through age 17 may enter the juvenile justice system when they are accused of

committing a crime and arrested or referred by the police to a juvenile court. Having received a formal

complaint from a local law o¢cer, the District Attorneys (DA) O¢ce must decide whether or not to


                                                     
petition the case to the court. Prosecutors may choose not to do so because of lack of su¢cient evidence.

Alternatively, to prevent incarceration, the DAs O¢ce may choose to enter into an informal agreement

(diversion program) with the juvenile and the parents which occasionally entails a child to participate

in community service, restitution, or treatment and comply with certain behavioral requirements such

as school attendance (Louisiana Childrens Code CHC 631). Finally, prosecutors may proceed with a

petition. When the case moves to adjudication, the disposition must be determined by a judge (Louisiana

Childrens Code CHC 650-675).

       Under the provisions of the Louisiana juvenile justice system, a computer generated random allotment

(open to public) is implemented on a daily basis by the Clerks o¢ce for all rst time case les led in

each district court.3 Therefore, random assignment to judges within each district court is true for rst

time juvenile o¤enders. Repeat o¤enders are reassigned to the judge who handled the initial case.

       Judges may simply dismiss the case if the prosecutor is unable to provide evidence to nd the youth

delinquent. The defendant would then be found not guilty and does not enter into the juvenile justice

system. If the judge nds the defendant guilty, the judge has to make a disposition decision. Disposed

youth is either assigned to the custody of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections to be con ned

in secure placement (incarcerated) or placed in a non-secure facility or on probation. Non-secure facilities

were established for youth that encountered problems at home and have nowhere else to go, and they

generally include foster care, group homes and short and long-term treatment facilities. The judges have

to also assign a disposition length (sentence length) regardless of the disposition type.4 In other words,

each convicted juvenile is assigned a sentence length irrespective of whether they are placed under secure

custody, non-secure custody, or probation. Additional details of the court procedures are provided in

Eren and Mocan (2016).

    Judges are responsible for weighing the severity of the o¤ense committed and the prior o¤ense of the youth. In general,
they shall impose the least restrictive disposition consistent with the circumstances of the case, the health and safety of the
child, and the best interest of the society (Louisiana Childrens Code CHC 683).

3    Data

The data for this study are compiled from three di¤erent sources. The rst one is the Louisiana Depart-

ment of Public Safety and Corrections, Youth Services, O¢ce of Juvenile Justice. By special permission,

we obtained access to the universe of case records from 1996 to 2012 that contain information on juve-

niles who were found guilty. For each case record, we have information on both the juvenile o¤ender and

the case itself. Information on juveniles includes basic demographics (e.g., race, gender, and age). The

case les also contain the exact statute o¤ense committed, the date the juvenile was disposed before the

judge, the judges disposition type (e.g. whether the juvenile was incarcerated), disposition length, and

the court in which the hearing was held.

    Our adult crime data come from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Adult

Services and they cover the period from 1996 to 2012. Similar to juvenile o¤ender les, adult crime

data include basic demographic information, the exact type of crime committed and sentence type (i.e.,

incarceration or probation). Finally, to obtain high school completion status of the juveniles, we utilize

the administrative records from the Louisiana Department of Education over the same period. Using a

unique personal identi er available in all these three data sets, we are able to link individuals records

between data sets.

    Our rst outcome of interest is adult conviction at age 25 or earlier. In order to measure criminal

recidivism without any censoring, we limit our focus to juvenile case les from 1996 to 2004, corresponding

to the cohorts born between 1979 to 1987. Put di¤erently, we focus on the universe of convicted juveniles

who were born between 1979 and 1987, and follow them until each one reaches the age of 25 to observe

their criminal conviction activity as young adults. Later in the paper, we relax the restriction of adult

crime by age 25 and focus on the same cohort of convicted juveniles (who were born between 1979 and

1987) but follow them until the year 2012 to observe their criminal convictions until 2012. In this second

set-up, we analyze the same group of juveniles, but the age in which the adult crime is committed can

be as high as 33.


                                                    
       The case les of juveniles are randomly assigned to judges, except for repeat o¤enders whose cases

are handled by the original judge. Thus, we focus on o¤enders who had only one interaction with the

juvenile justice system. Put di¤erently, to ensure random assignment of case les to judges, we include

only one-time juvenile o¤enders in the e¤ective sample.5 Although it is not a common occurrence,

juveniles may have committed multiple o¤enses. For those cases, we consider the most severe decision

among all convictions as their disposition outcome.6 As detailed below, because we control for court-

by-year xed e¤ects (which is the unit of randomization) we restrict the sample to the dispositions from

those courts that had at least two regular judges in a given year. Finally, we exclude individuals whose

disposition judge has handled fewer than 25 juvenile case les over the entire sample period. Doing so

alleviates concerns pertaining to noise in the construction of judge stringency measure. Having imposed

these restrictions, we end up with a total of 7,396 juvenile case les.

       Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics. The average juvenile incarceration rate, shown in column

(1) is about 25 percent, indicating that roughly one-in-four convicted juveniles serve time in secure

custody. This rate is slightly higher than the national average (21 percent in 2005) among all adjudicated

delinquent cases (Puzzanchera and Sickmund 2008). Black juveniles comprise 65 percent of all juvenile

delinquents; white juveniles make up about one-third of all juvenile convictions, and one-in-four juvenile

delinquent is female. The average age at conviction is 15 years.

       As shown in Panel A of Table 1, property and drug related juvenile o¤enses together make up half of

all juvenile convictions. About 20 percent of juvenile property crime convictions is for burglary o¤enses,

and about 38 percent is for various types of theft. About 41 percent of violent crime juvenile convictions

is for aggravated battery or aggravated assault, and 23 percent is for robbery or armed robbery. Seventy-

eight percent of drug convictions falls under the category of possession, manufacturing, distribution of

drugs and about 18 percent are for possession of marijuana. Other crimes are a heterogeneous group,

   5
      Although all rst time case les are randomly assigned to judges, keeping the initial les for repeat juvenile o¤enders may
still contaminate the e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on adult outcomes. For example, a juvenile who was not incarcerated
for the rst o¤ense may be placed in a secure facility for a subsequent juvenile o¤ense.
    6
      Eight percent of our e¤ective sample has committed multiple juvenile o¤enses.



                                                              
the most common categories of which include: ungovernable (18 percent), simple battery (18 percent),

truancy (15 percent), disturbing the peace (11 percent) and carrying a weapon illegally (4 percent).

    As shown in Panel B of Table 1, about 39 percent juvenile delinquents are convicted as adults by age

25. About 18 percent recidivates with a drug-related crime, 15 percent with a property crime, 7.1 percent

with a violent crime, and 3.5 percent with other crimes.7 Because an individual may have been convicted

for more than one adult crime, the sum of the adult recidivism rates of individual crime categories is

greater than the overall recidivism rate. The age at ( rst-time) adult conviction is about 20.

    We treat an individual as a high school graduate if the public records over the sample period indicate

graduation from high school in Louisiana. About 24 percent of those who are convicted of a crime as a

juvenile in Louisiana have subsequently graduated from high school. This graduation rate is substantially

higher than the 12 percent rate reported for Chicago/Cook County in Aizer and Doyle (2015) who

analyzed the cohorts born between 1971 and 1983.8

    Of the 7,396 juveniles who are convicted of a crime, 1,822 are incarcerated in secure custody. Column

(3) in Panel A of Table 1 shows that incarcerated juveniles are more likely to be black and male. Forty

percent of the incarcerated juveniles are convicted of property crimes. As columns (3) and (5) of Panel B

demonstrate, incarcerated juveniles are more likely to recidivate as an adult in comparison to those who

are placed on probation or placed in non-secure custody. Adult conviction rate is 54.6 percent among

those who are incarcerated as a juvenile, but the rate is 33.3 percent for the non-incarcerated juvenile

delinquents. Finally, high school graduation rate for those who are incarcerated as a juvenile is lower

than those who are convicted but not incarcerated.

    We should note that potential attrition due to migration is unlikely to be an issue in this setting.

Analyzing the American Community Survey data (2003 and 2004), we                            nd that only 4.8 percent of

   7
     This last category (other crimes) includes all other o¤enses, ranging from jury misconduct to criminal trespass, from hit
and run driving to aggravated incest.
   8
     Aizer and Doyle (2015) observe high school graduation status of the youth as long as they stay in the Chicago Public
School System. Thus, any transfers out the school district are coded as non-graduate. Unlike Aizer and Doyle (2015), we can
track individuals as long as they do not move out of the state or transfer to a private school. Among others, state-speci c
dynamics, cohort e¤ects as well as our ability to track individuals over the entire state (as opposed to a school district) may
contribute to uncovering the large discrepancy in the graduation rates in Louisiana and Chicago.


                                                              
individuals born in Louisiana between 1978 and 1987 left the state between the ages of 18 and 25. The

out-migration rate is even lower (2.2 percent) among the same age cohort if we focus on those with an

education of high school or lower.



4         Empirical Methodology

4.1       Baseline Model

To estimate the e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on recidivism, we consider the following model



                                   Yi =   0   +   1 Incarcerationi   + Xi0   2   + ui                      (1)



where Yi is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the individual i, who has been convicted

of a crime as a juvenile, is convicted of a crime as an adult (until the age of 25, or alternatively until the

age of 33). The variable of interest, Incarcerationi , is another indicator variable that takes the value

of one if juvenile had been incarcerated as a result of his/her juvenile conviction. If Incarcerationi is

zero, this indicates that even though the individual was convicted of a crime as a juvenile, he/she was

not incarcerated. Rather he/she had spent time in unsecure custody or was placed on probation. Xi is

a vector of individual and case characteristics, including the gender, race, age of juvenile and detailed

o¤ense type, and ui is the error term.

     Straightforward estimation of equation (1) using OLS will provide an unbiased coe¢cient estimate

of    1   if juvenile incarceration is exogenously determined. Many potential unobserved factors, however,

can inuence both the propensity for conviction of a crime in adulthood and the propensity for youth

incarceration (e.g. income, parental background). Ignoring these factors in the estimation of equation

(1) will likely yield a biased coe¢cient estimate of the impact of juvenile incarceration on recidivism.

     To address the potential endogeneity of juvenile incarceration, we construct a measure of judge strin-

gency, and employ this measure as an instrument for the juveniles propensity for being incarcerated


                                                         
following his/her juvenile conviction (Aizer and Doyle 2015 and Bhuller et al. 2016). More speci cally,

we exploit the fact that juvenile court judges have discretion in sentencing, that they di¤er in their

harshness in assigning punishment to juveniles, and that juvenile defenders are randomly assigned to

judges. Thus, we can investigate the impact of sentence severity of a juvenile on his/her propensity to

commit crime as an adult, using the idiosyncratic proclivity of a judge to incarcerate as an instrument

for juveniles incarceration experience.9

    Finally, standard errors in all estimations reported throughout the paper are clustered at the judge

level. The results remain intact if we instead cluster at the court level.


4.2    Judge Stringency as an Instrument

To create the instrument we use all past and future juvenile case les handled by each judge over the period

from 1996 to 2012. There are 73 judges in our e¤ective sample and the average number of conviction

per judge is 478. Once the juvenile is convicted of the crime, the judge makes a decision regarding the

disposition type. As detailed in the previous section, the disposition type is either incarceration in secure

custody (prison), non-secure custody, or probation.

    For each judge-juvenile pair, we calculate the leave-out mean incarceration rate of the judge as follows

                                                                            0                   1

where JS in Incarcerationj(i) stands for judges stringency in incarceration, calculated for the ith case

handled by the jth judge; nj is the total number of case les handled by judge j. As detailed below, the

validity of judge stringency as an instrument for juvenile incarceration hinges on random assignment of

case les to judges. This crucial assumption calls for controlling the unit of randomization in all rst and

   9
     Under certain assumptions (discussed below), one can interpret any di¤erences in adult conviction for juvenile o¤enders
who are assigned to more or less stringent judges as the causal e¤ect of the change in the probability of juvenile incarceration
associated with judge assignment. This estimated impact reveals the e¤ect of incarceration for those who are incarcerated
of whom the judge assignment induces a change in the incarceration decision, the so-called Local Average Treatment E¤ect
(LATE), and it can potentially be very di¤erent than the impact for the average incarcerated juvenile.



                                                               
second stage equations. Including the court-by-year xed e¤ects allows us to interpret the variation in

the propensity of a randomly assigned judge to incarcerate a juvenile relative to the case les in a given

court and year. The mean of judge stringency in incarceration is 0.21 with a standard deviation of 0.05.

   Figure 1 plots the distribution of (mean-standardized) residualized judge stringency. They are ob-

tained from a regression of judge stringency in incarceration (shown in equation 2) on court-by-year

 xed e¤ects and juvenile controls shown in Table 1. Figure 1 demonstrates non-negligible identifying

variation in the data. For example, moving from the least stringent judge to the most stringent raises

the probability of incarceration by around 29 percentage points. Put di¤erently, consider two juvenile

defendants of the same age, race and gender, and who are convicted of the same crime in the same year

in the same courthouse. The rst juvenile may be up to 29 percentage points more likely to go to prison

(incarcerated) as opposed to be placed on probation or non-secure custody if his/her case is handled by

a more strict judge in comparison to the second juvenile.

   To investigate whether judge stringency in incarceration is a strong predictor of juvenile incarceration

decision we estimate the following rst-stage regression



                     Incarcerationi =  0 +  1 JS in Incarcerationj(i) + Xi0  2 + "ijct              (3)


where Xi includes court-by-yeart xed e¤ects and all other variables are as previously de ned and "ijct

is the error term.

   Table 2 presents the     rst stage results from three speci cations. Column (1) shows that absent

any controls, having been assigned to a judge who is 10 percentage points more likely to incarcerate a

juvenile increases the likelihood of placement into secure custody by about 8 percentage points, with an

F-statistics for the instrument of 19. Including juvenile demographic controls (Column 2) and detailed

o¤ense xed e¤ects (136 detailed o¤ense xed e¤ects) do not alter the estimated impact of judge stringency

in incarceration, indicating that the instrument is strongly related to the endogenous variable.

4.3   Instrument Validity

Although JS in Incarcerationj(i) is a strong predictor of juvenile incarceration, there are three additional

conditions that must be met for us to interpret the coe¢cient estimate from an IV speci cation as the

LATE of juvenile incarceration.


Conditional Independence          The rst assumption is that of independence; i.e. the instrument must

be uncorrelated with the error term in the outcome equation. Under random assignment of juvenile case

 les to judges, this condition is likely to hold. A typical test for this is to run a series of regressions of

juvenile/case characteristics on judge stringency, while controlling for court-by-year xed e¤ects. These

randomization test results are reported in Table 3. Each cell represents a separate regression. The

coe¢cient estimates on judge stringency are very small in all regressions, and with one exception, none

of them is statistically di¤erent from zero. Thus, the evidence presented here coupled with the fact that

the coe¢cient of judge stringency in incarceration in the rst-stage regressions of Table 2 are insensitive

to the inclusion of additional control variables, provides assurance regarding conditional independence

assumption. We also run similar regressions using the incarceration indicator as the outcome of interest

and nd almost all individual and case characteristics to be strong predictors of juvenile incarceration.

These results are available upon request.


Exclusion Restriction In our design, estimating equation (1) using instrumental variables assumes

that the instrument, JS in Incarcerationj(i) , which represents the propensity of a judge to incarcerate the

juvenile defendant, has an impact on an outcome (e.g. recidivism, or high school completion) only through

the incarceration channel. In other words, it is assumed that the stringency of the judge in incarceration

has no direct impact on the outcome, nor does it impact the outcome through some other channel. But,

incarcerated juveniles spend time in prison, and it could be the case that more stringent judges are not

only more likely to incarcerate, but they are also more likely to assign longer prison sentences. If this is

the case, the instrument (JS in Incarcerationj(i) , shown in equation 2), would impact two components


                                                     
related to juveniles punishment: (i) whether or not the juvenile gets incarcerated, and (ii) the length of

time spent in prison, given incarceration. In this case, the exclusion restriction would be invalidated.10

More generally, consider the following speci cation



                     Yi =    0   +   1 Incarcerationi   +    2 T ime         Spent in P rison + Xi0   2   + ui         (4a)



Equation (4a) is the same as in equation (1) with one di¤erence: The outcome of interest Yi , (e.g. adult

recidivism), is assumed to depend not only on individuals incarceration experience as a juvenile, but also

on how long that person was incarcerated (T ime Spent in Pr ison). Put di¤erently, both the extensive

and intensive margins of incarceration experience are assumed to impact the outcome Yi . This formulation

calls for two instruments: one for incarceration, the other for time spent in prison. The detail of our data

allows us to generate these two instruments. As discussed earlier, the instrument for incarceration is the

leave-one-out measure of judge stringency in incarceration depicted by equation (2), which is reproduced

below as equation (4b)

                                                                                 0                   1
                                                                                 nj
                                                                   1              X
                            JS in Incarcerationj(i) =                            @    Incarcerationl A                 (4b)
                                                                nj  1
                                                                                   l6=i



As mentioned in Section 3, each convicted juvenile is assigned a sentence length by the judge regardless

of whether or not he/she gets incarcerated. This means that we can also measure the judges stringency

in sentencing. Analogous to (4b) the leave-one-out measure of judge stringency in sentencing can be

calculated as

                                                                 0                              1
                                                                 nj
                                                       1          X
                    JS in Sentencingj(i) =                       @    Assigned Sentence Lengthl A                      (4c)
                                                    nj  1
                                                                      l6=i



       This formulation suggests that the model in equation (4a) can be estimated with instrumental vari-

  10
    Of course, even when this exclusion restriction were to be violated one can still interpret the estimates from a reduced
form equation as the causal impact of judge stringency on adult recidivism.


                                                                 
ables, where the rst endogenous dummy variable incarceration can be instrumented with the judges

propensity to incarcerate, and the second endogeneous variable, time spent in prison, can be instru-

mented with judges harshness in assigning sentence length. More speci cally, here we have two rst

stage regressions as follows



    Incarcerationi =  0 +  1 JS in Incarcerationj(i) +  2 JS in Sentencingj(i) + Xi0  3 + eijct               (4d)



 T ime Spent in P risoni =     0+   1 JS   in Incarcerationj(i) +   2 JS   in Sentencingj(i) + Xi0   3 + ! ijct   (4e)


   When we estimate the rst stage regression (4e), however, we nd that JS in Sentencingj(i) has no

power in explaining the actual time spent in prison (in hundred days). The estimated coe¢cient                    2   in

equation (4e) is 0.062 with a p-value of 0.17, indicating that judge stringency in sentencing cannot be

used as an instrument to explain the variation in time spent in prison. This is because of two reasons.

First, even though all convicted juveniles are assigned a sentence length by judges, about three-quarters

of all convicted juveniles are not incarcerated (see Table 1). For this group, time spent in prison is zero,

and therefore there is no relationship between assigned sentence length and actual time in prison. The

remaining group serves time in prison, but even in this case, actual time spent in prison is less than the

sentence assigned by the judge for a number of di¤erent reasons such as early release or being placed on

parole.

   Thus, we focus on equations (1)-(3) to identify the impact of incarceration, using judge stringency in

incarceration as an instrument. Of course, the question that needs to be addressed is whether the exclusion

restriction holds in this speci cation. In other words, does the instrument (JS in Incarcerationj(i) ) have

an impact on the outcome Yi through another channel, perhaps through its impact on time served in

prison?

   We show that this is not the case. Consider the regression results reported in Table 4. The rst column

reports the results of the regression obtained from the full sample. The dependent variable is time served


                                                       
in prison. The average time in prison is 88 days because the sample consists of all convicted juveniles,

including those who are not incarcerated, for whom time served in prison is zero. The coe¢cient of judge

stringency in incarceration is positive and signi cant, but this is misleading because this relationship is

driven by the decision of judges on the incarceration margin. Column 2 presents the same regression for

those who are incarcerated. Here the coe¢cient of judges propensity to incarcerate has no impact on

actual time served in prison for those who went to prison. To make this point more clearly, the regression

in column (3) of Table 4 uses the entire sample and explains time spent in prison by both the judges

incarceration propensity and whether or not the person was incarcerated as a juvenile. The results show

that having been incarcerated as a juvenile increases time in prison by 343 days (in the sample of 7,396

individuals, 75 percent of whom have not been incarcerated), but that judge stringency in incarceration

has no direct impact on time in prison (the coe¢cient is 0.899 with and standard error of 1.05).

    This means that the length of time the juvenile stayed in prison is not impacted by the extent of

the harshness of the relevant judges incarceration propensity. Put di¤erently, the instrument does not

inuence the outcome through its impact on time spent in prison.

    Another plausible test for the validity of the exclusion restriction condition comes from exploring

the association between judge stringency and the decision to plead guilty. Juvenile defendants can plea

bargain with the district attorney and they can choose to plead guilty to the charges before going in front

of the judge to get adjudicated. In the data we can identify those who plead guilty.11 This allows us to

analyze whether judge stringency has an impact on the extent to which a juvenile takes a plea bargain

with the district attorney. We ran equation (3) by using as the dependent variable a dummy to indicate

if the juvenile accepted the charge before going to the adjudication hearing. The estimated coe¢cient of

JS in Incarceration is 0.177 (se=0.132), indicating the harshness of the judge in his/her incarceration

  11
     Before the adjudication hearing where the judge make decision on guilt-vs-innocence, a petition hearing takes place. At
this petition hearing the district attorney charges the juvenile with a crime. If the defendant pleads not guilty, the case goes
to the trials, which takes place at a later date. In this case, the date of the adjudication hearing is later than the date of
the petition hearing. If, on the other hand, the petition and adjudication dates are the same, this means that the judge has
not made a guilty/not guilty decision; instead, the juvenile has pleaded guilty or no contest to the charge led.

propensity has no impact on the juveniles likelihood to plea bargain.


Monotonicity Finally, in order to treat our point estimates as LATE from IV regressions, monotonicity

has to be assumed. This assumption requires individuals who are incarcerated by a strict judge would also

be incarcerated by a more lenient judge, and those who are not incarcerated by a strict judge wouldnt

be incarcerated by a lenient judge either. An easily testable implication of monotonicity is that the point

estimates from the rst-stage regression (equation 3) must be non-negative for all subsamples. Panel A of

Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix provides several rst stage results by juvenile and case characteristics.

The estimated coe¢cients of judge stringency are positive and signi cant for all subgroups.

    Another testable implication of monotonicity is that judges who are more strict for one group (e.g.

felony crimes) should also be strict for another group (e.g. misdemeanors). To check this, we follow

Bhuller et al. (2016) and de ne the instrument for each subsample to be the mean incarceration rate

of the judge from case les outside of the subsample. Once again, under monotonicity, one expects the

 rst stage result for each subsample using this reverse sample instrument to be positive. As presented in

Panel B of Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix, this is indeed the case. We also relax the monotonicity

assumption by recalculating the judge stringency (i.e., the leave-out mean incarceration rate of the judge)

by o¤ense severity (e.g., felony vs. non-felony). As shown in the Robustness Section, the results remain

intact.



5     Results

5.1       Baseline Results

We rst present the results, obtained by estimating equation (1) using OLS. The estimates, shown in Table

5, are based on two di¤erent speci cations. Column (1) provides OLS estimates of the impact of juvenile

incarceration controlling for court-by-year xed e¤ects and juvenile characteristics. Column (2) adds

detailed juvenile o¤ense xed e¤ects. The point estimate in column (2) indicates a statistically signi cant


                                                    
12 percentage point increase in adult recidivism for those who were incarcerated as juveniles. Panels (B)

through (D) report the same e¤ect by type of adult crime, and reveal no signi cant heterogeneity.12

The coe¢cient estimates are positive and signi cantly di¤erent for drug o¤enses, for violent crimes, as

well as for property crimes. These results, however, are likely to be biased as there are several potential

unobserved factors a¤ecting both adult conviction and youth incarceration.

    To address potential endogeneity of youth incarceration, we estimate the same models within the

framework of equations (1) and (2); instrumenting youth incarceration with JS in Incarceration. The

results are radically di¤erent from those obtained from OLS. The results in Panel A of Table 6 show that

the impact of juvenile incarceration on adult crime is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.

    Speci cally, columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 show if the person was convicted of a crime and was

incarcerated as a juvenile (due to having faced a tough judge) he/she is only one percentage point more

likely to get convicted of a crime as an adult (in comparison to a juvenile who was also convicted but

not incarcerated). This small e¤ect, however, is not statistically di¤erent from zero. Thus, the IV results

in Panel (A) of Table 6 reveal that juvenile incarceration has no statistically signi cant impact on adult

crime when the dependent variable does not make a distinction between crime types.

    Panels B, C and D of Table 6 reveal that this null-e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on adult crime

emerges because juvenile incarceration has di¤erential e¤ects on di¤erent types of adult crime. For

example, columns (1) and (2) of Panel B report the results of the IV regressions where the dependent

variable is conviction of a drug crime as an adult. Juvenile incarceration increases the probability of

adult conviction of a drug o¤ense by 27 percentage points. Panel C shows that juvenile incarceration has

no impact on the probability of conviction for a violent crime as an adult. On the other hand, as shown

in Panel D, juvenile incarceration reduces the propensity for recidivism in adulthood in case of property

crimes.

  12
     We do not analyze crimes that are not classi ed as a drug crime, property crime, or violent crime. These residual
crimes constitute a small fraction of all adult crime in the data (3.5 percent of all adult convictions). As noted, they are a
highly heterogeneous group, including crimes ranging from jury misconduct to criminal trespass, from hit and run driving
to aggravated incest.



                                                             
   In summary, juvenile incarceration, triggered by exposure to a harsher juvenile judge, has a deterrent

e¤ect on adult property crime commission, it has a positive impact on committing a drug o¤ense as

an adult, and has no e¤ect on adult violent crime. Consistent with the strong rst-stage relationship

reported in Table 2, the reduced-form regressions reported in the last column of Table 6 show that the

stringency in incarceration of the juvenile court judge has a signi cant negative impact on adult property

crime, and a positive e¤ect on adult drug crime. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority

of adult drug crimes are related to drug use, rather than drug selling. This is because about 95 percent

of all adult drug convictions receive a suspended sentence or probation, as opposed to incarceration.


5.2   Robustness Checks

We undertake several sensitivity checks to examine the robustness of our results. First, we rede ne our

outcome of interest to take the value of one if an individual was convicted of a crime as adult by any

age, instead of 25 or earlier. Doing so does not alter the results (Column 1, Table 7). Second, recall that

we limit our e¤ective sample to include juvenile o¤enders whose judge had handled at least 25 case les

over the period from 1996 to 2012. Relaxing this restriction and including judges with at least 15 case

 les has little impact on our results (Column 2). Similarly, further restricting the sample to judges who

handled 250 or more case les does not alter the point estimates appreciably (Column 3 of Table 7).

   In calculating the instrument (JS in Incarceration) we use all past and future dispositions from 1996

to 2012. In column (4) of Table 7, we recalculate the leave-out mean incarceration rate of judges using the

case les which only appear in our juvenile sample period (1996-2004). The estimated e¤ects on juvenile

incarceration remain intact. Finally, we also construct the measure of judge stringency that is allowed

to di¤er by juvenile o¤ense severity (e.g., felony vs. non-felony). Our ndings from this exercise (column

5) are very similar to those reported throughout the paper, providing assurance about the monotonicity

assumption. Alternatively, when we try a measure of judge stringency which varies by juvenile o¤ense

type (violent crime, property crime or drug crime) we obtain estimates that are similar in magnitude to



                                                    
those reported earlier.


5.3   Extensions and Potential Mechanisms

We investigated whether the type of crime committed as a juvenile and having been incarcerated for

that crime as juvenile exert a di¤erential impact on adult recidivism in the same crime category. The

results from this exercise are displayed in Table 8. The instrumental variables estimate in column (1)

show that, consistent with the results of Table 6, juvenile incarceration has a positive impact on adult

conviction of a drug o¤ense, but having been convicted of a drug charge as a juvenile has no impact on

the propensity of conviction of a drug crime in adulthood. Column (2) of Table 8 similarly shows that

juvenile incarceration has no impact on adult recidivism in case of violent crimes, and that having been

convicted of a violent crime as a juvenile has no impact either. Column (3) reveals the same picture with a

slight twist: Consistent with the results in Table 6, we nd that juvenile incarceration experience reduces

the propensity to commit a property crime as an adult. However, we also nd that if the individual

had a criminal experience as a juvenile for a property crime, the impact of incarceration is smaller (-

0.467+0.138), although the net e¤ect of incarceration is negative and still statistically di¤erent from zero

with a p-value of 0.00.

   We also analyzed the extent to which incarceration as a juvenile has any di¤erential e¤ect on adult

recidivism by race and by age at youth conviction. We report the results in Appendix Table A3. Odd

numbered columns in Appendix Table A3 present the results based on race, while even numbered columns

report the results based on age. There is some weak evidence for di¤erential e¤ects by race for violent

crime (Column 3) and by age at conviction for property crime (Column 6). However, the estimated e¤ects

of youth incarceration overall do not appear to reveal any signi cant degree of heterogeneity.

   It can be argued that the deterrence e¤ect reported for property crime (see Table 6) may be due to

incapacitation. Juveniles who spend time in a secure detention facility will have fewer opportunities to




                                                     
recidivate after they are released if they have served time in detention beyond the age of 18.13 There

are, however, only 62 individuals involved in adult property crime whose release date is set at age 19 or

above. Dropping these observations had no impact on the results.

       We also estimated the models using the intensive margin of di¤erent crimes as outcomes. That is, we

de ned the outcome as the number of crimes committed rather than whether or not the person is convicted

of a crime. The same picture has emerged. When the outcome is the number all crimes committed as an

adult, the impact of juvenile incarceration is not di¤erent from zero (-0.099, se=0.265). The same result

is obtained when the outcome is the number of violent crimes committed (-0.051. se=0.118). Consistent

with previous results obtained on the extensive margin, when the outcome is the number of property

crimes, the impact of juvenile incarceration is -0.504 (se=0.121), indicating that having been incarcerated

as a juvenile (as opposed to having been found guilty, but not going to prison) reduces the intensity of

the property crime activity as an adult. Consistent with previous results, juvenile incarceration increases

the number of drug o¤enses in adulthood (0.370, se=0.158).14

       Recall the discussion in Section 4.3, where we have shown that time served in prison is not related to

judge stringency in incarceration, holding constant incarceration. At the same time, there is variation in

time served among those who are incarcerated. To investigate whether the impact of juvenile incarceration

on recidivism is di¤erent between those who spent more vs. less time in detention, we re-estimated the

models by creating a sample of juveniles by excluding those who have served longer than 209 days (which

is the median time served, conditional on incarceration), and another sample that excludes those who

stayed in prison shorter than 209 days.

       Columns (1) and (2) in Panel (C) of Table 9 show that the impact of being incarcerated as a juvenile

reduces the propensity to recidivate for property crime as an adult, but that this deterrent e¤ect is not

     Judges can set a maximum duration of disposition up to the youths 18th birthday. The maximum duration can extend
up to 21st birthday if the juvenile o¤ense involves heinous crimes such as murder and rape (Louisiana Childrens Code CHC
686-897.1).
  14
     The sample mean of the number of property crimes with which individuals are charged as an adult is 0.15 (min=0,
max=6).
  The sample mean of the number of drug crimes with which individuals are charged as an adult is 0.19 (min=0, max=6).

signi cantly di¤erent between those who stayed in prison shorter or longer than the median time. In

other words, time spent in prison does not inuence the magnitude of the deterrent e¤ect of incarceration

in case of property crimes.

   Panel B shows that, consistent with the previous results, adult violent crime is not impacted by

juvenile incarceration, regardless of the duration of incarceration. Panel A of Table 9 indicates that

juvenile incarceration has no statistically signi cant impact on adult drug conviction if time spent in

incarceration as a juvenile is shorter than the median (column 1). On the other hand, column (2) of

Panel A reveals that incarceration as a juvenile increases the propensity for conviction of a drug crime as

an adult if time spent in incarceration as a juvenile is longer than 209 days. Note also that the estimated

e¤ect is considerably larger than that obtained in column (1).

   This could be because of three possible reasons. First, longer duration in incarceration increases

exposure to other convicted juveniles and this negative peer e¤ect might be the driver for adult drug

conviction. This explanation is unlikely because peer e¤ects explanation would be equally applicable in

case of violent and property crimes, but we observe no di¤erential e¤ects of prison duration in case of

these adult crimes. Second, negative selection could be the reason: those who end up staying longer in

prison, conditional in incarceration, could be di¤erent from those who spend less time in prison. The

unobservable, likely pre-existing, attributes of these long-stayers might be responsible for their higher

recidivism rates. This explanation, while plausible, is also inconsistent with the other results reported in

Table 9, because under this scenario one would observe di¤erential recidivism rates between those who

spend less and more time in prison in other crime categories as well, but this is not the case. Relatedly,

note also that all speci cations in Table 9 control for detailed juvenile o¤ense types (136 o¤ense xed

e¤ects). A third explanation is that longer time spent in incarceration might induce additional stress on

juveniles and might impact their emotional well-being, making them more susceptible to drug use. As

mentioned earlier, 95 percent of all drug convictions receive either a suspended sentence or probation,

which indicates that the overwhelming majority of drug conviction are related to drug use, rather than



                                                     
drug selling. This suggests that longer jail time would make the juveniles more likely to use drugs upon

leaving prison.


5.4   Incarceration and High School Completion

The impact of imprisonment on human capital accumulation and future labor market outcomes is not

well-understood. For example, Landersø (2015) used register data from Denmark and found that longer

incarceration spells generated lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, possibly due to rehabili-

tation. This nding is echoed by Bhuller et al (2016) using data from Norway. Similarly, Kling (2006)

reported a small positive impact of incarceration on employment in the U.S. Aizer and Doyle (2015), on

the other hand, reported that juvenile incarceration has a negative e¤ect on high school completion in

Chicago/Cook County.

   Because we can link the juvenile o¤enders with the public high school records in the state, we can

investigate the impact of incarceration as a juvenile on the probability of completing high school. That is,

we replace our outcome of interest in equation (1) with an indicator for high school graduation and re-run

OLS and IV regressions. The results from this exercise are reported in Table 10. The OLS regressions

indicate about a 5 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of high school graduation following juvenile

incarceration (Panel A). However, when we estimate the same model with instrument variables as before,

we nd that juvenile incarceration has no impact on high school graduation (columns 1-2 of Panel B, Table

10). This result is di¤erent from Aizer and Doyle (2015). In an attempt to reconcile these conicting

results, we partition the data as birth cohorts from (i) 1979 to 1982, and (ii) 1983 to 1987. The former

group partially overlaps with the birth cohorts used by Aizer and Doyle (2015).

   Column (3) of Table 10 presents the IV speci cation which allows the impact of juvenile incarceration

to di¤er between these two cohorts. The estimated e¤ect of juvenile incarceration for earlier birth cohorts

indicates a statistically signi cant 15 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of high school gradua-

tion, while the point estimate for more recent cohorts is positive but insigni cant. We also experiment



                                                     
the same analysis by (i) dropping GED recipients from the e¤ective sample (around 20 percent of all

high school graduates) and (ii) rede ning early cohorts to include years from 1979 to 1983. Doing so

does not alter the results. For example, the estimated e¤ect for earlier cohorts indicates a 12 percentage

point reduction in the likelihood of standard high school diploma when we exclude GED recipients. The

obvious question is: what could be the source of this di¤erential e¤ect?

       The Louisiana School and District Accountability system was adopted by the states Board of Ele-

mentary and Secondary Education in June 1998. The state identi ed 10- and 20-year goals for all public

schools and required schools to demonstrate progress toward these goals, which included targets in test

scores, increases in attendance and reduction in the dropout rates. As part of the new accountability

system, rst-time tenth grade students were required to take graduation exit exams (GEE) in English,

math, science and social studies to be eligible for a standard high school diploma.15 This new test-based

promotion policy became e¤ective in the 2000-2001 academic year. Students failing to achieve the mini-

mum requirements in all portions of the standardized tests even after multiple attempts were not able to

obtain a diploma. The high school experience of more recent cohorts of juveniles in Louisiana coincide

with this policy adoption, which suggests that the new accountability system may have led to di¤erential

e¤ects across birth cohorts.

       To further explore this hypothesis, we plot high school graduation trends over birth cohorts disaggre-

gated by juvenile incarceration status in Figure 2. The horizontal axis identi es the birth cohort. High

school graduation rates of incarcerated juveniles, represented by the solid line, remained rather steady

across birth cohorts. This may not be surprising because of a potential oor e¤ect, i.e., high school

graduation rates of incarcerated juveniles are consistently low (around 20 percent), and therefore they

are not responsive to variation in the policy environment. There is, however, a clear decreasing trend

among non-incarcerated individuals after the cohort of 1982 in both Panels A and B. (the birth cohorts

of 1983 and 1984 are likely to be the rst cohorts that are impacted by the adoption of the test-based

  15
    More precisely, GEE English and math were administered in grade 10. Science and social studies were administered in
grade 11 (GEE Interpretive Guide, Louisiana Department of Education-various years).

promotion policy in high school). The introduction of GEE made it more di¢cult to obtain a high school

degree, and as shown in Figure 2, this may have led to a decline in the high school graduation rates

of those juveniles who were delinquent, but who were not incarcerated. Put di¤erently, the exit exams

introduced by the education reform may have induced some non-incarcerated juveniles to drop out of high

school, but it had no impact on already-low graduation rate of incarcerated juveniles. As a robustness

check, we re-estimated the model in column (3) of Table 10 by re-de ning Early Cohort. Speci cally,

when we de ne the Early Cohort as those born in 1981 or earlier, or as those born in 1980 or earlier

the estimated coe¢cient of the interaction term is small, and not di¤erent from zero.16 This nding is

consistent with the time-series behavior of the graduation rates presented in Figure 2, and it supports

the hypothesis that the education reform in Louisiana, that increased the high school graduation stan-

dards, eliminated the di¤erential graduation rates between incarcerated and non-incarcerated juveniles

by reducing the graduation rates of the non-incarcerated. Our proposed explanation is also consistent

with a number of existing studies that nd adverse e¤ects of high school exit exams on graduation rates,

in particular for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (Dee and Jacob 2007).



6         Conclusion and Discussion

This paper investigates the extent to which juvenile incarceration experience has an impact on adult

crime and high school completion. While standard models of criminal activity predict that severity of

punishment is a deterrent to crime (Becker 1968, Ehrlich 1973), it is also the case that incarceration

experience can enhance criminal human capital, while depreciating legal human capital, and thus making

it more attractive to participate in crime in the future (Mocan et al. 2005). The issue is particularly

important for juveniles who are in formative years of their human capitalboth legal and illegal.

         Existing research, based on credible designs, have provided mixed evidence on the impact of juvenile

    16
    When we estimate the e¤ects of juvenile incarceration on adult recidivism by birth cohorts, the results are qualitatively
similar to those presented in the text.

punishment on criminal recidivism. Exploiting random assignment of cases to judges and using judge

stringency in punishment as an instrument, Bhuller et al. (2016) found that imprisonment discouraged

future criminal activity in Norway. They reported that this e¤ect was due to participation in programs

aimed at improving employability. In other words, the e¤ect was reported to be driven by time spent

in prison with a focus on rehabilitation. The applicability of this nding in another setting, such as the

U.S., where emphasis on rehabilitation is not as intensive as it is in Norway, is uncertain. In fact, Aizer

and Doyle (2015) employ the same identi cation strategy and analyze data from Chicago/Cook County,

and report the opposite result that juvenile incarceration generates a drop in high school completion and

an increase in adult recidivism. The city of Chicago/Cook County, is of course radically di¤erent from

the average city in Norway, as well as from many other settings in the U.S. in a number of dimensions

ranging from the urbanization rate to the crime rate, to the conditions of prisons.

   In this paper we focus on a di¤erent setting: The American South. We use the universe of case les

of juveniles who were found guilty by juvenile courts between 1996 to 2012 in Louisiana. Each case le

contains information on the attributes of the juvenile o¤ender and the details of the case, including the

exact statute o¤ense committed, the date the juvenile was disposed before the judge and the court in

which the hearing was held. Importantly, the case les contain information not only on the disposition

type of the juvenile (whether the juvenile was incarcerated, put on probation or placed in non-secure

custody), but also the sentence length assigned by the judge, as well as the actual time served in prison.

   We link these individuals to the records of adult crime data from the Louisiana Department of Public

Safety and Corrections that contain information on their adult convictions as well as the basic demo-

graphic information, the exact type of crime committed and sentence type (e.g., incarceration or pro-

bation). We also link these records to the administrative records from the Louisiana Department of

Education to determine whether the juvenile has completed high school.

   We exploit the institutional structure that randomly assigns juvenile case les to judges and we create

an instrument for having been sentenced to prison based on the idiosyncratic harshness of the judge



                                                    
in his/her incarceration proclivity. While OLS regressions demonstrate a positive impact of juvenile

incarceration on future crime, instrumental variables regressions reveal a di¤erent picture. We nd that

incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on future violent crime, but that it lowers the propensity to

commit a property crime in the future.

   On the other hand, incarceration as a juvenile increases the propensity of conviction for a drug o¤ense

in adulthood. This e¤ect appears to be mainly driven by time spent in prison as a juvenile. That is, we

fail to nd any statistically signi cant impact of juvenile incarceration on adult drug o¤enses if time spent

in prison is less than the median time (209 days), but that longer incarceration signi cantly increases the

propensity for adult drug conviction.

   We show that the overwhelming majority of adult drug convictions are arguably related to drug

use rather than drug sales or tra¢cking because they receive probation, instead of prison time. Thus,

although we have no direct evidence on drug use, this latter nding is consistent with the conjecture that

longer time spent in prison as a juvenile may lead to adult drug use because of emotional stress endured

in long prison stays. We also show that these results are not due to incapacitation (inability to commit

crime because of being in prison), nor is it plausible to attribute them to peer e¤ects in prison or to

negative selection.

   We nd that incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on high school completion propensity, except

for the younger cohorts. This may be tied to an education reform, implemented in Louisiana in 1996,

which made it di¢cult to graduate from high school. As part of the new system, students have to pass

competency exams in core subject to graduate from high school. We nd that for older cohorts, going

to prison as a juvenile reduced the probability of high school completion. On the other hand, among the

younger cohorts, there is no e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on high school graduation. The reform may

have eliminated the advantage of not going to prison for the convicted juveniles.

   In summary, our results obtained from a state in the American South fall in between those obtained

from a Scandinavian country (Norway) and a major metropolitan American city (Chicago/Cook County).
