                                           ABSTRACT

This paper proposes an econometric model to identify unobserved consumer types in the credit market.
Consumers choose different amounts of loan because of differences in their time or risk preferences
(types). Thus, the unconditional probability of default is modeled using a mixture density combining
a type-conditioning default variable with a type-determining random variable. The model is estimated
using individual-level consumer credit card information. The parameter estimates and statistical tests
support this kind of specification. Furthermore, the model produces better out-of-sample predictions
on the probability of default than traditional models; hence, it provides evidence of the existence of
types in the consumer credit market.

1. Introduction

       Several economic theories have long suggested the existence of different yet
unobserved types of individuals. In this line of research, theorists focus on mechanisms that
may be useful in distinguishing these types. For example, in the classical signaling game of
the job market (Spence 1973), there are multiple types of workers, some of which are more
productive than others. Since the types can not be observed, each worker’s level of
education is used as a signal to reveal his/her productivity. However, few empirical studies
have either documented the existence of the unobserved types among individuals and/or the
economic significance of identifying these types. To our knowledge, this is the first paper
that provides an econometric method directly derived from a theoretical equilibrium model
to empirically identify the unobserved individual types. Moreover, it shows that identifying
the types results in significant economic benefits.
       This paper presents two main contributions. First, the paper extends Milde and
Riley’s (1988) model of the consumer loan market, by assuming that consumers have
different, unobserved types characterizing their time discount rates (or their risk preference).
At equilibrium, consumers with different types will borrow different amounts of loans. As a
result, the probability of default is a function of the parameter that characterizes the types
(for example, time preference or risk aversion parameter). In other words, the unconditional
probability of default is a function of the types, and it can be written as the sum of the
conditional probabilities corresponding to each type. Therefore, ignoring the types would
lead to biased estimates of the marginal effect of observed characteristics. Accordingly, this
paper proposes a mixture density econometric model that can be used to estimate
simultaneously the distribution of the types and the conditional probabilities of default.
       Second, this paper estimates the empirical model using individual-level consumer
credit information. We find that there are unobserved types in the population, and that
having types in the model produces better out-of-sample predictions of the default
probabilities. Hence, this paper shows that this econometric model, that takes into account
the existence of unobserved types, improves upon traditional credit scoring models.
       Using mixture densities to empirically model unobserved types is not new in the
literature. For instance, Stahl and Wilson (1994) assume that individuals can be classified
into different rational archetypes. Some choose strategies randomly, while others can figure


                                               2
out the best responses predicted by rational models. Stahl and Wilson (1994) use a mixture
density model on a set of experimental data, and find evidence supporting the existence the
types. On a distinct field, Feinstein (1990) proposes and estimates a mixture density model
that considers simultaneously the unobserved violations and the observed detections of
violations of laws and regulations. Helland (1998) applies Feinsten’s method in studying
the effect of pollution control laws. More recently, Knittel and Stango (2003) estimate a
mixture density model using state-mandated price ceilings as focal points for unobserved
tacit collusions of credit card companies.
       The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 derives an equilibrium
model of consumer credit cards with unobserved consumer types, and proposes an
econometric method to identify the types. Section 3 applies the econometric model to
individual-level data of a consumer credit market, and empirically tests the significance of
the types previously defined. It also briefly discusses the application of this model to credit
scoring, and shows how this model improves upon models that are only driven by statistical
predictability. Section 4 concludes.


2. An Equilibrium Model of Consumer Credit Markets


       This theoretical model is based on the work of Jaffee and Russell (1976), and of
Milde and Riley (1988). These papers focus on type identification by characterizing the
theoretical conditions for the existence of separating equilibrium credit bundles.
Nonetheless, in this research we intend to describe the economic effects on consumer credit
of the existence of different types in the population, and how these effects motivate an
empirical approach to test the significance of these types.
       In this model, there are two sets of participating agents: the applicants/borrowers
and the issuer banks. We are interested in the potentially different types of borrowers in a
population, as their distinct behavior leads to possibly diverse equilibrium actions. So we
define Θ as the set of possible types of borrowers. Here it is assumed that there are two
different types, so Θ ={θ1, θ2}. The borrower applies for a credit card. In his application, he
discloses personal information (sex, age, income, number of children, credit history, etc),
that potentially reveals his type, and may be useful in determining the probability of



                                               3
default. The bank receives the application, and determines the appropriate combination of
interest rate and loan amount for the borrower in order to maximize its profit. Bierman and
Hausman (1970) indicate that accurate estimations of the probability of default lead to an
effective credit policy, in the sense that the amount of credit granted will not constrain sales
and gains, nor it will allow increased losses due to uncollectible accounts. Thus, the
probability of default is a critical variable for maximizing the bank’s profit. It is important
to notice that in a credit card the loan amount really is a credit limit. The actual amount
loaned may be lower than this limit. It depends on the preferences of the borrower. While
the bank does not know to which type a particular borrower belongs, it may know that there
is some probability that the borrower belongs to type θ1. From the economic theory about
signals (see Spence, 1974), this probability is a function of the information revealed by the
borrower.


A. Indifference Curves for the Borrowers


         Following the setup of Milde and Riley (1988), we formulate a simple two-period
consumption model to characterize the behavior of the borrowers. Let the intertemporal
utility function U(c1, c2) be expressed as
                           U (c1 , c 2 ) = V (c1 ) + α θ c 2                                      (1)

         In this model V (⋅) is assumed to be a concave function. Now, a first difference with
Milde and Riley’s (1988) setup is the inclusion of time preference parameter αθ. For this
analysis, we assume 2 that there are two types of borrowers depending on their
intertemporal preference for consumption: those who give the same weight to future
consumption as present consumption, that is α θ1 is normalized to be 1, and those who prefer

present consumption, that is 0 ≤ α θ 2 < 1 . This assumption can easily be relaxed to admit the

existence of a continuum of types defined by 0 ≤ α θ ≤ 1 . Loosely speaking, one can say that
there is a “responsible” type of borrower in the sense the he gives relatively more weight to

2
  Actually this specification is robust to whatever characteristics the different types have; as long as those
traits lead to different preference maps for each type. In the Appendix we solve for the case where the types
represent different degrees of risk aversion. Since differences in both time and risk preferences can generate
similar predictions, our empirical model cannot be used to distinguish the factors that define the unobserved
types.


                                                           4
the future consumption, and an “irresponsible” type of borrower in the sense that he put
relatively more weight to the present, without worrying too much about the future.
       The budget constraint is expressed in terms of consumption in the two periods. The
borrower uses amount L of his credit limit in the first period, hence his first-period
consumption is c1 = y1 + L. Loan L must be repaid in the second period, so the second-
period consumption is defined as
                                  c2 = max [ y 2 − (1 + r ) L, 0] ,                  (2)
where the minimum consumption level for survival (or guaranteed by some law) is
normalized to zero. The second-period income y2 is random, but we do not make Milde and
Riley’s (1988) assumption that individuals differ in their expected second period income;
hence, they define the types of borrowers as those with a high expected income, and those
with a low expected income. In this research we assume that the randomness of second
period income comes from exogenous shocks to the borrower, and thus it is independent of
the borrower’s type, αθ.
       Let D be a random variable describing whether a borrower defaults or not. D = 1 if
the borrower defaults; otherwise, D = 0. From equation (2), D = 1 if c2 = 0 or
                       D = 1 if y2 – (1+r) L ≤ 0.                                    (3)
        With this setup, for a given value of the utility function, say U(c1,c2) = U, one can
use the implicit function theorem to determine the shape of the indifference curves in a
given space. In this research we are interested in the space spawned by the loan amount L
and the interest rate, expressed in terms of R=1+r. We restate equation (1) introducing the
budget constraint:
               U (c1 , c2 ) = U ( y1 + L, max[ y2 − RL,0] )
                                                  ∞
                                                                                           (4)
                           = V ( y1 + L ) + α θ   ∫ (y   2   − RL )dF ( y 2 )
                                                  RL

       Borrowers maximize this utility function to determine the optimal amount of loan L
they demand. For a given interest rate R, the first order condition (FOC) for utility
maximization is:
                                     (            )              (
                                  V ' y1 + L*θ s = αθ R 1 − F RL*θ s ,(         ))   (5)

where L*θ s is the optimal loan for a given interest rate R.



                                                             5
       To obtain the indifference curves in the space of L and R, we fix the value of the
utility in (4). Applying the implicit function theorem to (4), we have:
                 [V ' ( y1 + L ) − αθ R(1 − F (RL ))]dL = αθ L(1 − F (RL ))dR            (6)
        Rewriting (6), we have
                          dR V ' ( y1 + L ) − α θ R (1 − F (RL ))
                             =                                                           (7)
                          dL          α θ L(1 − F (RL ))
        The numerator is the FOC of utility maximization of (4) for a given interest rate R.
When L = L*θ s , the numerator of (7) is zero, we have that dR/dL=0, which means that the

indifference curves’ slope has a turning point at L = L*θ s . To determine the sign of the slope

for L ≠ L*θ s , let’s consider the second derivative with respect to L:

        dR 2 V '' ( y1 + L ) − α θ R 2 f (RL ) dR α θ [1 − F (RL ) − RLf (RL )]
            =                                 −    ⋅                                     (8)
        dL2          α θ L(1 − F (RL ))         dL      α θ L(1 − F (RL ))

        As stated before, dR/dL=0 if and only if L = L*θ s . This implies that at point L*θ s ,

d2R/dL2<0 which means that the indifference curve is at a maximum. Then, the concavity
of V(·) allows one to conclude that
        (a) For L > L*θ s , V ' ( y1 + L ) < α θ R (1 − F (RL )) ⇒ dR / dL < 0 ; and,

        (b) For L < L*θ s , V ' ( y1 + L ) > α θ R (1 − F (RL )) ⇒ dR / dL > 0 .

        To evaluate the effect of αθ we differentiate dR/dL with respect to αθ:
                           d 2R       V ' ( y1 + L )
                                 =− 2                 < 0.
                          dLdα θ   α θ L(1 − F (RL ))
        Both the numerator and the denominator are strictly positive for any L. Then, a
higher value of αθ implies a lower marginal willingness to accept increments in the interest
rate. This means that the marginal willingness to accept an increase in the interest rate is
greater for type θ2 individuals, with higher preference for present consumption (lower αθ),
than for type θ1 individuals. Graphically this relationship is showed in Figure 1.


B. Iso-Profit Curve of the Bank and Market Equilibria




                                                     6
         Now, we turn our attention to the bank. Define i as a rate that captures the economic
cost of lending (including opportunity costs). Since there is the possibility of default, the
bank actually maximizes its expected profit. From equation (3), for a given level of R and L,
the probability of default is F(RL). The expected profit function is
                  E(π) = Pr(D = 0) RL – (1+i) L
                        = (1- F(RL)) RL – (1+i)L                                                   (9)
         In a competitive market setup, the expected economic profit is bound to be zero.
Thus, we derive the iso-profit curve for E(π) = 0. Similarly to the borrower’s indifference
curves, the iso-profit curve is characterized by 3

                           dR (1 + i ) − R + R ⎡⎣ F ( RL ) + RLf ( RL) ⎤⎦
                              =
                           dL       L ⎡⎣1 − F ( RL ) − RLf ( RL ) ⎤⎦
                                                                                                   (10)
                                             R 2 f ( RL )
                                =
                                    ⎡⎣1 − F ( RL ) − RLf ( RL ) ⎤⎦

         The second equality is obtained by applying E(π) = 0 to the numerator, which is
strictly positive. Now, it is easy to see that the numerator is strictly positive, so the sign of
(10) depends only on the sign of the denominator; which in turn depends on the difference
between the probability of payment, 1-F(RL), and RLf(RL). Thus, the sign of the
denominator depends on the characteristics of F(·), the distribution of second period income.
If F(·) is an unimodal distribution, then dR/dL will be positive and increasing up to a
turning point, RL , where dR / dL = ∞ . After this point, dR/dL will be negative, and the iso-
profit curve turns back to the left. With this characterization of the behavior of both
borrowers and banks, one can analyze the equilibrium in the consumer credit market via
credit cards.
         Figure 2 presents the equilibrium analysis for credit card loans. The bank defines a
credit limit LCL 4 , and offers a continuum menu of loan amounts, such that LS ∈ [0, LCL ] . The
borrower uses the supplied credit up to point where one of his indifference curves is tangent
to the zero iso-profit curve. As showed above, the shape of the indifference curves is
affected by the type of the individual. Therefore, type θ2 individuals, with a higher

3
  This result comes directly from applying the implicit function theorem to equation (9).
4
  The credit limit is defined by the total amount of funds available to loan, capital requirements and other
regulations.


                                                            7
preference for present consumption (lower αθ), have a higher equilibrium loan and interest
rate than type θ1 individuals. It is important to notice that for each type the other’s
equilibrium bundle lies in a lower utility indifference curve. In other words, neither type
has an incentive to switch to the other’s equilibrium bundle. Hence, we recover Milde and
Riley (1988)’s result that one can identify the type of the individual after he chooses the
amount of credit he wants to use. For two otherwise identical individuals, the one that uses
the highest amount of credit belongs to type θ2. The equilibrium loan amount for type θs,
denoted as Lθe s , is typically different from the optimal amount of loan L*θ s in (5), since L*θ s is

obtained for a given interest rate R, while Lθe s is obtained that allowing R to be changeable.

        Now, suppose that there is some legislation that fixes the interest rate, or that the
bank does not charge differential interest rates based on the loan amount. The constant rate
R has to be greater than 1+i, otherwise the bank will not participate in the market. As
showed in Figure 3, the same conclusions as in the unregulated case apply. The only
difference is that the equilibrium amounts of loan will be the optimal amounts of loan that
maximize the borrower’s utility given R for each type.


C. Equilibrium Default Rates and the Empirical Model


        In this setup, the probability of default depends on the type of each individual. We
let αθ be a random variable with a Bernoulli distribution such that Pr(αθ=θ1) = p and
Pr(αθ=θ2) = 1-p. When αθ =θs, the conditional probability of default is given by
                                             (                  )      (        )
                Pr (D = 1 | α θ = θ s ) = Pr y 2 − Rθes Lθe s ≤ 0 = F Rθes Lθe s ,       (11)

        Under the case illustrated in Figure 2, both Lθe s and Rθes will be functions of the time

discount rate αθ (i.e. the type of a person), first period income y1, and second period income
equation (2) through the cumulative distribution function F(·). In the case of a constant
interest rate R, as illustrated in Figure 3, the optimal loan amount Lθe s still is a function of

αθ, y1, and F(·). Let X be a random vector of the observable characteristics of individuals
that may affect probability of default. A simple way to approximate Rθes Lθe s is




                                                     8
                                            (        )
Rθes Lθe s ≈ α s y1 + Xβ s . Therefore, F Rθes Lθe s ≈ F (α s y1 + X β s ) and the unconditional

probability of default can be written as:
     Pr (D = 1) = Pr (D = 1, αθ = θ1 ) + Pr (D = 1, αθ = θ 2 )
                    = Pr (D = 1 | αθ = θ1 ) Pr (αθ = θ1 ) + Pr (D = 1 | αθ = θ 2 ) Pr (αθ = θ 2 )
                                                                                                    (12)
                    = pF (Rθe1 Leθ1 | αθ = θ1 ) + (1 − p )F (Rθe2 Leθ2 | αθ = θ 2 )
                    = pF (α1 y1 + Xβ1 ) + (1 − p )F (α 2 y1 + Xβ 2 ).
        Similarly,
                 Pr (D = 0) = p(1 − F (α 1 y1 + Xβ1 )) + (1 − p )(1 − F (α 2 y1 + Xβ 2 )) .
        Empirically, we can let Pr(αθ = θ1 ) = p be a function of a set of individual

characteristics Zi, i.e., Pr(αθ = θ1 ) = G ( Z iγ ) . The likelihood function of the model is:
                n
          L = ∑ Di ln[G (Z iγ )F (α1 y1 + X i β1 ) + (1 − G (Z iγ ))F (α 2 y1 + X i β 2 )] +
               i =1                                                                                  (13)
             (1 − Di ) ln[1 − G (Z iγ )F (α1 y1 + X i β1 ) − (1 − G (Z iγ ))F (α 2 y + X i β 2 )]
        Since the model in (13) incorporates the unobserved types into the model, we refer
this model as the type-consistent model.
        Feinstein (1990) discusses the identification issues related to this type of models. He
argues that these models are basically identified via the functional form. Especially, if the
same continuous variables appear in both Z and X, the coefficients β and γ may not be
identifiable. To avoid this problem, we include in Z only socio-demographic variables, such
as gender, age, and marital status; while X only includes economic variables such as income,
measures of wealth, and credit history. This distinction follows from signaling theory as
personal characteristics may reveal the individual’s type. Nevertheless, it is somewhat
arbitrary which variables should be included in Z or X. In the next section, we estimate the
model using individual-level credit information.

    A. The Data
        This research uses the information of all main cardholders of a major credit card
issuer bank from Ecuador as of February 2006. This data set comprises information of the



                                                          9
age of the debt (number of days in default), the demographic characteristics of each
individual, some economic variables, and the credit worthiness of each individual.
       One cannot simply use the fact that if an individual is late in his payment to classify
each person into two groups: default or not default. Being late in payment may simply
indicate that the card holder has forgotten to pay. Thus, it is necessary to define how many
days of not payment signify that the cardholder has opted to default. Ecuadorian law states
that if a consumer credit account is in arrays for 90 or more days, then full provisions must
be made and legal collection action must be taken. Therefore, if an individual is in default
for 90 days or more, it is a clear sign that he has chosen to default. For this study, clients
that not default will be those who are not in default, or those who are in default for less than
90 days (92.5% of the sample). Clients in default will be those in default for 90 or more
days (7.5% of the sample).
       The data set was randomly partitioned into a design sample (60% of the
observations) used to estimate the model, and a test sample (40% of the observations) for
further analysis. Both samples maintain the population proportions of default and not
default actions. For the estimation of the model, Zi will comprise variables that represent
only individual socio-demographic characteristics. Xi will include income, variables proxy
for the wealth of each individual, a set of indicator variables that represent if the
individual’s residence is in one of the nine largest cities of Ecuador, and credit worthiness
indicators in the form of ratings provided by “Superintendecia de Bancos”, the government
agency that oversees the operations of financial institutions in Ecuador. A description of
these variables is provided in table 1.
       The data for estimating default probabilities should come from a random sample of
all historic applicants (accepted and rejected). However, it is often only possible to identify
defaults and not defaults in the clients who were accepted. Therefore, usually there is a bias
in the data generating process for these models that reflects the procedures used to
accept/reject applicants. The estimators will echo this bias, and it is not possible to
determine its direction (Capon, 1982). In this case we have that this particular bank has a
very lenient applicant acceptance procedure. It basically relies on confirmation of the
information presented in the application form (especially the reported income), and on
requesting a guarantor for those cases where the assigned credit officer believes there is a



                                               10
risk. If the guarantor does not qualify, then it asks for another guarantor. Thus, for this bank
the rejection rate is negligible, and any bias in the data set will be minimal.


      B. Specification Test and the Estimation Results
           For identification reason, we let Z be different from X. More specifically, Z is not a
subset of X, nor is X is a subset of Z. Therefore, the type-consistent model does not nest the
logit model. A specification test of the two models requires a non-nested procedure.
Consider the following likelihood function:
                    Lnon −nested = aLlog it + (1 − a )Ltype −consistent ,                (14)

where the likelihood Llogit represents the standard likelihood function of a logit model, and
the likelihood Ltype-consistent is given in equation (13). The nesting parameter, a ∈ [0,1] , tests
which model is correct. If a = 0, then the type-consistent model is supported; when a =1,
the logit model is supported. To estimate the type-consistent model, we approximate G(·)
and F(·) in the likelihood function (13) with a logistic 5 CDF. Our estimation of (14) finds
that a = 0.0001 with a large standard error. Therefore, this non-nested test supports the
type-consistent model stated in equation (13). From table 2, the likelihood for the logit
model is -4028.95 while the likelihood for the type-consistent model is -3644.29. Given the
results of the non-nested test, it is not surprising to see that the type-consistent model has a
much higher likelihood value than the logit model.
           On average, the probability of default conditional on αθ = θ1 (6.5%) is lower than
the probability of default conditional on αθ = θ2 (12.63%). These results are consistent with
the hypothesis that one of the types is more “responsible” than the other. Consider first the
coefficients for the probability of type θ1. Of all the socio-demographic variables included
in Z to describe this probability, only age is statistically significant. Additionally, there is
evidence that age has a quadratic effect over the type probability. This result indicates that
older people have a higher probability of belonging to type θ1, but this effect decreases as
age increases. Looking back to the theoretical characterization of the types, in the context
of either the time preference or the risk aversion definitions of the types, this result implies
that older people tend to belong more to the “responsible” type than younger people. In
addition, it is worthwhile to note that neither gender nor marital status is statistically

    We also estimated the model using a normal CDF and recovered the main results.

significant to determine the type of an individual. Unfortunately, the data available does not
include information regarding the level of education of the cardholder. Signaling theory
argues that a person’s education could carry important signal about his type in a series of
economic setups. It would have been interesting to test education’s signaling power in the
credit market.
           In terms of the conditional probabilities of default, it is important to notice that
parameter estimates are different for each type of consumers. For example, for the
parameter that Times rated C past 3 months, the coefficient for type θ2 consumer is 17.19
(5.61) while the coefficient for type θ1 consumer is only 0.217 (.107) 6 . It is also true that
some parameters are statistically significant for one type of consumers but not for the other
type. Another important observation is that the parameter estimates from the simple logit
model are different from both type θ1 and type θ2 coefficients. Therefore, this result
indicates that different types of consumers do behave differently, as predicted by the
theoretical model.
           In terms of marginal effects, we present two examples to illustrate the differences
between the two models. In the first example, we consider an increase of 10 years for a
person at age 20, while everything else is taken at their respective sample mean. For the
type-consistent model, the probability that the person belongs to type θ1 increases by 0.034
and the overall probability of default decreases by 0.00130. However, this change based on
logit model causes the default probability to increase by 0.000888. In the second example,
we consider an increase in 1 in the number of times a person is rated E in the past three
months, while taking everything else at their mean. For the type-consistent model, the
probability of default increases by 0.1573. For the logit model, the probability of default
increases by 0.0823. In both examples, the two models produce significantly different
marginal effects.
           In the next section, we will show that modeling types in the probability of default
yields better out-of-sample predictions of the probability of default.


C. An Application to Credit Scoring

       In a more mundane field, the model described and estimated in the previous sections
provides the theoretical structure for a credit scoring model. Typically, credit card scoring
models are derived only from statistical considerations; with the sole objective of achieving
greater levels of predictability of the probability of default. Our model provides an
economic structure that considers the estimation of the probability of default within an
equilibrium setup and unobserved consumer types. As it will be showed, this allows us to
define a credit scoring system that improves on traditional techniques. Thus, we verify the
existence of types in the credit market in the sense that a model that includes types in its
specification produces better out-of-sample predictions of the probability of default.
       Even though credit scoring systems are commonly employed by banks and retail
companies, one can not find in the published literature much investigation on the subject,
especially on specific estimation techniques. Hand and Henley (1997) argue that this is a
consequence of the confidentiality lenders maintain on their data and procedures due to
security issues and the competitive advantage given by more accurate estimation
techniques. The estimation of the probability of default relies on techniques such as
discriminant analysis, linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, expert systems,
neural networks, and dynamic programming. Hand and Henley (1997), Rosenberg and
Gleit (1994), and Reichert, Cho and Wagner (1983) give a succinct description of these
techniques. Wiginton (1980) presents one of the first uses of the logistic regression in credit
scoring. His results show that the logit model predictability dominates the linear
discriminant results. In the nonparametric field, Hand and Henley (1996) derive a k-
nearest neighbor estimator for estimating the probability of default. In addition, Zhu, Beling
and Overstreet (2001) build on the notion of second order stochastic dominance to
determine the conditions where combining two credit scores leads to a better model in the
sense that it estimates probabilities of default more accurately than its components.
       We use the logit model for the probability of default to contrast the out of sample
performance of the type-consistent model. Logit models are commonly used in the credit
industry, so they are a well known benchmark. Several simple statistics and the Lorenz
curve will be used to compare the models. Of course, any validation of the predictive power
of the model must be assessed out of sample, so in what follows we use the test sample.




                                              13
(1) Model Accuracy
       Table 2 reports the within sample pseudo R2 for the type-consistent model and the
logit model. The pseudo-R2 = 0.8047 for the type-consistent model, higher than the pseudo-
R2 = 0.7841 for the logit model. Since we have more than 60,000 observations in the
estimation sample, the (degrees of freedom) adjusted pseudo-R2 changes little: the type
consistent model still has a higher pseudo-R2 than the logit model. However, for the within-
sample average default probabilities, the logit model (0.075119) is closer to the observed
default probability (0.075120) than the type-consistent model (0.07506).
       In table 3, we calculate out-of-sample statistics for the mean of the probabilities of
default, pseudo-R2, adjusted pseudo-R2, and the mean squared prediction errors for both
models. The type-consistent model produces a mean default probability closer to the
observed sample mean, a higher pseudo-R2, a higher adjusted pseudo-R2, and a lower mean
squared prediction error than the logit model. Therefore, there is evidence that a model that
includes types in its specification produces better out-of-sample predictions of the
probability of default.


(2) Lorenz Curves
       Before further comparing the models, it is necessary to establish how the probability
of default will be computed using the type–consistent model. In practice the bank can use
the computed unconditional probability of default, or either the conditional probability of
default for type θ1 and the conditional probability of default for type θ2, depending on each
individual’s probability of being of type θ1. Thus, different mixtures for estimating the
probability of default can be employed. For a credit card issuer, it is important to minimize
the number of “default” (“bad” clients) classified by the model as “not default” (“good”
clients), as issuers tend to not reject those applicants with high probabilities of default, but
to reduce their credit limit. Taking into account this fact, this research compares two
different alternatives with the results of the logit model:
       (i) A “naïve” approach that only uses the unconditional probability of default from
           the type-consistent model such that:
            Pr (Di = 1) = G (Z i γ )F (α 1 y1i + X i β1 ) + (1 − G (Z i γ ))F (α 2 y1i + X i β 2 )




                                                       14
        (ii) A “risk averse” approach based on the distribution of the estimated probability
            of type θ1 for each individual, to minimize the number of “bad” clients
            classified by the model as “good”.
              ⎧ F (α1 y1i + X i β1 )                                                 if pi > 0.86
              ⎪
Pr (Di = 1) = ⎨G (Z iγ )F (α1 y1i + X i β1 ) + (1 − G (Z iγ ))F (α 2 y1i + X i β 2 ) if 0.8340 < pi ≤ 0.8618
              ⎪ F (α y + X β )                                                       if pi ≤ 0.8340
              ⎩     2 1i       i 2


        The bounds are the upper quantile and the mean of the distribution of the estimated
probability of type θ1 at a 95% confidence level.
        Typically, the performance of a credit score model is to evaluate the number of
“bad” clients the model rates as “good” (Type II error) and the number of “good” clients
the model rates as “bad” (Type I error), for a specific probability of default cut off value.
This value should be determined to maximize profit, or relative to a particular approval
policy if any exists. In the absence of these criteria, one can calculate the proportion of
“good” and “bad” clients accepted by the model for a series of probability of default cut off
values. Then one can plot the proportion of “good” clients rejected and the proportion of
“bad” clients accepted against the cut off values forming Lorenz curves (see Figure 4 and
Figure 5). The perfect model would the lower and right axes for both “good” and “bad”
applicants. The area between the curves and the axes is used as a measure of the model’s
discriminatory power (Hand and Henley, 1997).
        As stated before, for the credit card industry, the main interest is to identify the
“bad” clients in the application process. Extending this idea, this is so because the amount
of credit extended and the interest rate can be defined to take into account the level of risk
of each individual (see Section 2). Therefore, in practice a “bad” applicant will not be
rejected (unless his or her risk level is really high), but will receive a lower credit limit. For
“good” applicants identified as “bad” this poses a minor inconvenience, since is common to
periodically adjust (increase) the credit limit granted according to consumption and
payment behavior. Thus, this research will focus on comparing the performance of the type
model versus the logit model regarding the identification of “bad” applicants. The relevant
Lorenz curves for the three cases are in Figure 4.
        The “risk averse” approach yields a smaller proportion of “bad” clients accepted
than the logit or the “naïve” approach for practically the entire range of probability of



                                                    15
default cut off values. This means that the bank will do better using the “risk averse”
approach for any acceptance rule. Also, the “naïve” model outperforms the logit for cut off
values lower then 0.25. This means that if the banks automatically accepts all clients with a
probability of default of 0.25 or lower, it will do better using the “naïve” model than the
logit. These results indicate that the type-consistent model identifies more accurately the
“bad” from the “good”. This is a consequence of identifying the type of each client in a
probabilistic sense.
        For the “good” clients (Figure 5), obviously the performance of the “risk averse”
approach is lower than both the logit model and the “naïve” approach, since this approach
was designed to detect the “bad” clients without considering the effect on the “good” ones.
However, its acceptance rate of “good” clients is over 90% for practically the whole range.
On the other hand, the “naïve” approach (which is neutral between “good” and “bad”)
performs better than the logit model for cut off values of 0.26 and larger. This indicates that
we could find a mixture similar to the “risk averse” approach, only that it would minimize
rejection of “good” clients”. All this indicates that a model that includes types in its
specification produces better out-of-sample predictions, and in this sense confirms the
existence of types in the population.


4. Conclusions
       This paper builds up an equilibrium model of consumer credit markets. The model
has two types of consumers, one with a higher time discount rate than the other. Although
the types are unobserved, different types of consumers will choose different equilibrium
amount of loan. As a result, the probability of default depends on the type of each
individual. Subsequently, the paper derives an econometric model for the probability of
default that incorporates the unobserved types. Hence, the choice of defaulting, viewed as a
random variable, has a mixture density.
       The paper then applies the model to the consumer credit market to test the existence
of two types of applicants: those individuals who are naturally inclined to fulfill their credit
obligations (the “responsible” type), and those individuals who are naturally inclined to
default (the “irresponsible” type). We find that including types in the model for the
probability of default leads to better out of sample predictions. In this sense, the paper tests



                                               16
and confirms the existence of types in the population. An interesting result is that older
people have a higher chance of belonging to the “responsible” type than younger, while
gender statistically has no effect in determining the type of a person. This indicates that
responsibility is not part of the genetic code, but is a consequence of the experiences a
person has in his life. Unfortunately, the data available does not include variables that carry
information about a person’s experiences (for example, education, type of work, travels to
foreign countries, etc.). It would be interesting to analyze which factors lead to higher
levels of responsibility for a series of economic setups.


Appendix


Unobserved Types in Terms of Risk Aversion
         Now we assume that there are two types of borrowers: those high risk aversion and
those with low risk aversion. To introduce risk aversion in the model, we explicitly define
V(·) as a power utility function with constant relative risk aversion coefficient αθ.
         In this context type θ1 individuals have a higher coefficient αθ than type θ2
individuals. The two-period utility function is restated as:

       dR/dL = 0 if and only if L = L*θs . This implies that at point L*θ s , d2R/dL2 < 0, which

means that the indifference curve is at a maximum. Then, the concavity of V(·) allows one
to conclude that:
       (a) For L > L*θ s : ( y1 + L )              < α θ RA−αθ (1 − F (RL )) ⇒ dR / dL < 0 ; and,
                                            −αθ



       (b) For L < L*θ s : ( y1 + L )             > αθ RA−αθ (1 − F (RL )) ⇒ dR / dL > 0 .
                                            −αθ



       To evaluate the effect of αθ, we take the second derivative with respect to αθ:
                                                                ⎛ A ⎞
                                             ( y1 + L )−α   θ
                                                             ln⎜⎜        ⎟⎟
                                                                ⎝ y1 + L ⎠

                         dLdα θ                   β LA −αθ [1 − F (RL )]

       Recall that A =    ∫ (y
                          RL
                                   2   − RL )dF ( y 2 ) , which means that it is the expected second

period consumption. Thus, there are three scenarios:
       •   E(c2) < y1 + L = c1, in this case, d2R/dLdαθ < 0 so type θ1 individuals, with a
           higher coefficient αθ, have a lower marginal willingness to accept increases in R
           than type θ2 individuals. This implies the same results as developed in Section 2.
       •    E(c2) > y1 + L = c1, in this case d2R/dLdαθ > 0, thus type θ1 individuals, with a
           higher coefficient αθ, have a higher marginal willingness to accept increases in R
           than type θ2 individuals. This implies that still one can find differences in the


                                                                18
           preference map between the two types, but in this case type θ1 individuals will
           have a higher equilibrium loan amount.
       •     E(c2) = y1 + L = c1, in this case the expected second period consumption is the
           same as the first period consumption. Now, d2R/dLdαθ = 0 and the existence of
           different types has no effect on the preference maps. Thus, the results in Section
           2 would not hold.
       In conclusion, as long as expected second period consumption is different from the
first period consumption, the existence of types, defined in terms or different degrees of
risk aversion, will differentiate the preference map of type θ1 individuals from the
preference map of type θ2 individuals. In turn, these differences will lead to different
equilibrium loan amounts and different probability of default for each type.
