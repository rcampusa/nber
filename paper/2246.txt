                     Implicit Taxation in Lottery Finance




                                   ABSTRACT




     State lotteries as they are operated in the United State today involve
four distinct aspects: legalization of lottery games, monopolistic provision
by the state, marketing of lottery products, and extraction of a portion of
the surplus they derive fran sales for state revenue. In this paper we use
conventional tools of applied public finance to examine the implicit tax
levied by lottery agencies through this fourth function. We examine the
incidence of the implicit lottery tax, focusing on the daninant lottery games
used in the 1980s. We find that the implicit tax is regressive in virtually
all cases. We then consider whether the implicit tax rate on lotteries is too
high, ccmparing that rate to excise tax rates on alcohol and tobacco.

      State lotteries have been the fastest—growing source of revenue to state
governments in the U.S. since 1970. They are also the most            type of
                                                                 lucrative

state-owned enterprise in the 22 states that currently operate lotteries. Net
revenues fran these   lotteries amounted  to $30 per capita in 1985. Since this
rixxiey was transferred to state treasuries to support other activities of these


governments, it is appropriate to call this transfer an "inlicit tax" on the
operation of the lotteries. Previous studies have examined the incidence of
this implicit tax and dnonstrated that it was regressive during the 1970s.1
Because the product line has changed dramatically during the last decade as
the agencies have sought to broaden the appeal of their games, it is useful to
take arxther look at the distributional patterns of lottery sales. In
addition,   the conceptual basis for conclusions reached in the earlier

literature needs clarification. In particular, how can the lotteries be

labelled "regressive" if   the    primary effect of the creation of a state lottery

is   to enhance consiner welfare?
    In this paper we distinguish among four separate aspects of government-
operated lotteries: legalization, monopolistic provision, marketing, and
revenue   extraction, or taxation. In doing so, we restrict ourselves to the

revenue side of the budget and ignore the expenditure side. We then      analyze

the taxation aspect of current lotteries as operated in the U.S. and Canada.

Section I of the paper describes the develoriTlent of contemporary state

lotteries. Section II discusses the four aspects of lotteries. Section III

examines the implicit tax incidence of state lotteries using new data from

several states. In addition to conventional measures of incidence, we focus

on the   variation in tax within income classes.     Section IV examines       the rate
of taxation implicit     in U.S. state lotteries and compares it to tax rates on

several     heavily—taxed ccmodities. These tax    rates   are   discussed   in relation
to the      theory of optimal taxation of commodities. Section V concludes the

paper.

I.   Background
       In    1964 New Hampshire introduced the first merican       government-operated

lottery      in the 20th century. Since then lotteries have grown to become

fixtures in state government finance     in half the states, arid      over 60 percent

of   the U.S. population now   lives in a lottery state. In November          1986 five
states voted to establish new state lotteries. The spread of lotteries in the
U.S. since the introduction of New Hampshire' s game has been nothing short of
breathtaking.      t only have total sales increased as more states have adopted
lotteries,      per capita sales have grown as well. Measured in 1985 dollars, per
capita      sales in lottery states have increased from $23 in 1975 to an average
of $88 in 1985 or 14 percent a year. Table 1 lists the currently operating

1znerican lotteries    by age. The first great   wave of   lottery adoptions occurred
between 1971 arid 1974, then 10 northeastern states, comprising 28 percent            of

the nation's population, began operations. The nation now appears to be               in

themidst of a second wave, with five states having begun operations since
1985 and another five now set to begin in 1987 as a result of referenda in
1986.


                                          2
       In the   jurisdictions   operating lotteries    in 1985, sales per      capita ranged
from a low of      $10 in Vermont, to a high of $175 in Washington, D.C. As a

rough correction for the opportunity to sell tickets to nonresidents, we

calculated an adjusted per capita figure by incltxiing in the denominator the

population of mon-lottery        states on each operating       state's   borders.2 By this
measure, Massachusetts has the highest level of per capita sales, at $173,

although this is an imperfect measure as well since a state such as

Massachusetts sti 11 has    out-of—state      sales despite being     ringed   with lottery

states.3    Hover, using this      rough adjustment, aggregate per capita sales in

lottery    states was $82 in 1985.
       Table    1 also gives information on the proportion of sales returned as

prizes, used     for operating   expenses, and kept as net revenues for the state.

The proportion of sales not returned as prizes, called the takeout rate,

varies narrowly around 50 percent in U.S. state lotteries, although it is

lower in some foreign lotteries. Due              to the   evident economies of scale in

lottery operations and variations        in   prize payout ratios, the profitability

per   dollar varies considerably.4 In         1985 net     revenue varied from 28 percent
of sales in New Hampshire and Maine to 47 percent in New York.
     Ptcpanying the rapid growth in aggregate and per capita lottery sales
has been a transformation in the product mix offered by lotteries. In the
early years of modern lotteries, the mainstay of the product line was a draw
game operated like a raffle with periodic, usually weekly, drawings. Next
came "instant" games, requiring players only to scratch off a plastic covering
to reveal — instantly —— whether the ticket is a winning one. In the mid—
1970s lotteries entered the computer age with a numbers game, based on the




                                              3
illegal version popular in many areas, featuring daily drawings and the

opportunity   for players   to choose   their   own nunters.

     Figure 1 illustrates the change in product mix brought about with the

introduction of these successive types of games, using aggregate data for

three   states that began   operations in 1972:       ODnnectiCUt, Massachusetts, and

Pennsylvania.     Weekly draw games      quickly lost their prominence to instant

games and, to a greater extent, to daily numbers gaines. By 1981 numbers
accounted for three-fourths of total sales in these states. But perhaps the
most dramatic change of all has been the emergence of a fourth type of game,
lotto, in which players attempt to pick the six winning nunbers that are to be
drawn fran a larger set (anywhere between 36          to 49). The odds of winning are
mini scule allowing extremely large jackpots for exact matches. In sane cases
these jackpots have exceeded $10 million. In a period of four years, lotto
jumped from    less than 1 percent of total sales in these states             to over 40

percent in 1985.    Significantly, the growth        in lotto   does not   appear   to have
come at the expense of numbers gaines; nor has the growth of numbers
appreciably diminished the size of instant game sales.

             their rapid growth in real terms, lotteries still account for
        Despite
only a nall portion of revenues in states that have them. Ible 2 canpares
 lottery revenues to several other sources of state own—source revenues in 1984
for 18 lottery states. In those states, revenues fran lotteries averaged 2.7
percent of total own—source revenues. In only t states, Pennsylvania and
 Maryland,    did lotteries account for         more than 4   percent of the total. But
fnen viewed in ccxnparison to excise taxes, lottery revenues look sanefnat more
substantial. For example, lotteries raised abDut the same amount of revenue
 as state alcohol and tobacco taxes ccthbined.5


                                                4
       The imxDrtance   of lotteries for state governments cannot be grasped by
looking   only at the revenue they raise, however. Not only are lotteries a

source of revenue, they are also a prcxuct marketed and sold directly by state
government.  In fact, in states where they operate, lotteries constitute one
of    the biggest and most prominent goods or services provided directly to

citizens and   widely   identified   as   a product   of   state government. Certainly

lotteries are one of the most imjxrtant products that is both advertised and
sold. ble 3 provides sane indication of this significance by canparing per
capita direct expenditures by category with three itans that are sold directly
to households. Probably the most important product that state governments
sell    directly to the general public is higher education, and states are

closely identified with    this product. After higher education,          one could argue

that lotteries are the second most important product provided to the general
public. If states' legalization, provision and advertising of lottery

products have any effects on the          attitudes and behavior of citizens, then,

such effects may be substantial.


II.   Four Elnents of Lottery Finance
    Because the purchase of tickets is entirely voluntary, lottery propDnents
sometimes argue that it is inappropriate to apply conventional concepts of
taxation,    such as regressivity or "tax burden," to lotteries. By this

arg1nent,   lotteries constitute     a "painless tax"      and should   not be canpared to

excise   or incane taxes6. The   apparent confusion here may result fran the fact

that the lotteries are in every case state—owned enterprises which are

operated for "profit," with    the   state treasuries being the residual claiitants.

This is an unusual organizational form for the United States and Canada,

although conunon in the rest of the world. The lottery states are in the



                                              5
business of selling a product at a price considerably above average cost for
the primary purxse of financing other goverrinent activities. iot only is it
appropriate to label the resulting net revenue an implicit tax, it is

interesting     to note    that   this   implicit tax   is   closely analogous to a corporate

tax   on net   inccitie,   but with a tax    rate of 100     percent.
       In order to clarify these and other issues related to the normative

evaluation of lotteries, it is useful to identify four distinct aspects of

lottery  finance as currently practiced in the United States: legalization,
provision, taxation, and promotion.

     Legalization.
                    Lotteries were outlawed in all states fron the late 19th
century until New Hampshire's adoption in 1964. While lottery games such as
the   ntirbers game certainly were played before              the advent of the rrcxlern state-
run versions, the state did not sanction them and often was vigorous in trying

to discourage them. The act of legalizing lottery gaines then is a first and

jnportant      aspect                                                as legal
                        of lotteries as currently established. As similar

and illegal numbers games may seem, for example, the fact that the state-run

game is legal and officially sanctioned does make it qualitatively a different
product. Al lowing lotteries to be provided legally confers consumer surplus.
If consumers are well—informed and there are no important external costs, this
increase    in consumer      surplus is a clear benefit of current lottery finance.
       Provision. A        second aspect of lotteries is provision. In all lotteries

in the u.s. and in most lotteries elsewhere, the government has made itself

the exclusive legal provider. If there were no economies of scale in the

provision of lottery products, this monopolization itself would have no

 necessary normative implication. To the extent that economies of scale do

 exist, ionopoly offers the potential of a lor average cost and consequently

 larger surplus to         consumers or the state.

                                                  6
       Taxation. Once a decision has been made to legalize the lottery and

operate   it as a state—owned monopoly enterprise, there remains a number of
operational decisions concerning product line and pricing. The appropriate
definition of     "price" in this context is a bit ambiguous; one reasonable

definition is "the cost of buying a probability distribution of prizes that

has expected value of       one dollar."   A closely related measure that is sintpler

for our purposes, is the takeout rate, the fraction of the total bet

retained by the state. (The takeout rate is identically equal to (p.-l )/p,

where p is the price defined as above.) Gianges in the price have we 1 fare
significance, both in terms of aggrate consumer surplus arid in terms of

incidence of the implicit tax.
     Prcztoti.on. The fourth aspect of lottery finance as currently practiced
is prantion.     State lottery agencies have adopted sophisticated marketing

strategies to sell their products, including imaginative advertising that

emphasizes such themes as the chance of winning big prizes, the fun of

playing, and the benefit the state derives fran lottery          revenues. We do not
deal   with   this aspect   in the current paper.7

Implications for Normative Analysis

       The welfare    implications of        these aspects can be illustrated by

considering an    individual's canpensated demand curve for a lottery product,
such as that shown on the right side of Figure 2. Quantity is measured in
dollar units,     and price is stated in terms of takeout rate T. It       is assumed
that   the individual is well-informed and that there are no externalities in

consizption.  the left hand side, a hypothetical market demand curve (D) is
shn along with an average cost curve (AC) reflecting administrative costs as
a percent of sales, which are assumed to fall with sales. At rate T1 total

                                              7
revenue to the state is T1 i! and the statet s net revenue is (TiTa)Qi This
amount can also be thought of roughly as the "monopoly profits" accruing to
the state by virtue of its self-granted monopoly over the provision of legal
lottery products.8
    In the context Of this conventional framework, two implications are
evident. First, the legalization and provision of lottery products create
consumer surplus, even when the takeout rate exeeds the average cost of
administration. Fbr the individual shown in Figure 2, this is area abc. By
this reasoning lotteries are welfare—erthancing.9 The second implication of
the analysis, however, is that this welfare gain due to the lottery's
introduction would be greater if the takeout rate were lower. If the lottery

were to produce at the minimum breakeven takeout rate (T2), the consumer
surplus would be as large as the triangle aef, although that would leave the
state with no revenue and is therefore a highly unlikely alternative.
     The intensity of the controversy that surrounds lotteries suggests,
however, that any evaluation based on danand curves and conventional applied

welfare concepts may be seriously incanpiete. Lottery critics question two
asszptions made in      theconventional normative analysis: that individuals are
best able to judge     what is good for then and that there are no externalities
in consumption or       production. It is a familiar caveat in welfare

econanics    that consumer    surplus loses its usual significance in the case of

"children   and madmen" and where consumers are seriously misinformed about
the   good being consurned)° In the case of lotteries, individuals often

have only the most rudimentary notion of the odds of winning or the amount

taken out for state revenue. Th.rthernore, it may be true that lotteries

increase    the   prevalence of canpulsive gambling. These concerns call into

question    the appropriateness of using observed danand   to measure the   benefit

                                           8
of consuming lottery products, especially given the use of advertising to
stimulate play.
       The presence of externalities may also complicate the simple analysis
outlined    above. The operation of the             lottery itself, most especially the

advertising,   creates externalities, although arguably of a mild variety.
Signs, caiTnercials, and publicity make it evident to all that the state is in
the    lottery business.       the extent that provision and praTtion of lotteries

have harmful effects on attitudes toward work or illegal gambling, for

example, such external costs would need to be taken into account.                           If

lotteries reduce     rather   than   increase   illegal   gathbling,   at least some   of   the

externalities   would be     fositive. This consideration of externalities is quite

apart from the view that lotteries are a "merit bad" for those who object to

gambling on noral grounds.

       To what extent these considerations outweigh the conclusion of
conventional    applied welfare economics is          uncertain.   Wflat is   clear is that

they   must be assigned considerable im!xrtance in            order to reverse the clear

implications   of the conventional analysis. Unless there are strong reasons to
believe that people are participating in lotteries against their own interests
or that lottery operation creates strong externalities, lowering the takeout
rate would increase net welfare. If, on the other hand, lotteries are seen as
a social evil — as they sean to have been in every state and province before
1964 ——   then a higher rate may be justified as           a sumptuary tax. A surnptuary

tax p1icy is difficult to square with the practice of advertising lotteries
as desirable consumer products, hver.

III. Implicit Tax Incidence
       As in many   other   applications in public finance, there is great interest



                                                9
in the distributional effects of the lottery as a fiscal device. It might
seem reasonable      in this context to ask, "What is the incidence of lottery

finance?"   The distinctions made in the previous section must be kept in
mind in answering this question. Lottery creation and taxation together

produce net welfare gains (assuming full information and no
externalities),      so the incidence   of lotteries as a whole   is the story

of   the distribution of these benefits. But once      it is decided to

legalize    and   provide lotteries are made,    it seems rrore appropriate to
concentrateon the incidence of the implicit tax alone. At this point the
relevant policy variable is the percentage of revenues kept by the state,
not   the existence of the lottery itself. We therefore focus in this section

on the incidence of the implicit tax on lottery purchases.

      Any household's contribution to revenues, corresponding to the quantity

(TiTa)Q1 in Figure 2, is     proportional to its expenditures on
lottery    products. In terms of average        rate progression, implicit lottery
taxation   would be proportional if expenditures     as a percentage of incane were
constant over the      income scale. It would be regressive if the proportion

falls    as incane increases.    Nt only does this conventional characterization

of tax    incidence describe the distribution of the total implicit tax

burden of lotteries, it also indicates the distributional impact of marginal

changes   in the takeout rate. The reduction in consumer surplus caused by       a

one   percent increase in the takeout rate, for example, will be exactly
proportional to a household' s expenditures on lottery products. Such
incremental incidence is central to the policy question of fnether takeout
rates ought to be reduced. If the incidence of the implicit tax is regressive,
reducing the takeout rate will benefit the poor xrore than proportionately


                                          10
with respect to inccme. In this section we examine available information on
lottery expenditures by incane in order to determine incremental incidence by
intxxne class. We then turn to variations in expenditures within inccxne
classes.

A. Average Expenditures by IncatLe Class
       Tables 4 through 8 present information on average household expenditures
on lottery products by income class. The first two              tables   are based on

previously published data. Using information           fran three northeastern   states

at   a time en weekly draw games were the predatiinant lottery product, Table 4
shows absolute expenditures peaking in the $10,000 to $15,000 income class.
Table   5 suntnarizes a survey taken about     the same time and   again indicates the
lost average expenditures at the highest and lowest inccxne levels. BDth of
these tables imply that expenditures on weekly lottery games fall as a
percentage of income as one goes up the income scale. The only previously

published    analysis   focusing on lottery products other than weekly gaines is

Clotfelter (1979), a study of Maryland games concluding that the implicit

lottery    tax on numbers games is significantly more regressive than that on
weekly games. Because it employs data based on the location of the sale
rather than the residence of the purchaser, lowever, that stody is relevant to

ccxnparative     incidence only and cannot   be   used to determine the incidence for

any   specific   lottery   product.-2
      To determine the implicit tax incidence of the lottery products now

daninating   the   market,   we collected data on personal expenditures by    type   of
game from a variety of sources. Table 6 shows the distribution of weekly
expenditures on instant game        tickets in    California based on a survey taken




                                          11
several rronths after the introduction of that state's lottery. This survey
reveals sane variation in average expenditures by inccxne but again the inccine
elasticity appears to be close to zero, implying regressiVity. Table 7
                                  states   based on the zip codes   of winners.
presents    information for two

(Winners are a convenient random sample of players). Winners are arrayed
according to the median inccrne of their zip codes. In the case of a 4—digit
nixnbers and instant games in Maryland, there is no discernible pattern in
relative expenditures    below $25,000. Relative expenditures in the top

income    group are quite low for both of these games. Again, these figures

point   to regressivity in   terms of average rate progression. Fbr   lotto,   the

data    for both Maryland and Massachusetts indicate sane increases with incane
over some ranges, suggesting      a pattern closer to proportionality. In this

regard, it    is interesting to note that the income distribution of lotto
players apparently changes en jackpots becane very
                                                         large. The last line
of Table 8 shows relative expenditures by incane class for drawings frien the
jackpt exceeded $5 million. Eccept for the highest incane class,
expenditures rise proportiately faster than incane, suggesting a progressive
incidence over this range.
     Table 8 gives information on participation and expenditures by game in
Maryland.      For each of these games, average expenditures are highest in the

 lost inccxne class. Absolute spending falls nnotonical1y in the 4—digit
daily nurrters game, while it shows a norironotoni-c pattern in the other games.
In contrast to previous tables, the distributions for the to nuiibers games in
Maryland appear to indicate inferior goods, clearly implying regressivity for
 the   implicit tax. In this regard, the findings are consistent with those

 based on sales data in Clotfelter (1979).            Above $10,000 in income,




                                           12
expenditures on lotto are roughly flat, though this distribution ould also
imply regressivity. Participation in lottery games also tends to fall with
inccmes    above $10,000.
      TO sxnrnarize:   with   the   exception of lotto expenditures in the presence of
very large    jackpots (where expenditures rose with income at low and middle

incanes) and   ni.inbers games in Maryland (where the lottery is an inferior good)
the   general finding here is that average lottery expenditures exhibit no

consistent relationship to income. This result implies that as a

percentage of inccrne a proportional tax on lottery expenditures generally

falls as    income increases. For example, average yearly lottery

expenditures in California          fall   nonotorlically fran 1.4 percent   of incane   in

the lowest income class to 0.1 percent in the $50,000 to $60,000

class)-3   Overall, the     incidence of implicit lottery taxation is decidely

regressive.


B. ODncentration

      Incidence measures based on mean expenditures such as those discussed

above obscure an important element in lottery incidence: participation is

heavily concentrated     within     a small    sgroup of   the population. In order to

examine concentration of play among individuals, we used a survey of

California residents taken several months after the introduction of that

state's lottery. At the time of the survey the only games offered were



previous

degree
           t
instant games. The survey asked for the number of tickets purchased in the

               months,   tickets being priced at $1 each. Thble 9            sixinarizes the

         of concentration in lottery purchases implied by the California survey.
During the period only about half of the sample bought any lottery tickets at



                                               13
all. among players the amount bet varied greatly. The 8 percent of the adult
population that    played the most during the sample period            accounted          for 60

percent of all purchases. The most active 20 percent accounted               for   80 percent

of purchases. Another survey of California lottery expenditures based on

purchases within the last week yields similar results, with           the most      active 10


percent   of players accounting for 64    percent of all play.14

      The   implication of this extreme concentration of lottery play is that
measures    of incidence based upon mean values alone are likely to miss

important distributional aspects of lottery finance. As a way of bringing

evidence on dispersion into the more traditional portrayal of incidence, we

follow an approach similar to that of King (1983). We used data from the

Maryland survey to calculate mean purchases for quintiles within                   each   incane

class. Figures refer to average weekly expenditures for those who played

within the last month. Since fewer than 60 percent of every income class

played the lottery in the sample mcnth,           the   first and   second   quintile means

are zero    in every case. Figure 3 shows the class        means for the third, fourth
and fifth quintiles by   inccrne class. The decline in mean expenditures between

the   lowest and the middle incane class is mirrored by wide variations within
each class. While all of        the class means are below $8 per week, the fifth

quintile means exceed $11 in every class. Especially striking is the very

heavy   play   among the most   active players in       the lowest incane classes. Pr

the most active 20 percent in the under—$10,000 class, average weekly

spending on the lottery was an astounding $30. The dispersion in lottery

expenditures within incane      classes   sIxwn here makes it clear that       a    relatively

 small proportion of households in each income class is contributing a

disportionate share of the revenue fran          the lottery.


                                            14
    One might well      expect such dispersion in tax burdens for other excise

taxes, particularly alcohol and tobacco. For the sake of comparison to

widely—used excise tax bases, Figure 4 shows the percentage of total

expenditures   accounted for by     quintile for several goods arid services.
                                  the top

cperxlitures for gasoline and telephone services are least concentrated, with
the top quintile spending less than half of the total in nost income classes.
Expenditures for tobacco and liquor exhibit irore concentration, particularly

at lower incomes. Yet lottery expenditures using the Maryland survey results
generally show still more concentration.15

C. Incidence by Other Characteristics
     Although    income is the natural focal point for the analysis of tax

incidence, it is useful to determine in the present case whether lottery

participation varies by other social or demographic characteristics. Most

rotably,   it is important to examine variations in race due to the frequently-
voiced charge that state lotteries cater to players from minority groups. It
is also    interesting to know how participation varies with education, since

lottery    critics have   charged that, with their relatively high takeout rates,

lotteries    prey   upon the ignorance of bettors. In order to examine the

independent effects     of race, education and other individual characteristics,
we estimated equations    explaining   average weekly expenditures based on the

survey of Maryland residents.        Fjuation 10.1 in Table 10 presents the basic

estimated   equation.
     Largest and most statistically significant among the explanatory
variables is race, with blacks spending an average of about $4.50 more than
whites, other characteristics the same-6.        Figure   5 illustrates the joint
effect of race and income on the proportion      of people betting more than $10



                                            15
per week.     This measure of heavy play also illuminates the degree of

concentration of play. Plainly, heavy lottery play is much irore prevalent
airong blacks than whites in Maryland, and this difference is rrost striking in
the lowest incane class. In that class, the proportion of blacks who repDrt
betting over $10 per week approaches 45 percent, compared to less than 10
percent for whites. These racial differences are so large and pervasive in
this data set that we estimated separate equations for blacks and whites in
addition   to the basic equation in b1e 10.

      Lottery expenditures for whites and blacks alike tend to fall with

education. This effect is significant only for whites, with the difference

between college graduates and those who did not complete high school being

alnost   $5 per week.   A similar pattern with   snaller   differences is observed

for blacks, but due to the ta1 1 sample the coefficients are estimated very
imprecisely. Regarding age, the estimates imply that expenditures on lottery
products are lowest for the elderly and highest in the prime earning years of
25—54. Males spend mDre than fanales: the x)int estimates imply a difference
of about $1 for whites and $4 for blacks. Surprisingly, expenditures do not
vary significantly between urban and rural counties once incane, race arid the
other characteristics are held constant.
     The estimated effects by income class reflect the patterns previously
discussed. Among those who report their income, expenditures are lowest in
the (cxnitted) $15, 000 to $25,000 incane class. The highest expenditures are

recorded   in the under-$1O, 000 class, but the difference between the middle and
the lowest class is statistically significant only for blacks, the point
estimate being over $14. The conclusion implied by Table 8 that Maryland
lottery products taken together constitute an inferior good, is supported for


                                       16
blacks. For whites, however, expenditure levels are not significantly

different    by   inccme level.


IV.   Optimal Pricing of Lotteries
      What    should the takeo.xt rate be on state lotteries? Having considered
efficiency and equity questions related to the creation and taxation of
lotteries, it is useful to conclude this analysis by asking whether the

optimal tax literature in public finance can inform us about this basic policy
question. Public finance theory offers several well—known rules for
determining optimal public sector prices and excise taxes. In order to
suggest      the broad implications of this literature, we apply one of those

rules, fully aware that this application necessarily will be incomplete.

Feldstein (1972) incorporates distributional considerations in the

determination of optimal       public sector prices.       Cne   special case   he obtains is

a modification of the familiar Ramsey pricing rule for the special case in

ich cross-elasticities of dauand are zero. Any externalities in production
or consumption       are ignored. Where the p's are gross prices and the m's are

marginal     costs, E11 and E22 are the       own—price   elasticities   of denand   for goods
1 and 2, and D corresponds to the "distributional characteristic" of the t
goods, the ratio of optimal markups on the goods is given by:

             —
                           =
                                  D12
             —
       (P2       ')/P2                  E11                   (1)



The distributional factor D12 given here is a function of the pattern of

consumption       of both goods over the incane distribution and the marginal social
utilities assigned to incane at different inccxnes. As the percentage of good 1


                                               17
bought by the poor rises, D12 falls. If both goods are purchased at the same
relative magnitudes over the incane distribution, D12 = 1 and the rule reduces
to the simple inverse elasticity condition. As the relative concentration of
good l's purchases arrong lower incane purchasers rises, however, the optimal
markup for that good fal is, reflecting distributional considerations.
       In order to assess current policy in light of this rule, we caripare the
implicit     tax rate for lottery products with the tax rates on alcohol and

tobacco products. Based      on an average distribution of 50 percent for prizes
and   15 percent for operating costs, lottery products face a typical markup of
35   percent apart frau federal taxes. We estimate that federal incane taxes on
prizes average roughly 5 percent       of sales, for a total tax rate of some 40

percent, shown in Table 11. This canpares with tax markups of about 30

percent on liquor, 13 percent on wine, 12 percent on beer, and 33 percent on

tobacco products, aggregating federal and state taxes on those products.

Regarding the "distributional characteristic," we have seen that lottery

purchases    exhibit either no relationship to incaute or are inferior        goods.     In
contrast, consi.iner expenditure surveys show that liquor is normal throughout
the   income distribution and that the other commodities are normal overall

(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 1978, Table 1; congressional Budget of fice

1987, Table 1).

       Fbr   current relative tax rates to satisfy the pricing rule, therefore,
either lottery products would have to be appreciably less price-elastic than
the    other products or lotteries would have to present more substantial

negative externalities. Neither possibility seens very strong.              Crie   is   left

with   the   strong suspicion, therefore, that the tax      rates   implicitly levied on

lotteries are    too high   relative to those   levied on   alcohol and tobacco.




                                          18
V. Conclusion

         once a state has decided to legalize and provide lottery gaines to its

    citizens, an im!x)rtant public finance question remains: what is the
    appropriate takeout rate? Without exception, the states and provinces in the
    United States that have instituted lotteries have a hign takeout rate for
    the purpose of securing large net revenues. Although lottery revenues do
    r,t approach the magnitnde of the major broad-based taxes on inccnie,
    property and sales, they are large relative to excise taxes and are
    certainly growing. In the United States the average rate of the inplicit
    tax on gross lottery purchases, counting federal and state taxes, is about
    40 percent, fnich exceeds the caTibined rate of tax on distilled spirits. It
    seems difficult to justify such a high rate of tax on sumptuary grounds,
    especially in light of the extensive marketing of lottery products conducted
    by states.
           The evidencepresented here demonstrates that the incidence of the
    implicit tax on lottery products in the l980s is highly regressive, as it was
    in the 1970s. Equally important are the particular patterns of variation
    in tax rates within incane classes. Because lottery expenditures are
    highly concentrated, the tax burden is also concentrated. The survey

    results     present suggest that, within inccxne classes, blacks are more
    likely to bet, and bet heavily, than ites. Looking at the provision aspect
    of lotteries implies, of course, that these heavy players also benefit 'tore
    fran   the existence of   lotteries if their decisions are well-informed. But
     focusing   on   the tax aspect highlights the fact that tax rates need not

    be as high as state and provincial governments have set them. ny
•    reduction in lottery tax rates uld have distributional effects favoring
    those groups that play the most.

                                            19
      In conclusion, it     is   worth   emphasizing   two   of   the limitations of the

current   paper. First,   the incidence analysis is couched in conventional

differential incidence terms where the implicit point of reference is a

proportional     inccxne tax. But since state tax      structures on the whole tend to

be regressive, objections to the dramatic         regressivity     of lottery finance on

the basis   of   equity criteria may be mitigated scznewhat. Second, the current

paper   does   not consider the expenditure side of the budget in analyzing

lottery finance. Where lottery revenues go to a state's general fund, this

omission has little effect. But where lottery revenues are earmarked for

specific purposes and where that earmarking has a discernible impact on a

state's pattern of expenditures, focusing on the revenue side of the budget

alone can miss important     aspects     of the distributional and al locative effects

of   lottery finance.17

     aRough estimate of average marginal federal income tax rate. Approximate
percentage of winnings subject to tax (followed by assumed marginal tax rates
for winnings subject to tax in brackets) are: numbers (MD): 9% [.20]; lotto
(MD): 22% (middle prizes) [.20], 50% (jackpot) [.30]; lotto (MA, 12/21/85 —
1/22/86): 68% (jackpot) [.30]; instant (MD, 1986): 4% (middle prizes) [.20],
3.5% (high) [.30]; instant (VT, 1986): 9% [.25]. Resulting weighted average
marginal tax rates and proportion of sales for each type of game (taken from
Table 2) are: numbers: .02 and .41; lotto: .20 and .41; and instant: .02 and .17.
On average, 50 percent of sales are returned as prizes. Excluding passive
games from the calculation, the weighted average marginal income tax on sales
is: .5[.02(41)+.20( .4l)+.02( .l7)]/.99=.047.

     2The ratio of jx)pulation in non—lottery states within 20 miles of a
state' s borders to the state' s own population was approximated using all or
half of county populations in bordering states.

     3Data on sales to noriresidents is not normally available, but inferences
can be drawn fran the zip ccxles of winners. Fbr Massachusetts, such information
is available only for lotto. n analysis of 500 winners showed that 15 percent
lived outside of the state. New Hampshire, which had much siialler lotto
jackpots than Massachusetts, accounted for 7 percent, Ithode Island 4 percent,
New York, none, arid other states the remaining 4 percent. Maryland, with four
lottery states and one non—lottery state on its border, had a similar 16 percent
of lotto winners fran out of state. However, the percentage of other games on
by nonresidents was ualler: 13 percent in instant games and 9 percent in 4
digit nuiers games. These figures suggest that the BORDER variable is at best
an imperfect measure of the capacity for out—of—state sales.

     4See DeBoer (1985) for a statistical test of econanies of scale in
lottery administration.

     5Actual revenues fran lotteries airrost surely overstate their incremental
contribution to state budgets due to declines in other revenue sources. Pbr
example, to the extent that purchases of lottery tickets take the place of
taxable constxner expenditures, retail sales tax collection will decline.
%'triere various bases other than lottery expenditures are denoted B, average
tax rates on each of them t1, arid total state revenue. R =          + tLL,
the incremental effect of an increase in lottery expenditures () is dR,/dL =
tL +     t1(dB1/dL). Fbr illustration, suppose a dollar's rth of lottery
tickets £reduces taxable retail sales by 80 cents arid there are no other
effects on any other tax base. In this case a state whose average lottery
contribution to net revenue is 35 cents per dollar of sales uld enjoy a
marginal contribution of only 29 cents per dollar if the state sales tax rate
re t percent and lottery winnings were not taxable. Fbr the case of
California, a state that does not tax lottery winnings, Vasche (1986, p. 48)
speculates that the lottery depresses revenues fran sales, incane arid pari-
mutuel taxes.

is ignored in the present discussion.


      9The introduction of a new good (such as a legal lottery) will be
expected to cause a shift in the demand curves for substitute goods (in this
case, illegal lotteries). This shift does not imply an offsetting reduction
in welfare, however, since the demand curve for legal lotteries already
accounts for the presence of the substitute good. This is so for the same
reason that the shift in the demand for a good creates no additional
offsetting welfare gain when a tax is placed on a substitute good. See
Harberger (1974, pp. 32 ff.), for example. For a similar application, see
Sugden and Williams (1978, pp. 134—137).
    10 for example, Stokey & Zeckhauser (1978, pp. 263—264).

    See, for example, Los Angeles Times Poll, March, 1986, referred to above.

    12Clotfelter (1979) employs data on sales and average incomes by zip code.
'lb the extent that individuals purchase tickets outside their zip code   of
residence and these zip codes have lower average income levels, the income
elasticities using such data will be biased downward. For that reason the
study makes conclusions based only on comparative incidence.


    -3using midpoints of bounded income classes, implied lottery purchases
as a percent of income in California for the classes shown in Table 8 are
1.36, 0.79, 0.48, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.13. If the mean of the over $60,000
class is $80,000, the ratio for that class is 0.15.


    141n order to calculate concentration or sample means in this March
survey, it was necessary to estimate the mean number for the highest category
on the questionnaire, which was 9 or more tickets. One method was to fit a
log—normal distribution, and the other was to use data on amount of winnings.
The estimate using the first method, 16 tickets, was lower and was the one we
use in this paper.
      We   assumed that the natural log of weekly expenditures was normally
distributed over the population of those who purchased at least one ticket. A
normal distribution with mean of 1.0 and standard deviation of 1.25 provided a
good fit for the empirical distribution. The other method of calculating
average play in the top group relies on answers to a question concerning the
to a question concerning the amount n in the previous week. The average
reported winnings generally rises with number of tickets purchased, but the
average ratio of winnings to number of tickets ($1.04) is too high by a factor
of 2, given a 50 percent payout rate. Whether this results from a tendency to
overstate winnings or understate number of tickets purchased is unclear. But
assuming the ratio of reported winnings to play is constant for all players,
the average reported winnings for the top class, $20.75, implies an average
purchase of 20 tickets in the top category.
    -5The figure is based on expenditures in Maryland, but similar results
re obtained for california using the Los Angeles Times Poll.


    16The derivative of expected expenditures with respect to race is F(z)
multiplied by the coefficient 10.20.
