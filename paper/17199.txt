The Behavior of Savings and Asset Prices When Preferences and Beliefs are Heterogeneous

                                              ABSTRACT

Movements in asset prices are a major risk confronting individuals. This paper establishes new asset
pricing results when agents differ in risk preference, time preference and/or expectations. It shows
that risk tolerance is a critical concept driving savings decisions, consumption allocations, prices and
return volatilities. Surprisingly, due to the equilibrium risk sharing, the precautionary savings motive
in the aggregate can vastly exceed that of even the most prudent actual agent in the economy. Consequently,
a low real interest rate, resulting from large aggregate savings, can prevail with reasonable risk aversions
for all agents. One downside of a large aggregate savings motive is that savings rates become extremely
sensitive to output fluctuation. Thus, the same mechanism that produces realistically low interest rates
tends to make them unrealistically volatile.

A powerful isomorphism allows differences in time preference and expectations to be swept away
in the analysis, yielding an equivalent economy whose agents differ merely in risk aversion. These
results hold great potential to simplify the analysis of heterogeneous-agent economies, as we demonstrate
in quantifying how asset prices move and bounding their volatilities. All results are obtained in closed
form for any number of agents possessing additively separable preferences in an endowment economy.

1    Introduction

The genius of the market is its ability to transform the holdings of agents with heterogeneous
preferences and endowments into outcomes that are superior for all. When time and subjective
beliefs enter the picture, agents’ claims shift across time and state in patterns that reflect both
aggregate shocks and their beliefs, and time and risk preferences. Aggregate measures in the
economy, such as interest rates and saving rates, reflect the outcome of agents who trade within
such dynamic market processes.

    We assume, as is common in the consumption-based equilibrium asset pricing literature, that
agents start with birthright endowments of a risky asset, i.e., the contingent claim on its stochastic
dividend stream. The dividend is interchangeably referred to as endowment, output or supply
hereafter. In addition there is a riskless asset created by the agents of zero net supply. The
price of the risky asset and the interest rate are determined by the supply and demand of the
market participants. Those participants possess additively separable utility functions. As the world
unfolds, they allocate their available funds - asset values plus asset returns - among consumption
and holdings of the two types of assets so as to maximize their discounted expected utility. Thus
agents continually shift their portfolios as asset prices rise and fall in response to the economy
(endowment). Such shifting would not take place if agents held identical preferences. Note agents
are better off in this heterogeneous world. They could mimic a homogeneous world by just refusing
to trade.

    Our attention to heterogeneity in preferences is intended to capture real world richness, and
to study the evolving patterns when diverse agents interact. Most prior analyses have eschewed
heterogeneity, thereby sacrificing relevance to escape the technical intractability that normally
accompanies attempts to allow for significant agent differences. We were able to define a new but
straightforward construct that characterizes the dynamic contribution of individual agents to the
demand for assets, and also identifies how current asset returns influence agents’ optimal allocations.

    We build on our analysis of differences in preferences to examine how disparate subjective
beliefs about the economy’s uncertain fundamentals also affect outcomes. Whatever the sources of
differences, the risk-averse agents share the unavoidably variable aggregate output in a manner that
smooths out their personal consumptions. Naturally, more risk averse and impatient consumers



                                                  1
respectively get smoother and earlier consumption, but they get less and ultimately much less later
consumption.

      All of our results are obtained in closed form. We show that all aggregate quantities of interest
can be expressed as functions of agents’ equilibrium consumptions, which in turn respond to those
aggregates. Agents whose consumptions are most sensitive to shocks, not surprisingly, contribute
predominantly to influence the behavior of the economy as output fluctuates.

    The risk tolerance measure that we advocate in the current paper captures this intuition of
                                                                           n io
risk-sharing mechanism. It is defined as individual i’s marginal propensity ∂c
                                                                            ∂w     to consume
                                                                                         i
ci out of the aggregate endowment w. It is proportional to individual risk tolerance, and shows
that more risk tolerant agents embrace more volatile consumption paths (i.e., larger response of
∂ci
∂w    to an output shock) in return for greater shares of the endowment when times are good. It
proves both convenient and reassuring that the economy’s implied aggregate (i.e., market-revealed)
behavior toward uncertainty, such as the risk premium and precautionary savings behavior inferred
from the market prices, and the volatilities of its bond and stock returns can be readily expressed
in terms of means and variances under this measure. For this reason, throughout this paper we
will interchangeably refer to these aggregate behaviors as market-revealed, and market-equivalent
characteristics of a fictitious equivalent single individual representing the entire body of agents.
This aggregation is feasible in our complete-market economy.

      In the special case of heterogeneous CRRA agents, it is well known that aggregate risk aver-
sion decreases with aggregate consumption. Similarly, given that more risk-tolerant agents invest
relatively more in the risky stock, a positive shock boosts their relative position in the economy,
thereby making them more influential. Observed risk tolerance thus increases in good times, and
vice versa, due to ownership shifts.

      Our risk tolerance measure makes available many parallel and intuitive results for the economy
as a whole on time preference, precautionary savings motive, and the response of aggregate sav-
ings to aggregate shocks. A simple decomposition identity illuminates the way. Market-revealed
(aggregate) risk aversion is a weighted average of the individual risk aversion in risk tolerance
measure, implying that its response to shocks is merely the average of individuals’ responses plus
the response of the risk tolerance measure itself to such movements. This latter term arises from
the equilibrium risk sharing among agents, and is responsible for many noteworthy effects in the


                                                   2
aggregation dynamics presented below. If, as is usually assumed, there is a long-term upward drift
in endowments, risk tolerance, despite bouncing around with output shocks, will drift upwards as
well.

       Like risk aversion, the market-revealed time discount factor is the weighted average value of
individual counterparts in the risk tolerance measure. As time rolls forward, more patient agents
- who have smaller discount factors - are more willing to defer consumption. Assets shift to their
hands, which drives down the aggregate discount rate. This phenomenon exerts downward pressure
over time on market-revealed time preference in the economy. Of course, the interaction with
aggregate shocks and risk preference can amplify or dampen the pressure.1 Our decomposition
identity yields simple expressions for how the discount rate moves with time and supply shocks.

       Our story is a story of risk sharing and wealth re-distribution as uncertainties resolve and time
passes. Surprisingly, these shifts allow market-revealed characteristics for the equivalent agent to lie
outside the range of values held by the agents in the economy. That is, if one were to posit that the
observed outcome came from a population of homogeneous agents, the hypothetical representative
agent could have values for his preferences or actions that lay beyond those for any agent in the
true economy of heterogeneous agents.

       Precautionary savings illustrate. The equivalent agent may have stronger savings motive than
would even the most prudent actual agent in the heterogeneous world. The explanation is straight-
forward. Agents facing stochastic output save for a rainy day. A world of heterogeneous agents
injects an additional layer of dynamic uncertainty in the economy, since the standings of individuals
in the economy change stochastically. This additional dynamic behaves as if it raises the demand
for precautionary savings. Thus, we point out that, in heterogeneous-agent economies, the large
market-revealed precautionary savings motive is not necessarily associated with the dominance of
the precautious agents. Rather, the savings motive is high when risk-sharing dynamic between
agents is important, i.e., when agents are sufficiently different in their beliefs, or in risk and time
preferences. To illustrate, the risk sharing can push up market-revealed precautionary savings
motive even when the mean value of risk aversion in the economy drops. It is well known that
precautionary savings powerfully push up bond values and lower interest rates. Then it is possible
and natural that the interest rate moves in the same direction with the economy’s average risk
   1
    If more patient agents are more (less) risk tolerant, positive shocks will amplify (dampen) the pressure, and vice
versa for negative shocks.

aversion when agents differ in their characteristics.

       In a heterogeneous and temperate2 world, savings and savings motives are also highly sensitive
to endowment fluctuations: they increase when economic prospects dim and endowments shrink.
This phenomenon is consistent with the observed extraordinarily low real interest rates observed in
most developed economies in the period following the 2008 meltdown. Aggressive monetary policy
surely contributed, but savings had also skyrocketed due to precautionary concerns. Another
remarkable implication is that when interest rates are low, they tend to be unstable in the current
general additive utilities setting. This is precisely because, as discussed above, the large savings
motives responsible for low interest rate is induced by substantial level of risk sharing and hence
is highly sensitive to economic fluctuations. In other words, large savings imply large savings
cyclicalities in the models. We establish an analytical and almost universal lower bounds for
interest rate volatilities. Within the additive utility framework, our investigation thus uncovers,
both qualitatively and quantitatively, the insightful role of savings cyclicality in the long-standing
risk-free rate and equity premium puzzles of macroeconomics and finance. In retrospect, it also
explains why promising models addressing these puzzles in the literature need to adopt either
features beyond additive utility (e.g., habit formation, recursivity) or richer time-series properties
for aggregate supply and consumption.

       Furthermore, our results on the dynamics of risk aversion and precautionary savings, and
their consequences for the movement of savings with the economy, have significant implications
for determining the direction and magnitude of volatilities in stock returns. The underlying logic is
clear: saving decisions reflect portfolio choices, which are intimately related to the volatility of all
asset prices, which in turn are influenced by the sloshing of assets among different classes of agents.
This savings dynamic (more specifically, the savings sensitivity to economic fluctuations) plays no
role in simple and popular models of the economy that employ a representative agent or two classes
of agents holding power utility functions. The critical role of the cyclicality of savings gets obscured
in such models. In our models, with a plethora of heterogeneous agents, the cyclicality of savings
stands out for its influential role quite beyond risk aversion and precautionary savings. The extent
of heterogeneity, i.e., how greatly agents differ, turns out to be critical.

       In any market-exchange economy, prices are determined by both the growth rate and volatil-

   Temperance is a determinant of portfolio choices. It is proportional to the fourth derivative of the utility function.
We will characterize this behavior under uncertainty more precisely in a later section.

ity of output (endowments in our models), and by the participants’ tastes for risk and tradeoff
across time, as well as their beliefs. As far as consumption and risk sharing are concerned, our
formulation identifies a simple tradeoff between these two key, but seemingly quite different factors.
That is because an interesting duality emerges. An economy whose agents differ on time and risk
preferences is isomorphic to another economy whose agents differ merely on risk aversion, though
the evolution of the endowment in the second economy will differ from what it is in the first. The
isomorphism means that consumption partitions, risk sharing between agents, and market-revealed
characteristics are identical in the two economies.

    This isomorphism potentially enhances our ability to study economies where agents differ on
multiple dimensions. First, the seemingly complex dynamic interactions of market participants in
an economy with heterogeneous agents are reduced to those of simpler economy but with a modified
output process. In particular, there proves to be an intimate connection between this heterogeneity
reduction and the market’s ”natural” selection (that is, the survival) of agents in the economy.
Second, employing this isomorphism may immediately pin down the direction in which additional
classes of heterogeneity or expanded heterogeneity (e.g., a mean preserving spread) within an
existing class will affect the volatility of asset returns. If the modified volatility of the isomorphic
economy’s output is lower than that of the original economy, that implies that the expansion in
heterogeneity in the original economy tend to shrink the volatility in asset returns. This is simply
because the volatility of asset prices increases with output volatility in the first order. The powerful
implication of this result is that should endowments change, our bounds on asset return volatilities
can be immediately adapted from a world where there are mere differences in risk aversion to one
where differences in time preference pile atop those. Our later analysis also allows individuals to
differ in their beliefs on how endowments will evolve, what might be thought of as their levels
of optimism. Moreover, the isomorphism extends. That is, we can add differences in beliefs to
those of time preference and risk aversion, and still find another equivalent economy whose agents
differ merely in risk aversion. In other words, the disparities in time preference and optimism
can be rotated away by a transformation in the evolution of the output process. Market-revealed
characteristics toward risk taking and savings will be identical in the two economies.

    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2.1 reports briefly the empirical statistical moments
(means and volatilities) of interest rates and equity market returns, which have been extensively



                                                   5
documented in literature. We also discuss recent estimates of distributions of risk aversion and
time preference in the population. Not surprisingly, these show substantial degrees of heterogeneity
among individuals. Section 2.2 positions our work and findings with respect to the related literature.
Section 3 derives various equivalent forms of the risk tolerance measure and discusses their merits
in the aggregation analysis of the economy with heterogeneous agents. Section 4 analyzes the effect
of savings behaviors on interest rate volatility and identifies substantial lower bounds given the
premise of large savings. Section 5 carries out similar analysis on equity return volatilities and
derives a sufficient condition for excess equity return volatilities, as long observed in data. Section
6 shows and analyzes the equivalence between the effect of heterogeneities in time preferences and
beliefs, and an appropriate modification in the output statistics. Section 7 concludes. All proofs
and derivations are given in the appendices.



2     Empirical facts and related literature

This section provides factual material to motivate our study of the linkage between risk sharing and
equilibrium asset prices given heterogeneous preferences. First, we recount the observed behaviors
of returns on key asset (risk-free bond and stocks). Next, we provide recent evidence from litera-
ture surveys showing sizable heterogeneity of market participants’ preferences. Models employing
homogeneous agents do not capture the richness of the world in which we live. Finally, we discuss
the literature most relevant to the current work.


2.1   Estimates of asset returns’ moments and preferences

Returns on equities and risk-free assets are among the most documented quantities in the empirical
finance literature. The behaviors of these returns expose stylized facts that can be ”puzzling” from
the consumption-based asset pricing perspective.

historical equity risk premia for these countries. In all three countries, for both recent and long
histories, real risk-free rates are both low and stable, compared to much higher and more volatile
returns on equities. This is the risk-free rate puzzle (Weil (1989)). Similarly, equity premia are
also large and volatile vis-a-vis low and stable aggregate consumption growth.3 This is the closely
related equity premium puzzle (Mehra and Prescott (1985)).


Heterogeneity in risk and time preferences

Our analysis includes heterogeneity in both risk and time preferences, thus it is important to
determine whether there is heterogeneity in such dimensions in the real world. Table 3 reports
the results of some recent studies on the distribution of individuals’ relative risk aversion, R =
−c∂ 2 U/∂c2
  ∂U/∂c ,       which have been conducted on the US and Norway populations. The first three estimates
are obtained from responses to different surveys, over different periods. The surveys employed
various forms of hypothetical gambles. The last estimate is inferred from actual financial decisions
  3
      Dividend growths are also much less volatile than returns on equities.

2.2     Related literature

Our paper is most closely related to heterogeneous-agent equilibrium models addressing price
anomalies in financial economics literature. The interest on price puzzles has skyrocketed since
the seminal papers by Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Weil (1989). Mehra and Prescott (2008)’s

                                                           8
dedicated handbook offers the most extensive single source of up-to-date references on this impor-
tant and vibrant topic. The current paper does not attempt to provide new solutions; it instead
contributes to a deeper understanding about the nature of risk-free rate and equity premium be-
haviors within the classic additive utility setting, a setting in which these phenomena are most
puzzling. First and conceptually, we shed new light on the crucial role of the cyclicality of precau-
tionary savings in shaping equity and bond return dynamics. Second and analytically, we identify
substantial lower bounds on interest rate volatility when interest rates are desirably low. Together,
these demonstrate the hard-to-reconcile nature of low and smooth interest rates observed in real-
world economies.

    In the finance literature, the heterogeneous-agent formulation appeared early on in Benninga
and Mayshar (2000), Dumas (1989), Wang (1996) and others, where agents differ in their risk
aversions. Heterogeneity in market participants’ characteristics has evolved into an attractive
topic of active research, which now also incorporates differences in time preferences (Gollier and
Zeckhauser (2005), Jouini and Napp (2007), Lengwiler (2005)), beliefs in the fundamentals (Basak
(2005), Detemple and Murthy (1994)), or all of the above (Bhamra and Uppal (2010), Lengwiler et
al. (2005), Sandroni (2000), Yan (2008)). Heterogeneity generates non-trivial risk sharing patterns
and consequently, has rich implications for price dynamics (Bhamra and Uppal (2009), Dumas et
al. (2009), Chan and Kogan (2005), Zapatero (1998)), portfolio choices and trading (Gallmeyer
and Hollifield (2008), Longstaff and Wang (2008)), and market selection (Blume and Easley (2006),
Kogan et al. (2006) and (2009)). In contrast with these works, our paper points out an intuitive
tradeoff between agent-based heterogeneities and macroeconomic conditions, which is helpful in
analyzing agents’ equilibrium interaction and the resulting price dynamics mentioned above.

    The degree of heterogeneity in the economy is plausibly the key determinant of the magnitude
of heterogeneity’s impact. In particular, Chen, Joslin and Tran (2010) study the impact of hetero-
geneous beliefs in the likelihood and severity of rare events (e.g., crises, disasters and alike) on asset
prices. They point out that the risk premium in the economy may drop even when the average
level of pessimism among agents surges. This is because there, the driving force is the dynamic
dispersion of beliefs and the associated risk sharing, but not just the mean value of the belief
distribution. By showing that subject to sufficient heterogeneity in risk aversion in the economy,
the equilibrium interest rate may even increase when the average level of precautionary savings



                                                    9
motives among agents surges, the current study complements their results in identifying another
setting where the risk sharing induced by heterogeneity yields spectacular effects.



3     Risk tolerance measure and aggregation

In any economy, be it one of homogeneous or heterogeneous agents, risk taking and savings are
determined by the behavior of individual agents. In a heterogeneous world, the dynamic competitive
interactions among such agents play a major role in determining aggregate outcomes. To address
the interactions that are determined by risk taking propensities, and the ultimate consequences
for various aggregates, the concept of risk tolerance proves to be both extremely powerful and
convenient. It precisely measures how agents’ consumptions move with changes in the aggregate
endowment. This section uses risk tolerance measures to derive key market-revealed quantities,
including risk aversion, time preference and precautionary savings. The approach neatly separate
the contributions of agents’ characteristics from their interactions. Many interesting aggregate
behaviors of the economy, some known others new, then can be readily elucidated.


3.1    The setting

To develop intuitive results on aggregation, we first investigate a general endowment economy with
many classes of agents. Within each class, agents have identical preferences,4 but across classes
agent risk aversions and time preferences differ. Throughout the paper, the superscript i denotes
quantities associated with agent i. Agents maximize their general time-separable utilities, which
are increasing, concave and three-time continuously differentiable. Agent i’s relative risk aversion
(RRA) Ri (t, ci ) and subjective discount factor δ i (t, ci ) generally can be functions of consumption
ci and time t. Alternatively, we will also study the canonical settings with power utilities to make
precise the model’s key results. For that case, agents’ RRAs are constant and simply denoted γ i ,
instead of Ri (t, ci ) reserved for more general (non-CRRA) settings. At the outset, each agent i
is endowed with a fraction θSi (0) of a risky stock paying a stochastic dividend stream w(t). The

     For this reason, to simplify notation, hereafter we simply use agent (being representative of her own homogeneous
class) in place of class (of identical agents).

When (µw − (σ w )2 /2) > 0 the economy is growing in the long term (limt→∞ E0 [w(t)/w(0)] →
∞ a.s.). A single share of the risky stock is available in the economy for agents to trade. In
addition, there is a zero net supply of a riskless asset (money market account, also loosely referred
to as bond below) created by the agents. Agents trade these two assets and choose consumption
levels to maximize their expected utilities subject to a budget constraint5 and market clearing

As the aggregate constraint holds at all time and states, the optimization problem (3) can be

     Aggregating the budget constraint (2) over all agents we obtain       i dw (t) = dS(t), i.e., the total change in
agents’ wealths equals the change in value of the single share of stock, which is the net asset of the economy.

     Given the infinite time horizon T → ∞, Lengwiler, Malamud and Trubowitz (2005) shows that this economy’s
necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium existence is precisely the boundedness of every agent’s expected
utility of aggregate endowment               Z                 ∞

3.2   Risk tolerance measure

In the economics of uncertainty, the ways agents optimally allocate their consumptions across states
and time are determined respectively by their relative risk aversion (RRA) and pure time preference
(a.k.a. subjective discount factor). It is convenient to adopt these standard characteristics for an
equivalent agent of the aggregate economy. Given a complete market, these characteristics are
revealed unambiguously from observed prices, and are attributed to this equivalent agent as if
there were only one class of agents in the economy. For this reason, hereafter R, δ and T are
respectively referred to as risk aversion, discount factor and risk tolerance of the market-revealed
equivalent agent (hereafter, equivalent agent).

The apparent analogy of these market-revealed characteristics with those of single-agent economy
aims to capture the whole economy’s attitudes, such as discount factor δ, risk aversion R and utility
function v(w), as of a single equivalent (representative) agent’s. In particular, in the aggregate the
                                w
above definitions imply T =     R,    a relation that also holds at individual level.
Following Wilson (1968), there exists a first very simple aggregation relation on risk tolerance (see
also proposition 1)

which motivates the choice of the risk tolerance measure {pi } as micro-economic building blocks of
all these market-revealed characteristics

                                                  T i (ci , t)    T i (ci , t)   X
                            pi (ci (w, t), t) ≡                = Pi            ⇒   pi = 1.

                                                                    T (w, t)     i


This implied normalization together with pi ∈ [0, 1], which holds when all agents are risk averse
(T i > 0 ∀i), qualify {pi } as a standard measure.

       This measure is formulated to precisely capture a key concept that risk tolerant agents play
predominant role in consumption and wealth distribution dynamics. To see this point, we note the
following very interesting and intuitive relation


                                              pi (ci (w, t), t) = ciw (w, t),                                      (7)


This identity shows that risk tolerance measure exactly characterizes the individual optimal con-
sumption responses to an aggregate endowment shock. In equilibrium, more risk-tolerant (i.e.,
          Ti
larger    T )   agents embrace relatively less smooth consumption paths (i.e., larger ciw ), and necessar-
ily contribute more to economy’s reactions to output fluctuations. In comparison, we note that
                                                                                 n io
neither the least risk averse agent (min{Ri }) nor the one who consumes most (max cw ) invariably
put up strongest response to the aggregate shocks. This signifies the unique role of risk tolerance
measure in determining the risk sharing and consumption partition among agents. As agents save
and trade accordingly to realize their optimal consumption plan, asset prices and their volatilities
necessarily are contingent on this measure. Establishing this link more quantitatively is a central
theme of our subsequent analysis.

       Being functions of equilibrium consumptions, {pi (ci , t)} entirely capture both aggregate fluctu-
ation effects and the dynamics of the competitive interaction between agents. The mere fact that
pi ≥ 0 ∀i (when all agent are risk averse) immediately implies a known and important result that
no agents cut their optimal consumption when the aggregate endowment increases, dw > 0. Fur-
thermore, agents whose optimal consumptions respond most strongly to an aggregate endowment
shock will dominate in this measure,7 as the following concise result implies.
                                                                                 n i       o

    The most widely-used heterogeneity measure in literature is consumption share c w(t)
                                                                                     (w,t)

with respect to the rich dynamics of equilibrium consumption’s changes under supply shocks.

guaranteeing the desired risk-averse and increasing utility for the equivalent agent.

      In the stochastic and complete market, agents perfectly share their risks by taking stochastic
positions in both stock and bonds. The optimal consumption plans thus are necessarily stochastic,
and so are their risk tolerance measures (also referred to as weights), pi = ciw . The resulting
equivalent preference characteristics e.g., R, δ, are stochastic, not necessarily because their agent-
based counterparts e.g., Ri , δ i are stochastic, but rather because their dynamics weights {pi } bounce
stochastically. Indeed, in a CRRA utilities setting, the individual Ri , δ i are constant, yet R, δ in
(8) are not so, obviously. To understand those dynamics more precisely, it is best to see how the
risk tolerance measure changes under aggregate supply shocks

These imply that the least risk averse agent i (γ i = γ min ) has convex consumption ciww > 0 and her
weight ciw unambiguously increases with aggregate endowment. The converse holds for the most risk
averse agent (γ max ). In between, the transition is monotonic: percentage changes in less risk averse
agents’ weights ciw are more dramatic than those of more risk averse ones. The stochastic nature of
risk tolerance measures is induced by risk sharing mechanism and has profound implications for the
volatilities of all market-revealed characteristics, as the latter are some form of weighted averages
in this measure. This observation is reflected in the following result, which provides the basis for
many findings presented below.


Proposition 2 Suppose {ai } are some agent-based characteristics. The response of the result-
ing risk-tolerance aggregate E{pi } [ai ] to an aggregate supply shock dw can be decomposed into two
components
                                     ∂E{pi } [ai ]                                    piw i
                                                                                           
                                                   = E{pi } [aiw ] + Cov{pi }            ,a .              (11)
                                       ∂w                                             pi

Of special interest, the second component is exclusively associated with the dynamic behavior piw ≡
∂pi
∂w    of individual risk tolerance pi (w, t).


To a lesser degree, the first component is also related to risk-tolerance measures, because aiw =
aic ciw = aic pi . But it is primarily associated with the dependence ai (ci , t) at the agent-specific
level at the onset. The mechanism underlying this decomposition is very intuitive. For a simple
illustration, let us continue with eq. (10) and assume that all the ai are constant. Dividing both
sides of (10) by pi = T i /T yields

                                             piw
                                                                               
                                                      1           1
                                               i
                                                 =                   − Tw (w, t) .
                                             p     T (w, t)       γi

                       piw       pjw
Clearly, γ i < γ j ⇒   pi
                             >   pj
                                     ,   or percentage changes in weights pi are greatest for agents with lesser
risk aversion γ i . This is because under a positive shock dw > 0 to the aggregate endowment, less
risk averse agents, who invest disproportionally in the risky contingent claim on aggregate wealth
(stock) become relatively better off, and contribute more to the welfare. Indeed, in this CRRA
framework, (11) simplifies to

                                          ∂E{pi } [ai ]
                                                                                      
                                                             1                    1 i
                                                        =          Cov{pi }          ,a .
                                            ∂w            T (w, t)                γi


                                                               15
The situations when ai > aj for γ i > γ j and vice versa are referred to as comonotone. Similarly,
anti-comonotonicity means ai > aj if γ i < γ j and vice versa. To illustrate, when ai is the discount
rate δ i , comonotone relations represent the normal case where less risk averse agents also tend
to be more patient. We see that when {ai } and {γ i } are comonotone, the mean value E{pi } [ai ]
decreases unambiguously with aggregate endowment w. This is precisely because smaller values of
ai (associated with smaller γ i by co-monotonicity) have relatively larger weights after a positive
shock increases w as we argued above, and thus drive down the mean value. The opposite holds when
{ai } and {γ i } are anti-comonotone; larger ai (associated with smaller γ i by anti-comonotonicity)
have relatively larger weights after a positive shock increases w, which makes mean value E{pi } [ai ]
increases unambiguously with aggregate endowment w.

      Two immediate applications concern the market-revealed risk aversion R and discount rate δ
of proposition 1, specialized to the CRRA utilities setting9
                                                                        

                                 Rw (w, t) =              Cov{pi } γ , i < 0,                          (12)

The first equation demonstrates a well-known result of decreasing market-revealed risk aversion (see
e.g., Wang (1996)). The second formalizes the wealth effect on market-revealed time preference
first obtained in Gollier and Zeckhauser (2005). We recast these known and important results in
connection with the risk tolerance measure to capture the key intuitions underlying this measure’s
dynamics.

      The above market-revealed characteristics also yields the equivalent hyperbolic discounting
behavior of the economy (Gollier and Zeckhauser (2005)). Taking the derivative with respect to
              ∂δ
time, δt ≡    ∂t ,   again within the CRRA setting yields

                                                 X               (δ(w, t) − δ i )2
                                 δt (w, t) = −       pi (w, t)                     < 0.                (14)
                                                                       γi
                                                 i


The intuition again can be distilled from competitive interaction in equilibrium. More patient
agents are more willing to defer their consumptions, and thus will increase their dominance as time

      Corresponding expression for non CRRA setting is Rw =       T

rolls forward. Given that being more patient means having smaller δ i , this competitive behavior
simply decreases the weighted average discount factor δ(w, t) over time. This in turn has interesting
and direct effects on the term structure of interest rates (Lengwiler(2005)).

      When heterogeneities are present in both risk and time preference, either a low risk aversion
or a small discount rate will lead an individual to play a greater role in the long run We will
analyze quantitatively the tradeoff between these characteristics in conjunction with agents’ long-
run survival in section 6.


3.3     Market-revealed precautionary savings

Prudence (see Leland (1968) and Sandmo (1970)) is a key characteristic determining precautionary
savings, and thus both interest rate and returns on other assets. Kimball (1990) shows that the
prudence, defined in analogy with relative risk aversion (6) as

                                           −ci uiccc (ci , t)               −wvwww (w, t)
                          P i (ci , t) ≡       i    i
                                                              ←→ P (w, t) ≡               ,
                                            ucc (c , t)                      vww (w, t)

provides an analytical measure of the intensity of the precautionary savings motive. Other factors
being equal, an agent i who is more prudent (larger P i ) will save relatively more under the prospect
of future income uncertainties. For a heterogeneous-agent economy with general additive utilities,
we can differentiate the FOC (3) twice to obtain the explicit aggregation relation

                                                                                                  ci Rci (ci , t)

                                                                            + Cov{pi } R (c , t), i i               , (15)
                                                           R (ci , t)

where the moments again are defined in the risk tolerance measure. The key observation is that
while market-revealed risk aversion (8) has value bounded within the spectrum of agents’ RRA
(Rmin ≤ R(w, t) ≤ Rmax ), such bounding need not apply for market-revealed prudence P (w, t).
The market-revealed precautionary savings motive contains a weighted average E{pi } [P i ] over indi-
vidual agents, which plausibly results from a simple aggregation. More profoundly, it also contains
additional components which arise from the dynamics of the risk sharing, and thus the risk toler-
ance measure itself, much in the spirit of the mechanism underlying propososition 2. To illustrate




                                                           17
this insight, let us employ the class of power utilities, wherein (15) becomes
                                                                 
                                                                1                     X
              P (w, t) = E{pi } [P i (ci , t)] − Cov{pi } γ i , i = E{pi } [P i ] − T   γ i ciww .                (16)

                                                                                         i


As pi = ciw defines the risk tolerance measure, ciww clearly characterizes the dynamics of this measure
under changes in aggregate endowment w. Individual agents’ savings are not made independently
as naive intuition about aggregation might suggest. That is because the economy’s precautionary
savings reflect both agents’ average precautionary savings motive and the response to stochastic
wealth distribution.10 This second factor inflates the market-revealed precautionary savings motive
                                  
because the term Cov{pi } γ i , γ1i is invariably negative. The more risk averse agents have concave
consumptions (ciww < 0, see (10)), and they contribute positively to this induced prudence due
to their larger γ i . When agents are sufficiently different in their risk preferences, this covariance
tends to be large (and negative) and it can inflate economy’s savings motive greatly beyond that
of even the most prudent agent in the economy. The proposition 3 and figure 1 below confirm this
extraordinary effect stemming from risk sharing between agents.

       Before turning to the main results of this section, we note that there exists another relation
involving prudence P (w, t), directly obtained from the definitions of R and P (derived in appendix
A)
                                                R(w, t)
                                 Rw (w, t) =            (1 + R(w, t) − P (w, t)).                                 (17)
                                                  w

This equality does not rely on any aggregation mechanism, and hence holds at both the agent
and aggregate level. (17) implies that high market-revealed precautionary savings are related to
the countercyclicality in market-revealed risk aversion. We will discuss this cyclicality and its
implication for interest rate volatility in more detail in section 4. Many important properties
related to risk sharing between agents emerge in a world with merely two classes of agents. We

Evidently, equivalent agent’s precautionary savings optimization composes of two-stage optimization over agents’,
subject to market clearings in each period. This subtle constraints constitute additional sensitivity of social utility
to future uncertainty that equivalent agent should be wary of.

Proposition 3           1. In the multiple-CRRA-agent economy, market-revealed precautionary savings
         are                                                                              

         tribution between the two agents where the market-revealed precautionary savings are higher

To illustrate the results of proposition 3, Figure 1 plots the market-revealed prudence in a two-
CRRA-agent economy with γ A = 0.1 and γ B = 10. In this case, P is a function of first agent’s risk

into two components; the weighted average prudence and the dynamics-induced prudence. We see
                                                                                                       cA γ B

       ∼ 1.5%). This value far exceeds either individual prudence level, P A = 1.1, P B = 11. The
excess stems from the risk sharing mechanism, and is quantified by the risk tolerance measure
dynamic. The latter tends to zero in both homogeneous limits (pA = 0, 1) where the risk sharing
possibility between the agents vanishes. Collectively, the agents may keep up this high market-
revealed precautionary savings motive for an extended period of time because they differ as well
in time preference.11 We will study in detail how precautionary savings affect both the levels and

3.4    Cyclicality of market-revealed precautionary savings

We now delve deeper into the microeconomic foundations of asset pricing to see how the cyclicality of
precautionary savings motive moves with consumption and wealth. This analysis provides rigorous
grounds to study the key effects of savings cyclicality on equilibrium price behaviors in later sections.
                                                                                                                                            A           B
condition holds, e.g., when subjective discount rates are e−δ ≈ 0.8, e−δ                                                                                    ≈ 1.



                                                                                                                                       20
       Central to our analysis is a simple and strong relation between precautionary savings motive
P (w, t) and its cyclicality Pw (w, t) that holds for any general time separable utility.

                                                 P (w, t)
                                  Pw (w, t) =             (1 + P (w, t) − Q(w, t)),                              (20)

where Q(w, t) is referred to as temperance

                         Qi (ci , t) ≡       i     i

                                          uccc (c , t)                     vwww (w, t)

Kimball (1992, 1993) shows that in a partial equilibrium setting with multiple sources of risks,
temperance affects the allocation of savings between safe and risky assets, i.e., portfolio choice.
First, in light of the relation (20), temperance Q(w, t) contributes decisively to the cyclicality of
savings. This savings adjustment in turn is reflected in asset return volatilities ans asset (bond
and stock) holdings.12 In the current general equilibrium settings, our observation in (20) thus
reinforces Kimball’s partial equilibrium results.

       Second and more important, equation (20) constitutes a new and keen relation between savings
and savings cyclicality in general heterogeneous-agent settings; savings behaviors tend to be more
volatile when savings motives are higher! Indeed, all else being equal, the intensity of cyclicality
Pw increases more than linearly with P 13 in (20). This finding is somewhat unexpected since a
priori savings and volatility of savings may not necessarily be tightly bound. A counter-example
illustrates this point. When the representative agent conventionally has CRRA utility of the form
             C 1−γ
U (C, t) ∼   1−γ ,   the precautionary savings motive P = γ +1 is constant, and thus savings cyclicality
is null, regardless of how big this savings motive P is. In contrast, the intuition behind our
observation (20) highlights the risk sharing dynamics in an environment with heterogeneous agents.
As we saw in the last section, in such setting the aggregate savings motive P is high not because
the most precautious agent dominates the economy. Rather, large P arises when risk sharing
dynamics are important, which are possible on the premise that agents sufficiently differ in their
characteristics, as illustrated by figure 1. Precisely because of this marked heterogeneity in agents’
risk preferences, shocks to the output induce considerable amount of assets and wealth changing
  12
     Given complete market hedging, portfolio choices are one-to-one with asset return volatilities. One’s position in
the stock is the ratio of wealth volatility to stock price volatility.
  13
     Q may also change with P . But in a setting with many agents, this dependence is rather weak.

hands among investors. As a result, economy’s savings behavior is then highly sensitive to output
fluctuation.

      To illustrate, we establish the aggregation relations concerning temperance, along the lines
similar to our analysis of market-revealed precautionary savings. For simplicity, we consider again
the power utilities setting.14 Differentiating the FOC (5) repeatedly yields the analytical expression
of market-revealed temperance Q(w, t)

                                                                                R2 (w, t)
                                                                                                              
                                          i                         i 1                                     1
                     Q(w, t) = E{pi } [Q ] − 2Cov{pi }             γ, i       −           V ar{pi }                  .                   (21)
                                                                     γ          P (w, t)                    γi

Given that market-revealed temperance arises from the third order derivative of the FOC, the
dynamics of risk sharing, and thus risk tolerance measure, contribute two terms beyond the naive
weighted average of individual temperance. This basic intuition also emerges from proposition
2. In the difference with prudence, for temperance the contribution of risk tolerance measure
dynamics is both strong and ambiguous. The market-revealed Q can either be larger than the
largest Qi , or smaller than the smallest Qi . In analogy with proposition 3, when specializing to
the two-CRRA-agent economy, we can specifically assess the market-revealed tolerance P (w, t) and
temperance Q(w, t) on a comparative basis. This comparison is important since both direction and
quantitative behavior of savings cyclicality Pw (20) are determined by the relative importance of
P and Q.

consumption partition, the dynamics-induced temperance is so strong that market-revealed Q(w, t)
falls negative albeit all individual Qi ’s are positive. Again in homogeneous limits (pA = 0, 1), the
sharing dynamics vanish and so does the dynamics-induced temperance.

    Interestingly, with three agents or more in the economy, the market-revealed characteristics
R(w, t), P (w, t), Q(w, t) are largely independent of each other, allowing more flexibility to estimate
the model in accordance with empirical patterns. This shows the rich outcome of genuine hetero-
geneities, beyond that of the customary but rigid assumption of a CRRA-representative agent in
the literature.



4    Interest rate volatility

In this model’s complete-market intertemporal setting, no-arbitrage is enforced by the unique state
price density M (w, t). In the current consumption-based framework, this state price density is the
marginal utility (5) of the equivalent agent


                                             M (w, t) = vw (w, t).                                     (23)


The risk-free rate (rfr) r and the market price of risk (mpr) (or Sharpe ratio) η are identified with
                                                        dM (w,t)
the drift and volatility of the state price density:     M (w,t)   = −r(w, t)dt − η(w, t)dZ(t), and thus


                       r(w, t) = δ(w, t) + R(w, t) µw − 12 (σ w )2 P (w, t) ,
                                                                          
                                                                                                       (24)
                                    wσ w
                       η(w, t) =   T (w,t)   = σ w R(w, t).

Here r(w, t) is the instantaneous risk-free rate at time t. Throughout this paper, for brevity
we also refer to it interchangeably as risk-free rate and interest rate. Both rfr and mpr have
forms familiar from a single-agent economy, which justifies the use of the associated characteristics
{R, P, Q} revealed by market prices as if there were a single equivalent agent representing the current
heterogeneous-agent economy. In particular, a strong market-revealed precautionary savings effect
is needed to drive down the interest rate’s magnitude in (24)

Here the numerical bound is based on the estimates of the aggregate consumption growth mo-
ments µw ∼ 2%, σ w ∼ 2% (Table 1). As we see in proposition 3, the risk-sharing dynamic in
heterogeneous-agent economy is able to generate a strong savings motive P out of much smaller
individual values P i , given that agents differ sufficiently in their risk preference. Similarly, for the
stock market to be priced by the above state price density M (w, t), mpr η needs to satisfy the
Hansen-Jagannathan bound (Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), see also appendix). By virtue of
(24), this constraint too has a very familiar expression in the current heterogeneous-agent setting

                                                       µs (w, t) − r(w, t)

where µs and σµs −r are respectively the stock market expected return and excess return volatility.
In the data, typically the stock market excess return µs − r ∼ 6%, the excess volatility σµs −r ∼ 20%
and the real rfr r ∼ 2%, which imply a conservative lower bound15 on the aggregate risk aversion

                                            1 µs (w, t) − r(w, t)
                               R(w, t) ≥                          [1 − r(w, t)] > 15.                             (27)
                                           σw       σµs −r

The large value for risk aversion implied from the excess stock market return is the well-known main
thesis of the equity premium puzzle. In the current section, our main focus is to show analytically
that this and specially the large precautionary savings bound (25) also have profound impact on
the interest rate volatility. Intuitively, as hinted by the stochastic natures of r(w, t) and η(w, t) in
(24) as well as the presence of aggregate quantities R, P therein, the heterogeneity among agents
necessarily affects the volatilities of asset prices in important ways.

       To fix the notation, we adopt the interest rate diffusion process dr(w, t) = µr (w, t)dt+σ r (w, t)dZ(t)
where like r(w, t) itself, the µr , σ r are endogenous in the model. Indeed, in analogy with (40), the
volatility σ r of the rfr is


                                σ r (w, t) = wσ w rw (w, t) ≡ σΓr (w, t) + σ∆
                                                                            r
                                                                              (w, t),                             (28)
  15
    Both bounds on P (25) and R (27) are most sensitive to the estimated value of consumption growth volatility
σ . In the US data (Table 1) σ w ∼ 1%. Here we adopt σ w ∼ 2% to have very conservative lower values for the
 w

aggregate savings motive and risk aversion, while noting that a smaller value of σ w will lead to larger P , R and thus
an even more volatile rfr than what we point out in this section.

are the components of rfr volatility associated primarily with the heterogeneity in risk aversion and
time preference, respectively. The expressions for these components are obtained by computing the
partial derivative rw from (24). We now analyze the contribution of each type of heterogeneity to
rfr volatility.

    Judging from the abundance of the derivatives Rw , Pw in the above expression of σΓr , this
component of rfr volatility is necessarily characterized by the response of economy’s collective risk
preference and savings motive to supply shock dw. A closer look helps to estimate the magnitude
of this volatility. Plugging (17), (20) into (29) yields

Terms on the right-hand side simply express the sensitivity of aggregate intertemporal consumption
smoothing and precautionary savings behaviors to output fluctuations, as they are derived directly
from the last two terms of (24). The most remarkable feature here is that both of these sensitivities
are substantial under the afore mentioned premise of large savings motives (25) needed for a low
real interest rate. Indeed, both terms in (30) are dominated by the large factor P , given the
realistic values for aggregate consumption moments µw , σ w ∼ 2%. This observation then offers a
simple but very drastic implication for the interest rate of general heterogeneous-agent economies
with additive utilities. Namely, in these models, a realistically low interest rate will tend to be
excessively volatile. The following proposition quantifies this important observation in analytical
terms.


Proposition 5 Assuming sufficiently large precautionary savings motive (25), in a general econ-
omy with agents heterogeneous in their time-additive risk preferences, the interest rate volatility is

Qualitatively, a key factor determining the volatility of the rfr is the cyclicality Pw of precautionary
savings, quantified by market-revealed temperance Q(w, t) in the above expression. This obser-
vation identifies a new and interesting factor driving interest volatility, one that is supported by
strong intuitions. Here, a critical connection is the relation (20), i.e., large precautionary savings
P tend to induce strong savings cyclicality |Pw |. In turn, for large P (25), both the intertemporal
consumption smoothing and precautionary savings motives are fiercely sensitive to supply uncer-
tainty as in (30), and the resulting interest rate is highly volatile unless these two sensitivities
cancel out. Proposition 5 shows that such cancellation holds only within a range of temperance,

                                                                               2µw

tive scale, and thus the cancellation is unlikely (see Fig. 3 below). As a result, large precautionary
savings most likely render the interest rate both low and volatile.

       Furthermore, interest rates are potentially volatile regardless of the direction of savings cycli-

cality. When Q(w, t) <        (σ w )2
                                      ,   the volatility of intertemporal consumption smoothing dominates
the precautionary savings term. Given a positive shock to endowment, the aggregate risk aver-
sion decreases and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution increases; agents tend to defer more
consumption to later time and the interest rate drops. In other words, the equilibrium interest
                                                                                    2µw
rate is countercyclical in this case. Conversely, when Q(w, t) >                   (σ w )2

precautionary savings dominates the consumption smoothing term. Given a positive shock to en-
dowment, the precautionary savings term decreases and the interest rate surges. In other words,

Kimball (1992,1993) finds in a partial equilibrium model that sufficiently temperate (large positive
Q) investors may invest most of their savings in safe assets. Our findings on the relation between
temperance and interest rate volatility echo this link in general equilibrium settings.

    Quantitatively, the lower bound of interest rate volatility is substantial when Q is not in the

(to render a low interest rate), when Q is slightly off from the above critical value, the lower bound
is several times larger than the observed interest rate volatility of 2% (Table 1)

characterized by temperance Q(pA ) (lower panel). The choice of risk aversion parameters {γ A , γ B }

stated by proposition 5, we clearly see that interest rate volatility is small only when temperance

Q is slightly off this value (by a few percentage points), the interest rate is hugely volatile.18

    Proposition 5 underlines the rich and complex equilibrium dynamics of the heterogeneous econ-
omy. It shows, for e.g., that a standard cure addressing, say, the level of the rfr may adversely
increase its volatility. All that said, though large precautionary savings motive has been found very
useful in addressing the equity premium and interest rate level in literatures, it is likely to bring
about an unrealistically volatile rfr in the heterogeneous-agent economies (with additive utilities).
The incompatibility of these canonical exchange economies and the observed equity premium is
well known.19 Our contribution here is to offer a new analytical perspective on this incompatibil-

strongly violated, and stock market is incorrectly priced by the model.

ity, within the standard setting of time separable preferences.

    We next consider adding heterogeneity in time preferences to see whether that can ease the
puzzles. The contribution of time preference heterogeneity can be computed either directly, as to
be performed in this section, or indirectly by first homogenizing this heterogeneity, as explained in
                          r of rfr volatility (28) arises from an interesting interaction between
section 6. The component σ∆
Yaron (2004)) have been invoked to tackle these asset price puzzles. In a new hybrid approach, Lettau and Wachter
(2009) enlarge the state variable space to include exogenous short rate process while maintaining the equilibrium-based
relation between the market price of risk and the fundamental dividend process.

where the last equality is an application of proposition 2, also derived in appendix A (eq. (64)). The
covariance structure is rich because both the risk tolerance measure {pi } and marginal risk tolerance
Tci are dynamic. In a CRRA economy, the latter is the inverse of the risk aversion coefficient. In
                           r depends on the relative orderings (comonotone or anti-comonotone)
that setting, the sign of σ∆
between risk aversions {γ i } and discount factors {δ i }. Under a positive supply shock dw > 0,
a procyclical discount factor δw > 0 increases the time value of consumption, thus encourages
consumption and discourages savings. It thereby leads to a surge in the rfr r. Hence, a procyclical
discount factor contributes to procyclicality in interest rates and vice versa. The heterogeneity in
time preferences can have either positive or negative effect on rfr volatility, and therefore can help
temper the extreme nature of the latter’s bound.

a function of consumption allocations {ci }, the covariance term is intimately associated with the
discount rate heterogeneity structure, and can be formulated largely independent of the temperance
term in (35).21 This makes heterogeneity in time preference a venue to mitigate the interest rate
volatility in the consumption-based pricing models. In an attractive alternative approach, Garleanu
and Panageas (2010) show that the combined features of overlapping generations and heterogeneous
preferences are able to sustain the long-term survival of groups with different risk aversions, while

      In CRRA settings, Tci = 1/γ i , so Cov{pi } (Tci , δ i ) = Cov{pi } ( γ1i , δ i ) > 0. This means that small γ i are most likely
associated with large δ i and vice versa (anti-comonotone). These are configurations wherein no agent dominates
other in long run (see section 6).
   21
      In CRRA settings, the covariance term is always negative if RRAs and discount factors are co-monotone (γ i >
γ ↔ δ i > δ j ), and positive if anti co-monotone (γ i > γ j ↔ δ j > δ i ), independent of consumption dynamics.

5         Equity return volatility

How do heterogeneities in risk and time preferences affect the volatility of return on stock? The
answer is considerably more involved than that for the interest rate because the stock price S is a
contingent claim on the entire series of future dividend streams. To pursue this question, we employ
the convenient tool of Malliavin calculus, following closely the approach presented in Detemple et.
al. (2003) and Bhamra and Uppal (2009). We assume that there are just two classes, A and B,
of CRRA agents, thus simplifying the exposition while retaining heterogeneity. In such economies,
                                                                                                                             TA
there is a single state variable, which can be chosen as agent A’s risk tolerance weight pA =                                T .

Detailed derivations can be found in the appendix B.

         In risk-neutral measure Q, all payoffs are discounted at the risk-free rate r. The stock price
then is

In our Markovian (GBM) setting, the stock price S(w, t) is a function of current endowment w,
and thus stock return volatility σ s can be defined from the associated diffusion process (i.e., gain
process)
                                     dS(w, t) + dw
                                                   = µs (w, t)dt + σ s (w, t)dZ(t).                                          (37)
                                        S(w, t)

A standard application of Malliavin calculus confirms these relations

                               S(w, t) t               t          B(w, u)          t

where B(w, t) = exp (          0   r(w, u)du) is the numeraire associated with the money market account,
and Dt denotes the Malliavin derivative at time t. This representation of stock return volatility
is very intuitive, as it reflects fluctuations both in the fundamental dividend and the discounting
process. In the deterministic discounting scheme (r, η are constant), fluctuation in the stock
return results entirely and without distortion22 from stochastic movement in the dividend process
σ s = σ w . However, in the current general equilibrium settings, both the interest rate and the market

price of risk are endogenous and stochastic. They then also contribute to the excess volatility
σ s (w, t) − σ w (terms σ w Dt η and Dt r) in (38)) of the stock return via the discounting mechanism.
Because the Malliavin derivative of a process X is proportional to its volatility σ X : Dt X ∼ σ X
(see (80)), we arrive at a simple sufficient condition for stock return excess volatility to be positive,
σ s (w, t) − σ w > 0, in the current two-CRRA-agent economy

Empirically, the return excess volatility in stock market is pointed out first by Shiller (1981). Here
the above condition allows us to rigorously validate intuitive arguments from the consumption
CAPM literature attempting to address this anomaly. In particular, either a countercyclical Sharpe
ratio or a countercyclical rfr acts to boost the stock return volatility. We now discuss these two
components in more detail.

    All else equal, when the interest rate r is countercyclical, r and hence the discount rate decrease
with the output. Similarly, when the Sharpe ratio η is countercyclical, the risk premium, and again
the discount rate, also tend to move in opposite direction with the supply. Given a positive
shock to the endowment, the contingent claim (stock) price plausibly increases. However, under
either countercyclical r or η, the stock price would increase more than proportionally with the
endowment because the discount rate tends to drop in both cases as mentioned above. The opposite
holds when the endowment shock is negative. This is why either a countercyclical Sharpe ratio
σ η < 0 or countercyclical interest rate (σ r < 0) would contribute directly to positive stock return
excess volatility σ s (w, t) − σ w , as expressed by each component of (39). The countercyclicality is
a feature present in many models in the equity premium literature, and is pivotal to producing
empirical patterns of predictability in stock returns. Campbell and Cochrane (1999) enlist habit
formation to generate a Sharpe ratio that is high when aggregate consumption is low and vice
versa. Chan and Kogan (2002) construct a heterogeneous-agent economy with a catching-up-with-
the-Joneses feature in preferences, which renders risk premia countercyclical to endowment shocks.
Quantitatively, a standard Ito manipulation on η (24) yields the following Sharpe ratio volatily
(with the convention: dη(w, t) = µη (w, t)dt + σ η (w, t)dZ(t))


                                        σ η (w, t) = w(σ w )2 Rw (w, t).                            (40)


                                                      32
It follows that the condition σ η (w, t) < 0 is achieved, as one would expect, when market-revealed
risk aversion is decreasing with respect to aggregate consumption, Rw (w, t) < 0. This is behaviorally
quite reasonable as we would expect agents to be bolder in accommodating risks when they are
richer. As viewed intuitively and generically as a direct implication of the risk sharing mechanism
(proposition 2), a negative Rw originates from the dynamics of the risk tolerance measure, which
favors less risk averse agents after a positive shock to the endowment, and vice versa. It thus arises
very naturally in the setting with heterogeneous CRRA agents (see (12) and also Wang (1996)).
In a more general setting (beyond the CRRA framework), this countercyclicality is easily observed
under the premise of large precautionary saving (25). Indeed, we can use (17) to rewrite σ η (w, t)
in terms of the aggregate characteristics R(w, t), P (w, t)


                            σ η (w, t) = (σ w )2 R(w, t)[1 + R(w, t) − P (w, t)].                      (41)

                                                              2µw
Unless R assumes unreasonably large values, R > P >          (σ w )2
                                                                       ∼ 100, the condition on large savings
(25) needed for a low interest rate readily assures a countercyclical Sharpe ratio. Alternatively,
proposition 6 below provides an agent-based sufficient condition for the countercyclicality beyond
CRRA framework.


Proposition 6 When all agents’ risk aversions and precautionary savings motives satisfy the re-
lation P i (ci , t) ≥ 1 + Ri (ci , t) on the equilibrium consumption path {ci }i , the counterpart relation
must hold at the aggregate level: P (w, t) ≥ 1 + R(w, t).


Intuitively, given a certain degree of uniformity among the heterogeneous agents, this proposition as-
serts that the individual preference properties, that are central to determining the price volatilities,
are preserved under dynamic aggregation. In other words, when all agents possess a large precau-
tionary savings motive, so does the economy as a whole. Proposition 6 confirms and states this
intuition as a rigorous sufficient condition. Whereas the risk aversion aggregation is linear (propo-
sition 1), the aggregation on precautionary savings is highly nonlinear. This contrast makes these
                                                                                R(t,w)
results far from obvious. It is also interesting to note that, Rw (t, w) =        w (1 + R(t, w) − P (t, w))

as in (17), proposition 6 simply states that market-revealed risk aversion is decreasing in consump-
tion if that property holds for each individual agent. A known special result of this proposition is
obtained when all individual utilities belong to the CRRA class, whence both Ri = γ i , P i = γ i + 1

Proposition 6, however, holds more generally for any additive expected utilities.

      Back to the condition (39); combining its two terms yields a more complete insight into the
relation between stock price movement and the economy’s behavior toward risks. We rewrite this

A few important observations should be made. First, each of risk aversion, precautionary savings
and temperance affects stock return volatilities. Intuitively, this is because all three influence savings
and portfolio choices. The mechanism at work is as follows. All else being equal, small Q enforces
the above sufficient condition, and therefore boosts the excess volatility of the return on stocks. We
recall from (20) that temperance Q is crucially related to Pw , namely small enough Q is associated
with procyclical P . A positive supply shock will increase precautionary savings (as Pw > 0), leading
to a decrease in both the interest and discount rates (see (24)). Thus the stock price increases more
than proportionally compared to the endowment, which implies excess volatility in the stock return.
(See also Shiller (1981) for a behavioral explanation of this phenomenon.)

      Second, the relative orderings between agents’ risk aversions and subjective discount factors also
influence return volatility, via the term Cov{pi } (δ i , γ1i ). That is because these orderings determine
the dynamics of risk sharing, consumption partition and risk tolerance measure in the economy.
These in turn are compounded in the asset price movements due to changes in endowment. We
will return to these heterogeneity effects in the next section.

      Finally, it is noted that while risk aversion and the precautionary savings motive have enjoyed
substantial credence as shapers of asset price patterns in consumption-based pricing models, the
cyclical properties of precautionary savings (or equivalently, temperance) are not well studied. Our
investigation makes explicit the important link between these cyclical properties and asset (bond
and stock) return volatilities. One reason why this very intuitive link has been quite implicit in


                                                            34
the literature lies with the heterogeneity structure of the model itself. For a close illustration, we
consider the setting of Bhamra and Uppal (2009). They obtain the first sufficient condition for
positive stock return excess volatility that involves solely precautionary savings.23 How can we
reconcile this result with our condition (42)? The answer is as follows. In the two-CRRA-agent
economy, as seen earlier, there is only a single state variable. This can be chosen without loss of
                                                                              TA
generality as the first agent’s risk tolerance measure pA =                   T .   Each and every aggregate quantity
R, P and Q then is a simple function of pA , and thus they pairwise bear a one-to-one relation.24
The derivation of Bhamra and Uppal’s sufficient condition exploits these simple relations, and in
doing so inadvertently obscures the role of temperance Q(w, t).25 In fact, by virtue of (24), the
                       dr                         dP         Pw
derivative of rfr     dpA
                            contains the term     dpA
                                                        =    pA
                                                                ,   which is obviously related to the cyclicality Pw

of precautionary savings. This example and (42) together indicate that in more general multiple-
agent settings R and P are important, but far from sufficient statistics to determine stock return
volatilities.

         It is reassuring that all the above observations and intuitions concerning the cyclicality of
precautionary savings, or equivalently temperance, also underlie the parallel results on interest rate
volatility, reported in proposition 5.



6         Heterogeneities and homogenization of beliefs

The heterogeneous-agent economies we have explored so far address heterogeneities in risk aversion
and time preferences. As we have seen, these differences can foster rich and resilient exchanges lead-
ing to the equilibrium when agents assume off-setting characteristics in their preferences. While a
higher degree of patience (smaller δ i ) favors deferring consumptions, a larger elasticity of intertem-
                                                                               1
poral substitution ψ i (equivalently lower risk aversion γ i =                 ψi
                                                                                    in the additive utility framework)
produces the same effect. Another practical and important factor in which agents differ is in their
subjective beliefs about economic fundamentals. Such beliefs directly affect agents’ intertemporal
    23
    Bhamra and Uppal (2009) investigates an exchange economy with two agents who differ only in risk        w
                                                                                                                 aversion.

decisions and thus asset prices. In this section we will show that, as far as consumption and risk
sharing are concerned, an economy whose agents differ in all time preferences, risk aversions and
beliefs may be transformed isomorphically into a far simpler one with heterogeneity only in risk
aversion. The required transformation offers new quantitative perspectives on the above-mentioned
tradeoff between different dimensions of heterogeneity. The analysis also relates neatly to the sur-
vival of market participants (a.k.a market selection) in the long run.


6.1    Heterogeneity in time preferences, risk aversions and beliefs

We consider the canonical case, widely studied in literature, of a two-CRRA-agent economy with
GBM endowments. The next section addresses the setting with multiple agents. In addition to
heterogeneities in discount factors and risk aversion, agents A, B also differ in their beliefs about
the growth rates µA , µB of the endowment process w(t) (1). The realizations of w(t) are correctly
observed by all parties

                                                        dw(t)
                            µw,A dt + σ w dZ A (t) =          = µw,B dt + σ w dZ B (t),
                                                        w(t)

where Z A (t), Z B (t) are standard Brownian motions under each agent’s subjective information set
(i.e., belief). We assume agents act on their own persistent beliefs.26 A comparison with (1) yields

                                                                         µw − µw,A
                                   dZ A (t) = dZ(t) + θA dt;        θA =           ,
                                                                            σw
                                                                         µw − µw,B
                                   dZ B (t) = dZ(t) + θB dt;        θB =            .                              (43)
                                                                            σw

Coefficient θi in essence characterizes the deviation of agent i’s beliefs on the endowment growth
rate µw,i from the its true value µw . When θi < 0, agent i is optimistic (with respect to the
objective growth rate µw ) and vice versa. Also, two agents assign different but equivalent probability
measures and distributions to the future uncertain endowment process. Since agents are still allowed
to trade in the riskless bond and a contingent claim on the aggregate endowment (stock), the market
is complete and the equivalent-agent optimization problem can be constructed to explicitly account
  26
     That is, agents do not draw inferences from the willingness to trade by others. Later, we will extend our framework
to accommodate time-varying beliefs, which in turn may arise from learning or other ad-hoc belief adjustment
mechanism.

Here we clearly see that all three dimensions of heterogeneity - risk aversion, time preference and
belief - play roles in shaping the equilibrium. To simplify the analysis, it would be desirable to
reduce this economy to one where only risk aversion experiences heterogeneous. Remarkably, that
is possible. Consider the following simple multiplicative transformation (which is derived in the
proof of proposition 7, see appendix C)

The coefficients δef f                2 ,       δef f                 2        are the effective discount rates of agent A
and B respectively, with their subjective beliefs being incorporated. The coefficients β γ,θ and β γ,δ
quantify respectively differences in beliefs and in time preferences, normalized with respect to the
difference in risk aversions. These coefficients will have a neat interpretation as slopes of a linear
projection in characteristics space (δ, γ, θ) when we come to the full multiple-agent settings in the
next section. Interestingly, we note that this transformation indeed considerably simplifies the full
dynamics (46), which now become

Equation (49) represents the familiar dynamics of a two-CRRA-agent economy whose agents differ
only in their risk aversions γ A , γ B , as studied in Benninga and Mayshar (2000), Dumas (1989) and
Wang (1996). Effectively, we have been able to ”rotate” the heterogeneities in subjective beliefs
and discount factors away by changing the aggregate endowment w(t) to Υ(Z(t), t)w(t). This in
turn is equivalent to shifting the growth and volatility rates of the GBM endowment

                                                                                                 

Thus in the dynamics of consumption and risk sharing, the differences in time preferences and be-
liefs can be taken into account by modifying both the growth and volatility of the supply process.
We will refer to {γ 1 , γ 2 , δ 1 , δ 2 , θ1 , θ2 , w(t)} as the original economy, in which two CRRA agents differ
in risk aversion, time preference and belief, as specified in (43). Similarly, we denote {γ 1 , γ 2 , ŵ(t)}
as the reduced economy, whose agents differ only in risk aversion. The defining property of the
transformation, that all agents’ equilibrium consumptions stay the same up to a (stochastic) mul-

tiplicative factor Υ(Z(t), t) in the two economies (47), implies a profound relationship between the
two respective consumption sharing dynamics. Not only are the consumption shares unchanged

economies.

And so do the aggregate characteristics built upon this measure in the two economies. The first is
the (market-revealed) equivalent risk aversion (8)

                                                         X T̂ i (ĉi , t)             X T i (ci , t)
                                    R̂(ŵ, t) =                                γi =                        γ i = R(w, t).
                                                                 T̂ (ŵ, t)                     T (w, t)
                                                            i                          i


Market-revealed precautionary savings P (w, t) and temperance Q(w, t) are also identical in the
two economies, which can be directly deduced from their expressions (71), (72) for CRRA utilities.
Because of these relationships, we will refer to this key property generally as preserving consumption
partition dynamics below. We summarize this precise correspondence in the following proposition.



Proposition 7 Suppose that the aggregate endowment follows a GBM process w(t) (1), and that
there are two classes of CRRA agents. In term of consumption partition dynamics at equilibrium,
the two economies are isomorphic:


                                            {γ 1 , γ 2 , δ 1 , δ 2 , θ1 , θ2 , w(t)} ←→ {γ 1 , γ 2 , ŵ(t)},


where the isomorphic endowment ŵ is also a GBM process defined in (50).

Though this result holds exactly under the specific premise of GBM endowment, it clearly shows
the direction and possibility of an interesting and qualitative tradeoff between agent-based charac-
teristics and aggregate supply statistics in more general cases. In this way, the findings in a reduced
economy can be adapted to economies with additional dimensions of heterogeneity. Among others,
the analytical results on the linkage between risk sharing and the size of endogenous credit markets
obtained in Longstaff and Wang (2009) can be immediately generalized to allow agents to differ
also in time preference. To fix the convention for the next discussion, we assume without loss of

                                                                                 39

ously higher growth rate (50). That is, as agent A is both less risk averse and effectively more
patient in the original economy, she would take more risk and be more willingly to defer consump-
tion than would agent B. Then it is necessary to boost the isomorphic economy’s endowment
growth rate, in which agents are now equally patient,28 to induce agent A to undertake similar
                                                             A > δ B . Second, when θ A < θ B ,
consumption sharing in equilibrium. The opposite holds when δef f ef f

β γ,θ > 0, the modified endowment ŵ has both higher growth rate and volatility (50). That is, as
agent A is both less risk averse and more optimistic29 in the original economy, she would bear risk
more aggressively in this case too. Then to preserve equilibrium consumption partition dynamics,
it is necessary to boost both the isomorphic economy’s endowment growth rate and its volatility,
given that agents now have identical beliefs. Finally, we also note that while time preference hetero-
geneity is reflected only in the isomorphic economy’s endowment growth rate, belief heterogeneity
influences both that growth rate and volatility. This is because a subjective belief relative to truth,
as characterized by a Radon-Nikodym change of measure (45), is always stochastic, while a discount
              i
process e−δ t is deterministic.


Time-varying beliefs

Interestingly, the above isomorphism also exists in the richer class where beliefs vary over time as
agents observe the realizations of the endowment process. The analysis can address general forms of
time variation of subjective beliefs, for which the perceived growth rates µw,A , µw,B of endowment
are bounded, adapted processes.30 Important special cases would be Bayesian updating and other
ad-hoc learning mechanisms. In such settings, in place of (45), individual beliefs are characterized
by the path-dependent Radon-Nikodym derivatives

     These are prerequisites for Girsanov’s theorem on change of measure to work. See, e.g., section 3.5 in Karatzas
and Shreve (1991).


                                                              40
The coefficients θA , θB (43) now are bounded, adapted stochastic processes and describe possible
evolution patterns of beliefs. To illustrate, let us briefly consider two examples. The first is the
Bayesian updating case where agents’ priors about the endowment’s unobserved growth rate µw
are normal distributions N (mI (t), v I (t)), I ∈ {A, B}. In this setting, Brennan (1998) obtains the
following learning dynamic31
                     
                      dmI =          v I (0)      w
                                                   (µ − mI )dt + σ w dZ(t) ,
                                                                          
                                v I (0)t+(σ w )2
                                                                                                     I ∈ {A, B}.
                      v I (t) = vI (0)(σw )2 ,
                                 v I (0)t+(σ w )2


Evidently, as time lapses, both agents’ beliefs converge to truth; limt→∞ v I (t) → 0, limt→∞ mI (t) →
µw , I ∈ {A, B}. In the second example, even if agents eventually learn the truth, their beliefs may
                                                                                                                ∂|θA −θB |
diverge incrementally following a negative shocks to the output when relation                                      ∂w        < 0 holds.

      The current general belief heterogeneity can be rotated away by modifications in the growth
and volatility of endowment process, similar to (47). The only difference with (48) is that now the
transformation parameters β γ,θ , β γ,δ are stochastic. Accordingly, in place of (50), the endowment
process of the isomorphic economy becomes

                                                  dŵ(t)

While the original output w(t) is a pure geometric brownian process, its isomorphic counterpart ŵ(t)
incorporating the time variance in belief dynamics, generally belongs to richer classes. In particular,
when beliefs diverges in bad time (dw < 0), the volatility of the isomorphic economy’s endowment
σ ŵ gets further away from that of the original economy σ w , though the former economy does not
necessarily become more volatile (i.e., σ ŵ can either increase or decrease with w). Furthermore,
certain time-varying patterns of beliefs in the original economy may transform into a degree of
mean reversion in the output of the isomorphic economy so that the risk-sharing dynamic between
agents is preserved despite beliefs being homogenized. The mean reversion in the output’s growth
benefits alternatively one or the other agent when the trend turns.32 This implies that the original
 31
      We assume that agents agree to disagree, and learn only from the observed realizations of endowment.
 32
      We will analyze in section 6.3 how the output’s growth rate affects agents’ survival in the long run.



                                                                 41
belief heterogeneity acts to compensate agents’ difference in risk aversions in a way that sustain
their presence in equilibrium, despite market selection. Qualitatively, the isomorphic transformation
allows us to see quickly how heterogeneities in beliefs and time preferences affect agent’s risk-sharing
behaviors in the original economy per se. The dynamic (51) of isomorphic economy’s output then
initiates a quantitative analysis of the risk sharing in the simplified setting of heterogeneity only in
risk aversion.

      So far our analysis has involved two-CRRA-agent economies, for which case the isomorphism
exists. We turn next to the more general setting with multiple CRRA agents and relate it naturally
to the important issue of long-run survival of these agents.


6.2     Multi-agent setting

We now generalize the findings of the previous section to the case of many CRRA agents, and
relegate missing derivations to the appendix C. Quantitatively, the consumption dynamics isomor-
phism between the original (fully heterogeneous) and the reduced (agents heterogeneous only in
risk aversions) economy {γ i , δ i , θi }i , w(t) ←→ {γ i }i , ŵ(t) is concerned with both FOC and

In particular, when either γ i and θi (or γ i and δef f

(or β γ,δ ) are positive. Then the growth rate µŵ and volatility σ ŵ of the isomorphic endowment
ŵ are unambiguously larger than their original counterparts µw , σ w . This is because the co-
monotonicity in γ i and θi means agents are highly polarized; less risk averse agents are also likely
more optimistic ones and vice versa. To induce agents to preserve their consumption sharing
dynamics, it is necessary to boost both the growth rate and volatility of the endowment in the
reduced economy, in which agents by construction have homogeneous time preferences and beliefs
(that is, they are less polarized). The same applies for co-monotonicity in γ i and δef
                                                                                     i . These general

intuitions, when combined with the regression-based interpretation of the coefficients B, D in (54),
(55), point again to the interesting tradeoff between microscopic (agent-based) characteristics and


                                                              43
macroscopic (aggregate) supply statistics in the multiple-agent economy. When the the linearities
(53) in characteristics space (δ i , γ i , θi ) do not hold, no exact isomorphism can be found between
the original {γ i , δ i , θi }i , w(t) and the reduced {γ i }i , ŵ(t) economies. Nevertheless, the latter
                                                        

can always be explicitly constructed about the linear projections (54), (55) from time preferences
{δ i } and beliefs {θi } onto risk aversion {γ i }, as we see in (57). We reasonably expect that the
consumption partition dynamics in the reduced economy, heterogeneous only in risk aversions,
would most closely match that of the original economy, heterogeneous in all three dimensions of
risk aversion, time preference and beliefs.

      So far in this section, our strategy for analyzing heterogeneous-agent economies has been to
deform the aggregate supply process to the point that it fully (or best) accounts and thus com-
pensates for agents’ heterogeneities in time preferences and beliefs. In certain aspects, this pairs
well with a popular strategy in the literature to substitute different dimensions of heterogeneity,
either at the individual agent or representative agent level. The latter strategy addresses whether
the risk loving, patience and optimism of each agent or the whole economy (market-revealed agent)
are equivalent and mutually substitutable given observed risk sharing and price dynamics. In the
single-generation settings under current consideration, a specific but central question is on the
domination and survival of some agents over the others in the long run. Working in the context of
the market selection, we now formally relate these two strategies.

Consider the case µw >         2      so that the economy is growing statistically. When I i < I j , Yan (2008)
notes that the above scaled equilibrium consumption ratio (58) grows to infinity almost surely as
                                                 cj                                                        cj (w,t)
t → ∞. As the consumption ratio                  w    ∈ [0, 1] is bounded, this necessarily implies that    w(t)      →0
almost surely, or agent j will fail to survive in the long run.33 For this reason, parameters I i are
referred to as survival indices. By performing this pairwise comparative analysis for all agents
in this growing economy, Yan (2008) obtains a necessary condition for long-run survival in this
economy.
                                           ci (w, t)
                                        lim          6= 0 =⇒ i ∈ arg min{I j }.                                       (60)
                                        t→∞ w(t)                      j

Any agent i who survives in the long run must have minimum survival index among all agents.
Clearly, either high risk aversion (large γ i ), impatience (large δ i ) or pessimism (large θi ) will
contribute negatively to the market selection of an agent. On top of these, the economy’s strong
                                      (σ w )2
growth (large positive µw −              2 )    also fastens the extinction process for those who are not fit to
survive. This is because, the statistically growing economies do not reward these characteristics
of ”reservation” nature in the long run.34 We note that this condition however is not strictly
sufficient for survival. Consider the case where there are several agents i, j all having minimum
index I i = I j = Imin . In the limit of t → ∞, standard Brownian motion Z(t) → ±∞ with
equal probability (a well-known non-stationarity problem). (58) then implies additionally that
only agents having extremum (minimum or maximum) value of θj + γ j σ w (among agents with
minimum survival index) survive. This observation allows us to deduce a more elaborated set of
necessary conditions, that also connect well with our analysis of the isomorphic economy. Namely,
common to all agents i who survive, there exist two constants K, L such that
                                                                              

     Here any agent i’s long-run survival definition is that his consumption ratio c w(t)

limit of large t.
  34
     For example, more risk-loving agents have lower EIS, defer more consumption and invest more in risky equity
relatively. When economy grows steadfastly, the stock market pays off well, and these agents quickly dominate the
economy. The rate of their ascent increases with the economy’s growth rate.


                                                                45
These necessary conditions are none other than the linearity sufficient conditions for the existence
of the reduced economy. The immediate conclusion is that the set of survival agents implies the
existence of the exact isomorphic economy. To put it in another way, ultimately all heterogeneous-
agent economies specified in this section can be exactly reduced to its simpler isomorphic version,
when all agents differ only in their risk aversion.35 Furthermore, in this case the reduced economy’s
supply ŵ turns out to be constant, which makes the analysis of co-surviving agents even simpler. In
the not-so-long run, the isomorphism does not hold exactly because other agents (who ultimately
perish) hang on. Nevertheless, in the current setting with additive utilities, Kogan et. al. (2009)
show that these agents leave no lingering traces on price dynamics after their consumption shares
become negligible. Then as discussed earlier, the linear projection construction (54), (55) will
determine qualitatively the time preference and heterogeneous belief contributions, as well as sig-
nificantly simplifying the analysis on consumption partition and perhaps the asset price dynamics
of the original economy.

         We thus show that agent survival implies the existence of an isomorphic economy. But is
the converse true, i.e., does isomorphism also imply survival? We recall that isomorphism just
requires that the original economy can be reduced to a simpler economy heterogeneous only in
risk aversion. Obviously, the latter generally does not imply survival, because both (i) agents are
still heterogeneous in risk aversion and (ii) its aggregate endowment ŵ can be either growing or
shrinking steadily. Thus survival is the stronger concept, and the existence of isomorphic economy
does not imply the survival of different agents in general. Only in a special case where the transform
Υ(Z(t), t) assumes some particular functional forms, does the isomorphism imply the survival of
all agents.



7         Conclusion

Finance, and economics more generally, has made great progress utilizing the representative agent
model. However, real world agents differ significantly in risk aversion, time preference and beliefs.
Moreover, such differences strongly motivate the trades that are made on financial markets, and
    35
    In this regard, the special case when only one agent survives is trivial, because he eventually consumes the whole
aggregate endowment. For time separable utilities under consideration, the economy will converge to a single-agent
economy in all aspects as shown by Kogan et. al. (2009).




                                                         46
therefore the behaviors of asset prices.

   We analyzed the savings and consumption choices for agents who differ in preferences and beliefs
within an economy with a GBM endowment. These choices translate into aggregates, which in turn
determine asset price behavior. The most significant results are two remarkable isomorphisms,
which may greatly facilitate the study of economies composed of heterogeneous agents. First, when
agents differ only in risk aversion, the economy behaves as if all agents were identical to a single
market-equivalent agent with a derived level of risk aversion. Second, when agents differ in all of
risk preferences, time preferences and beliefs about the future growth of the economy, the economy
is equivalent to one where all agents differ merely in risk aversion. Combining these two results,
despite three dimensions of heterogeneity, the economy operates as if it were homogeneous and
composed only of the market-equivalent agent.

   Surprisingly, the aggregates in the heterogeneous economy, such as the ”observed” precaution-
ary savings motive, can lie well outside the behaviors that would be observed were the economy
composed of any possible one of its constituent types of agents. That is because the dynamic risk
sharing and trading of assets among types as the economy incurs shocks are of a stochastic na-
ture. Low real interest rates, equivalent to those observed in the real world, can be achieved with
reasonable risk aversions for all individual agents, given that large aggregate precautionary savings
motives are feasible in equilibrium. However, such large savings motives tend to imply large savings
cyclicality, which in turn generates unrealistic levels of interest rate volatility. (We show that such
volatility can be dampened by heterogeneity in time preference.) Savings cyclicality also influences
stock prices and volatility, as is demonstrated.

   To move from the heterogeneity in all of risk aversion, time preference and beliefs to those
merely on risk aversion, that is to dramatically reduce the dimensions of the problem, requires
merely modifying the mean and volatility of the endowment process. We expect this insight to
make future investigations of heterogeneities much more tractable.

   The risk tolerance measure proves to be an extraordinarily versatile tool quantifying how in-
dividuals share risk and how resulting aggregate behaviors response to growth shocks. The sen-
sitivities to these shocks (i.e., derivatives) of risk tolerance reveal how agents are jostled in their
weightings within the economy as uncertainties unfold. Conveniently, these derivatives prove to be
simple functions of individuals’ risk aversion, prudence and temperance. This property allows us


                                                   47
to obtain interesting and analytical bounds on asset return volatilities.

   The principal risk that we face in the modern economy, as we witnessed in recent years, is
the movement of asset prices within the economy. This analysis traced how agents who differ on
preferences and beliefs trade amongst themselves to simultaneously hedge against, capitalize on
and generate such movements. Most important, it showed that those tracings prove tractable.

B     Proofs concerning asset return volatilities

Preliminaries:
When θ is a continuously differentiable function of the underlying Brownian motion Z, the Malliavin
derivative Dt θ is the deviation in θ due to change in the path of Z starting at t. The Malliavin
calculus is a handy tool to study stock return volatilities. We adopt this tool here along the
presentation of Detemple et. al. (2003) and Bhamra and Uppal (2009). More extensive exposition
of this powerful tool can be found in Nualart (2006). We first state two useful results for our proofs.
Result 1: Let β(t) be a general GBM process with bounded drift and diffusion

           dβ(t)
                 = µ(β, t)dt + σ(β, t)dZ(t) where |µ(β, t)|, |σ(β, t)| < ∞ almost surely.                (76)
           β(t)

Then the process β(t) never changes its sign


                                  β(t)β(s) ≥ 0            ∀t, s almost surely.                           (77)


Result 2: Let θ(t) be a general diffusion process


                                    dθ(t) = µ(θ, t)dt + σ(θ, t)dZ(t),                                    (78)


then under regularity conditions the Malliavin derivative Θ(τ ) ≡ Dt θ(τ ) of process θ(t) is a gener-
alized GBM process with specified initial value

                      dΘ(τ )
                             = µθ (θ, τ )dτ + σθ (θ, τ )dZ(τ );            Θ(t) = σ(θ, t).               (79)
                      Θ(τ )

 Note that subscript θ in µθ , σθ always denotes the partial derivative and Malliavin derivative
Dt θ(τ ) is a process with respect to the ulterior time τ , and thus is defined only for τ ≥ t. This
result makes clear the relation between diffusion of a process and its Malliavin derivative. More
specifically,
                                          Z   τ                                Z τ               
                                                                  1 2
         Dt θ(τ ) = Θ(τ ) = σ(θ, t) exp                µθ (θ, u) − σθ (θ, u) du +     σθ (θ, u)dZ(u) .   (80)
                                           t                      2                t


In particular they are identical when the Malliavin derivative is contemporaneous, Dt θ(t) = σ(θ, t).

Plugging above Dt G(t, T ) into eq. (82) we get the excess volatility of stock return (38).




                                                                             58
Derivation of eq. (39): Let’s define


                           θ(w, t) ≡ σ w η(w, t) + r(w, t);   dθ = µθ dt + σ θ dZ(t).


From (38), it is clear that Dt θ(w, τ ) < 0 ∀τ ≥ t implies positive stock return excess volatility
σ s > σ w . In light of Result 2 above, this Malliavin derivative is a generalized Brownian motion,
and Result 1 implies that it will remain negative at all time if all following conditions hold.

                           ∂σ θ
  1. Diffusion σθθ ≡        ∂θ    is bounded. Indeed this is the case. In the current two-CRRA-agent
     setting, δ, R, P are simple polynomials of pA , and so are r, η in (24), and also θ and σ θ =
                                                                                                                ∂θ
     [∂(r+σ w η)/∂pA ]σ pA by virtue of (81). Then the next-generation partial derivatives θpA ≡               ∂pA
                                                                                                          σ θA
                   ∂σ θ                                                                        ∂σ θ
     and σpθA ≡    ∂pA
                          are also simple polynomials of pA . These in turn imply σθθ =         ∂θ    =    p
                                                                                                          θpA    is
     bounded almost surely because pA is in (0, 1).

                   ∂µθ
  2. Drift µθθ ≡    ∂θ    is bounded. This holds by identical reasoning.

  3. Initial value Dt θ(w, τ )|τ =t < 0. Note that because τ = t, this Malliavin derivative is simply
     the volatility σ θ = [∂(r + σ w η)/∂pA ]σ pA . From (81), σ pA is always positive for our convention
     γ A < γ B , then this last condition is precisely the required sufficient condition (39).

                                                                                                          TA
Derivation of eq. (42): In 2-agent economy, we can work with risk tolerance measure pA ≡                  T      as

C         Proofs concerning heterogeneity transformations

Proof of proposition 7. The multiplicative factor Υ(Z(t), t) (47) is required to be able to reduce
FOC (46) to a simpler FOC (49), thus it satisfies

                                                         A       A        B      B

Let us look for Υ in the form exp β γ,δ t exp β γ,θ Z(t) . Plugging in the Radon-Nikodym derivative

ξ i = e−(θ              e−θ            , above eq. becomes

                                                      (θA )2
                                                                h                i

                                                        2

Identifying the drift and diffusion parts immediately yields β γ,δ , β γ,θ in (48). This transformation
implements the isomorphism {γ 1 , γ 2 , δ 1 , δ 2 , θ1 , θ2 , w(t)} ←→ {γ 1 , γ 2 , ŵ(t)}.
