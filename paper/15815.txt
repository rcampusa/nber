This Time is Different Chartbook: Country Histories on Debt, Default, and Financial Crises
Carmen M. Reinhart
NBER Working Paper No. 15815
March 2010
JEL No. F3,H6,N50

                                               ABSTRACT

This Chartbook provides a pictorial history, on a country-by-country basis, of public debt and economic
crises of various forms. It is a timeline of a country’s creditworthiness and financial turmoil. The analysis,
narrative, and illustrations in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), This Time is Different: Eight Centuries
of Financial Folly, were primarily organized around themes (serial default, inflation, etc.), although
detailed tables in the book chronicled country-specific information on the dating, frequency, incidence,
etc. of specific crises episodes by country. The Chartbook compliments the thematic analysis with
individual country histories, and provides the grounds for a systematic analysis of the temporal patterns
of debt cycles, banking and sovereign debt crises, hyperinflation, and, for the post World War II period,
the reliance on IMF programs.

                                              I. Preamble

           This Chartbook provides a pictorial history, on a country-by-country basis, of debt and

economic crises of various forms. The analysis, narrative, and illustrations in This Time is

Different, were primarily organized around themes (serial default, inflation, etc.), although

detailed tables in the book chronicled country-specific information on the dating, frequency,

incidence, etc. of specific crises episodes by country. 1 The Chartbook compliments the thematic

analysis—indeed, it fills in as documentation to its underpinnings. What follows systematically

illustrates for 70 countries the individual timeline of public and private debts, banking, sovereign

domestic and external debt crises, and hyperinflation, starting from a country’s independence

(and even prior to that in numerous cases) to the present. The dating of the largest output

declines and a country’s history with International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs since World

War II to deal with an assortment of economic ills contribute to the chronologies.

           The individual country histories are often fascinating in their own right, highlighting that

virtually no country has escaped unscathed from economic crises of one form or another. In

effect, in a number of countries, financial crises are more “a way of life” affecting all, if not most

generations. Black swans are not that rare.

           The prologue to this Chartbook is minimalist by design and is organized as follows. The

next section offers an essential guide to the country charts and the accompanying tables, clarifies

methodological issues, and delineates the approach followed to document the vast number of

sources referenced in this analysis.

           Section III summarizes some of the main (common or recurrent) themes and patterns that

(collectively) the country histories reveal. Some of these are documented in the literature while

others merit considerable further study. These “big picture” themes include: The repeated-game

nature of sovereign debt crises and the fact serial default is commonplace among today’s

commentary, as even a causal perusal of the charts display this historical pattern. The serial

II) is equally compelling. Nearly all of the 21 advanced economies in the sample record an

impressive crisis tally, especially from the 1880s to the 1930s. The episodes where there are

surges in private debt before the crisis and public debts after the crisis are not only numerous but

span across advanced and emerging economies in nearly all regions. And so on…

         The last section discusses where there are gaps in the data and overall analysis of the

debt-crisis cycle. As such, it is a roadmap for future research,



                                II. Key to Charts and Methodology Notes

    For working definitions of banking, currency, debt, and inflation crises, see the extensive

discussion in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a and 2010). As to the crises highlighted in the country

profiles, our focus is on primarily external sovereign default (also its less common counterpart--

domestic sovereign default) and banking crises. Many countries have a rich history of recurring

(and often chronic) exchange rate crashes and inflation crises, particularly (but not exclusively) in

post World War II Latin America. We only provide limited information on these recurring follies

in monetary history.2 We do include, highlight and date all hyperinflation episodes, as these have

been associated with the complete or near complete liquidation (through de facto default) of

domestic currency debts.

Key to charts

    Besides the events discussed above, in a few charts we highlight “near- default” episodes,

which involve some form of international assistance to avoid a default or a restructuring. Their

dates are also listed in the first column of the accompanying table. Some examples of sub-

  In the tables that accompany each country profile, we do provide, as summary statistic on inflation crises,
the share of years with annual inflation above 20 per cent per annum. This inflation performance also gives
a reasonable indication of the incidence of currency crashes,

sovereign defaults (by states or provinces) are also flagged. In a few charts, historic currency

crashes (such as the collapse of an 80-year old peg) are highlighted as well. More mundane

episodes of inflation and currency crises are not shown. However, the full sample incidence

(share of years) in an inflation crisis, is reported in the table below the chart, so as to provide

information on chronic inflation problems. 3 The major output collapses shown in the tables that

accompany the charts and the numerous IMF progams since 1952 (listed as a memorandum item

at the bottom of the table) are not depicted in the figures, to avoid compromising clarity.

Insets of smaller tables and charts into the figures

        Insets are used throughout to provide complementary information to that shown in the

main figure. For example, for many advanced economies, an inset plots for household credit to

GDP from the mid-1990s to the present to highlight trends in private debts ahead of the 2007-

2008 crisis. In other cases, these insets provide information on the maturity composition of the

debt (public or private, as the case may be) on the eve of a banking crisis be it default or

hyperinflation. The distribution of public and private debt before and after a crisis also provide

documentation of the numerous crisis cases where the government assumed important quantities

of private debts.

Descriptive statistics in the tables to each country

        Descriptive statistics are mostly self-explanatory, but two particulars merit explanation.

The first year of banking crises are listed and those shown in italics indicate that the episode in

question was not deemed to be a systemic crisis. Near default episodes are also shown in italics

and not counted in the tally of default. The last column provides information on the largest annual

output declines, usually the top five, but more or less when relevant. Both the year and the

percent decline (in parentheses) are given. For full output collapse episodes, the interested reader

is referred to Barro and Ursua (2009).

        The bottom portion of the table gives memorandum items on IMF programs with the

country over the period from 1952 to 2009. The first year of the program is listed as well as the

total number of programs. The relevant sources are discussed below.

Debt ratios

    Debt is usually shown as a percent of GDP and in a few cases as a percent of exports. In a

handful of cases we have debt data for the earlier part of the 19th century but no GDP or trade

measure to scale the debt data by. In those few cases, we show changes in debt (often over three

years) to provide an indication of the debt cycle. The nominal GDP data comes from numerous

scholars as well as official statistical sources. For a number of developing countries we have

more data on exports than for GDP (in all cases we have post World War II nominal GDP data).

In these cases the charts show the actual debt/GDP ratio for the period during which GDP data is

available (say post 1920s) and use the debt/exports ratio times the average export to GDP ratio

(for the period during which both series overlap) to back-cast the series.

References and sources

    Most charts list the main source as Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), which has an extensive data

appendices listing sources series-by-series and country-by-country over different subperiods.

Additional sources listed below each graph usually indicate that we came across these sources

subsequent to the publication. Prominent examples of the recent discoveries include: detailed

Netherlands, and Klas Fregert and Roger Gustafsson for Sweden.) As the sample was extended

to include Bulgaria, Ghana, Iceland, Ireland, and Switzerland, pertinent sources for these are also

listed in the relevant country page. Finally, the sources for the IMF programs are Bird, Hussain

and Joyce (2004), Mody and Saravia (2009), and the IMF’s Annual Reports for several years to

update these studies through 2009.



                                III. Debt and Crises: Main Themes

This section highlights some of the issues where the collective evidence from the country

histories are particularly illuminating. Throughout, I use country examples or specific crises

episodes to illustrate particular points.

         (i) Serial default is a widespread phenomenon across emerging markets and several

advanced economies. Figures 8a and 26 for Brazil and Greece, respectively (among many more

that are similar) call attention to this point by simply shading the years in default throughout the

sample; the summary table also lists the timing and duration of each default spell while the tally

entry (bottom of column 1) reports the default tally for 1800-2009. Countries such as France and

pain have a higher count if pre-1800 default episodes are counted.

        (ii) Prior to World War II, serial banking crises in the advanced economies was the

norm; as the larger emerging markets developed a financial sector in the late 1800s—these

economies joined the “serial banking” crisis club. Country histories for Belgium (Figure 6),

Canada (Figure 10a) among others, illustrate this pattern. The world financial centers (the UK,

Figure 65a and the US Figure 66a) take the lead in serial banking crises. One can speculate that

the less-developed economies substitute foreign bankers for nonexistent domestic ones. As such,

when acute sovereign fiscal difficulties arise, these become manifest in serial external default

rather than serial domestic banking crises.

                                                                                           Chartbook 2010

        (iii) In light of serial debt and banking crises (not to mention chronic currency and price

instability), it is not surprising to see a similar serial pattern in the incidence of IMF programs.

Peru and the Philippines set the record with 24 and 23 programs, respectively. However, IMF

programs were not always in the exclusive domain of emerging markets. During the 1950s-

1970s, the IMF was more like the discount window of a central bank and did not carry the stigma

it of the default or near default cases. Among the advanced economies, the U.K. holds the record

with 11 programs.4

        (iv) Private debts typically surge prior to a banking crises. This pattern is evident in

total external debt (a stock), capital inflow bonanzas (a flow), domestic banking sector credit (a

stock), or any combination of these. 5 Public debts may or may not surge ahead of banking

crises. Indeed, especially in financial repression cases the governments efforts to stuff its debts in

“captive “ bank balance sheets Procyclical fiscal policies, where the government amplifies the

boom-bust cycle in total debt (as documented in Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh, 2003), all too

often re-enforce the boom in private indebtedness ahead of the banking crisis.

        For external debts, see Figures 30b and 62a for Iceland and Thailand, respectively.

Surges in capital inflows do not last forever. When they end, countries often display the Calvo-

type sudden stop syndrome, even in crises of an earlier century in advanced economies. 6 The

U.S. experience during 1865-1913, shown in Figure 68b, exemplifies this behavior. Domestic

credit climbs sharply prior to the banking crisis an unwinds afterward—the examples form

banking in Colombia (Figure 12b) and Norway (Figure 47b) demonstrate this time profile. By

contrast, the famous (or infamous) lost decade and bank debt overhang in post 1992 crisis Japan

is evident from Figure 34b. The coverage on domestic credit boom in this Chartbook is not

intended to be as comprehensive as public and external debt—the primary focus. However, the

                                                                                         Chartbook 2010

pattern alluded to here is strongly supported by the evidence from studies that have focused

primarily on the domestic credit cycle. The most comprehensive in terms of country coverage is

Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who find most booms are followed by currency crises, banking

crises or both. The smaller country set for the 1880-2008 period studied in Schularick and Taylor

(2010) presents similar findings.7

        (v) Banking crises most often either precede or coincide with sovereign debt crises. To

be clear, we are referring to “domestic” banking crises, the issue of whether banking crises in the

financial centers precede domestic banking crises and or sovereign defaults or restructurings is

examined in some detail in Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). The reasons for this temporal sequence

may be the contingent liability story emphasized by Diaz Alejandro (1985) and formalized in

Velasco (1986), in which the government takes on massive debts from the private banks, thus

undermining its solvency.8 Even absent large scale bailouts (and without counting the post-crisis

new government guarantees) , Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) establish that, largely owing to

collapsing revenues, government debts typically rise by about 86 percent in the three years

following a systemic financial crisis, this sets the stage for rating downgrades and, in the worst

scenario, default.

        The list of country examples of this sequencing is too long to enumerate, we would

highlight as illustrative, the Barings 1891 crisis in Argentina (Figure 3b), Austria’s banking crisis

in 1931 and subsequent default in 1932 (Figure 5a) and Indonesia’s 1997-1998 banking crisis and

1999-2000 default (Figure 32a).

        (vi) Public debts follow a repeated boom-bust cycle; many (if not most) of the bust

phase involved a debt crisis in emerging markets. Public sector borrowing surges as the crisis

nears. Debts continue to rise after default, as arrears accumulate and GDP contracts markedly.9


7
  Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) and Gourinchas et.al. (2001) also document for different samples this
boom-crisis-bust pattern.

  See Arellano and Kocherlakota (2008) for a framework that is consistent with these dynamics.

  See Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) on evidence on output behavior before during and after debt crises.

                                                                                       Chartbook 2010

If there is an exchange rate crash associated with default, as shown in Reinhart (2002), the

valuation effect on external debts also contributes to further increase in debt/GDP ratios.

           The boom-bust episodes are very numerous cutting across regions and time. The crisis

episode in Figure 69 for Zambia illustrates the pre-crisis surge in public debt—as well as its

continued climb in the early stage of default.

       (vii) As suggested in the Diamond and Dybvig’s famous framework of banking crises, short-

term debts (public and private) escalate on the eve of banking crisis and sovereign defaults. 10

This pattern is also consistent with He and Xiong’s (2010) setting, where creditors' incentives to

shorten debt maturity to protect themselves against runs by other creditors. Most famously,

Mexico ramped up its short-term debt issuance just in advance of its “Tesobonos” crisis in 1994

as in Figure 40b. In the march toward hyperinflation, long-term debts disappear altogether; the

German hyperinflation of 1923-1924 (Figure 22a) demonstrates these dynamics.

       (viii) Private debts become public debts-after the crisis. Several examples from the debt

crisis that engulfed Latin America in the early 1980s and lasted a decade are documented in

various insets that document the rising share of private “hidden debts” carrying implicit

government guarantees (Figure 62a for Thailand, among others) (Figure 19a for Ecuador, for

example). 11

Notes: An interesting anecdote on sub-sovereign debt from correspondence with Huw McKay (who also
refered us to Butlin’s work, which dates the earliest banking crises.. During the great depression, the left
wing government of the largest state in Australia, New South Wales, voted to default on its foreign debt,
only to be over-ruled by the Federal Government. Only systemic banking crises are shown.

Notes: For 1824-1945, public external debt; for 1946-2009 external debt is the aggregate of public and
private debts. Only the major banking crises are shown. There are a total of 9 default episodes but only 8
shaded regions, as two episodes occur in consecutive years (see table below). Only systemic banking crises
are shown.

Notes: For the period 1973-1989 the data is for external public debt for general government, this
underestimates public indebtedness, as it does not include domestic (or internal) debts—at the same time
general government is more inclusive than our central government measure. These two effects are working
in opposite directions.
