                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we specify a dynamic programming model that addresses the interplay among health,
financial resources, and the labor market behavior of men in the later part of their working lives. Unlike
previous work which has typically used self reported health or disability status as a proxy for health
status, we model health as a latent variable, using self reported disability status as an indicator of this
latent construct. Our model is explicitly designed to account for the possibility that the reporting of
disability may be endogenous to the labor market behavior we are studying. The model is estimated
using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We compare results based on our model to results
based on models that treat health in the typical way, and find large differences in the estimated effect
of health on behavior. While estimates based on our model suggest that health has a large impact on
behavior, the estimates suggest a substantially smaller role for health than we find when using standard
techniques. We use our model to simulate the impact on behavior of raising the normal retirement
age, eliminating early retirement altogether and eliminating the Social Security Disability Insurance
program.

Section 1. Introduction

    Population aging and other challenges to public and private pension financing highlight the

importance of understanding the determinants of retirement behavior. Much of the recent research on

the labor force behavior of older workers has focused on the effects of financial incentives such as

Social Security and private pensions, generally showing that these incentives have powerful behavioral

effects (e.g., Blinder, et al., 1980; Burkhauser and Quinn, 1983; Diamond and Hausman, 1984; Stock

and Wise, 1990; Rust and Phelan, 1997; Gruber and Wise, 1999, 2004; Gustman and Steinmeier, 1986,

2000, 2005). Additionally, a substantial amount of research has focused on the effects of the

availability of both privately and publicly provided health insurance on retirement behavior (Rust and

Phelan, 1997; Gustman and Steinmeier, 1994; Blau and Gilleskie, 2001a, 2006, Forthcoming). At the

same time, econometric studies of retirement behavior have provided strong evidence for the

importance of health factors (e.g., Quinn, 1977; Gordon and Blinder, 1980; Burkhauser and Quinn,

1983; Diamond and Hausman, 1984; Gustman and Steinmeier, 1986; Quinn et al., 1990; Rust and

Phelan, 1997; Bound et al., 1999; Blau and Gilleskie, 2001b). Indeed, in analyses using Census data

we found that more than half of men and one third of women who leave the labor force before reaching

the Social Security early retirement age of 62 report that health limits their capacity to work (Bound

et al., 1997).

    However, as several reviews have noted, important questions remain regarding the magnitude of

the effect of health on labor market behavior (Chirikos, 1993; Lumsdaine and Mitchell, 1999; Currie

and Madrian, 1999). Moreover, except for early work by Quinn (1977) and research focusing

specifically on the effects of changes in Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) on the work force

attachment of older men (e.g., Parsons, 1980; Halpern and Hausman, 1986; Bound, 1989; Haveman

et al., 1991; Bound and Waidmann, 1992, 2002; Kreider 1999a; Kreider and Riphahn, 2000), no one

has studied the effect of the availability of financial resources on the relationship between health and

retirement. This despite the likelihood that health and financial factors interact in affecting retirement




                                                    1
decisions -- that is, deteriorating health will tend to make continued work less attractive, but

individuals will tend to retire only if they have sufficient financial resources.

    More fundamentally, previous longitudinal retirement research has suffered from limited measures

of health, relying heavily on global measures such as self-rated work limitations and self-rated health.

There are a number of potential problems with such survey measures: (1) they are discrete, whereas

the construct researchers are interested in measuring is presumably continuous; (2) they are

presumably error ridden, since not everyone will use the same scale when responding to survey

questions; and (3) they are likely to be endogenous to retirement decisions, since it seems plausible

that responses to these global questions will be related to labor market status. 1

    In this paper we use methods designed to address all three of these problems. We use both the

global and the more detailed health measures available on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)

within the context of latent variable models. This approach can be thought of as using the detailed

health measures available on the HRS to instrument the global measures. We find that the choice of

how we model health is substantively important. To preview our results, our estimates confirm the

central role health plays in the early retirement behavior of men. Indeed, we estimate the rate of labor

force exit before the age of 62 to be 5 times as great for those in poor health than it is for those in

average health.        Importantly, however, we found that using the standard (binary) model of health

would overstate the magnitude of this effect. At the same time, our simulations suggest that the

availability of financial resources also plays an important role in determining behavior. In particular,

we find that a large fraction of those who leave the workforce in poor health before the age of 62 apply

for DI. Consistent with other estimates in the literature, our estimates imply that the DI application


1
 The potential endogeneity of self-rated work limitations or health has received a good deal of attention in the literature (e.g.
Parsons, 1982; Myers, 1982; Anderson and Burkhauser, 1984, 1985; Bound, 1991; Waidmann et al.,1995). Indeed,
compelling evidence indicates that responses to such questions depend not just on health, but also on features of the
individual’s social and economic environment. Bound and Waidmann (1992, 2002) demonstrate that the fraction of working
aged men in the U.S. who are out of work and identify themselves as limited in their capacity for work tracks the fraction
receiving Social Security Disability benefits quite closely, rising in the 1970s, falling in the 1980s, and rising again in the
1990s. Bound and Waidmann argue that the most plausible interpretation of these findings is that exogenous changes in the
availability of disability benefits induced a change in reporting behavior. Waidmann et al. (1995) report similar trends for
a range of other health measures, including self-reports of overall health and specific chronic conditions.


                                                               2
decision is quite sensitive to benefit levels. Even so, our estimates suggest that seemingly dramatic

changes to Social Security rules-increasing the normal retirement age or eliminating the early

retirement benefit--would have small spill over effects on the DI program. The reason is simple: most

men in their 60s are too healthy to qualify for DI.

   Similar approaches to modeling health have been used by other researchers in both cross-sectional

(Kreider, 1999a) and longitudinal studies (Lindeboom and Kerkhofs, 2004; Disney et al., 2006).

However, to our knowledge no one has embedded such modeling into the kind of dynamic

programming models that are currently state of the art for modeling retirement behavior. This is the

approach that we take in this paper.

   For our method to yield valid results, responses to the more detailed measures available on the

HRS must be exogenous to labor market behavior. While many researchers have worked with the

presumption that the more specific health measures available on the HRS are less susceptible to the

kinds of problems we have discussed, these measures may not be completely immune. We discuss

evidence below that suggests to us that these measures are, indeed, exogenous. The latent variable

model we use is computationally intensive, which may explain why other researchers have continued

to use the global health measures available on the HRS. For this reason, it seems important to know

whether our model yields answers that are substantially different from those we obtain if we follow

the standard practice of simply including discrete health indicators in our behavioral models, and thus

we include estimates from both approaches.

   Researchers increasingly view retirement as a process rather than a single event (Honig and

Hanoch, 1985; Honig, 1985; Quinn et al., 1990; Ruhm, 1990; Quinn and Kozy, 1996; Quinn, 1997,

2000). While poor health induces many individuals to leave the work force altogether, it may induce

others to merely change jobs or find ways to accommodate their limitation on their current job. A more

general literature on the adaptations that older adults make in response to deteriorating health indicates

that ceasing to perform an activity is often the response of last resort (Baltes and Baltes, 1990; Brim,

1988). Before this occurs, older adults will expend increased effort, allow more time, and reduce



                                                      3
performance standards in order to perform the activity. However, to date very little research has

attempted to model the effect of health on labor force transitions other than retirement. 2

    As far as we know, with the exception of work in progress by Rust and his colleagues (Rust,

Benitez-Silva, Buchinsky 2001), we are the only researchers modeling retirement behavior to

distinguish the application for DI benefits from other modes of labor force exit. Doing so seems crucial

because: (a) our estimates suggest that, of those in poor health, the number that apply for disability

is greater than the number that simply leave the workforce, and (b) the financial incentives involved

in the two behaviors are quite different.

    In our modeling and estimation to this point we have focused on single men nearing retirement age

during the 1990s. We focus on single individuals to avoid the very significant complication arising

from trying to model the joint labor supply decisions of married men and women. While, as a result,

our sample is not representative of the population, we believe that we can learn a considerable amount

by examining the behavior of this group. 3

    In section 2 we describe our dynamic programming (DP) model and the methods that we use to

solve the value functions that are the key inputs into our estimation procedure. In Section 3 we

describe the estimation methods we use. In Section 4 we present parameter estimates and simulations

which highlight important aspects and implications of our model. Additionally we compare results

based on our model to results that simply use self reported work limitations as the measure of health.

In Section 5 we conclude.




2
 Exceptions include Honig and Reimers (1987), who find little association between poor health and the move from full-time
work to partial retirement in their analysis of Retirement History Survey data; Blau and Gilleskie (2001a), who find that the
effect of health on the probability that a person changes jobs is much smaller than its effect on labor force exit (using HRS
data); and Bound et al. (1999), who find that poor health is a significant predictor of labor force exit -- particularly of exit
combined with application for DI -- and of job change among people who choose to stay in the labor market.
3
 We focus on men because we do not have reliable information on the financial incentives facing single women. Their
Social Security Benefits will often depend on their ex-husbands earnings, something we do not have information on. Further,
while 39 members (20%) of our baseline behavioral sample do marry during the observation period, we ignore this
possibility in the choice set.

                                                               4
Section 2. Model Specification and Solution

Model and Estimation Overview

   We model the behavior of males who are working as of a “baseline” time (t=0) which corresponds

to the first wave (1992) of the Health and Retirement Study. The basic behavioral model is a dynamic

programming model in which individuals take into account that current period decisions may have

substantial effects on their future utility. Central to this model is a set of current period utility

equations that allows a person to construct the expected lifetime utility, or value, that he will receive

from each option that he considers in each year that he makes a decision.

   The solution of the value functions and the estimation of the parameters of these “behavioral”

equations is complicated by our desire to address two issues. First, those who are working at our

baseline time period are a select group of individuals.         For example, from the standpoint of

understanding the effects of health on behavior, it is possible that the individuals in poor health who

are still working at t=0 have unobserved characteristics and preferences regarding work that are on

average different from those of individuals who are in poor health at time t=0 but are no longer

working. Second, although our model posits that individuals make decisions based on actual health,

as mentioned earlier, it is self-reported health that is observed in our data.

   We address the former concern by adding a reduced form initial conditions equation that describes

whether a person is working at our baseline time period. Following Bound (1991) we address the latter

concern by adding a latent health equation that formally describes the relationship between self-

reported health, health reporting error, and true health. The presence of these additional equations has

several practical implications that increase the difficulty of the solution and estimation of our model.

First, in order for the additional equations to serve their purpose, our estimation procedure must allow

correlations between certain unobservables that appear in the initial conditions equation, the health

equation, and the behavioral equations. Our use of a multivariate normal distribution, which allows

these correlations, implies that closed form solutions do not exist for integrals that are needed to

compute value functions or for the likelihood contributions that serve as inputs into the Maximum



                                                    5
Likelihood algorithm that is used for estimation. Second, our health framework produces a continuous

measure of true health that is serially correlated over time, a well-known challenge for researchers

employing dynamic, discrete choice estimation methods (Stinebrickner 2000). These issues, when

combined with our desire to include unobserved heterogeneity, our use of up to six years of observed

choices in addition to the initial condition, and our need to include a non-trivial number of state

variables other than health, imply that the computational burden of solving and estimating our model

is very high.

    In this section we describe the behavioral portion of our model and the methods used to solve value

functions given the presence of the serially correlated health variable. This discussion implicitly

assumes that the true health of each individual is known at each point that a person makes a decision.

 In reality, true health is not observed. In Section 3, we describe the modifications that we make to

our model to address this issue and the sample selection/initial conditions issue, and we describe the

estimation method that we implement to deal with the non-standard features of our model.

2.1 Choice Set

    Each individual has a finite decision horizon beginning at year t=1 (1993) and ending at year t=T. 4

At each time t, an individual chooses an activity state from a finite set of mutually exclusive

alternatives D t. D t d {C, B, N, A} where C is the option of remaining in the person’s career job (defined

to be the job that the person held at baseline, t=0), B is the option of accepting a bridge job (defined

to be a job other than the job held at baseline), A is the option of leaving the workforce and applying

for Disability Insurance, and N is the option of leaving the workforce without applying for Disability

Insurance (often referred to hereafter as the “non-work” option). Let d j(t)=1 if option j is chosen (j=C,

B, N, A) at time t and zero otherwise.

    At any time t<T, a person can choose any of the options in the set {C, B, N, and A} unless it is

ruled out by one or more of the following two assumptions. First, we assume that a person imagines

that he will not return to his career job in the future if he leaves his career job in any year t.                        With


4
 In practice, we assume that T is the year that the person turns 70 years old. After year T, individuals are assumed to remain
out of the workforce for the remainder of their lives. We assume that all individuals die by the age of 100.

                                                              6
respect to this assumption, we allow for both the possibility that a person could leave his career job by

choice and the possibility that a person may get exogenously displaced from his career job for a reason

such as a plant closing. Notationally, we let L(t) be an indicator of whether a person who is working

in a career job at time t-1 gets exogenously displaced before time t. Second, we assume that a person

imagines that, if he applies for Disability Insurance and is approved for benefits, he will remain out of

the workforce (i.e., he will be in option N) and collect his Disability Insurance payments for the

remainder of his life. Notationally, we let DI(t) indicate whether a person has been approved for

disability benefits as of time t. A person can apply for Disability Insurance if he is less than the normal

retirement age for Social Security Retirement Benefits (65 for most of our sample). 5 These assumptions

imply that sufficient to characterize the choice set D t is the person’s age at t, the person’s choice at t-1,

whether the person becomes displaced from his career job between time t-1 and time t if he was

working in his career job at time t-1, and whether the person has been approved for Disability Insurance

at any time in the past.

    This choice set implies that we do not formally model an individual’s optimal consumption/savings

decision. Rather, consistent with much previous research in the dynamic, discrete choice literature we

assume that a person consumes all of his “income” in year t. 6 In Appendix E we describe the tradeoff

between approximation quality and model “size” that influenced our decision not to expand the choice

set to model the consumption/savings decision (and other endogenous decisions). Instead we view

pension wealth, non-pension wealth, Social Security earnings, Disability Insurance payments, and other


5
 For this and other elements of the choice set, we carefully follow the eligibility and benefit rules of the Social Security Old-
Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program. See the Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin (SSA
2007) for details.
6
 In recent work, researchers have begun to introduce savings into dynamic programing models of retirement (e.g., French,
2005; van der Klaauw and Wolpin, 2005; Rust, Buchinsky and Benitez-Silva, 2001; French and Jones, 2007). Doing so
requires treating savings as a continuous state variable and consumption as a continuous choice variable which significantly
complicates estimation. In all these cases the authors have treated health as an exogenous discrete state variable. In contrast,
we treat health as a continuous state variable and allow for the potential endogenous reporting of health status, but ignore
savings. While adding savings as a state variable and consumption as a choice variable is possible from a conceptual
standpoint, in practice this change in our specification would make our model intractable at its current level of approximation
quality. Given our interest in the interplay among health, financial resources, and the labor market behavior, we believe our
choice to carefully model health was a reasonable one. In fact, those in poor health tend to have relatively little in the way
of savings. Thus, for example, amongst those that identify themselves as having a limitation that effects their capacity for
work in our sample, median non-housing wealth is under eleven thousand dollars at baseline.

                                                               7
entitlements as sources of income and attempt to make reasonable assumptions about the timing of the

income from these sources in cases where the timing is not immediately obvious from institutional

details.

      Our specification of the opportunity set implies that an individual applying for Social Security

Disability benefits will incur financial costs. For the year of application he will forgo all earnings.

Further, if his application is rejected, he will not be able to return to his previous job which will tend

to represent a loss of income since earnings on bridge jobs are typically lower than earnings in career

jobs. These costs vary across the population. Those with little in the way of income outside of

earnings will lose a greater proportion of their total income during the year they apply for disability

benefits, and, as a result, will suffer a larger loss in utility if utility is not linear in consumption. In

addition, those in high paying jobs stand to lose more by applying both because disability benefits are

paid on a progressive schedule and because those with high paying jobs are likely to suffer a larger loss

if they give up their career job for a bridge job.

2.2 Current Period Rewards

      The current period reward in any year t, R j(t), contains all of the benefits and costs associated with

alternative j; R j(t) is the sum of the utility from consumption,          , and the non-pecuniary utility,

        , that the person receives from option j at time t.

      2.2.1 Utility from Consumption,

      Defining Y j(t) to be the person’s total income net of expenditures on health care if he chooses

option j at time t, the individual’s utility from consumption is assumed to be of the form

(1)                          for j 0 {C,B,N,A}

where 2 determines the level of risk aversion and J (along with parameters in the non-pecuniary utility

equation (2) that will be discussed in Section 2.2.2) is used to determine the importance of utility from

consumption relative to non-pecuniary utility.

      A benefit of the HRS is that it allows us to capture in detail how expenditures on health care and

income vary across the possible options j. For option j at time t, Y j(t) is the sum of income from



                                                      8
earnings, Social Security entitlements, defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans,

Disability Insurance payments, non-pension wealth, food stamps, 7 Supplemental Security Income, and

other exogenous sources of income (such as veteran benefits) minus expenditures on health care. In

Appendix A.2 we discuss in general terms our timing assumptions related to the receipt of income from

these sources and later in Section 2.3.2 (and in Appendix A.3) we provide detail about modelling and

computation issues related to these sources. At this point it is worth noting that the reason that we can

take full advantage of the detail about these incomes sources in the HRS is that, unlike much other

work using the types of models employed here, we solve our model separately for each person in our

sample.

    All incomes are converted to 1992 dollars. The concept of income we use is after tax income. To

this end we subtract off from our estimate of gross income both the worker’s share of the payroll tax

and a piecewise linear approximation of the individual’s federal income tax obligations. 8

    While the approach we use for modeling the effect of the availability of health insurance is now

common in the literature (Rust and Phelan, 1997; French and Jones, 2007; Blau and Gilleskie, 2006),

using it implies that we are treating health care utilization as exogenous. 9 Indeed, the observed

difference in out of pocket health care expenditures between those that do and do not have health

insurance almost surely represents an underestimate of the value individuals put on the availability of

health insurance benefits. In an attempt to mitigate the bias that this underestimation introduces in the

estimates of our behavioral equations in Section 2.2.2, we allow the availability of employer provided

health insurance benefits to have a direct effect on an individual’s utility.




7
 When imputing food stamp benefits, we use our estimate of what the individual would be eligible for. This effectively puts
a floor on income.
8
 Using 1992 dollars, we assume the income tax rate is 0 up to $5280, 0.1851 between $5280 and $34600, 0.3354 between
$34600 and $80863, 0.3689 between $80863 and $127600, 0.4215 between $127600 and $214000 and 0.4636 above
$214000. For the purpose of computing taxes we use only a portion of the Social Security Retirement or Disability benefits
a person is receiving.
9
 As far as we know the only researchers who have tried to endogenize health care utilization decisions within the context
of retirement models are Blau and Gilleskie (Forthcoming). Similar to what we find, they find that the availability of retiree
health insurance seems to have little effect on retirement behavior.

                                                              9
      2.2.2. Non-Pecuniary Utility,

      We assume that the nonpecuniary utility                    associated with an option j is a linear function of

a person’s time t health 0 t, an indicator HI j(t) of whether the person has either private health insurance

or medicare at time t if he chooses option j, exogenous observable characteristics of the individual X(t),

and a set of other transitory factors ( , tj) unobserved by the econometrician (but known to the individual

in the current period) that measure the person’s particular circumstances and outlook in year t. In

addition, we allow individuals to have unobserved, permanent differences in their preferences for work

by including a person-specific, permanent heterogeneity term 6 that enters the non-pecuniary utility

associated with the work options C and B, i.e., κ C=κ B=κ and κ N= κ A=0.


 (2)




Thus, in addition to allowing health to have effects on net income, our model allows decisions to have

non-pecuniary costs which depend on a person’s health. 10

      We choose N as the base case of our discrete choice model which implies that we normalize the

coefficients        and        to zero and interpret            j=C,B,A as the effect of X on the utility of option

option N. To summarize,

2.3 Discounted Expected Utility - Value Functions

      2.3.1 Specification of Value Functions




10
   Given the way we have specified a person’s alternatives, a person who applies for DI will receive non-pecuniary utility
of         in the year that he applies. If accepted he is assumed to remain out of the workforce and receive non-pecuniary
utility of         for the remainder of his life. Thus, for example,   indicates, in part, how the cost or stigma of taking part
in the DI application process varies with health.

                                                              10
      Letting S(t) represent the set of all state variables at time t, the expected present value of lifetime

rewards associated with any option j 0 {C,B,N,A} that is available at time t can be represented by a

standard Bellman equation (Bellman 1957):

(4)       V j(t, S(t))=R j(S(t)) + $ (S(t)) @ E[V(t+1,S(t+1))|S(t),d j(t)=1]

where                                                                                      .

      We have written D t+1 as a function of d j(t) and S(t+1) because, as discussed earlier, a person’s

choice set at time t+1 depends on the person’s choice at t, the person’s age at time t+1, whether the

person becomes displaced from his career job between time t and time t+1 if he was working in his

career job at time t, and whether the person has been approved for Disability Insurance at any time in

the past.

      $ is the one period discount factor which varies across people and across time for a particular

person.      Specifically, we assume that for person i at time t, $ depends on a factor $ Common that is

common across people and on the probability that person i will be alive at time t+1:

(5)       $ = $ Common @ Pr(Alive at t+1|Alive at t). 11

      We assume that the probability of dying between t and t+1 depends on the respondent’s age and his

health at t, 0 t. This probability is computed using a discrete-time proportional hazard model. The

baseline hazard, which represents the probability of dying at a particular age conditional on not dying

before that age, is computed using life table survival probabilities for U.S. men obtained from the

Social Security Administration. Health shifts the baseline hazard in a proportional fashion. 12

      2.3.2 State Variables

      The set of state variables at time t, S(t), includes all variables that provide information about the

set of choices that will be available in the current and future periods, the discount factor, or the utility

associated with all choices that may be available in the current and future periods. The information



11
  This specification implies that the value of death is zero so that people have no bequest motive.

12
 The amount of the shift is estimated outside of our behavioral model using information on the subsequent mortality of our
HRS sample together with a health index that is the same as the one used in our behavioral models. See Appendix A.4 for
details.

                                                            11
that influences future choices and the discount factor was described in Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1

respectively. In the next two subsections we focus on the state variables that influence either non-

pecuniary or pecuniary utility -                         or           .

      State variables that influence non-pecuniary utility

      Equation (2), indicates that non-pecuniary utility at time t is determined by X(t), , (t), 6 , 0 t, and

HI(t) where , (t) f {                         } is the vector of , ’s from all of the current period utility equations that

are relevant in time t given a person’s choice set.                       X which includes, for example, a constant and a

person’s educational level, is predetermined and known to the agent and econometrician for all periods.

The permanent, person-specific, unobserved heterogeneity value, 6 , is known to the individual but is

unobserved to the econometrician. We assume that, in the population, 6 - N(0, F 26) where F 6, which

determines the importance of unobserved heterogeneity, is a parameter to be estimated. , (t) is observed

by the individual but not by the econometrician at time t. Both the econometrician and individual know

the distribution of , in future periods. We assume that , tj- N(0,1), j=C,B,A,N and that E( , tj, , rk)=0 if

j … k or t … r. 13

      A person’s health, 0 , is exogenously determined but correlated across time. We assume that health

at time t depends on demographic characteristics in X(t), including a person’s age. Based on evidence

in Bound et al. (1999), we assume that the portion of health that remains after removing the effect of

X(t) in each period follows an AR(1) process:

(6)        0 t+1= D ( 0 t - B X t) + B X t+1 + > t+1

where > t+1 - N(0, F 2>) œ t. Given a current period value of health, both the agent and econometrician can

use equation (6) to compute the distribution of health in all future periods. However, while the agent

knows his current health, the econometrician observes only a noisy, self-reported health measure. The

manner in which we deal with this data problem is an estimation issue which we discuss in detail in

Section 3.




13
  Normalizing the variance implies that a constant can be estimated as part of            in equation (3).

                                                                 12
     Finally, at time t a person’s beliefs about his health insurance status at time t+1, HI(t+1), is

determined by the health insurance characteristics of his career job (which we denote HI C), the health

insurance characteristics of his bridge job at time t if he is working in a bridge job at time t (which we

denote HI B(t)), and the person’s age at t+1. We identify the health insurance associated with the career

job to be one of three types: HI C =3 if the insurance plan covers the worker while he is working on his

career job and also provides retiree health insurance which covers him after he leaves the job; HI C =2

if the insurance plan covers the worker while he is working on his career job but does not provide

retiree coverage; HI C =1 if the person has no health insurance on his career job.                            Primarily for

computational reasons, we assume that bridge jobs do not have retiree health insurance. Thus, there

are only two possible characterizations for HI B(t): HI B(t) =2 if the insurance plan covers the worker

while he is working on his bridge job and HI B(t)=1 if a person does not work in a bridge job in time

t or works in a bridge job that does not have health insurance.

     We assume that at time t a person believes he will have health insurance at future time t+1 if any

of the following conditions are true: 1). HI C=3; 2). d C(t+1)=1 and (HI C=2 or HI C=3); 3). d B(t+1)=1

and HI B(t)=2; 4). Age(t+1) $ 65; or 5) DI(t)=1. The first condition indicates that a person with retiree

health insurance on his career job believes that he will always have health insurance. The second

condition identifies a person who is still working in a career job which has health insurance. The third

condition indicates that a person who has health insurance in a bridge job imagines that he will

continue to have health insurance if he remains in a bridge job in the next period. The fourth condition

is present because everyone who has turned 65 years of age receives medicare. The last condition

shows that, if approved for Disability insurance, individuals begin to receive medicare benefits (after

a waiting period). 14 In addition, we assume that a person who is working in a bridge job without health

insurance at time t or has chosen an option other than the bridge option at time t believes that there is




14
  This is a rough approximation of the reality that individuals receive Medicare benefits 24 months after starting Disability
Insurance benefits.

                                                            13
                                                                                                                     15
some probability that the bridge offer he receives in time t+1 will include health insurance.                             In

addition, we allow any person who has employer provided health insurance at time t but not at time t+1

to buy COBRA insurance at time t+1. 16

     Then, to summarize, at time t the state variables that influence non-pecuniary utility are {X(t), , (t),

6 , 0 t , HI C, and HI B(t)}.

     State variables that influence income

     Some of the variables that influence non-pecuniary utility also provide information about current

and future income levels Y j, j=C, B, N, A. For example, the specification of the health expenditure

equation in Appendix A.3.1 indicates that X(t), 0 t, HI C, HI B(t), and DI(t) all influence health

expenditures at time t.

     In addition, some new state variables are needed to represent a person’s information about income.

For example, income calculations depend in part on a set of baseline variables, & , that describe

everything about a person’s financial situation, previous work history, and earnings potential when the

person arrives at t=1. This set of baseline variables describes exogenous sources of income (such as

veterans benefits) and also contains information about a person’s wealth at time t=1. In addition,

because & contains information about a person’s complete SS earnings history as of time t=1 and the

specific details that characterize an individual’s defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans,

it also plays an important role in determining the income that would be received from the remaining

sources of income described in Section 2.2.1: earnings, the SS and DI systems, and DB and DC pension

plans. Below we describe the state variables that are needed (in addition to & ) to characterize what a

person knows about the income from each of these sources. More detail on modelling and computation

issues related to these sources is presented in Appendix A3.

     The earnings equations are given in Appendix A.3.2. Earnings in career jobs depend on a fixed

effect (which can be viewed as an element of & ) and a transitory component R Ct. Earnings in bridge


15
  We assume that this probability is .20 for a person who is working in a bridge job without health insurance at time t and
is .67 for a person who has chosen an option other than the bridge job option in time t.
16
  We assume that the cost of this coverage is $1000.

                                                           14
jobs are allowed to vary with a person’s baseline earnings in his career job W CO (which is contained in

& ), a transitory component R Bt, and the age at which a person left his career job. Notationally, we let

R (t) d {       } be the vector of transitory earnings shocks that are relevant at time t given a person’s

choice set. Sufficient for knowing the age at which a person left his career job is the person’s age at

baseline (contained in X) and the number of years of experience that the person worked in his career

job as of time t (which we refer to as EXC(t)). 17

     A person’s SS benefits at some future year t* depend on his 35 highest years of labor earnings, the

age when he began receiving SS benefits, and details about any earnings that were received after

beginning benefits. Sufficient for providing this information is the person’s earnings history as of time

one (which is contained in the baseline characteristics & ), and his complete earnings history between

time t=1 and time t*-1. Unfortunately, a specification which requires the agent to keep track of a

complete earnings history is not tractable since it requires that a person’s entire histories of the R C’s

and the R B’s be treated as state variables in the model. Our model is made tractable through an

assumption that an individual considers expected future earnings rather than actual future earnings

when thinking about future SS benefits. 18 In this case, sufficient for computing the SS benefits that a

person will receive in some future year t* is the person’s earnings history as of time t=1 (which is

contained in & ), the number of years that he will work in his career job after time zero and before time

t* (which we denote EXC(t*)), the number of years that he will work in his bridge jobs after time zero

and before time t* (EXB(t*)), and a variable which keeps track of all relevant information about what

years the person worked after age 62 and before time t* (which we denote SSEX(t*) and describe in


17
 Because the person cannot return to his career job after leaving, EXC(t) represents the year at which a person who is
working in a bridge job left his career job.
18
  While this assumption is made primarily for computational reasons related to the size of the state space, it will only tend
to be restrictive if yearly randomness in career job earnings (associated with the RC’s) generates a large amount of variation
in the defined benefit and defined contribution payments or if yearly randomness in career job or bridge job earnings
(associated with the RC’s and RB’s) generates a large amount of variation in Social Security or DI benefits. There are several
factors which mitigate the influence of this assumption. First, given our fixed effects specification for career job earnings,
the variation of the unobservables RCt in Appendix equation (A.2) is relatively small. Second, over several years, positive
shocks to earnings in some years tend to be offset by negative shocks to earnings in other years and this tends to have an
offsetting effect on pension benefits and SS benefits. Finally, for many people, a large proportion of DB, DC, SS, and DI
benefits are already determined by the time they reach the later parts of their working lives.

                                                             15
more detail in Appendix A.3.3). These three state variables are endogenously determined within the

model. 19

      As with the SS calculation, we assume that individuals consider expected future earnings when

thinking about payments from DB pensions, DC pensions, and the DI system. In this case, a person

can compute the DB payment he will receive from his career job at some future time t* if he knows the

details of the pension plan and his earnings history as of t=1 (which are both contained in the set of

baseline information & ) and the year that he left his career job, as described by EXC(t*).With respect

to defined contribution plans, future payments will depend on details of the plan, past contributions,

and future contributions. We assume that an individual will continue to contribute to the DC plan at

his career job at the same rate as he has contributed in the past. In this case, as with DB benefits,

sufficient to characterize DC benefits at some future t* is information in & and EXC(t*). Disability

Insurance benefits are a part of the Social Security system and, with the exception of differences that

arise because DI benefits are not age-restricted, are determined in a manner similar to SS payments.

This implies that an individual can compute the DI payment he would receive at some future time t*

if he knew the baseline information & , EXC(t*), EXB(t*), and whether he has been approved for

benefits as of time t*, DI(t*). We assume that a person who applies for Disability Insurance benefits

at some time t is approved for benefits if

(7)     A 1DI +A 2DI0 t + e DI >0

where A 1DI and A 2DI are a constant and slope coefficient and e DI is a random component that is normally

distributed.

      Then, to summarize, the time t state variables in the model are                     S(t)={ & , X(t), EXC(t), EXB(t),

SSEX(t), DI(t), , (t), R (t), L(t), 6 , 0 t , HI C, and HI B(t)}.




19
  Essentially, these variables are sufficient to characterize the entire earnings history that is relevant for the SS calculation
if the person thinks about expected earnings in the future.

                                                              16
     2.3.3 Solving value functions

     The expected value in equation (4) is a multi-dimensional integral over the stochastic elements of

S(t+1) whose realizations are not known at time t given the decision to choose j. For illustration,

consider a person who is working in his career job in time t, d C(t)=1. In this case, the stochastic

elements of the state space whose time t+1 realizations are not known are L(t+1), , (t+1), R (t+1), 0 t+1,

and HI B(t+1).       L(t+1) and HI B(t+1) are discrete random variables so the expected value involves

summing over the probability functions of these variables and integrating over the density functions

of the remaining continuous variables. 20

     Researchers have often relied on convenient distributional assumptions to reduce the burden of

evaluating integrals of the type described in the previous paragraph. For example, as shown in Rust

(1987) if one specifies the choice specific transitory shocks (i.e., , (t) in our case) to be iid extreme

value, the expected value in equation (4) has a closed form solution conditional on the values of the

other state variables. 21     However, in this application, the Section 2.3.2 normality assumption for , (t)

is driven by practical considerations related to the importance of allowing certain correlations that will

be discussed in detail in Section 3. This assumption, along with the equation (6) assumption about the

distribution of 0 t+1 given 0 t and the fact that we wish to avoid functional form assumptions related to

earnings by taking advantage of the empirical distribution of R , implies that the expected value in

equation (6) does not have a closed form solution. In Appendix B we describe in detail our method

for approximating the integrals involved in this expectation. This method involves a combination of

Gaussian quadrature and simulation methods.                   Of importance from the standpoint of estimation




 If the person has chosen a time t option other than his career job, L(t+1) is not relevant and the dimensions of ,(t+1) and
20

R(t+1) are reduced by one. In addition, if a person is working in a bridge job with health insurance in time t, no uncertainty
exists about HIB(t+1) because the person believes that he will have bridge insurance in time t+1. Finally, if a person applies
for disability insurance at time t, uncertainty exists about whether he will be approved in the next period.
21
   A recent example that takes advantage of the extreme value assumption is Diermeier, Keane and Merlo (2002) who are
able to estimate a dynamic programming model of the decisions of congressional members with a very large state space by
taking advantage of extreme value errors. Keane and Wolpin (1994) explore approximations based on simulation
approaches that are useful in cases where closed form solutions do not exist.

                                                             17
feasibility, the derivatives of the expected value “approximator” are continuous with respect to model

parameters.

      The recursive formulation of value functions in equation (4) motivates a backwards recursion

solution process of the general type that is standard in finite horizon, dynamic, discrete choice models.

The most basic property of the algorithm is that in order to solve all necessary value functions at time

t, it is necessary to know value functions at time t+1 for each combination of the state variables in

S(t+1) that could arise at time t+1. In Appendix B we discuss computational issues that arise when

implementing the backwards recursion solution process in our particular application, including the

modification that is needed to deal with our continuous, serially correlated health variable.

Section 3. Estimation

      Individuals make choices by comparing the values of the various options that are available.

Generally speaking, our estimation approach is to choose parameters that maximize the probability of

observed choices. However, as discussed at the beginning of Section 2, we would like to address two

issues during estimation. First, although our model posits that individuals make decisions based on

actual health, it is self-reported health that is observed in our data. Second, the group of individuals

that are working at baseline is a select group of individuals. In sections 3.1 and 3.2 we discuss these

two issues in turn and then in Section 3.3 and Appendix C we describe our Simulated Maximum

Likelihood estimation approach.

3.1 Health

      Because true health is unobserved, we use a latent variable model to construct an index of health

(Bound 1991, Bound et al. 1999). Specifically, we imagine that health in time t is a linear function of

exogenous factors (e.g. age and education), X t; detailed health measures (i.e., physical performance

measures), Z t ; and other unobserved factors      .

(8)              0 t= B X t+ ( Z t+ < t

      We assume that < t is uncorrelated with both X t and Z t (this assumption is essentially definitional:

< t is the part of health that is uncorrelated with X t and Z t). While we do not directly observe 0 t, we do



                                                       18
observe an indicator variable, h t, of whether a person is work limited.         Letting h t* represent self-

reported health at time t, the latent counterpart to h t, we assume that h t* is a simple function of 0 t and

a term reflecting reporting error

(9)              h t*= 0 t+ : t

      We assume that : t and 0 t are uncorrelated. Substituting equation (8) into equation (9), we get

(10)             h t*= B X t+ ( Z t+[ < t+ : t].

      If < t+ : t is assumed to be normally distributed with a variance that is normalized to be one, equation

(10) represents a probit model in which h t* is greater than zero if the person reports that he is work

limited. Estimates that use respondents rating of their own health on a five point scale as our measure

of h t* yield very similar results to those reported here. The relative size of var( < t) and var( : t) is not

important for the estimation of B and ( in equation (10) but is important for other parts of the model

because, for example, it is true health (i.e., the portion not including : t) that enters the utility equations.

      The composite error term in equation (10), < t+ : t, reflects a number of different factors. The < t

component reflects aspects of health not captured by X t and Z t, while the : t component reflects reporting

errors. These errors reflect differences in reporting behavior across individuals and across time for the

same individual. The presence of : t introduces a number of biases in our estimates if we were to use

h t* directly when estimating the impact of health on labor market outcomes. If : t were completely

random, it would represent classical measurement error, which will attenuate the estimated effect of

health on labor market outcomes. If, however, people use health as a way to rationalize labor market

behavior, then one would expect : t to be correlated with labor market status. In this context, the use of

global self-reported health measures might well exaggerate the effect of health. This consideration

suggests that our specification should allow for the possibility that the reporting error : t is correlated

with each of the shocks , tC, , tB, , tN, , tA in the behavioral equations. For identification reasons similar

to those that require us to set the equation (3) current period utility coefficients        and     in the base

case to zero, we normalize the covariance between the reporting error and the utility unobservable in




                                                      19
the base case to be zero (i.e., COV( : t, , tN)=0) and estimate the three covariance parameters COV( : t, , tj),

j=C,B,A.

    Essentially, our latent variable model uses the detailed health information available in the HRS (the

Z’s) to instrument the potentially endogenous and error-ridden work limitation measure, h t*. The

validity of this approach for estimating the effects of health on labor force withdrawal depends critically

on the assumptions that the reports on the detailed health information available in the HRS are

exogenous with respect to labor force status. In Bound et al (1998), we test this assumption by

comparing the performance of our preferred health model to health models estimated using a sparser and

arguably more clearly exogenous set of measures from the HRS and find no evidence that the physical

performance measures we are using are endogenous to labor market status. There are a number of

reasons we do not simply use the more detailed performance measures directly in our behavioral

equations. Among these, the measures reflect only a component of health and our latent variable model

substantially reduces the number of parameters we need to estimate. Substituting equation (8) and

equation (3) into equation (4) shows that the value functions at time t can be rewritten as

(11) V j(t,S(t))=

                 + $ E[V(t+1,S(t+1))|S(t),d j(t)=1] j=C,B,N,A

3.2 Initial Conditions

   Although the choices we have been considering are all conditional on a person being employed at

time t=0, this group will be a non-random sample of the population of people working at time t=0.

To account for this we include in our estimation a reduced form initial conditions equation. In

particular, we imagine a latent variable I* that is greater than 0 if the individual is working as of t=0

where

   (12) I*= A 1X 0+ A 2Z 0 + , I.

We assume that , I - N(0,1) in which case equation (12) is a probit model.

   In this reduced form specification, , I captures both the portion of true health at baseline and the

portion of preferences for work at baseline that are not captured by observed characteristics (i.e., not



                                                      20
captured by demographic characteristics at t=0, X 0, and physical performance measures at t=0, Z 0).

The former suggests that , I may be correlated with the unobserved portions of health < t, t=1,2,....

Equation (6) implies that for t>1, COV( , I, < t) is a function of COV( , I, < 1) and D , and we estimate

COV( , I, < 1). The latter suggests that , I may be correlated with unobserved preferences to work

which influence behavioral decisions in t=1,2,...,T. To allow for this possibility we estimate

COV( , I, 6 ), the covariance between the initial conditions equation and the permanent unobserved

heterogeneity term.

   Credible identification of the covariance between the initial condition and the behavioral

equations depends crucially on exclusion restrictions. In particular, some variable or variables must

influence the initial condition, but have no direct effect on subsequent behavior. In our case we

have assumed that, while health at t=0 affects whether or not one works at t=0, it does not have a

direct effect on subsequent behavior after conditioning on health at t=1. We believe this assumption

is a natural one. Current health affects current behavior directly by affecting the utility that a

person derives from work and also affects behavior through the role that is plays in determining

individuals’ expectations about future health. After conditioning on current health, it seems

reasonable to believe that the primary avenue through which past health would influence current

behavior is that decisions made in the past (which are influenced by past health) have an implication

for the set of choices that are available to the person in the current period. In this case, after

conditioning on a person’s opportunity set and his current health, it does not seem that past health

should have much of a direct impact on behavior. In addition, for this exclusion restriction to be

valid, health must be exogenous to retirement and must follow a Markov process. Like much other

research in this area, we maintain these assumptions throughout. In earlier work (Bound,

Schoenbaum, Stinebrickner and Waidmann, 1999 we found the Markov assumption to be a

reasonable one. In current work (Bound and Waidmann, 2007) we test the exogeneity of health to

retirement by testing to see if there are identifiable changes in health in response to exogenous




                                                      21
retirements. We found no evidence of such changes and concluded that the assumption that health

is exogenous to retirement to be a reasonable one.

3.3 The Likelihood Function

  Estimation proceeds by evaluating the joint probability of the simultaneous conditions that must

be satisfied for a person who is working at our baseline t=0 (i.e., is in our behavioral sample) or is

not working at our baseline period t=0 (i.e., is not in our behavioral sample). The set of

simultaneous conditions that must hold can be written in terms of the simultaneous equations (10),

(11), and (12) that define our model and contain the parameters to be estimated. We describe the

likelihood function and the methods we use to compute the likelihood function in Appendix C.

Section 4. Results

4.1 Data

  Data for this research come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which contains both the

detailed health data necessary to implement our latent variable framework and the the labor force

and economic data necessary to accurately model the choice sets faced by individuals. The first

wave (wave 1) of the survey was conducted in 1992/93; respondents were re-interviewed in 1994

(wave 2) and at two-year intervals since. The HRS covers a representative national sample of

non-institutionalized men and women born between 1931 and 1941 (inclusive), so that respondents

in the sample frame were aged 50-62 at the time of the first wave. The estimation of our model uses

the public release versions of the first four waves of data, supplemented by confidential matched

data from the Social Security Administration giving earnings histories and from employers giving

details of private pension plans in which respondents are enrolled. Once we limit ourselves to single

men with valid data, we end up with a sample of 328 individuals in our initial conditions sample and

196 (working) individuals in the behavioral sample who contribute a total of 837 person-year

observations. More detail about the HRS and the composition of our sample is presented in

Appendix A.1.




                                                     22
4.2 Timing of Behavioral Choices and Health

     As described in Section 2.1, the decision periods in our model are one year in length.

Assumptions are required to map the continuous work histories that can be constructed from the data

to a sequence of yearly decision periods, each characterized by a single behavioral decision. A

consideration particularly relevant for making these assumptions is that a person’s economic

incentives tend to vary with the person’s age. For example, changes in the payment amounts that a

person would be eligible to receive from the social security system if he were to retire typically take

place on a persons’ birthdays. This motivates our desire to have each yearly period in our model

correspond to a birthday year (i.e., the period that a person is a particular age). From a practical

standpoint, in order to assign a single behavioral decision to a birthday year it is necessary to choose

the point in time during the birthday year at which the behavioral decision will be determined from

the data. In order to take into account that a person may not always make decisions immediately

after his economic incentives change, we choose the point in time to be close to the end of the

birthday year. 22 In the typical case where there are zero or one transition during a birthday year,

this approach allows the behavioral choice for a particular age to reflect whether a transition has

taken place at any time during which the financial incentives related to that age are relevant.

     While a person’s activity status can be ascertained at any point during the sample period, a

person’s health measures are available only at the HRS interview dates. We map the health

information to a decision period using the person’s age at the time of the interview. Given that

interviews take place approximately two years apart, this implies that health information is only

observed for a subset of the yearly decision periods for which we have determined a behavioral

decision. As discussed in Appendix C, we address this issue by integrating over the joint probability

of the missing health values as suggested by the missing data literature.

     Figure 1 gives an example of how surveys are used to establish timing of health status

measurements and job status transitions. For a hypothetical individual born on 15 September 1937,


22
 The HRS masks the full date of birth information to protect confidentiality. We measure behavioral choices on the first
day of the month preceding the respondent’s birth month.

                                                           23
the behavioral year runs from 15 September to 14 September the following year. For such a person,

we will measure work status as of 1 August in each year. We set t=0 at the first such point following

the baseline interview. In this example, the baseline interview took place in July, 1992, making 1

August 1992 correspond to t=0. For this individual, age at the interview (and at t=0) is 54.

Depending on the spacing of the interviews, there may be one, two, or three possible transition

points between survey waves. In the case illustrated, behavior at t=1 is defined using the second

wave survey conducted in June 1994. Behavior at t=2 and t=3 is defined using the third wave survey

from June 1996, and behavior at t=4, 5, and 6 is defined by the fourth wave survey in January 1999.

In this example, health status is observed at t=0,2,4 & 7.

4.3 Descriptive Statistics

  We are interested in understanding how the availability of economic resources and health affect

economic behavior. Table 1 presents descriptive information on the incomes sources in 1991 for

age-eligible men in the HRS. Results are stratified according to whether or not the man was working

as of the date of his wave 1 interview and whether or not he identified himself as suffering from

health conditions that might limit his capacity for work. The table is limited to those who report no

change in employment or disability status between January 1991 and the date of their wave 1

interview. This restriction was imposed to ensure that the incomes reported represent incomes

commensurate with the data we use to stratify the sample.

  While only 27% of the overall sample report work limitations, more than 75% of those out of

work report work limitations. Focusing on those not working, income sources differ substantially

depending on the respondent’s self-reported work limitation status. For example, while 40% of the

men without work limitations report pension income, less than 14% of those with work limitations

report pension income. In contrast, roughly 68% of those with limitations report receiving income

from one of the major federal disability programs, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social




                                                   24
Security Disability Insurance (DI). 23 Crudely put, Table 1 suggests that men are not likely to leave

the labor force before the age of 62 unless they have income sources on which they can rely, but that

the composition of the income sources that are used to support an exit from the labor force varies

dramatically with health status. Not surprisingly, those who are working and report work limitations

have lower incomes than those who are working and do not report work limitations. However these

differences may have preceded the work limitation.

     Table 2 presents incomes and income sources as of 1991 and 1999 for age-eligible men working

as of wave 1, stratified by behavior as of wave 4. Here we see, for example, that while almost 90%

of those men who continued to work in their career jobs as of wave 4 (1998) had earnings in 1999,

only 70% of those who had changed jobs between wave 1 and wave 4 and only 19% of those who

had applied for disability benefits had earnings in 1999. At the median, household incomes rose by

65% between 1991 and 1999 for those that stayed with the same employer. In contrast, the drop in

median income for those that retired was about 25%, and for those that applied for disability

benefits median income declined by about 7%.

     Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for both the behavioral sample (working in 1992) and the

group of individuals who are not working. The first column in this table shows that the average age

at the last survey for individuals in our behavioral sample is 60.6. Approximately 10% report that

they suffer a work limitation. The second column of Table 3 shows that men in our sample who are

not working at baseline tend to be slightly older and are approximately three times as likely than

those working to report having a work limitation.

     Recall that the choice data used to identify the behavioral portion of the model come from the

activity status of our behavioral sample at approximately yearly intervals. The third through sixth

columns of table 3 report descriptive statistics on our behavioral sample broken down by whether




23
  In Table 1, DI payments and regular SS payments are grouped under the category Social Security. Although not shown
explicitly in Table 1, approximately 44% of those not working and reporting work limitations are receiving income from
the DI program.

                                                          25
they chose C, B, A, or N in the final survey. 24 There are several things to note. Those who retire

(i.e., choose option N) are more likely to be eligible for a private defined benefit pension and more

likely to have reached age 62 by wave 4 than those who did not. What is more, those who retire (N)-

-and especially those who applied for DI benefits (A)--were no more likely to be in poor health or

report a work limitation at their wave 1 interview, but were much more likely to report health

problems as of the final survey. These patterns make considerable sense.

     A person in our behavioral sample would receive an average of $12,820 in SS benefits at age 65

(based on the contributions made as of the baseline interview) and would receive DI benefits of the

same amount if he is approved for the program. On average, the expected career earnings and bridge

earnings at the final survey based on estimates of Appendix equations (A.2) and (A.3) are $32,854

and $13,098 respectively.

4.4 Model Estimates and Simulations

     The parameters that enter our model are:

1). the parameters of the DI approval equation (7);

2). the parameters B , ( , and F 2< from the health equation (8) and the parameters D and F 2> from

equation (6);

3). the parameters in the earnings equations (A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A);

4). the parameters of the health expenditure equation (A.1 in Appendix A);

5). J , 8 HI, and {        :j=C,B,A} from the current period utility equation (3);

6). the parameters A 1 and A 2 from the initial conditions equation (12);

7). the standard deviation of unobserved heterogeneity F 6;

8). The covariance parameters {COV( : t, , tj), j=C,B,A} discussed after equation (10);

9). the covariance parameters {COV( , I, < 1) and COV( , I , 6 ), j=C,B,A} discussed after equation (12);

10). the parameter $ Common from the discount factor equation (6); and


24
 Persons are classified as having applied for disability benefits are those who apply at any time between the 1992 and 1998
surveys. Persons who have not applied for disability benefits and are still working but who have changed jobs since the
baseline survey are classified as “Bridge.” Those alive and not working in the final survey who have not applied for
disability benefits are classified as “Retired.”

                                                            26
11). the parameter 2 from the pecuniary utility function in equation (1).

     The identification of the DI approval equation (10) is made difficult in practice by the reality that

the DI approval decision is only observed for those who apply for benefits and virtually all DI

applicants have poor or fair self-reported health. While our model has features that in theory can

address this type of problem, the reality that only a relatively small number of individuals apply for

DI during our sample period makes identification difficult in practice. For our structural estimation

we set A 1DI=.08 and A 2DI=Var(e DI)=1 in equation (7). The assumption that A 2DI=Var(e DI)=1 amounts

to assuming that DI award decisions are about as equally reliable indicators of disability status as

are the global self-reported measures available in the HRS, which is consistent with the work of

Benitez-Silva, Buchinsky and Rust (2006). We chose our estimate of A 1DI so that the fraction of

those that apply for benefits who are awarded them implied by our model matches the fraction in the

data, roughly 2/3.

     In Appendix D we describe the technical/computing steps used to address a very time-intensive

estimation problem. In part due to the importance of having a likelihood function with certain

properties that make estimation feasible and in part as a concession to the size of the computing task

we reduced the number of parameters in the model by estimating the parameters of the earnings

equations (#3 above with estimates shown in Appendix A.3.2) and health equations (#2 above with

estimates shown in Table 4) outside of the behavioral model. 25 To estimate the health parameters (#

2 above) using Maximum Likelihood, we specify the likelihood contribution for a person in a way

similar to equation (C.7) in Appendix C but we include in the probability expression only the

conditions involving aggregate unobservables of the form < t+ : t which are the terms related to self-

reported health (i.e., in illustrative equation (C.7) in Appendix C this would involve the first three

terms in the intersection, < 2+ : 2<- B X 2- ( Z 2 , < 3+ : 3<- B X 3- ( Z 3, < 5+ : 5>- B X 5- ( Z 5). B and ( enter these


25
  A primary motivation for estimating the parameters of the earnings equation outside the structural model is that Defined
Benefit pension payments are calculated using a computer program provided by the Health and Retirement Study. The
reality that this program cannot be used interactively with our estimation program implies that all DB payments, which are
a function of individual’s earnings (or, equivalently, years of career experience in our model), must be calculated and stored
prior to estimation. Estimating the health equation outside the model has certain benefits from the standpoint of ensuring
that our likelihood function has properties that are necessary to use derivative-based updating algorithms

                                                              27
conditions directly. The remainder of the health parameters (in #2 above) affect the likelihood

contribution through their effect on the covariance matrix of the aggregate unobservables. Given the

discrete nature of the self-reported health variable, once we make the normalization var( < t+ : t)=1 œ t,

it is possible to identify the covariance between each pair of aggregate unobservables. In addition,

the fact that we observe information about h t* at multiple times implies that it is possible to

separately identify var( < t) and var( : t). What allows the separate identification is that fact that : t has

only a transitory effect on measured health, while < t has an effect which dies out over time only

slowly.

     An additional concern was the difficulty of credibly identifying and estimating $ Common and 2 . In

response to this concern we take the approach of seeking guidance from recent literature in order to

choose reasonable values of these two parameters, and we estimate the thirty-six remaining

parameters described above. 26 We begin by estimating a “baseline” specification in which

$ Common=0.90 and 2 =1 which implies that Y j(t) 1-2/(1- 2 )=ln(Y). 27

     The first column of Table 5 shows the estimates of the behavioral equations for the baseline

specification. 28 The estimate of J indicates that the amount of consumption available from a

particular option plays a statistically significant role in the utility that is derived from that option.

The estimates in the first column of Table 5 also indicate that health plays a statistically significant

role. Given that larger values of health represent worse health, the negative estimates of                         and

indicate that individuals in bad health get less utility from the work options (relative to the option N)

than individuals in better health. The positive estimate of                 indicates that individuals in bad health

get higher non-pecuniary benefits from applying for Disability Insurance (relative to the option N)

26
  See Magnac and Thesmar (2002) for a discussion of the difficulties related to the estimation of the discount factor. Given
these difficulties, researchers often fix the discount factor at a seemingly reasonable number (Berkovec and Stern 1991).
As a concession to the small number of individuals who apply for DI at t=1, we make the assumption that the covariance
terms described above are the same regardless of the reason that a person is out of the workforce. That is, we assume that
COV(:t, ,tA)=COV(:t, ,tN)=0.
27
  In a longer version of this paper (Bound, Stinebrickner & Waidmann 2007), we also examine the robustness of our results
to changes in $Common and 2.
28
 Although not shown in Table 5, we also included two dummy variables characterizing a person’s education level (less than
high school and more than high school).

                                                             28
than individuals in better health. In addition, the estimates imply that individuals, especially those in

decent health, face a very significant non-pecuniary cost associated with applying for DI benefits. 29

Our estimates imply that, over and above the effect of health insurance on disposable income, health

insurance has a positive relationship with well-being in the sample, but the estimated effect is quite

small and not statistically significant. Among the variance/covariance estimates, most striking is the

importance of unobserved heterogeneity; the point estimate (standard error) of the standard

deviation F 6 is 1.423 (.322).

     In order to quantify the roles that economic resources and health play in determining labor

decisions we begin by performing simulations using an “illustrative person.” We construct a person

who has a college education and has career earnings, bridge earnings, SS benefits, and potential DI

benefits that are close to the average for people in our sample, but has no private pension wealth or

other sources of wealth. 30 We first assume that the illustrative person has true health 0 1 at time t=1

that is equal to the average true health of the individuals in our sample. The first column of Table 6

shows simulated choice probabilities at t=1 for an illustrative person at 55, 60, 62, 64, and 65 years

of age, respectively. Since the simulated individuals would have been employed at t=0, these

simulated probabilities can be thought of as one year labor force exit rates.

     The simulated choice probabilities at age 55 and age 60 are quite similar. At these ages, the

illustrative person’s only economic resources if he leaves the workforce come from assistance

programs such as the food stamp program. This reality, combined with the fact that being in average

health implies that it is not particularly unenjoyable to work and that applying for Disability

Insurance is not particularly worthwhile, implies that the person at age 55 and age 60 has a very low

probability of leaving the workforce for either the non-work option N (0.02) or for the option of



29
  In our behavioral sample the mean of health is -0.904, while the standard deviation is 0.802. These numbers, together with
the estimates reported in Table 5 imply that virtually all individuals in our sample face a non-pecuniary cost associated with
apply for DI. These costs hit zero when an individuals health is 4.2 standard deviations worse than the average in the
sample!
30
 Our illustrative person would receive $15,588 in SS benefits at age 65 (given amount of contributions as of time t=1), and
would receive DI benefits of $15,588 if approved for the program.

                                                              29
applying for Disability Insurance A (0.001). Evidence regarding the effect of economic resources

on behavior can be seen by comparing the choice probabilities at the age of 60 to the choice

probabilities at the age of 62 at which time the person becomes eligible for Social Security

retirement benefits. The consumption increase in the non-work option (N) causes the probability of

choosing this option to increase by a factor of approximately two (from 0.024 to 0.046). The fact

that the probability of applying for DI remains extremely small (0.003) for the average health person

even when SS benefits become available is evidence of the very strong importance of health in the

DI application decision. 31 Delaying retirement past the age of 62 increases a person’s Social

Security benefits. Comparing simulated choice probabilities between the age of 62 and the ages of

64 and 65 reveals that this increase in Social Security benefits has a relatively small effect on

retirement decisions.

     The second column of Table 6 shows choice probabilities at different ages for the illustrative

person under the assumption that his health at t=1 is one standard deviation below average. 32 As

before, the choice probabilities are fairly similar at ages 55 and 60 for this person. However,

comparing the choice probabilities for this person at ages 55 and 60 to the choice probabilities for

the person in average health at ages 55 and 60 indicates that health has a very important effect on the

probability that a person will transition out of the workforce at ages 55 and 60. For example, the

total probability of leaving the workforce (N+A) at age 60 is 0.025 for the person in average health

and is 0.106 for the below-average health person with the impact of worse health coming from both

an increase in the probability of choosing the non-work category (N) and an increase in the

probability of applying for DI (A). Comparing these two numbers with the choice probabilities of




31
 Before age 62, a person with no outside wealth who applies for DI must rely on social assistance such as food stamps while
waiting for the approval decision. However, at age 62 a person can receive SS benefits while waiting for the DI approval
decision.
32
 As is clear from the discussion in Appendix A.1, a large share of those in poor health as of the initial HRS survey year do
not make it into our behavioral sample. Thus, a large share of those in poor health as of t=1, would not have been in poor
health two years earlier and would have suffered a major negative health shock in the interim. Thus, while lagged health
does not enter the behavioral model, it probably still makes sense to interpret the results in terms of the behavioral effects
of the deterioration in health status, rather than the effects of permanently poor health.

                                                              30
the individuals in average and below-average health at age 62 indicates that the incentive effect of

economic resources depends to some extent on health. At age 62 when SS benefits become

available, the total probability of leaving the workforce increases by approximately 0.06 (from 0.106

to 0.168) for the person in below-average health but increases by only approximately 0.02 (from

0.025 to 0.049) for the person in average health.

  The third column of Table 6 shows choice probabilities at different ages for the illustrative person

under the assumption that his health is 1.5 standard deviations below average. Comparing the

results of the second and third columns indicates that, once a person reaches poor health, an

incremental worsening of health can have large effects on decisions. When compared to the person

who has health 1 standard deviation below average, the person in worse health is at least twice as

likely to apply for Disability Insurance at each age and has a probability of leaving work (N+A) that

is approximately 10 percentage points higher at each age.

  In a previous version of this work (Bound, Stinebrickner and Waidmann 2007), we also examined

the robustness of these estimates to the assumptions made about time preferences and risk aversion.

In general, varying these parameters produced results that were consistent with the baseline

specification.

Does the treatment of health matter? - A comparison to a model trusting self-reported health

  Our models deal with the measurement error and endogeneity problems that are potentially

present in self-reported, survey health measures. Given that the implementation of the health

portions of our models is non-trivial, and, as a result, has implications for the feasibility of

estimating other aspects of the decision process, it is valuable to examine the extent to which our

findings would differ from a model in which these potential problems were ignored.

  To do this, we estimate a new version of our model in which our health framework has been

replaced with a treatment of health that is consistent with the standard in the literature. Specifically,

in the current period utility equation (2) of our baseline specification we replace our continuous

measure of health, 0 t, with a binary health variable that is equal to one if the person is in bad health

and is equal to zero otherwise. We assume that the person’s self-report of this binary health variable

                                                    31
is accurate so that, unlike the continuous health measure that enters our models, the binary health

measure that enters this new model is observed directly in the HRS data. 33 In order to compute the

new value functions of the type in equation (4), we make the standard assumption that a person

knows his current period binary health status, and, given this status, knows the probability of each

possible health status arising in period t+1. To be consistent with the self-reported health measure

that we use to estimate equation (10), we characterize a person to be in bad health if he reports that

he has an impairment or health problem that limits the kind or amount of paid work he can do. 34

     The second column of Table 5 reports the estimates of this “traditional” model. The estimate of J

is similar to the estimate shown in the first column of Table 5 for the baseline specification of our

continuous-health model. Consistent with the estimates of                     ,     , and      in the continuous-health

model, the estimated effects of the binary health variables in the traditional model are statistically

significant in each of the current period utility equations. However, the t-statistics associated with

the estimated effects of health are non-trivially different between the models. For example, the t-

statistic associated with the effect of health in the option C is greater by a factor of more than three

in the traditional health model than it is in the baseline specification of our baseline continuous-

health model. While these differences in statistical significance raise the possibility that ignoring

the measurement and endogeneity issues related to self-reported health may lead to different

conclusions about the importance of health, knowing whether this is actually the case cannot be

confirmed simply by examining individual coefficients in isolation. Therefore, we take the approach

of comparing the health implications of the two models by examining whether simulated choice

probabilities from our baseline model are different than simulated choice probabilities from the

traditional model.


33
  To be more exact, a person’s health status is observed in each survey year but is not observed in non-survey years. We
deal with this issue using standard MLE missing data techniques which involve integrating over the joint probability
function of the non-observed health values.
34
 In our sample, the fraction of individuals in good health who transitioned to poor health was .096, while the fraction in poor
health who stayed in poor health was .684. We found no statistically significant evidence that these transition probabilities
varied with the age of the respondent of the years of the survey used. We converted these two year transition rates into one
year transition rates using the assumption that these transitions represented a Markov process.

                                                              32
  To do this, we again make use of the illustrative person that was used to produce the simulations

in Table 6. For the traditional model there are only two possible health values. In In the first two

columns of Table 7 we show choice probabilities at different ages for the illustrative person who

reports himself to be in good and bad health, respectively. A comparison of these two columns

reveals that changing the self-reported health of the illustrative person from good to bad has very

large effects on behavior. For example, the probability that the illustrative person will be out of the

workforce at age 60 is .094 if the illustrative person reports being in good health and is .426 if the

illustrative person reports being in bad health.

  The goal is to compare the numbers from the traditional model to analogous numbers constructed

from our continuous health model. It is not trivial to construct choice probabilities for the

illustrative person who reports being in good or bad health in our continuous health model because

this model is written in terms of true rather than reported health. To construct these probabilities,

we need to account that, in our model, there is a continuum of health values, 0 , with a distribution

that is characterized by equation (8) and that the connection between a particular value of

continuous health, 0 , and the person’s self-reported binary health is provided by equations (9) and

(10) which determine the probability that a person with a particular value of 0 will report himself to

be in bad health or good health. Thus to construct the analog to the first two columns, we integrate

the choice probabilities that can be constructed for the illustrative person for a particular value of 0

over the person’s distribution of 0 , where we weight the choice probabilities in the integral to reflect

the probability that a person would report himself to be in bad health given 0 . The results of this

exercise shown in the third column represent the average choice probabilities of the illustrative

person over all health scenarios in which he would report good health. Similarly, the results in the

fourth column represent the average choice probabilities of the illustrative person over all health

scenarios in which he would report bad health.

  A pair-wise comparison across the first four columns provides evidence of substantial differences

between the traditional model and our model. For example, for the traditional health model, we see

the difference between good and bad self-reported health is a .33 difference in the probability of not

                                                    33
working at age 60. In our continuous health model, we see a .16 difference in the probability of

working at age 60 between a person who reports himself to be in good health and a person who

reports himself to be in bad health. Thus, our results suggest that dealing with the potential

problems associated with self-reported health is important in this context.

       It is not an easy task to pinpoint exactly why these differences exist. Somewhat generically,

the difference between the two models arises to a large extent because our continuous health model

is able to take into account that reported differences in health should be attributed to both true

differences in health and a non-trivial amount of reporting error. More concretely, we find evidence

that a large part of the difference between the traditional model and our model operates through

differences in the importance of unobserved heterogeneity between the models. Specifically, we

find in the last two columns of Table 7 that if we reestimate and resimulate our continuous model

holding the standard deviation of heterogeneity, F 6 , constant at its value from the traditional model,

a little more than half of the aforementioned difference between the traditional model and our model

disappears. For example, we see that there is now a .26 difference in the probability of working at

age 60 between a person who reports himself to be in good health and a person who reports himself

to be in bad health. It is necessary to leave a detailed exploration of why substantial differences exist

in the importance of heterogeneity between the traditional and continuous models to future work.

What we note here is that a stark implication of moving from the traditional model (in which true

health is observed exactly) to the continuous model (which recognizes that only the distribution of

true health can be observed) is that F 6 is estimated less precisely. This finding highlights the

importance of work such as Kasahara and Shimotsu (2007) that focuses on understanding the

identification of finite mixture models in dynamic, discrete choice models.

  Potential Changes in Policy

  The simulations involving the illustrative person suggest that changes in policy that influence

economic resources may have substantial effects on individual behavior and that these effects may

vary across people with different health. Here we use our baseline model and our behavioral sample

to simulate the effects of several potential changes in policy. Policy 1 examines the effect of

                                                    34
removing the option of early SS benefits. Policy 2 examines the effect of a policy that has been

implemented - changing the normal retirement age from 65 to 67. Policy 3 examines the impact of

removing the Disability Insurance program entirely. Policies 4, 5, and 6 examine, respectively, a

25% reduction in SS benefits, a 25% reduction in DI benefits, and a 25% reduction in both SS and

DI benefits.

     To quantify the effects of these policy changes, we first perform a baseline simulation in which

no policy change has occurred. For each person in our behavioral sample (i.e., those individuals

working at time t=0), we condition on the person’s information that is available at time t=0 and

simulate a sequence of choices corresponding to the years that a choice is observed for the person in

the data. 35 We then repeat this process 7200 times for each person in our behavioral sample. The

resulting simulations can be used to compute the proportion of individuals that would choose each of

the options in the set {C, B, N, A} at particular ages and the proportion that would choose each of

the options when all of the ages are pooled. The results are shown in the first column of Table 8A.

     The first entries in Column 1 represent the choice proportions that are generated if individual
                                       36
choices at all ages are pooled.             Thus, under the baseline specification, our model indicates that

individuals will choose the work option (C+B) in 1-.152=.848 of the periods in the pooled decision

periods, will choose the non-work option (N) in .134 of the pooled decision periods, and will choose

to apply for Disability Insurance (A) in .019 of the pooled decision periods. To get a sense of the fit

of our model, recall from Section 4.3 that the actual proportions in the data are, respectively, .830

(C+B), .153 (N), and .018 (A). The remainder of the entries in Column 1 reflect the choice



35
  Thus, we take the approach of simulating choices within the sample period. The likelihood contribution for a person in
Section 3.3 and Appendix C assumes that a person who applies for DI and is accepted makes no subsequent decisions (i.e.,
he remains on DI forever). For these simulations we assume that a person makes choices in all data years (i.e., in essence
for the simulations we assume that individuals who apply for DI benefits (A) in some year t do not get approved and we
simulate choices for the person in years subsequent to the DI application. The motivation for this simulation approach is
that it implies that the set of people making decisions at particular ages is identical across all policies that we simulate even
if the policies influence how many people apply for DI benefits.
36
  Thus, we are creating these entries by using all behavioral sample members in all years that choices are observed. Recall
that the youngest age at which any individual in the sample is observed making a choice is 51 and the oldest age at which
any individual in the sample is observed making a choice is 66. Each individual contributes simulated choices at the subset
of these ages which corresponds to the years choices are observed for him in the data.

                                                               35
proportions when choices are disaggregated by age (for select ages). We note that, while from an

operational standpoint it would be possible to compare these disaggregated simulated proportions to

the actual disaggregated proportions in the data, in practice the usefulness of a full comparison of

this type is limited due to relatively small sample sizes at individual ages. However, it is certainly

worth noting that the general message from such a comparison is that the age gradient in the

simulations is substantially less steep than the comparable age gradient in the actual data. For

example, while the proportion of men working falls from roughly .89 to .54 between the ages of 55

and 65 in the data, our simulations (using our model which does not allow a person’s age to

influence his non-pecuniary utility) show a decrease from .85 to .78 between these ages. Thus,

roughly speaking, at least in our model, health and economic resources can explain about 20% of the

decline in work between the age of 55 and 65.

  For each policy change, the simulation process is repeated after modifying the model

appropriately to reflect the change. Column 2 of Table 8A shows the proportions associated with

Policy 1 in which no benefits are available from the Social Security system until a person reaches

the age of 65. When a person is younger than 62, this policy change influences decisions only

through its influence on future income. Because knowledge that Social Security benefits will not be

available at the ages of 62-64 tends to reduce the value of each option in a somewhat similar fashion,

it is perhaps not surprising that the policy change has little effect before the age of 62. For example,

at age 55, the proportion choosing the non-work option (N) is .123 under the baseline simulation

and .121 under the policy change. The policy change leads to an increase in work at the age of 62

when the amount of current period consumption that a person receives in the non-work and DI

options is reduced relative to the baseline case; at age 62 the proportion choosing the non-work

option falls by approximately 15% (from .155 under the baseline simulation to .132 under the

policy change). A similar effect (.176 versus .158) is shown in the table for age 64. The policy

change leads to little change in the number of DI applicants. Thus, the decrease in the proportion

choosing N is accompanied by an increase of similar size in the proportion choosing C or B. At 65

when Social Security benefits become the same in the baseline simulation and policy change

                                                    36
simulation, the proportion choosing option N becomes similar under the baseline and policy change

(.220 vs. .214).

     We also construct the analog to Table 8A for individuals with health that is one standard

deviation or more below the average for the sample (hereafter referred to as “bad” health) and for

the remaining individuals in our sample (hereafter referred to as individuals in “good” health) and

show these proportions in Table 8B and Table 8C, respectively. 37 Consistent with our illustrative

person simulations, we find that individuals in bad health are much less likely to be working in all

periods than individuals in good health. Also consistent with our illustrative person simulations, we

find some evidence that the effect of this policy change varies with a person’s health. For example,

a comparison of the first and second columns of Table 8B reveals that, for individuals in our sample

with bad health, the policy causes the proportion choosing N at age 62 to fall by approximately .04

(from .351 under the baseline to .310 under Policy 1), while the proportion applying for DI rises by

0.014. Thus, our model implies that among those in poor health affected by the elimination of early

retirement benefits, roughly one third would apply for DI, while two thirds would continue to work.

A comparison of the first and second columns of Table 8C reveals that, for individuals in our sample

with good health, the policy causes the proportion choosing N at age 62 to fall by approximately .02

(from .137 under the baseline to .116 under Policy 1). For this group, there is essentially no effect

of the policy change on the number of men applying for DI.

     The third column in this set of tables (Policy 2) shows the proportions associated with a second

policy which influences Social Security benefits in a less drastic way than the first policy.

Specifically, the policy change involves increasing the normal retirement age from 65 to 67 and

allowing individuals to apply for DI benefits until the age of 67. Under this policy, while

individuals still become eligible for Social Security benefits at the age of 62, the amount of the




37
 True health is not observed in our data. However, our model produces the distribution of health for a particular person.
This can be used to compute the probability that a person is in “good” or “bad” health.

                                                           37
benefits that is received if one retires at age 62 is reduced by 12.5%. 38 This change in the normal

retirement age is currently being phased in. A comparison of Column 1 and Column 3 of Table 8A

reveals that this policy will have relatively small effects on individual decisions.                  The change has

virtually no effect before age 62. At ages 62 and 64, the policy causes a decrease in the proportion

choosing the non-work option (N) of one percentage point or approximately seven percent for people

in our sample. 39

     The fourth column of Table 8A (Policy 3) shows the proportions associated with a third policy

change in which the Disability Insurance program is removed entirely. Comparing the “Pooled

Ages” entries in Column 1 to those in Column 4 reveals that, when the DI program is removed,

slightly less than half of the individuals who were DI applicants under the baseline simulation

choose to work. 40      Evidence about the differential effect of the policy change by health status can

be seen in Tables 11B and 11C. The “Pooled Ages” entry in Column 1 of Table 8C shows that,

under the baseline simulation, individuals in good health choose to apply for DI benefits (A) in only

.007 of the pooled decision years. Thus, removing DI benefits has very little effect on individuals in

good health. The “Pooled Ages” entry in Column 1 of Table 8B shows that, under the baseline

simulation, individuals in bad health choose to apply for DI (A) benefits in .104 of the pooled

decision years. For these individuals, comparing the “Pooled Ages” entries under the baseline

(Column 1 of Table 8B) to that under Policy 3 (Column 4 of Table 8B) shows that the removal of the

DI option results in an increase in the proportion choosing N from .296 to .362 and a smaller change

in the proportion choosing C+B (from .600 to .637). Thus, to a large extent, the differential impact

of this policy change by health status comes from the fact that many individuals in bad health who




38
 For cohorts born before 1938, for whom the normal retirement age was 65, benefits were reduced by 5/9 of 1% for each
month prior to age 65 a person retired, for a maximum of 20% for a person who retired when they reached the age of 62.
With the rise in the normal retirement age to 67, the reduction will rise to 30% for someone retiring at the age of 62 (SSA
2007).
39
  French and Jones find similar small effects of the increase in the Social Security Normal Retirement age.
40
  The proportion of DI application in the baseline is .019. When the DI program is removed, C+B increases from .848 to
.856 and N increases from .134 to .144.

                                                            38
apply for DI benefits under the baseline remain out of the workforce but no longer receive income

from DI benefits when the program is removed.

     The last three columns of Tables 11A, B & C report results from simulating what would happen

if first just DI benefits, then just Retirement benefits, and then both together were reduced by 25%.

Although not shown, the results from simulating what would happen were benefits increased by 25%

were very similar. Our estimates suggest that a 25% reduction in DI benefits would reduce

applications for DI by a little over 20%. 41 The effect of reducing Retirement benefits by 25% varies

by age. For those who have reached the Social Security early retirement age of 62, there is about a

7% reduction in the fraction of men simply leaving the labor force (N). 42 One can also see in this

table a clear evidence of interaction effects between the Social Security retirement and Disability

Programs; when retirement but not disability benefits are reduced, the application for disability

benefits increases, with the reverse being true when disability, but not retirement benefits are

reduced.




41
 The implied application elasticity is quite close to Kreider’s (1999b) estimate, but somewhat larger than early estimates
based on time series data. See Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a discussion of existing estimates.
42
  Van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2005) also report only modest effects of a 25% change in benefits.

Section 5. Conclusion

     In this paper, we report estimates of a dynamic programming model that addresses the interplay

among health, financial resources, and the labor market behavior of men nearing retirement age. A

significant contribution of our work is the use of a latent variable model for health that we believe is

robust to concerns about the endogeneity of self-reported health. Our comparison of results obtained

using this health model to those obtained using a more traditional measure of health suggest that the

manner in which one models health can have a substantial effect on conclusions about the behavioral

effects of poor health.

     Our estimates imply that individuals in good health are unlikely to retire unless they have

generous financial resources available to them. On the other hand, our estimates imply that a man in

poor health is quite likely to leave the workforce even when he is not yet eligible for any kind of

pension benefits. In fact, our simulations show that a typical individual in poor health is 10 times

more likely than a similar person in average health to retire before becoming eligible for pension

benefits. These estimates underline the importance that health plays in determining early retirement

behavior.

     Strikingly, our estimates imply that changes in the Social Security Retirement Program are likely

to have quite small effects on applications for the Disability Insurance Program. 43 We suspect that

the reason for this has to do with the fact that those potentially eligible for DI are a quite a distinct

population. Our findings have strong predictions about the patterns we might see in the application

for DI benefits as the age for normal retirement under Social Security rises over the next decade.

Despite the fact that this change will substantially increase the financial rewards associated with

receiving DI rather than early retirement benefits, our estimates suggest that the number of

individuals over the age of 62 who apply for DI will not rise by much.




43
  As far as we know the only other attempt to estimate the impact of changes in the Social Security Retirement
Program on Disability participation is the work by Mitchell and Phillips (2000). Mitchell and Phillips use a conditional logit
framework to study the effect of financial incentives on the probability that a person will retire early or apply for disability
insurance. In qualitative terms, Mitchell and Phillips results are similar to ours. They estimate that eliminating Social
Security early retirement benefits would have only modest effects on behavior.

Appendix A. Data

A.1 Overview of Health and Retirement Study and sample composition
      The HRS is described in additional detail in Juster and Suzman (1995). The survey covers a
representative national sample of non-institutionalized men and women born between 1931 and 1941
(inclusive), so that respondents in the sample frame were aged 50-62 at the time of the first wave. The HRS
over-samples Blacks, individuals of Mexican descent, and residents of the state of Florida to permit reliable
analysis of these groups. The first wave of HRS was conducted in person in respondents' homes; the response
rate was 82%. The total sample size of the first wave is 12,654 respondents. The second wave of the HRS was
conducted by telephone in 1994; the second wave re-interviewed 11,317 of the original respondents,
representing 91% of the original sample. The third wave (1996) reinterviewed 10,681 of the original sample,
and the fourth (1998) reinterviewed 10,242, representing 86 percent of the original respondents. By 1998, 805
(6.4%) of the original respondents were deceased.
      The HRS includes the spouses/partners of the survey population even if they are not themselves in the age
range of the sample frame; since respondents out of the sample frame do not constitute a representative sample,
they are excluded here. The age-eligible first wave sample consists of 9,824 respondents, of whom 4,522 are
men, of whom 733 are not married/partnered. Table A.1 describes the effects of sample exclusions necessary
for our analysis. From this group, we exclude 206 respondents who did not have a Social Security earnings
history, either because the respondent refused the HRS permission to access their records or because they had
no covered earnings between 1951 and 1991. We exclude 31 respondents who claim to have a private pension
on their current job, but who have no corresponding record provided by their employers. We then exclude 153
respondents who were not eligible to receive both retirement (old age) and disability payments from the Social
Security system if they did not work past 1992 because they lacked the required number of quarters of covered
employment. Finally we excluded 15 respondents who had missing data for any of the variables used in our
models. These exclusions left 328 respondents who were included in the initial conditions sample. Of these,
132 were not employed (or were self employed) at the date of their wave 1 (1992/93) interview. The remaining
196 respondents make up the “behavioral sample.”

 A.2 Timing Issues Related to Income Sources
       Given our assumption that an individual consumes all of the income that he receives in the same year,
characterizing consumption in a particular year requires that we describe our assumptions related to the timing
of the income from a variety of sources. For some sources of income, institutional details imply that the timing
of receipt is obvious given the labor supply decisions that a person makes. For example, that defined benefit
(DB) pension plans do not typically include an actuarial adjustment for delayed receipt implies that individuals
will begin receiving DB pension payments from a particular job as soon as they become eligible for benefits and
are no longer working in a job. We assume that DB pension wealth is not accrued in bridge jobs. While this
assumption is made largely for computational reasons, the data suggest that it is a reasonable simplifying
assumption. Individuals also have little discretion about the timing of income from food stamps, Supplemental
Security Income, and other exogenous sources of income. In addition, the receipt of Disability insurance
payments starts automatically after one applies and is approved for benefits. We treat defined contribution
pension plans analogously to defined benefit pension plans by assuming that benefits from these plans are only



                                                        58
accrued on career jobs and that an individual starts receiving benefits as soon as he becomes eligible and is no
longer working at his career job.
       For Social Security, some individual discretion about the timing of benefits remains given a person’s
labor supply choices, and we try to make reasonable assumptions about the timing of benefits. Specifically, we
assume that an individual begins receiving Social Security benefits in the first year he is both eligible (i.e, he is
62 years old or older) and not-working. As noted, the choice-set allows individuals who are younger than 70
years of age the flexibility of returning to work after leaving the workforce. If an individual returns to work
after beginning to collect benefits, earnings are taxed away and actuarial adjustments are made to future
earnings in accordance with the rules of the Social Security system.
       Perhaps the most difficult timing issue relates to the manner in which a person spends the wealth that he
has accumulated by the beginning of the sample period. Our approach for dealing with wealth takes into
account the intuitively appealing notion that individuals who are not working are more likely to use portions of
their wealth for consumption. Specifically, we compute the yearly value of a hypothetical annuity that a person
could buy at time t=0 given his wealth. In any year for the remainder of his life that the person does not work,
he is assumed to consume the annuitized value of his wealth. In any year that the person does work, we assume
that the person saves the annuitized amount.44 This additional savings is used to increase consumption when he
retires permanently (i.e., takes a year off at age 70 or older).45  Finally, we assume that health expenditures
are paid out of income in the year that they are incurred. However, consistent with the notion that there exists
government assistance, we assume that a person’s consumption in a period cannot fall below a minimum level
of subsistence.46

A.3. More detailed information related to various sources of income

A.3.1 The health expenditure equation
      Following French and Jones (2004), we assume that a person’s health expenditures at time t depends on
the person’s health insurance status k, age, and health:
(A.1) Ln Expenditures(t) = 71k +72 (Age-53) + 73 0t + ek
where we differentiate between four possible health insurance categories - k0{ESI (employer sponsored health
insurance) only, ESI and Medicare, Medicare only, no coverage}. 71 is a constant which depends on a
person’s health insurance status k. 72 and 73 measure the impact of age and health respectively. e is a a random
component which is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance which depends on a
person’s health insurance status.
      To estimate the model of out-of-pocket health care expenditures, we used the 1996 and 1998 waves of the
HRS. The sample we use (n= 4,619) consists of age-eligible men, who had not applied for Disability Insurance,
and who did not have Medicaid between 1995 and 1998. Respondents fall into one of four insurance groups:
those with employer sponsored health insurance (ESI) and Medicare coverage (n=261), those with ESI but no
Medicare (n=2,419), those with Medicare but no ESI (n=527), and those with neither ESI nor Medicare
(n=1,412).
      The expenditure variable we use includes out-of-pocket payments for medical care provided during the
two years between interviews plus any insurance premiums paid by the person. As a result, during estimation
we divide the amounts from the expenditure equation by two. Payments included are all those for nursing home
and hospital stays, doctor visits, outpatient surgeries, dental visits, prescriptions drugs, and in-home medical
care. The expenditure model is estimated using a Tobit method with expenditure censored on the left at the


 44
   The formulation precludes any active savings. As mentioned in footnote 2, the population we are specifically interested
 in does not appear to have much in the way of savings at baseline. For this reason, we do not believe our rather ad-hoc way
 of dealing with savings and wealth seriously distorts our estimates of the impact of health on labor market behavior.
 45
   At the time the person retires permanently we compute the yearly value of a second hypothetical annuity that could be
 purchased with the savings he has accumulated by not consuming the first annuity (i.e., by working in some years between
 t=0 and the time he retires permanently). From the date of permanent retirement until the end of his life, the person receives
 both the yearly value of the first annuity and the yearly value of the second annuity.
 46
   We assume that this consumption floor corresponds to the maximum payment that a person could receive from the food
 stamps program. Thus, no individuals in our model receive consumption lower than the maximum food stamp payment.

                                                              59
median level of expenditures and on the right at the 99th percentile. The censoring is done, first, for the entire
sample and, then, separately by insurance group. Residual variances are allowed to vary across insurance
groups but are fixed within them. The estimates of the expenditure model are shown in Table A.2.

To see the effect of insurance group on the distribution of expenditures, we produced hypothetical distributions
of expenditure using the 71k and variance estimates while holding age and health constant. Our predictions
imply that a ESI reduces out of pocket expenditures in the upper tail of the distribution, but not at the median.
This finding is similar to that of French and Jones (2004), and is consistent with findings from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (Olin & Machlin, 2004) that persons with more comprehensive insurance
coverage receive substantially more care, and as a result may have significant coinsurance expenses.

A.3.2. The earnings equations
      We assume that the log of a person’s real earnings in his career job at time t evolves according to the
fixed-effect specification

(A.2) Ln(WCt)=                      Y WCt=




                                                          60
where "1i is a person-specific fixed-effect that can be estimated given multiple career-job earnings observations
in the Health and Retirement Study and RCt is the stochastic component of career job earnings. The log of a
person’s real earnings in his bridge job option is given by

(A.3) Ln(WBt)=                                        YWBt=

where RBt is the stochastic component of bridge job earnings, and EXITAGE is the age at which a person left
his career job. Our specification allows for the possibility that the earnings a person received in his career job at
t=0 may contain information more generally about his earnings potential.
       We do not make functional form assumptions about the distributions of          and     since our simulation
approach described in Section 3 allows us to use the empirical distributions of these random variables.
       Earnings in the career job are estimated using Internal Revenue Service (Form W-2) data linked to HRS
records. The data cover reported wage and salary income and self-employment income from the years 1980-
1991. We estimated the rate of growth in real earnings for the persons in our sample over the period to be
1.93% (s.e.=0.23%) per year. Future real earnings were thus assumed to grow at this rate from the base reported
in 1992. Earnings in bridge jobs were estimated using self-reported data from survey year 1994. Sample
individuals who reported working in a job different from the one reported in the 1992 survey were included in
the estimation sample.

A.3.3. Issues related to Social Security Benefits
       Recall that the choice set in Section 2.1 allows individuals to leave the workforce and return at a later
time. With respect to bridge job information, in reality the actual SS benefit formula implies that a person’s SS
benefits would depend on not only the number of years that a person works in a bridge job before t and the
wages in those years but also to some extent on the specific ages that the bridge job wages were received. This
is the case because earnings that enter the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) which determines SS
benefit amounts are indexed by year-specific factors (that are different than standard rates of inflation) at ages
less than 60 and are not indexed at ages greater than 60. We choose not to use this age information when
computing SS benefits because including it in the model is not computationally feasible since it would require
that the model contain a set of state variables that characterize the specific ages at which the person worked in
bridge jobs (or alternatively state variables that keep track of the years the person was out of the workforce
before time t). This assumption does not seem particularly problematic because the age information tends to
have a relatively small effect on benefits. The SS benefits that we use in our model are those obtained with the
person’s bridge years taking place immediately after a person’s career years.



                                                         61
       The SS rules imply that, when recomputing the actuarial adjustment factor, one month is added to the
Social Security starting age for each month before the normal retirement age that a person incurs a benefit
reduction (including partial reductions) due to work. Thus, the actuarial adjustment factor typically changes
when a person returns to work before the normal retirement age (after beginning to collect SS benefits) because
a partial benefit reduction occurs in a month for anyone who earns more than the monthly equivalent of
approximately $10,000 a year. However, working after the normal retirement age (after beginning to collect SS
benefits) only leads to a change in the actuarial adjustment factor if the person incurs a full benefit reduction
due to work in a particular month. Thus, the actuarial adjustment factor does not typically change for those
working after the normal retirement age (after beginning to collect SS benefits) because, for example, a person
with $20,000 in yearly SS benefits would only incur a full benefit reduction in a month if he earned more than
the monthly equivalent of approximately $70,000 a year in his bridge job. This implies that the state variable
SSEX in Section 2.3.2 keeps track of the number of years that the person is out of the workforce between the
age of 62 and his normal retirement age, and, if the person is not out of the workforce in any of these years,
SSEX keeps track of the first subsequent age that the person is out of the workforce.
       Social security benefits are calculated using SSA data on covered earnings that have been attached to
HRS records and self reported data from 1992 using program rules in effect as of 1992. Earnings histories are
available for persons in covered employment beginning in 1950. Future earnings are assumed to evolve
according to the estimates described above. Individuals who do not give HRS permission to access earnings
histories are excluded from the analysis.

A.3.4 Issues related to Defined Benefit Pensions
     In order to be eligible for a defined benefit payment from a particular job at time t$1, a person must have
left this job at this point. In this case, whether a payment is received and the amount of the payment depends on
a person’s earnings history in that job as of time t and the details of the employer’s pension plan. Much
heterogeneity exists in both eligibility ages and payment structures across plans.
     For the discussion here it is worthwhile to group the set of jobs that a person holds during his working
lifetime as jobs that the person left before t=0 (referred to hereafter as previously held jobs), the job the worker
held at t=0 (defined above as a career job), and jobs that the worker begins after t=0 (defined above as bridge
jobs). With respect to bridge jobs, for reasons of model tractability we assume that defined benefit pensions are
not accumulated in these jobs.47 Descriptive work shows that this is a reasonable simplifying assumption. With
respect to any previously held job, because the worker has left this job as of t=0, & contains all details of the
pension plan and information about the worker’s earnings history at the job that is necessary for the person at
t=1 to compute the defined benefit payment he will receive at any t$1. With respect to the career job, because
the worker has not left this job at t=0, in order he must know not only the details of the employer’s pension plan
and information about his earnings history at the job that are contained in & but also the endogenously
determined number of years that he will remain in his career job and the wages that he will earn in each of these
years. Letting EXC(t) denote the years of experience that a person has accumulated in his career job as of time
t, the number of years that the person stays in his career job before leaving is EXC(T) and the set of wages
relevant to the DB calculation is given by WC1,WC2,...,             .48 The assumption that an individual considers
expected future earnings when thinking about future DB benefits implies that the information in & and EXC(T)
is sufficient for the person at t=1 to compute the DB that he will receive in some year in the future.
     Values for defined benefit pension income are computed by the HRS Pension Benefit Calculator. In 1992
the HRS asked respondents who were working for the name and address of their current employer as well as
their previous employer. Using this information, the HRS contacted the employers to obtain summary plan
descriptions. These descriptions, supplemented with data on pension plans maintained by the U. S. Department
of Labor were used to produce formulas for the calculation of individual pension benefits based on the
individual’s wage history for any given date of retirement. See Curtin et al. (1998) for details on the pension


 47
   Allowing DB pensions to be accumulated in jobs that are started after time t=0 is difficult because it requires a person to
 think about the types of pension plans that could arrive with all possible future job offers. In this case, variables that are
 capable of describing all pension plans that arise in the future would have to be included in the model as state variables.
 48
   EXC(T), the number of years of career job experience as of the end of his decision horizon, is the relevant number because
 the person cannot return to his career job after leaving.

                                                              62
calculator program. For each sample member with a pension plan recorded in the plan database we generated
annual pension benefit values for every future age of retirement from the current job beginning in the current
year through the year in which the respondent reaches age 70.

A.3.5 Issues related to Defined Contribution Pensions
     Defined contribution pensions are treated analogously to defined benefit pensions. To be consistent with
our DB assumption regarding bridge jobs, we assume that DC benefits are not accumulated in jobs that begin
after t=0. The defined contribution benefits at future time t associated with jobs that ended before t=0 are
entirely characterized by information about the total amount of contributions that have been made to the plan
and the plan’s age of eligibility that is contained in our baseline financial characteristics &.49 With respect to the
career job, because the worker has not left this job at t=0, in order for the person at t=0 to compute the DC that
he will receive in some year in the future he must know not only information about previous contributions and
the plan’s age of eligibility that is contained in & but also the endogenously determined number years he will
remain in his career job and how much he will contribute to his DC plan in each of these years. We abstract
from the endogeneity of the contribution decision by assuming that each individual continues to contribute the
same percentage of his income to the DC plan at his career job in the future as he has in the past. In this case,
given the past rate of contribution which is information contained in &, the information needed to compute
future DC benefits is very similar to that of the DB case. In particular, in addition to knowing the information
in &, the person must know how many years EXC(T) that he will remain in his career job and the wages
WC1,WC2,...,            that he will earn in each of these years. The assumption that an individual considers
expected future earnings when thinking about future DC benefits implies that the information in & and EXC(T)
is sufficient for the person at t=1 to compute the DC that he will receive in some year in the future.
     Values for defined contribution pension income are derived as an actuarially fair annuity based on the
accumulated value in the DC pension account at the time of retirement from the career job, according to the
formula
           119
                 li ( x )   A(a )
W (a ) =   ∑ l (a) (1 + r )
           x=a i
                                x−a


where W(a) is the accumulated value of the pension fund at age a, li(x) is the adjusted (see above) life table
probability of survival to age x, A(a) is the annuity payment for an individual who begins receiving it at age a,
and r is the (real) interest rate, assumed here to be 3.29%. Pension wealth is self-reported at baseline, and it is
assumed to accumulate with annual contributions from either or both employers and employees calculated as
percentages of wage and salary income from the career job until retirement. Interest is accrued on these pension
assets until they are converted to an annuity.

A.3.6. Non-pension wealth
    Our general approach for dealing with wealth is described in Appendix A.2. The HRS respondents are
asked to value a wide variety of assets and debts (see Smith, 1995, and Hill, 1993, for details). We calculate the
total net value of non-pension sources of wealth available at baseline (1992).

A.4 Survival Probabilities
     We calculate health-adjusted survival probabilities at each future age for the purposes of discounting future
utility and converting stocks of wealth into annuity income estimates. The relationship between current health
and survival is estimated using a discrete time hazard model of mortality and the longitudinal data from the
HRS. In particular, for persons who are interviewed (taken as an objective measure of survival) in successive
waves, we record the date of each interview, and include in the likelihood function an expression for the
probability that the individual survives to that date. For those who die between waves, we include in the
likelihood function the cumulative probability that the individual dies sometime in the two-year period
following their last interview. The survival function is assumed to be exponential. Thus , the probability of
survival from year t-1 to year t is next is




 49
   We assume an anticipated real growth rate of 3.29% on all investments.

                                                           63
where single year of age dummies and a health index (the predicted latent variable from an ordered probit
estimate of self-assessed health status) are included in X. The probability of surviving from one survey (t-2) to
the next (t) is then S(t-1)S(t) and the probability of dying during the interval is just 1 - S(t-1)S(t). Health as of t-
2 and age as of t-1 and t are included in the model. The coefficient on the health index was 0.623 (0.071). Our
estimate of the coefficient on health in the survival model implies that a one standard deviation increase in the
latent health index (worse health) increases the mortality hazard by a factor of 1.86. Using this coefficient
estimate and individual values of the latent health index, individual survival probabilities to future ages are
increased or decreased relative to the national probabilities obtained from Social Security life tables (SSA,
1995).

A.5 Characterizing a person’s decisions
    An individual in the behavioral sample is classified as having applied for disability benefits at time t if he
reported applying for Social Security Disability or Supplemental Security Income sometime between the target
dates t-1 and t, regardless of his work status as of time t. Among those not classified as disability applicants,
those who report that they are doing no work for pay as of time t are classified as “non-workers.” Note that this
classification can include respondents who had applied for disability benefits but did so more than a year before
time t-1. At each survey, workers are asked if they work for the same employer, named by the interviewer, they
reported in the previous wave. If not (or if they reported being self-employed), they are asked the dates at which
the previous job ended and the current job began. This information is used to classify individuals as working in
a career job or a bridge job. Finally, respondents who either denied working for the employer given in a
previous interview or didn’t know if they worked for the same employer were excluded from the behavioral
sample. Persons who were working but self-employed at wave 1 were also excluded from the behavioral
sample.

Appendix B. Computing Value Functions

      For illustrative purposes, consider the calculation of the expected future utility associated with the
option of staying in one’s career job. For clarity below, it will be useful to separate the stochastic components
in S(t+1) from the components in S(t+1) that are deterministic given S(t) and the decision to choose j at time
t. Denoting the vector of non-stochastic components SNS(t+1), S(t+1)=SNS(t+1)c{DI(t+1), 0t+1, ,(t+1),
R(t+1), HIB(t+1), L(t+1)},

where H, G, and F are the distribution functions of 0t+1 given 0t, ,, and R respectively.50

       The normality assumption for , described in Section 2.3.2 is made primarily for practical reasons
related to the necessity of allowing certain correlations in our model that are discussed in detail in Section 3.
Unfortunately, this distributional assumption, along with the equation (8) assumption about 0t+1 given 0t and
our use of the empirical distribution of R, implies that equation (B.1) does not have a closed form solution.
Simulation approaches have been found to be useful in such contexts. For illustration, considering the first of
the three-dimensional integrals in equation (B.1), our approximation approach has its foundations in the
“naive” simulator given by

              D
(B.2)
         1
         D   ∑
             d =1
                    [V(t+1,SNS(t+1),L(t+1)=1,Rd(t+1),,d(t+1),0dt+1,HIB(t+1)=1]

where 0 t+1, ,d(t+1), and Rd(t+1) and represent the dth of D draws from the distributions of 0t+1 given 0t,
         d

,(t+1), and the empirical distribution of R(t+1) respectively.

      We deviate from this naive simulator in two ways. The first deviation is that, motivated by findings in
Stinebrickner (2000), we choose to approximate the outer integral in each of the three-dimensional integrals
in equation (B.1) by Hermite Gaussian Quadrature rather than by simulation51. The second deviation is
motivated by the reality that the naive simulator in equation (B.2) does not have continuous derivatives with
respect to the parameters of our model.52 This causes problems with the derivative-based optimization

50
  L(t+1) is relevant for only the choice C and DI(t+1) is not relevant for the choice C or B since we assume that individuals
do not imagine returning to work if they are approved for DI.. Uncertainty about HIB(t+1) exists in all cases except when
a person is working in a bridge job with health insurance at time t. In this case, the individual assumes that he will have
health insurance if he remains in a bridge job in time t+1. The future utility associated with applying for DI depends on
whether the person is approved or not. If not approved the person has multiple options in the next period. If approved, the
individual receives the utility from remaining out of the workforce and collecting DI benefits for the remainder of his life.
Thus, the expected value is a weighted average of the utility from these sources with the weights coming from a person’s
belief about the probability that his DI application will be approved.
51
 Stinebrickner(2000) found that Gaussian Quadrature methods performed well relative to simulation methods in a similar
context with a serially correlated variable. We have no strong evidence (or strong beliefs) that the quadrature method is a
better choice than simulation in this specific context, especially since we are also simulating other dimensions of the integral.
52
  A slight change in a particular parameter can potentially change the option that is the maximum, and, therefore, lead to
a discrete change in the derivative of V(A) with respect to the parameter.
algorithms that are a necessity given the computational demands of our model. We address this issue in a
manner similar to Keane and Moffitt (1998) by adding an additional extreme value smoothing random
variable to each of the current period utility equations (4). The additional parameter produces a smooth
simulator which approaches the value in equation (B.1) as the variance of the extreme value smoothing
random variables approaches zero. In practice, we set the variance to be a small number.

      Specifically, these two deviations from the naive simulator lead to an analog of equation (B.2) that is
given by
             Q            D

where, as described in detail in Stinebrickner (2000), mq and wq, q=1,...,Q are the Q quadrature points and
                                                                                                   1

                                                                                                       arises from a change of variables
that is necessary to use the Hermite Quadrature method. The expected value is over the extreme value
smoothing random variables that have been added to each current period utility equation. The benefit of
adding the smoothing variable is that E[C] has a closed form solution that has continuous derivatives with
respect to all of the parameters that are being estimated (Keane and Moffitt, 1998).

       The expectations of the type in B.1 are calculated as part of the backwards recursion solution process.
In order to solve all necessary value functions at each time t of the backwards recursion process, it is
necessary to know value functions at time t+1 for each combination of the state variables in S(t+1)={&,
X(t+1), EXC(t+1), EXB(t+1), SSEX(t+1), DI(t+1), ,(t+1), R(t+1), L(t+1), 6, 0t , HIC, and HIB(t)} that could
arise at time t+1.

      The variables &, X(t+1), HIC, ,(t+1), and R(t+1) are not computationally burdensome from the
standpoint of solving value functions. The first three of these variables are not computationally burdensome
because they are assumed to be exogenous and predetermined. This implies that value functions at time t+1
need to be solved only for the known value of these variables. The last two of these variables are not
computationally burdensome because they are assumed to be serially independent, and, as a result, influence
t+1 value functions only through the current period utility.53

       The computational burden of the DP model arises primarily from the variables EXC(t+1), EXB(t+1),
SSEX(t+1), DI(t+1), HIB(t+1), 0t+1, and 6. For each of these variables, the computational burden arises
because 1) there are multiple values for which value functions are needed at time t+1 and 2) the current
period value of the variable provides information about both current and future utility.54 It is worth noting
that the reasons that multiple values need to be solved varies somewhat across the variables. For the first six
variables, the agent needs to solve for the multiple values as part of his decision process. However, this is not
the case for 6 since each person is assumed to know his person-specific value. Instead, the necessity of
solving value functions for multiple values arises as an estimation issue because the econometrician does not
observe the person-specific value. The method for dealing with this “missing data” problem is an estimation
which, as described in Section 3, implies that the econometrician needs to solve value functions for different
values of 6.


53
  Thus, the implication that the time t+1 value functions need to be known for many values of ,(t+1) and R(t+1) is not
problematic since, for any j, knowledge of Vj(t+1,S(t+1))= Rj(S(t+1))+$(S(t+1))@E[V(t+2,S(t+2))|S(t+1),dj(t+1)=1] for any
values of ,j(t+1) and Rj(t+1) implies that Vj(S(t+1),t+1) can be found for any other values of ,j(t+1) and Rj(t+1) by simply
recalculating the current period reward Rj(S(t+1)). This calculation is not computationally demanding.
54
 The latter characteristic of these variables implies that, for any option j, computing a time t+1 value function for any
particular combination of these variables requires that one recompute the computationally demanding
$E[V(t+2,S(t+2))|S(t+1),dj(t+1)=1].

                                                                        66
       The first five of the variables in the previous paragraph are discrete variables that are determined
endogenously by individual decisions, and the possible combinations of these variables at any time t+1 can
be easily characterized.55 The simulation approach for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity which is
described in Section 3 determines a finite number of values for 6 for which value functions need to be solved.
However, 0t+1 is a serially correlated continuous variable and this causes well-known difficulties for the
backwards recursion solution method. As discussed in detail in Keane and Wolpin (1994), Rust (1997), and
Stinebrickner (2000), quadrature or simulation methods such as those mentioned earlier in this section are a
useful tool for addressing the difficulties of serially correlated, continuous variables because, in effect, they
serve to discretize the state space - an obvious necessity given that the backwards recursion process requires
that value functions be solved for all combinations of state variables. Unfortunately, while finite, the number
of possible values of 0t+1 for which value functions need to be solved at time t+1 is very large for all but the
smallest values of t+1.56 As a result, for all but the smallest values of t+1 it is infeasible to solve value
functions using standard methods for all possible combinations of EXC(t+1), EXB(t+1), SSEX(t+1), DI,
HIB(t+1), 6 and 0t+1 that could arise. We address this issue by implementing a modified version of the
standard backwards solution process. The first step in the modified backwards recursion approach, which
takes place before the backwards recursion process begins, involves determining the range of possible values
that 0t could have in t=1,2,...,T. The set of possible values of 01 are determined by the simulation process
(described in Section 3) that is needed to compute the likelihood contribution of the person given the reality
that true health in t=1, 01, is not observed. Given the range of possible values of 01, equation (B.3) can be
used to determine the possible values for 02 that are needed to compute the future component of time value
t=1 functions associated with these values. Additional values of 02 are generated by the simulation process
associated with the likelihood contribution which takes into account that 01 is not observed. The range of
possible values of 02 can be constructed from the set of all possible values of 02, and this process can be
repeated one period at a time to determine the possible range of values of 03,...,0T.

       Once the range of values for 01,...,0T have been determined, the modified backwards recursion process
can take place. At each time t in the backwards recursion process, rather than solving value functions for all
possible values of 0t, value functions are solved for the largest possible value of 0t, the smallest possible
value of 0t, and some subset of the possible values in between. We refer to these values of 0t for which value
functions are solved at time t as the time t grid points and denote them                where N0 is the total
number of grid points at time t .57 Equation (B.3) indicates that solving the value functions associated with
the grid points at time t requires knowledge of value functions at time t+1 for various values of 0t+1. The
reality that these values of 0t+1 will not correspond to the time t+1 grid points (for which value functions were

  If a person leaves the workforce at an age of 70 or older or if a person successfully applies for Disability Insurance he
enters a terminal state in which he remains out of the workforce for the remainder of his lifetime. These terminal state
assumptions reduce computational burden. For example, the latter implies that value functions C, B, and A do not need
to be solved at time t unless DI(t)=0. The former implies that value functions C, B, and A do not need to be solved for any
combinations of state variables that indicate that a person left the workforce at any year when he was age 70 or older.
56
  To see this note that Equation (B.3) in appendix B indicates that solving value functions for a particular value of 01 would
require that value functions be computed at time t=2 for the Q values of 02 given by D(01 -BX1) +BX2 +               q=1,...,Q.
Similarly, solving each of these time t=2 value functions would require that time t=3 value functions be computed for Q
values of 03. Thus, solving value functions for a particular value of 01 would require that we compute value functions at
any time t+1 for Qt values of 0t+1. Further, as described below, our methods for dealing with the reality that true health in
period 1, 01, is unobserved requires that we solve value functions at t=1 for multiple values of 01.
57
 The number of grid points can change with t. In practice, to reduce computational expense slightly we allowed the spacing
between grid point to increase as t increases and for values of 0 that are a long way from the mean of 0 for the sample. The
spacing we choose between grid points is .35 for the years in which choices are observed which is approximately .30 of a
health standard deviation. Stinebrickner (2000) suggests that the methods perform well even when grid points are spaced
substantially further apart than this. Consistent with this, we find that reducing spacing further had virtually no effect on
parameter estimates.

solved at time t+1) necessitates a value function approximation. Specifically, we interpolate the t+1 value
function associated with a particular value of 0t+1 as the weighted average of the value function associated
with the smallest grid point at time t+1 which is larger than 0t+1 and the value function associated with the
largest t+1 grid point which is smaller than 0t+1. This nonparametric linear interpolation approach based on
“surrounding” grid points has the virtue that the interpolated value function for 0t+1 converges to the true
value function as the number of grid points is increases (i.e., as the grid points used in the weighted average
become close to the value of 0t+1 for which value functions are being approximated).58




58
  Keane and Wolpin (1994) describe a value function approximation technique based in Ordinary Least Squares and
demonstrate the usefulness of this in several applications including Keane and Wolpin (1997). An alternative for solving
value functions in the presence of serially correlated state variables that does not require value function approximation is
the self-interpolating approach suggested by Tauchen and Hussey (1991) and Rust (1997). Stinebrickner (2000) provides
some intuition about cases in which one might expect the interpolating method to perform better and cases in which one
might expect the self-interpolating method to perform better. Stinebrickner (2000) suggests that the interpolating method
has an advantage in cases such as this where the degree of serial correlation is high.

Appendix C. The Likelihood function

       In either the case of a person who is in our behavioral sample or a person who is not in our behavioral
sample, the first conditions that must be satisfied come from the fact that, in each year that a person reports
his work limitation status, this report dictates an interval in which the latent health index ht* from equation
(12) must lie. While individuals make decisions annually in our behavioral model, health is only reported at
survey dates. Thus, given that we are using three waves of HRS data after the baseline wave, we observe up
to three health observations per person after the baseline period. In Section 4.2 we discuss the timing of
survey dates in more detail. For concreteness at this point, assume that the person’s health status is reported
three times at t=2, t=3, and t=5, and that the reports indicate that the person’s work is not limited at t=2 and
t=3 but is limited at t=5. Then, health equation (12) implies the three conditions that must be satisfied:

      h2* = πX 2 + γZ 2 + [ν 2 + μ 2 ] < 0 ⇒ ν 2 + μ 2 < − πX 2 − γZ 2 ,
(C.1) h3 = πX 3 + γZ 3 + [ν 3 + μ 3 ] < 0 ⇒ ν 3 + μ 3 < − πX 3 − γZ 3 ,
        *


        h5* = πX 5 + γZ5 + [ν 5 + μ5 ] < 0 ⇒ ν 5 + μ5 < − πX 5 − γZ5

      For each person, an additional condition that must be satisfied comes from the initial conditions
equation. For a person who is working at baseline, equation (14) implies that

(C.2)    ,I>-A1X0 -A2Z0.

The direction of the inequality is reversed for individuals who are not working at baseline.

       The likelihood contribution for an individual who is not in the behavioral sample, comes exclusively
from the health and initial conditions observations. For an individual who is in our behavioral sample,
additional conditions come from the expression for the behavioral choice that a person makes in each year a
choice is observed. For concreteness assume that the person is younger than 61 years of age at t=1, five
behavioral decisions are observed and the decisions are to work in his career job in years t=1,2,3, to work in a
bridge job in year t=4 and to be out of the workforce in year t=5.59 In Section 4.2 we describe how we map
the continuous work histories that can be constructed from the data to the sequence of yearly decision periods
that are each characterized by a single activity status.

       Starting with t=1, the fact that the person chooses the Career option implies that the value of this option
is greater than the value of each of the other options for this individual at time t=1,

(C.3)     VC(1,S(1))>VB(1,S(1)), VC(1,S(1))>VA(1,S(1)), and VC(1,S(1))>VN(1,S(1)).

      Define V*j(t,S(t),Rt,0t)=Vj(t,S(t),Rt,0t)-6j- <t -,tj for j=C,B,A,N, where for expositional reasons we
have included Rt and 0t explicitly in V* even though they are both elements of S(t). Then, the three
conditions in equation (C.3) can be rewritten as

(C.4)     6 +80C<1+,1C - 6j- 80j<1-,1j >V*j(1,S(1),R1,01)-V*C(1,S(1),R1,01),            j=B, A, N.

For t=2 and for t=3, three conditions of identical form exist with the exception that all variables would be
indexed by time t=2 and t=3 respectively rather than t=1.
      At t=4, the person chooses the bridge option and the three conditions analogous to those in equation
(C.4) indicate that the value of the bridge option at t=4 is greater than the value of the three other options at
t=4:


59
 The reason to specify the age of the example person is that a person’s age has an effect on his choice set. Given the
specified age, the example person can apply for DI (option A) in all periods t=1,2,3,4,5..

                                                         69
(C.5)     6+ 80B<4+,4B -6j- 80j<4-,4j >V*j(4,S(4),R4,04)-V*B(4,S(4),R4,04) j=C,A,N.

       Finally, at t=5, the person no longer has the option to work in his career job because he left his career
job at time t=4. The two conditions analogous to those in equation (C.4) indicate that the value of not
working (N) at t=5 is greater than the value of the two other available options at t=4:

(C.6)           80N<5+,5N -6j- 80j<5-,5j >V*j(5,S(5),R5,05)-V*N(5,S(5),R5,05) j=B, A

       Thus, the likelihood contribution Li for our example person i is given by the joint probability that the
eighteen conditions (3 health conditions, 1 initial condition, and 14 behavioral conditions) in equations
(C.1), (C.2), (C.4), (C.5), and (C.6) are jointly true. The Rt’s are independent of all other stochastic elements
that enter these equations so that the likelihood contribution of person i can be written as

(C.7) Li= IPR(<2+:2<-BX2-(Z2 1 <3+:3<-BX3-(Z3 1 <5+:5>-BX5-(Z5 1 ,I>-A1X0-A2Z0 1
            6 +80C<1+,1C - 6 - 80B<1-,1B >V*B(1,S(1),R1,01)-V*C(1,S(1),R1,01) 1 . . . 1

       The integral in equation (C.7) can be simulated in a straightforward manner given the empirical
distribution of R1,...,R5. What remains is to show how to compute the probability expression in (C.7) given
values of the R’s. The joint probability is the area under the joint density of Q={ <2+:2, <3+:3, <5+:5, ,I, 6+
80C<1+,1C -6 - 80B<1-,1B, 6+ 80C<1+,1C - 80A<1-,1A , . . . , 80N<5+,5N -6- 80 B<5-,5B, 80N<5+,5N -80 A<5-,5A} where
the conditions that appear in the probability expression (i.e., the conditions in equations C.1, C.2, C.4, C.5,
and C.6) are all true.

      The eighteen elements of Q have a joint normal distribution. The diagonal elements of the covariance
matrix are determined by the previously discussed normalizations var(<t+:t) = var(,I) = var(,tC) = var(,tB) =
var(,tN) = var( ,tA) = 1, by F6 and var(<t), and by the coefficients 80C, 80B, 80N, 80A. The non-diagonal
elements of the covariance matrix are determined by D, by the covariance terms COV(,I, <1), COV(,I, 6),
{COV(:t, ,tj), j=C,B,A}, by the normalization of COV(:t, ,tN) to zero, and by the fact that <t, t=1,2,3,4,5
enters multiple elements of Q.

        Given the covariance matrix that can be computed given the model parameters at a given iteration of
our updating algorithm, we use the GHK simulator of Geweke (1991), Hajivassiliou (1990), and Keane
(1994) to approximate the probability expression in equation (C.7). Roughly speaking, this approach centers
around the rewriting of the joint probability in equation (C.7) as a product of conditional probabilities and
approximating this product by repeatedly computing marginal probabilities, drawing values of random
variables consistent with conditions that must be satisfied, and updating conditional distributions. It is worth
noting that the GHK simulation approach provides a very natural way to deal formally with important
missing data issues that arise in this context (see Stinebrickner, 1999, and Lavy et al., 1998). Consider the
likelihood contribution for our example person. The person’s true health 0t in t=1,2,3,4,5 enters the
likelihood contribution. However, 0t is never observed since, even when a self-report of health occurs at time
t, the self-report represents only a noisy measure of true health. In essence, our approach allows us to deal
with the missing data problem by “integrating out” over the joint distribution of 01, 02, 03, 04, ..., 05 that is
appropriate given a person’s self-reported health in t=2, t=3, and t=5.

        Specifically, he likelihood in equation (C.7) can be approximated as

probabilities that appear in equations (C.7) and (C.8) are computed. The probability expression on the last
line of equation (C.8) is conditioned on all of the unobservables that have been simulated in order to compute
the previous seventeen conditional probabilities.

      One adjustment is needed to make the likelihood calculation in equation (C.8) feasible. Recall from
Appendix B that our adjustment to the backwards recursion method implies that V*j(A,01) j=C,B,N,A will be
solved for only a set of grid points              which will not be the same as 01d, d=1,...,D. This implies that
we must use an approximated value of V*j(A,01 ), j=C,B,N,A for each d=1,...,D in equation (C.8). Consistent
                                                 d

with what is done in Appendix B we interpolate V*j(A,01d) as the weighted average of the values of V*j
associated with the largest grid point less than 01d and the smallest grid point greater than 01d.




60
  One minor complication is that the health conditions Zt from equation (10) are not observed in the data in non-survey years
(in our example, years 1 and 4). We simulate the missing (Zt’s (in our example,we would simulate (Z1 and (Z2).

                                                            71
Appendix D. Computational Time Issues

       In order to make estimation feasible we paid close attention to certain properties of the likelihood
function - specifically we made sure to specify our model in a way such that the derivatives of the likelihood
function with respect to the parameters above are continuous and smooth. This has substantial benefits
because it allows the use of a derivative-based Newton-Raphson parameter updating algorithm which
requires many fewer likelihood function evaluations (and are therefore many times faster) than algorithms
that do not take advantage of derivatives (e.g., simplex methods). Nonetheless, even with an updating
algorithm that does not require large number of likelihood function evaluations, estimation of our specified
model would not be feasible if we were to estimate the model on the fastest single windows-based CPU that
is currently available using numerically computed derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to model
parameters. Specifically, we found that using this approach would require between 100 and 200 days to
compute a single iteration of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

      In order to make estimation feasible we took several steps. First, rather than relying on numerical
derivatives (of the likelihood function with respect to model parameters) which require a likelihood function
evaluation for each parameter in the model we took the painstaking approach of programming analytic
derivatives for all parameters that enter the model.61 Second, rather than relying on a single processor we
took advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of one of the fastest academic supercomputers in North
America which provided us with exclusive access to 48 Compaq Alpha CPU’s for an extended period of
time.62 Finally, as described in Section 4.4, we estimated certain parameters separately from the structural
model. These efforts reduced the time necessary to compute one iteration of the likelihood function to
approximately 9 hours which made estimation time-consuming but feasible given our Newton-Raphson
updating algorithm.




61
  The amount of time needed to compute an analytic derivative is much smaller than that needed to compute a numerical
derivative (which requires at least 1 additional likelihood function evaluation for each parameter). One reason for this is
that the analytic derivatives can typically be written as functions of information that has already been computed when
evaluating the likelihood function.
62
 See Swann (2002) for a user-friendly description of how to use parallel processing techniques with Maximum Likelihood
estimation algorithms. For some preliminary explorations we used as many as 160 CPU’s. The final numbers in this paper
were generated using 48 CPU’s.

Appendix E. The Tradeoff Between Model “Size” and Approximation Quality

      It is worth noting that, while the choice set in our model allows individuals to consider a set of work
and non-work activity statuses that is more detailed than that which has typically been allowed in the
retirement literature, it is somewhat parsimonious in the sense that we do not model other types of individual
decisions that take place during the later part of a person’s working life. As one example, as discussed in
Section 2.1, we do not formally model the savings decisions of individuals.

       While we recognize that there is a cost to this parsimony, the specification of the choice set was
motivated by the potentially significant cost to expanding the choice set to allow for more endogenous
choices. As discussed in detail in Appendix D, even after taking very substantial steps to reduce
computational time as much as possible, we are currently at the computational edge. As a result, the
computational increase associated with the most obvious expansions of the choice set and the change in the
number of state variables that would accompany such an expansion would imply the necessity of adopting an
approximation method in which value functions are solved for only a small subset of the state points in the
model. While other researchers have recently chosen to take this route, in practice evaluating the quality of
approximation methods that are available when value functions can be solved for only a very small subset of
the state space is extremely difficult for a particular application, and very little evidence exists in the
literature about this issue more generally.63 It was the virtue of avoiding uncertainty about approximation
quality that led to the specification of a parsimonious choice set.64 Nonetheless, while we think our choices
are reasonable, we stress that we have no evidence (or overly strong feelings) about the benefits of our
decision relative to the alternative.




63
  While other work also relates to approximation quality (Rust, 1997, Stinebrickner, 2000), the most relevant evidence and
most used methods related to the case of a very large state space is Keane and Wolpin (1994). The majority of the discussion
and evidence in that paper relates to a case where the state space is not very large, but functional form assumptions imply
that closed form solutions do not exist for the value function in a model. As detailed in that paper, when the state space is
very large (so that it is not possible to solve or interpolate value functions for all points in the state space), it is not possible
to use the specification of the interpolating function that was found to be desirable in the case where the state space is not
very large. The two tested interpolating functions that are available in the case of a very large state space lead to biases of
“substantial economic magnitude” in certain parameters.


64
 Given our specification which includes a continuous health measure it is not possible to avoid the issues of approximation
quality altogether. However, given the nature of the approximations in our specification, we feel much more comfortable
about our ability to specify a model in which little approximation error exists than we would be if we expanded our choice
set and dealt with the case of a very state space. As one example, as described in Section 3 and appendix B, our
approximation method for dealing with the serially correlated health variable involves interpolating in only a single
dimension and we are able to use a straightforward nonparametric approach with desirable properties.

                                                                73
