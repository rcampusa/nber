                                                ABSTRACT

Subjective well-being research has often found that marriage is positively correlated with well-being.
Some have argued that this correlation may be result of happier people being more likely to marry.
Others have presented evidence suggesting that the well-being benefits of marriage are short-lasting.
Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we control individual pre-marital well-being
levels and find that the married are still more satisfied, suggesting a causal effect, even after full allowance
is made for selection effects. Using new data from the United Kingdom's Annual Population Survey,
we find that the married have a less deep U-shape in life satisfaction across age groups than do the
unmarried, indicating that marriage may help ease the causes of the mid-life dip in life satisfaction
and that the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived. We explore friendship as a mechanism
which could help explain a causal relationship between marriage and life satisfaction, and find that
well-being effects of marriage are about twice as large for those whose spouse is also their best friend.
Finally, we use the Gallup World Poll to show that although the overall well-being effects of marriage
appear to vary across cultural contexts, marriage eases the middle-age dip in life evaluations for all
regions except Sub-Saharan Africa.

Introduction

        The decision of whether and who to marry is one of the most important that people make.

People typically enter into marriage with the expectation that their marriage and their relationship with

their spouse will make their lives richer and more satisfying. To test whether the decision to marry

actually makes people’s lives more satisfying, we rely on individuals’ assessments of the quality of

their own lives. We follow most other research in using life evaluations, rather than measures of current

emotions, because these evaluations have been found to be more reliably based on life circumstances.

There are three main types of life evaluation collected: satisfaction with life as a whole (SWL),

happiness with life as a whole, and the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of their lives as a

ladder, with the best possible life as a 10, and the worst as a 0, and then to evaluate their current lives

on this scale. The Cantril ladder, by design, tends to produce lower average scores, at the population

level, than either of the other measures, with the means of the other two measures being quite close

together, when asked on the same scale of the same respondents. Despite these differences in mean

values, all three measures deliver structurally equivalent information about the relative importance of

the various factors that have been found to be linked to subjective well-being1.

        Most studies have found that marriage is positively associated with life satisfaction2, although

most of these studies have been conducted in western, educated, industrialized, and rich democracies3,

and as discussed later in this paper, there are indications that these results may not be generalizable to

the rest of the world. A positive correlation between marriage and life satisfaction is not in itself

sufficient to show that someone who marries is more satisfied with their life than they would have been

had they remained single. To draw a causal connection, we must remove or otherwise account for

influences in the reverse direction or coming from some third factor. Those who marry tend to be more

social, healthier, better educated and have more engaging jobs, all features of life likely to increase

happiness with or without marriage. And there is lots of evidence that happier people tend to attract

more friends and potential partners. While we can control for observable traits that we know are

associated with well-being and marital status, it would also be useful to allow for personality

differences and other unobserved factors that might increase the chances of marriage and of happiness

through different channels. A primary contribution of this paper is to use panel data to directly control

for pre-marital well-being levels to try to provide a secure estimate of the impact of marriage,

excluding the impact of other factors that help to explain why (in some populations) married people are

on average happier than those are not married.

          This paper also looks again at whether marriage provides evidence for or against the set point

theory of happiness. Some previous papers have argued that marriage boosts well-being only in the few

years immediately before and immediately after the wedding. This paper tests these claims by looking

at how the difference between the married and unmarried changes with age and the duration of

marriage. We also discuss why the use of individual fixed effects in panel data could suggest full

adaptation where in fact there are continuing happiness effects.

          There are many possible mechanisms that could explain why marriage might have a causal

effect on well-being. For instance, Becker (1974) showed the possibility of marriage increasing utility

of both partners through complementarity of inputs in household production. As marriage has evolved

over time and women's share of the labour market has increased, the model of marriage where one

spouse works and the other attends to children seems to be less relevant to many modern households.

An important role that a spouse continues to play in a successful marriage is that of a close friend and

confidant; however, only one previous paper has, to our knowledge, estimated the extent to which

friendship can condition the well-being benefits of marriage. This paper explicitly tests whether those

who have a closer friendship with their spouse get more well-being gains from marriage than those who

do not.
                                                      2
Literature Review

        Although the cross-sectional correlation between marriage and well-being is well-established, at

least in certain cultural contexts, some researchers have contested the causal effect. Stutzer and Frey

(2006) found that “if singles at the age of 20 are asked about their satisfaction with life, the well-being

of those who will get married later is higher than of those who will stay single throughout their life”4,

although the authors also acknowledge that “it is unlikely that these selection effects can explain the

entire difference in well-being between singles and married people”5.

        A further question is whether the benefits of marriage are short-lived or long-lasting. Brickman

and Campbell (1971) introduced the idea of a hedonic treadmill – the notion that people adapt to their

sensory experiences and revert to a set-point level of well-being. Proponents of adaptation point to the

relative stability of subjective well-being over time, the partial heritability of well-being and the ability

of personality variables such as extroversion and neuroticism to predict well-being6.

        Lucas et al (2003) analyzed the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) and concluded

that the set point theory applies to marriage because they found that married individuals have a higher

pre-marital happiness baseline than those who will remain unmarried and have further increased well-

being around the time of their marriage but that their subsequent well-being reverts to their pre-marital

baseline after a few years.

        Soons, Liefbroer and Kalmijn (2009) offered four theoretical reasons why people in fact may

not adapt to the well-being effects of marriage as readily as they adapt to most events: partner-related

resources can manifest themselves in diverse ways, the importance of a partner varies as new situations

and challenges arise in one's life, repeated downward comparisons when meeting single people in

accordance with downward comparison theory and a partner is a “unique resource provider, who

cannot be replaced easily by other people.”7

        The notion of adaptation requires identifying a baseline to which individuals will revert. Many

studies that find adaptation use the pre-marital (or pre-relationship) level of well-being as the baseline.

This approach implicitly assumes that had the marital event not occurred, the well-being would have

remained at “baseline” for the entire duration. However, Blanchflower and Oswald (2008) found that

well-being follows a U-shape in age. The authors found that well-being falls through early adulthood

until it reaches a minimum (typically in the late 40s but varying across countries) and then rises after

that minimum. Thus, as well-being is changing ceteris paribus with age, pre-marital well-being levels

do not provide an appropriate counterfactual baseline to represent what the individuals’ well-being

would have been had they not married.

        Zimmermann and Easterlin (2006) analyzed the GSOEP and found that when allowing age to

vary “individuals who remain married two or more years do not revert to their baseline value before

marriage”8. The authors' reason as to why their results differ from Lucas et al (2003) was due to “their

[Lucas et al] failure to treat age as varying with time, and thus to control for life circumstances that

affect life satisfaction negatively”9.

        Yap, Anusic & Lucas (2012) used a propensity score matching method to match unmarried

individuals who would go on to be married to similar individuals who would remain unmarried for the

duration of the sample and found that while the well-being of the married sample rose around the time

of their marriage and then fell, the well-being of the unmarried sample fell during the entire period.

This finding is consistent with the U-shape in age as most people marry in their 20s and 30s when well-

being is generally in decline. Thus, this finding can reconcile why married individuals simultaneously

revert to their premarital baseline and maintain a well-being advantage over their peers who remain

unmarried. The authors found similar results to hold in Switzerland10 and Australia11.

        Clark and Georgellis (2013) used the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to show that

married people are more satisfied in the years immediately before and immediately after their marriage,

but that marriage had a negligible effect for individuals who had been married for at least five years.

The authors used individual fixed effects in the panel in an attempt to control for unobserved selection

differences between the married and unmarried which are not caused by their marital status. However,

given that only twelve waves of the BHPS have life satisfaction data, there is limited variation of

marital status across survey waves. Thus, as will be discussed later in this paper, the use of individual

fixed effects is likely to have excessively depressed the estimated long-term well-being effects of

marriage.

        Qari (2014) used the GSOEP to show that the adaptation result is sensitive to the baseline

period used. Qari found that “using five years prior to marriage as the relevant baseline year allows us

to calculate utility while single more accurately. If we – instead of this – use 1–2 years prior to

marriage as the reference category, the same sample generates evidence of complete “adaptation” as in

previous longitudinal studies”12. Thus, when analyzing the panel data results in the BHPS, we must be

careful as to what baseline we choose, noting that using individual fixed effects will be implicitly

choosing a baseline equivalent to the within-sample pre-marital years for those who eventually became

married. If this time period is too short, as we find to be the case with the BHPS life satisfaction data,

then the baseline could be contaminated by the happy period during which friendship with the eventual

marriage partner is being developed and enjoyed.

        To implement our exploration of friendship as a possible mediating factor to help explain why

the married would be more satisfied than the unmarried, it must first be established that friendship

matters for well-being. Similar to marriage, there is a risk of reverse causation – that more satisfied

people are more likely to develop and sustain friendships. Using the BHPS and individual fixed effects,

Powdthavee (2008) found that “a move from “seeing friends or relatives less than once a month” to

“seeing friends or relatives on most days” is now estimated to be worth an extra £85,000 a year for a

representative individual”13.

        If marriage affects well-being through friendship, then we would expect that friendship and

marriage could be substitutes and that friendship would be more important for the unmarried than the

married, as the married would have much of their friendship needs met through their spouse. Helliwell

and Huang (2013) found that “the estimated contribution of having more than more than 30 friends is

0.72 in the un-married/partnered sample; the standard error is 0.18. In contrast, the estimated

contribution is only 0.14 for people who are married or in a common-law partnership; the standard

error is 0.14. There is thus no overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two estimates”14. This

paper explores whether the closeness of friendship with one's partner affects the well-being benefit of

the marriage.

Data and Summary Statistics

        This paper uses three data sets: the United Kingdom's Annual Population Survey (APS), the

British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Gallup World Poll (GWP).

        The APS is a cross-sectional dataset with 328,665 observations collected between May 2011

and April 2013 in the United Kingdom. The APS data set has four relevant well-being measures: life

satisfaction, worthwhileness, anxiety and happiness. This paper focuses on the life satisfaction

measure, where respondents are asked “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?” Each

well-being measure is measured on a 0-10 scale. Table 1 summarizes the key demographics15, well-

being measures and marital statuses in the APS dataset.

        The BHPS is a panel data set with 18 waves, collected from 1991 to 2009 in the United

Kingdom. The BHPS' principal well-being measure is overall life satisfaction, where respondents are

asked “How dissatisfied or satisfied are you with your life overall” and scores are measured on a 1-7

scale. The BHPS has overall life satisfaction only for Waves 6-10 and 12-18, thus these waves will be

the principal focus of this paper's analysis. Overall, the BHPS surveyed approximately 30,000

individuals; however, not all respondents completed all waves. There are only 5,337 respondents for

whom we have life satisfaction scores for both Wave 6 and Wave 18. Table 2 reports the summary

statistics for each of Wave 6 and Wave 18.

         The GWP is a cross-country and cross-sectional dataset where observations were taken from

2005 to 2013. The life evaluation measure in the GWP is the Cantril ladder, which is slightly different

than life satisfaction. Respondents are asked “to evaluate the quality of their lives on an 11-point ladder

scale running from 0 to 10, with the bottom rung of the ladder (0) being the worst possible life for them

and 10 being the best possible”16. Table 3 reports the summary statistics for the GWP by region of the

world.

Causal Effect of Marriage

         Those who are more satisfied with their life are more likely to get and stay married as happier

people may be more likely to enter into and maintain romantic relationships and previous research has

provided evidence for some reverse causation. Additionally, factors such as sociability, income,

education and health status are correlated and possibly even causally related to both well-being and

propensity to marry.

         To provide a likely upper-bound estimate of the possible causal effects running from happiness

to marriage, we estimate the impact of life satisfaction ten periods ago on probability of marriage

considering only the population that was unmarried ten, nine and eight periods ago. We find that an

increase of one point on the life satisfaction scale is associated with an increase in probability of

marriage of 1.37%. This effect is significant at the 1% level. For perspective, the mean probability of

16 World Happiness Report (2012, 11)

                                                      7
someone unmarried in each of ten, nine and eight periods ago being married in the current period is

22.74%. This indicates that the selection effects found in papers such as Stutzer and Frey (2006) are

present in the BHPS data as well.

       The existence of a selection effect does not preclude a true causal effect from marriage to life

satisfaction. To test whether the reverse causation can fully explain the life satisfaction difference

between the married and unmarried, we use the BHPS to regress life satisfaction on relationship status,

lagged life satisfaction from ten periods ago and other individual characteristics. Standard errors are

clustered at the level of the individual respondent. Model 1 in Table 4 below provides the coefficients

when no lagged life satisfaction is included. This is the relationship between marriage and life

satisfaction including any selection bias into marriage that is not captured by controlling for age, health

limitations and log income. Model 2 includes life satisfaction from ten waves ago as an independent

variable. If there are stable but unobserved pre-marital differences in circumstances and personality that

increase both happiness and marriage prospects, any resulting danger to the estimate of the effects of

marriage on happiness can be allowed for by including a baseline measure of each individual’s life

satisfaction at the beginning of the sample period. Any remaining effect should be attributable to the

effect of marriage.

       Model 3 includes lagged life satisfaction and also includes the life satisfaction changes that

occurred between ten periods ago and nine periods ago and between nine periods and eight periods ago,

to capture any trends in life satisfaction that may have occurred prior to any potential marriage. Since

this sample restricts itself to only those who were unmarried eight periods ago, the life satisfaction

trend from ten periods ago to eight periods ago will likely capture some of the anticipatory benefits of

marriage for some people in the sample who will be married shortly after the trend ends eight periods

ago. This could explain why the marriage effect is slightly reduced in this specification, as any

anticipation effects captured in the trend would lower the estimated effect of marriage.

       The inclusion of lagged life satisfaction as an independent variable lowers the coefficient on
                                                     8
being married slightly from 0.480 to 0.427 and the inclusion of the previous life satisfaction lowers the

coefficient to 0.347. In both cases, the effect still remains significant at the 0.1% level and the

difference between singles and those who are living as couple but unmarried is approximately three-

quarters of the difference between singles and married individuals. The inclusion of within-sample

changes in life satisfaction lowers the estimated effects of marriage, and perhaps excessively so, as

noted above. Hence the estimates including only the initial life satisfaction as a personality control are

probably more appropriate.

       Model 4 is equivalent to Model 2 with the inclusion of the interaction term to cover the

difference between men and women in the well-being effect of marriage. This model shows that the life

satisfaction impact of marriage is 0.161 higher for females than males. This effect is significant at the

5% level.

       The estimates of the average well-being effects of marriage may include some unhappy years

that precede separation and divorce. Thus, the long-term well-being difference between the never-

married and those who stay married may be greater than the above would suggest.

Marriage and the U-shape in Age

       If the benefits of marriage are fleeting and individuals return to their set-point level of well-

being, we would expect that the difference between the married and unmarried would be greatest at

ages when many people of that age are recently married and much smaller at ages when fewer people

are getting married. Given that the median of age of marriage in the United Kingdom is approximately

30.8 for men and 28.9 for women17, adaptation theory would suggest that the difference between

married and unmarried should be the greatest in one's late 20's and 30's. But the cross-sectional

evidence from the UK Annual Population Survey rules out this possibility.

       Figure 1 shows that the U-shape in marriage exists for both the married and unmarried but is

deeper for the unmarried. Figure 2 shows the difference between the married and unmarried by age

17 Haurant (2013)

                                                      9
group, and we can see the difference between married and unmarried is greatest when people are in

their late 40s and 50s18.

         We can also test whether the above result is driven by disproportionate selection out of

marriage, where people who are less satisfied with their lives will be more likely to divorce. This is

done in Figures 3 and 4, where we see similar results persist when we compare people who have ever

been married to people who have never been married, although, as would be expected, the difference

between the ever-married and the never-married is smaller than the difference between the married and

unmarried. Figure 5 shows the difference between married and unmarried over age by gender. Marriage

seems to be more important for women than men in middle ages, with the largest gap for those ages 51

to 55 where there is no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals.

        One hypothesis that could explain why the U-shape in life satisfaction over age is deeper for the

unmarried than the married is that the social support provided by a spouse helps ease the stresses of

middle age. It has already been shown, although with US data, that the U-shape in age, for daily

measures of positive and negative affect, is smaller on weekends than of weekdays, and the

determinants of the additional weekend happiness are shown to relate to the social contexts both at

home and at work19. The U-shape difference for the married is likely to have a similar explanation,

although the BHPS does not have sufficient variables describing the social context to permit more

direct testing.

Why not Fixed Effects?

        As noted in the literature review, Clark and Georgellis (2013) analyzed the relationship between

marriage and well-being in the BHPS using individual fixed effects. This approach makes intuitive

sense because we would expect that the fixed effect would eliminate any time-invariant unobservable


18 This is not a definitive rejection of full adaptation, as there could be a small group of people becoming married in middle
   age who have a dramatic but temporary increase in life satisfaction or the selection effects between the married and
   unmarried could be largest in middle age; however, we believe that is unlikely that these could explain the difference
   between Figure 1 and what the adaptation theory would predict.
19 See Helliwell and Wang (2014, Table 6).

                                                             10
selection bias; and thus only the remaining estimated effect of marriage could be interpreted as causal.

However, this approach is problematic in the BHPS due to the relatively short duration of the dataset

and the large number of lags and leads included by Clark and Georgellis (2013).

        The use of fixed effects in panel data with rarely varying regressors is problematic. Beck (2001)

noted this issue and said “although we can estimate [a model] with slowly changing independent

variables, the fixed effect will soak up most of the explanatory power of these slowly changing

variables. Thus, if a variable … changes over time, but slowly, the fixed effects will make it hard for

such variables to appear either substantively or statistically significant”20.

        Plumper and Troeger (2007) noted that variables can be time-invariant either by definition or

because of the period or sample under analysis. The BHPS suffers from the latter problem as we only

have twelve years of life satisfaction data. Marital statuses typically do not differ much over short

periods of time. In the BHPS, 92.73% of people who were single in a period remained single in the

next period, 82.45% of people who were living as couple remained living as a couple in the next period

and 97.83% of people who were married remained married in the next period. Plumper and Troeger

(2007) proposed a method entitled fixed effects vector decomposition (FEVD) to deal with time-

invariant or rarely variant regressors and Boyce (2010) applied the method to life satisfaction and

marital status and found that the marriage benefit was nearly three times larger in a model using FEVD

rather than a model just using fixed effects. This suggests that the limited variance of marital status in

the panel data is a real problem with significantly large effects.

        The anticipatory effects of marriage and the use of lags and leads make the relatively invariant

nature of the BHPS even more questionable. Clark and Georgellis (2013) used dummies for four

periods prior to marriage and five periods after marriage. Thus, the long-term effect of marriage, which

is the effect after five periods can be compared to the pre-marital baseline only if someone has been in

the sample for that entire period. This would require someone to have at least five unmarried periods

20 Beck (2001, 285)

                                                      11
and at least six married periods.

         By running the panel regression with fixed effects, the estimated marriage effect is identified by

comparing to a baseline level of well-being, which includes whatever unmarried years the individual

has in the panel. The “all people” regression in Table 5 shows that using this specification and similar

lags and leads as employed by Clark and Georgellis (2013), that the long-term marriage effect for

people who have been married at least six years is approximately zero. However, if we shift the

baseline by only including individuals in the regression if they have at least five periods of a “never

married” status, then the long-term effect returns to being large and significant at the 5% level. We

believe that this is a more appropriate specification as failing to ensure that people have at least five

years to use a pre-marital baseline causes the anticipatory well-being effects of marriage and the

limitations of the BHPS to falsely drive down the estimated impact of marriage.

Friendship as a Mechanism

         The potential mechanisms through which marriage could have a causal effect on well-being are

numerous. Ribar (2004) found that there is a wage differential between the married and unmarried21;

however, given that the estimations in the previous sections of this paper control for income, it is

unlikely that economic factors are a key part of the explanation for the well-being difference between

the married and unmarried.

         The difference between how people perceive changeable versus unchangeable decisions may be

a mechanism to explain the higher well-being of the marriedd. Gilbert and Ebert (2002) experimentally

gave some participants photographs with the opportunity to change photographs at a later time and

some participants no opportunity to change their mind. They found that contrary to orthodox economic

theory, those “who had been given the opportunity to change their outcome were less likely to grow


21 Ribar (2004) provides five hypotheses as to why this wage differential exists: specialization of activities allowing one
   partner to focus on market activities and one to focus on non-market activities, instrumental support of a partner's career
   such as reviewing resumes and entertaining co-workers, marriage as a stabilizing or maturing influence, married
   individuals may sacrifice amenities in a job for higher pay to support their family and market discrimination in favour of
   married men compared to unmarried men.

                                                              12
relatively fond of it over the course of several days than were experiencers who had not been given that

opportunity, even though only one of the experiencers who had been given the opportunity chose to

exercise it”22. Gilbert proposed to his long-term girlfriend shortly after making this finding and he is

reported as having said “I love my wife more than I loved my girlfriend” due to the irrevocability of the

decision23. Gilbert and Ebert (2002) noted that the increased societal acceptability of divorce over the

20th century may alter this perception of irrevocability24.

          However, for the purpose of this paper we focus on the mechanism of friendship and the social

relationship between spouses. Friendship could help explain why the benefits of marriage are not

subject to adaptation, as one's partner provides unique social support for each challenge one faces in

life. Additionally, friendship can help explain why people who are unmarried but living as a couple

enjoy most of the well-being benefits of marriage, especially if, as we find, their partner is also their

best friend.

          If friendship explains much of the well-being benefits of marriage, then life satisfaction should

be higher for those whose spouses are also close friends. This is easily tested using the BHPS data,

since respondents are asked about their closest friendship, with spouse or partner being one of the

choices. Table 6 shows the distribution by relationship status in Wave 17 of the BHPS of whether an

individual lists their best friend as their partner or lists someone else as their best friend. Approximately

half of married people and of those who are cohabiting list their partner as their best friend and less

than five percent of people in any other marital status consider their partner to be their best friend25.

          To test the impact of having a best friend as a partner, we regressed life satisfaction on

relationship status interacted with whether their partner is their best friend and standard controls and the

results are presented in Table 7. Given their small number and unusual status, those who are neither


22   Gilbert and Ebert (2002, 508)
23   Ury (2008)
24   Gilbert and Ebert (2002, 504)
25   There are differences by gender. Among the married, 53% of men and 43% of women respondents list their spouse as
     their best friend. For the cohabiting unmarried, the percentages are 48% for men and 44% for women.

                                                           13
married nor cohabitating but whose partner is still their best friend are omitted from the analysis. Those

whose spouse or partner is also considered their best friend get almost twice as much additional life

satisfaction from marriage or cohabitation as do others26.

          Figure 6 shows that married individuals whose spouse is their best friend have higher life

satisfaction than those who do not, even when controlling for age, gender, income and health

limitations, and the same results hold for those who are cohabiting. Figure 7 shows that the effect of

being best friends with one's spouse persists even when previous life satisfaction is controlled for.

          Figure 8 shows the same specification as Figure 6, except with the sample divided by gender.

The well-being benefit of being married to one's best friend appears much higher for women than for

men, although on average fewer women than men regard their spouse as their best friend. Further

research is required to indicate how the friendship mechanism may differ for men and women or if

there are other factors driving this result.

          Our finding that the happiness benefits of marriage flow largely through social channels, in

particular though friendship, has strong parallels to the results of by Lim and Putnam (2010) for the life

satisfaction effects of religion. They find that most or all of the SWB benefits of religious involvement

flow through the number of church friends, in particular those who share common values. The two

pieces of research taken together suggest that friendship is a strong mediating factor for the life

satisfaction consequences of two key life circumstances: marriage and religion. While all friends are

important for happiness, those who share who share beliefs (in the Lim and Putnam example) or are

married to each other (as in our results) are super-friends, with well-being effects apparently much

larger than for friends on average. Our results for the U-shape in age are also consistent with our

emphasis on the social context.




26
     The impact of being best friends with one’s spouse was not significantly different for married individuals with and
     without children.

                                                              14
International Results

        Marriage is a social, cultural, religious and legal institution, with different meaning for different

individuals and different cultures. Therefore, the well-being effects of marriage found in this paper may

be specific to the cultural context of the participants of the dataset. Using the cross-sectional Gallup

World Poll, we use OLS by world region to determine the marriage effect on life evaluations by region

and Table 8 summarizes the results of this analysis.

        We find that marriage is significantly positively related with life evaluations in Western Europe

(excluding the United Kingdom), United Kingdom, Central and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of

Independent States (including Russia), Australia-New Zealand, East Asia, North America and the

Middle East & North Africa. Marriage is significantly negatively associated with life evaluations in

Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. Marriage is not significantly associated with

life evaluations in the Southeast Asia and South Asia.

        In Table 9, we add interaction effects between marriage and age to test whether the U-shape in

age persists across countries and whether marriage affects the middle-age dip globally in the same way

it does in the United Kingdom. Somewhat surprisingly, the results are remarkably consistent across

regions. With the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa, in each region, the U-shape over age exists for both

married and unmarried and is deeper for the unmarried. Appendix A shows the U-shape for each region

across age, by five-year age brackets27. We believe the most natural hypothesis is that the social

support provided by marriage is most important in middle-age and this social support is applicable, to

varying degrees, in all cultures.

Summary and Conclusions

        This paper makes four key contributions. First, even when controlling for pre-marital life

satisfaction levels, those who marry are more satisfied than those who remain single. Second, contrary

   separately for males and females.

to past papers claiming full adaptation, the benefits of marriage persist in the long-term, even if the

well-being benefits are greatest immediately after marriage. Third, marriage seems to be most

important in middle age when people of every marital status experience a dip in well-being. This result

seems to be applicable globally, even in regions of the world where the average effects of marriage are

not positive. Fourth, those who are best friends with their partners have the largest well-being benefits

from marriage and cohabitation, even when controlling for pre-marital well-being levels. The well-

being benefits of marriage are on average about twice as large for those (about half of the sample)

whose spouse is also their best friend.

           This paper provides evidence that the long-term benefits of marriage are substantial and worth

further exploration. The evidence in this paper helps to solidify the important case that changes in key

life circumstances have large and enduring consequences for life evaluations. These results combine

with the large international differences in average life evaluations (as shown in Table 3) to demonstrate

that life evaluations are not fully determined by genetic and other factors to define immutable long-

term individual happiness set points28.

     Although Cummins et al (2014) argue that set point theory can be reconciled with the idea that life circumstances have
     long-term impacts on life satisfaction.
