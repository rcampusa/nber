                                          ABSTRACT


       This paper shows that up-front payments can play a crucial role in providing efficient

investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. They can eliminate the overinvestment

effect identified by Rogerson [1984] and Shaven [1980] when courts use an expectation damnge

remedy. This method extends to complex contracting situations if parties combine up-front

payments with what we call "Cadillac" contracts (contracts for a veiy high quality or quantity).

This combination provides efficient investment incentives in complex contracting problems when

an expectation damage remedy is accompanied by a broad duty to mitigate damages. This
indicates that an expectation remedy is well-suited to multidimensional, but one-sided, investment

problems, in contrast to specific performance, which Edlin and Reichelstein [1993] showed is

well-suited to two-sided, but unidimensional, investment problems.

 1. Introduction

 Up-front payments are common enough. One may wonder, though. why one party to
a contract sometimes pays the other before the other performs? This essay identifies a
new purpose for this practice: Up-front payments, combined with what we call "Cadillac"
contracts, can provide a simple solution to the incomplete contracting problem, a solution
that incorporates the traditional remedy of expectation damages with a broad duty to
mitigate damages. This solution is remarkably robust, working nor only in the simple
contractual settings of Rogerson [1984] and Shavell [1980], but in settings where the
investment decisions are complex, though made by only one party.
    Up-front payments are often associated with special orders, custom goods, or other
contracts involving specific investments. This is probably no accident. Whenever in-
vestments are relationship—specific, the investor risks a 'holdup"—i.e.. he risks losing
the returns to his investments in negotiations after the investments are s'ink Adequate
protection must somehow be provided, and Williamson [1983] has argued that if courts
are an impractical option, then up-front payments serve to protect investment returns
against the holdup problem."2
    We ask here whether such payments are useful in the polar case when courts ate
effective. The initial response of those familiar with law and economics might be "no"—
at least for the extreme case where courts can costlessly enforce contracts. After all,
Rogerson [1984] and Shavell [1980] showed that enforceable fixed-price contracts not
only protect investment returns, but can overprotect them and cause overinvestrnent.
   twilhian..son [19831 calls such up-front payments "hostages," and develops a model of "private order-
nc in which a hostage is paid to the investor—seller up front. This payment serves to bind the buyer,
substituting for an enforceable contract.
   2High legal fees can make court an impractical option; alternatively, courts can be ineffective if one
party is unreliable and may flee from the court's jurisdiction, or become judgment-proof from insolvency.

If such contracts by themselves can overprotect investment, then why add an up-front

payment?
    This paper argues that up-front payments can play a richer role. They are important
even in models where courts are costless and there is no fear of a judgment-proof defen-
dant. They control which party chooses to breach the contract, thereby eliminating the
Rogerson—Shavell overinvestment problem and providing efficient breach and investment
incentives under a breach remedy of expectation daniages.3
    Consider, for instance, the not-so-fictional story of an economics department near
Chicago. The department's building is undergoing substantial remodeling, remodeling
that will definitely be completed in a year, perhaps even earlier. In the meantime, the
department rents space in a commercial district on a 1-year lease. Although the landlord
sets the rent high, he provides an up-front payment as an inducement to tent the space:
the first two months are free. Given the high rent, the landlord has no desire to terminate
the tenancy (after the first two months) since no one is offering higher rent. However,
the department may desire to breach the contract and move out of the office space, if the
remodeling nears completion before the lease terminates. In fact. the department will
move out at the very time moving is efficient, assuming that it must pay the landlord
damages calculated to compensate him for the breach (expectation damages). Moreover,
the department will make efficient (multifaceted) ex-ante investment decisions. For in-
stance, it will invest optimally in hastening the remodeling, and will also "settle into"
the downtown building to just the right extent (making appropriate expenditures to dec-
orate, move books, and buy new business cards and stationery; expenditures that take
   3The reader familiar with ShaveN (1980, p. 412j may be skeptical of this claim since his fourth
conclusion is that "There does not exist a damage measure which leads to Pareto efficient decisions
concerning both breach and reliance 'independent of the type of contractual situation Moreover, Shavell
(1980, p 41TJ does not neglect the possibility of up-front payments, and indeed assumes, "without loss
of generality that the contract price k ii paid when the contract is made." However. Shavell is only
considering up-front payments made by the investor to the non-investor instead of the other way around.
His conclusion arises from this restriction.

into account the likely lengths of stay).
   The combination of the expectation damage remedy, the up-front payment, and the

high rent is critical to the efficiency of this contract. The up-front payment induces the
department to accept the high rent. The high rent, in turn, ensures that the alternative-
rental value of the office space stays below the rent. Otherwise, the department might
not unilaterally move even though moving were efficient: since the department has the
right to stay under the lea.se, the landlord would then have to bribe the department to
move. The more settled" it is, the larger the bribe would generally be: this means the

department would have a (bribe—seeking) incentive to "overrelf on the tease; i.e., to

overinvest in the specific investment of settling in. The overinvestment problem would

turn out to worsen if the landlord could unilaterally breach, terminating the tenancy and

paying the tenant expectation damages.
   Such an overinvestment (overreliance) problem from expectation damages has become

a textbook result in law and economics. Polinsky [1989, 31, br example. writes:


         The   e.rjctation remedy generally leads to too much reliana btcause it
     git'es the relying party the value that would have been created by (he reliance
     incest rnent if the contract had been performed.

   Recent work indicates that the overinvestment problem is not so general as was

thought when Polinsky wrote this passage. Rogerson (1984] and Shavell (1980] stud-
ied indivisible trade—trade either happened or it didn't. In contrast, when the quantity

the parties contract to trade is a continuous variable as in the lease example, Edlin and

Reichelstein [1993] have now shown that simple fixed—price contracts can induce an ef-

ficient level of investment for one party under an expectation damage remedy. (Under

specific performance, see also Aghion, Dewatripont, and Rey [1994] and Chung 119911.)

However, in the Rogerson—Shavell discrete—trade context, the balancing approach of Edlin
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                          Page 4


and Reichelstein [19931 requires random contracts.4 Moreover, these approaches do not
create appropriate incentives when the investment problem is multifaceted, as when the
economics department above needs to decide its expenditures to speed the remodeling
and also to settle into the downtown offices.
       This paper begins by returning to the Rogerson—Shavell context and showing that
up-front payments to the investor provide efficient investment incentives tinder an ex-
pectation damage remedy without random contracts. This result furthers the argument
that standard legal remedies do not necessarily cause overinvestment: the conventional
wisdom embodied in the Polinsky quotation stems from the particular contracts Roger-
son and Shavell considered. Our efficiency results remove the impetus to restrict the
expectation damage remedy, as proposed by Cooter and Eisenberg 11985. p. l467]; in
fact, unrestricted expectation damages is a better "problem—solvin& default rule than
specific performance when only one party invests. (See Schwartz 1993] for a helpful
taxonomy of default rules.)
       The intuition behind combining up-front payments and expectation darnage is situ-
pie.   The party that makes a sufficiently large up-front payment will not want to breach.
since finishing performance requires only a commensurately small subsequent payment.6
Therefore, the other party will commit any breach. Controlling who breaches is critical
under an expectation remedy, because the breacher gets the residual left after paying
the victim compensatory damages. If the breacher is also the investor he will invest
    4ilermalin and Katz 119931 develop a non-random solution for the discrete context; their fill-in-the-
price contract is elegant, but is-somewhat more complex than a fixed-price contract and requires that
renegotiation be ruled out in the 'syinznetric information" cases considered here. (For general abstract
mechanisms see Rogerson (19921; for the use of liquidated damages see MacLeod and Malcomson (1993]
or Spier and Whinston [1994J.)
     Cooter and Eisenberg (19851 argue that overreliance will not occur if expectation damages protect
only the expectancy conditional upon efficient (or reasonable) investment. Spin and Whinston (19941
make the same argument.
     lznplicit in this comment is the assumption that the breaching party cannot sue. This assumption
is central and the paper will provide examples where it holds and where it doent. Where it doesn't,
policy conclusions tollow.
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                             Page 5


efficiently, maximizing this residual.
     In Rogerson [1984] and Shavell's (1980] models, breach is committed by the party with
the uncertain valuation of trade. If the breacher is not the investor, overinvestment results
for the reason Polinsky described.7 In contrast, when the investor breaches, he invests
efficiently, just as in the "second case" in Shavell [1980, 484—Si], where the investor has
the uncertain valuation and so is the party to breach. Section 2 simply observes that up-
front payments allow the parties to control who breaches, so that the overinvestment effect

from expectation damages is not mandated by the potentially exogenous arrangement of
who must invest and who experiences uncertainty. The parties control their fate, and
can avoid overinvestment by choosing an appropriate contract.8
    Section 3 explains that the court does not have to observe damages for the approach
in Section 2 to provide efficient investment incentives; the court need only make an un-
biased damage judgment. Section 4 shows that this approach works in quite general
settings where both parties' valuations are uncertain, and where one party makes mul-
tidimensional choices about investment and trade. Allocating all "decision rights" both
cc ante and ex post to one party is important, and to do this, we argue that the law (or
perhaps the parties) should incorporate a broad duty to mitigate damages. a duty that
includes accepting non-conforming performance. When the investor cannot be given a
decision right over production, a good substitute is for the contract to be "divisible,"
which allows the investor to breach one part of the contract without discharging the
other party's duty to perform other parts of the contract. It is also important to the
approach we outline to avoid situations with holdups where both parties must come to
an agreement in order to trade aciently. The parties may do so by signing a "Cadil-
   'See Shavell's 11980, pp. 473-83j first case and also Itogerson   119841.
    'Contrast this viewpoint with Shavell (1980, 4731, who did not consider up-front payments being made
to the investor, and who therefore described the situation in his "fiat case" as follows: 'tiotice here that
the party who chooses reliance does not face uncertainty in a direct way and that the other party does.
This means that the party who decides about reliance is not the one who decides about breach."
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                              Page 6


lac" contract—a contract to trade as high a quantity and quality as they are likely to
want. Such a contract ensures that all adjustments of trade are "downward," and can
be achieved with unilateral breach. Hence, Cadillac contracts and either divisibility or
a broad duty to mitigate damages combine to extend the results in Section 2 to quite
general contexts.
   It should not he too surprising that efficient contracts exist, even in the genera!
contexts of in Section 4. After all, the first-best should be attainable if one party is
risk-neutral and can feasibly make all decisions. Compare the situation to a standard
principal—agent framework where the solution would be to have the agent buy the firm.
The solution presented here is interesting for at least three reasons. First it is liistori-
cal: it shows that earlier overinvestment results stemmed from restrictions on the foriti
of contract. Second, it illustrates how fixed-price contracts can interact with legal doc-
trines such as expectation damages, a broad duty to mitigate damages, and contractual
divisibility, to effectively give all decision rights and the residual to one party. This
suggests   a variety of guiding principles for parties writing contracts or for courts con-
structing problem—solving default rules. Third, it incorporates up-front payments made
to the party that undertakes investment, a common phenomenon that differs from the
investor buying out the other party. (Our agent, instead of buying out the firm, is paid
a significant up-front sum in return for promising to deliver the maximum output.)
   The paper has four remaining sections. Section 2 explains the importance of up-
front payments in the discrete context of Rogerson and Shavell. Section 3 relaxes the
informational requirements of the court. Section 4 generalizes the contract solution to a
context where investment and deployment of assets are multidimensional decisions, and
where both parties place unknown value upon trade. Section 5 discusses implications.

2. Discrete Trade Revisited

2.1. The model

This section lays out a model of discrete trade like those in Rogerson [1984] and Shavell
[1980). A risk-neutral buyer and seller contract to trade a good, and one party, in our
case the seller, must invest S E [o.3] before the other's trade valuation is known. If the
good is produced ex post, the seller must later incur the variable cost c(S).9 If the good
is not produced, the investment may be redeployed to earn an alternative use value, or

salvage value, a(S), where (0) = 0. The traded good has a random value v(O) to the
buyer, where B denotes the realized contingency. We assume that both parties observe the
values ii and c ex post, after the investment and contingency are determined. Production
and trade are efficient ex post if and only if the value to the buyer is sufficiently high
that
                                         v(9)—c(S) 5(S) .                                              (1)

Otherwise it is better to sell the investment as salvage for a(s).
    We assume some optimal investment level or levels exist. Since both buyer and seller
are risk-neutral, any first-best level of investment satisfies

where F (0) is the cumulative distribution for contingencies 8. The Liming of events is
summarized below.
    91n Rogerson (1984] and Shavell [1980] the buyer invests and the seller has uncertain costs. This
difference is unimportant here. However, when trade is not discrete, as in Section 4, it becomes important.
There we explicitly present a solution method involving a broad duty to mitigate damages. On the other
hand, if the buyer invests, & parallel analysis would involve the contract being TMdivisible," a concept we
elaborate later.

2.2. Efficient investment from up-frént payments

We show below that when an up-front payment is possible, the parties can sign a fixed-
price contract that provides optimal investment incentives. The parties should sign such
a contract since it maximizes joint surplus, and this surplus can be divided arbitrarily
with the up-front payment.
   We begin by defining up-front payments.

Definition 1. An up-front payment is anything valuable delivered at the time a con-
tract is signed (other than the promise of payment for the goods). It might represent
money paid, another profitable trade, or the signing of a separate profitable agreement.

   We consider a fixed-price contract to trade the good at a price p to be paid at the
time of trade. The buyer also pays the seller an amount T up front, which may be viewed
as compensation for the seller's investment. This up-front payment plays a critical role
in creating efficient investment incentives.
   We assume that if either the seller or the buyer breaches the contract, the other
party may choose to sue to get an expectation damage remedy imposed. In contrast, the
breaching party cannot sue on a "breach of contract" theory since the other party has
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                          Page 9


breached no contractual duty. We also assume that the breaching party cannot sue in
what is called "quasi-contract," and that the court will find no other reason to assist the

breaching party.'° This latter assumption does not accurately reflect the legal system
in some jurisdictions and cases. For instance, the doctrine that a "willful" contract
breacher cannot sue is common but not universal." Where the assumption does not
presently apply, our analysis will generate a legal policy recommendation as well as a
contracting recommendation. The policy recommendation is that courts should become

increasingly skeptical of such suits in quasi-contract; but until they do, the contracting

prescription is that parties pay the up-front payment in a Separate contract with separate
consideration. These prescriptions eliminate a race to breach,'2 and allow the parties to

neatly overcome the overinvestment problem by controlling who breaches.

    To be concrete about the sort of unjust enrichment suit that will prevent the parties
from solving their contracting problem, consider the lease example in the introduction,
Suppose that while the economics faculty is attending the Winter AEA meetings, the
landlord removes their belongings and re-rents their offices. They can site for breach

of contract to recover any damages they suffer, but they may suffer no damages: They
  '°The poasibility of suing "in quantum meruit," one type of "quasi-contractual" suit, is a long-
established way to recover benefits conferred on another who the court deems would otherwise be
unjustly enriched. Even where there is a contract, and bne party has clearly breached the contract,
courts have often allowed that party to recover the value of benefits he conferred upon the victim of the
breach. (See, e.g.1 Britlon v. Turner[1834], where the plaintiff breached a twelve-month labor contract
by working only nine and one-half months, but was allowed to recover nine and one-halt month's wages.)
However1 courts sometimes refuse to allow such recoveries. See BerL-c 8' Co. v. Griffin, Inc. [1976, 7641
where the court note that, generaIly quantum meruit recovery will not be awarded where the conduct
has been 'wilful' [sic]."
  ttSee the comment later regarding Berke & Co. it. Griffin, Inc. (1976]. Some commentators argue
that even a willful breacher should be accorded relief. See Nordstrom and Woodland [1959, 211—14].
  Ijf quantum meruit recovery is allowed for the breather, extreme perversities may result. Suppose
that unjust enrichment means receiving more than one's expectancy resulting from another's breach, and
suppose further that a contract breather can always sue to prevent unjust enrichment. Then both buyer
and seller will be in a race to breach when tiade is inefficient. Each will attempt to make announcements
of his refusal to perform in advance of the other's announcements. More peculiar still, each wilt assert
in court that the announcement of the other did not amount to an anticipatory repudiation or breach!
These Alice-in-Wonderland phenomena occur if the breacher can always "pin" the other party to his
expectancy by suing for disgorgement of any surplus from not trading when that is efficient.

 may find other accommodations for less rent and not be much inconvenienced. Would
 the landlord, then, be able to sue them to recover the rent for the two free months they

 enjoyS at the beginning of their lease, or for their rental savings from their involuntary
 relocation? Were they "unjustly enriched"? In this paper, we assume the answer is no

The landlord who breached has no cause of action. This assumption is probably realistic
in this example, however, in other examples where the structure of the contract and
flavor of the breach differs, some jurisdictions will allow the breacher to sue. This paper

provides reasons not to. We will return to these issues later.

    Since we follow Rogerson [1984) and Shavell [1980] in ignoring litigation costs, a breach

victim will sue whenever damages are positive. Although abstracting from litigation cost

necessarily limits the descriptive power of this paper, it allows us to further develop
the influential benchmark case they considered. For now, we assume that the court
has sufficient information to properly calculate damages. As Shavell [19S0J emphasizes.
this requires the court to observe the value v(9), but not the state 0 nor the functional

relationship v (.). Section 3 of this paper considers imperfectly informed courts that can't
observe even u.

   Damages will be calculated using the expectation formula; this formula compensates
for economic damages, and is defined as follows:

Definition 2. Expectation damages are the amount that makes the victim of a breach
exactly as well off as she would have been if the other party had performed.

   Expectation damages give the victim what lawyers call her "expectancy." Accord-
ingly, if the seller breaches, he will have to pay the buyer

                                     max[O,v(O)—pJ .                                    (3)

If the buyer's damages v(O)—p are positive, the buyer gets the same payoff as perfonnance.

She can bring an action to recover t'(O) — p, or equivalently, since they anticipate the
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                          Page 11


 result, the parties may simply settle out of court, If v(O) — p were negative, the buyer
 would not sue, so the seller pays 0. If the buyer breaches, she must likewise pay the seller

                                       max(O,p — c(S) — a(S)] ,                                         (4)

 assuming    that the buyer notifies the seller of the breach before he incurs the variable
 costs c(S). Again the "max" takes into account the fact that no one forces the seller
 to sue. The seller's expectancy is p — c(S), but i(S) is deducted because the seller is
obligated to "mitigate" his damages by selling the investment at its salvage value,'31'
Although the duty to mitigate damages can induce efficient actions ex post, this feature
is inconsequential in a symmetric information context where renegotiation is possible.
The duty to mitigate damages is nonetheless quite important for efficient investment
incentives, and Section 4 explains that in a more general setting, the duty to mitigate
damages should be broader than the law often recognizes.
    When contractual quantity is not an available instrument, the key to inducing effi-
cient investment is to set the price low so that the seller—investor commits any breach.
(Compare with Edlin and Reichelstein (1993], where quantity is used as an instrument.)

Proposition 1. Let p E infu(9). Then the seller invests and breaches efficiently, flow-
ever, unless trade is always efficient, the seller must be paid an up-front payment, or he
will not agree to such a low price.
  13[f the buyer wants to breach, she should announce her intention early, repudiating the contract.
Otherwise her damage payment might increase by c(S) (if the seller produced) or even c(S) + a(S) (if
the seller produced and lost his opportunity to salvage his investment).
   "The duty to mitigate generally bars a plaintiff from recovering costs incurred after cancellation of the
contract. A canonical example l found in Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co. [1929), where Luten
Bridge Co. continued building a bridge after notice of cancellation was given by Rockingham County.
Rockingharn successfully argued that it owed Luten only the "damages which the company would have
sustained, if it had abandoned construction at that time." Note, however, that some expenses incurred
after cancellation are recoverable. For Instance, advertising expenses are generally recoverable when they
might reasonably increase salvage value; in a typical view, such expenses are recoverable even "where
the result is an aggravation of the damages rather than a mitigation1" if "expenses are the result of a
prudent attempt to mininte damages." (Air. Eddie, inc. a. Ginsberg [1968), a breach of contract
case, where a wrongfully dismissed employee under a three-year employment contract spent $1,340 in
an unsuccessful job search.)

    Proof: Suppose the buyer does not breach, but stands ready, willing, and able to buy.
Then either the seller performs and the buyer pays p and enjoys v(O) from consuming
 the good, or the seller breaches and must pay v(O) — p in damages. Either way,the buyer
has payoff v(O) —p, which is non-negative since p                 infv(O). Performance is therefore a
weakly dominant strategy, since breach would yield the buyer at best 0, and even less if
the seller sued. (Recall that we assumed the buyer cannot breD.ch and sue.)
    If the seller breaches, he will be sued. His payoff will be              the salvage value minus

damages, i.e., i(S) — (t40) — p]. If the seller performs, he receives p — c(s), so he breaches

if and only it"5

                                     a(S) — v(8) —c(S) -                                             (5)

This inequality matches inequality (1), so the parties trade if and only if trade is efficient
cc post. Since expectation damages is a liability rule allowing unilateral breach, no
renegotiation is necessary for efficient trade.
   The seller's investment problem is to choose

                   S E arg maxf maxp — c(S),(S)               —
                                                                  v(9) + pJdF — S   .                (6)


This optimization differs from the social optimization given by (2) only by adding p—v(O)
in each contingency. Investment incentives are unaltered, so we have shown that choosing
p = mt u(O) induces efficient investment and breach.
   Nonetheless, the buyer must pay the seller an up-front payment to induce him to
sign such a contract unless .trade is always efficient. That is, consider a case where trade
is sometimes inefficient: Le., for some 0', v(O') — c(S)            c a(5).    Since by construction
p v(O'), substitution yields p— c(5) <(S). Without an up-front payment, the seller
would be better off avoiding the contract, investing 5 and selling it as scrap.'80
 "Tin where v(9) = c(s) leave the seller indifferent.
 "If the optimal investment S is not unique, read 5     as   the seller's choice from among the optima.
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                               Page 13




    Thus, the seller invests efficiently if the buyer and seller agree to tradeat the favorable
price given in Proposition I. However, the buyer must often pay the seller some up-front
payment T to convince him to sign the contract under these favorable terms. In fact, an
up-front payment is necessary in cases where Rogerson—Shavell overinvestment occurs,
i.e.. in cases where trade is sometimes inefficient. (Note that the up-front payment might
not be necessary if costs were uncertain as well.)
    A similar efficiency result holds if the buyer invests before the sellefs costs are known.

Proposition 2. Suppose the buyer invests, and let the valuations be u(S) and c(9).
Then if p supc(O), the buyer invests and breaches efficiently.

   Proof: The proof is left to the reader, since it is essentially the same as when the
seller jnvests.O

   Our anumption that the contract breather cannot sue may at times appear punitive
to the breather. For instance, if the buyer invests and the seller fails to deliver, the buyer

keeps any up-front payment. Possibly, the buyer gets more than her expectancy out of
the deal. We previously pointed out that in cases such as our lease example, it is realistic
to think that the party who made the up-front payment has no recourse if she breaches.
Another example is a record club whose membership consists of an initial enrollment
purchase of twelve records for one cent together with the promise to pay a high price for
some number of additional records at a later date. If the club later refused to sell the
additional records (even at the high price), it is doubtful that the initial discounted sale
would be voided, or that the buyer would owe additional money.
   On the other hand, suppose a buyer puts down a deposit on a couch. only to cancel her

purchase subsequently. If the deposit is unreasonably large "in light of the anticipated or
  Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                           Page 14


 actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience
 or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining adequate remedy,"   a court may insist that some
 of it be returned under the Uniform Commercial Code Section      2—718. Yet,   suppose the
 couch were custom-made and that the maker had to order special fabrics and foams with

 lovi resale value, In consideration of this specific investment, the customer makes what
 we call an up-front payment; or, perhaps she simply buys the materials from the maker,
 and a separate contract is written to build the couch, so that if the buyer cancels the
 construction (breaching), she should be entitled to no refund on her purchase of materials
 (or payment for investment). When the buyer is seen to be purchasing the investment
 in a separate deal, the up-front payment will not be refundable to a breaching buyer
 unless the investment were not made. If the up-front payment were made in a separate
agreement. the penalty doctrine might not apply across the agreements.
    Again, we remind the reader that the above analysis is valuable even in those cases or
jurisdictions where the breacher could sue. Then, the analysis provides a policy reason
why a breacher should not be able to sue. Allowing an up-front payment to stand
even when it appears punitive lends the parties considerable contracting power. Notice.
though, that efficiency is not driven simply by allowing what in some cases is tantamount
to high stipulated damages; rather, efficiency results from the combination of these "high
damages" preventing one party from breaching, and the expectation remedy giving the
other party appropriate breach and investment incentives.


2.3. No up-front payrnints: Overinvestment

For the sake of contrast, we show below that if up-front payments are impossible (say,
because of liquidity constraints), then the Rogerson—Sliavell overinvestment problem re-
turns. As the introduction discussed, Shavell [1980J considers
                                                               up-Front payments but
only payments made to the non-investor. Without an up-front payment made to the
Cadillac Contracts and Up.Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                   Page 1.5


investor—seller, he will not agree to the low price that drives Proposition 1; instead, lie
will demand a price p such that


                                                                                               (7)

where . is whatever investment the seller chooses given the contract. (If the inequality
were violated, the seller would always lose money.) With such a "high' price, as we shall
see, the seller always performs and the buyer becomes the potential breacher.
    In order to derive the Rogerson—Shavell overinvestment effect, we must impose addi-
tional structure on the model:

    (Al) —e(S) — '(S) > 0;
    (A2) 5 as defined by (2) is unique and 3 (0,3);
    (A3)
                                    /
                                   Je:v(D)—cs•)ca(s•)
                                                        dF>O.                                  (8)

Assumption (Al states that marginal investment lowers production costs by more than
it increases salvage value.'7 Assumption (A2) is self-explanatory and (A3) states thai
when S = S., salvage is efficient with positive probability. These assumptions abo;.it.
functional form and the uniqueness of 5 were unnecessary to prove Proposition I, but
we need them here to replicate the traditional overinvestment result.

Proposition 3. Assume (Al), (A2), and (A3). Then, without an up-front payment to
the investor—seller, he overinvests. (This proposition is essentially like those of Shavell

fi980j and Rogerson [1984).)

   Proof: As argued above, when up-front payments are impossible. the seller will only
agree to a price p such that p — c(S)         a(S), when evaluated at the investment level
  This assumption corresponds to assumption 3 in Rogerson [1984] except that he wrote it as a weak
inequality, and proved weak overinvestment.
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                           Page 16


he intends to take. Consequently if the buyer stands ready to perform, the seller also
performs and receives p — c(S). (The seller's other alternative is to salvage, which yields

a (S) if the buyer doesn't sue, and even less if the buyer sues.) lithe buyer breaches, the
seller will sue to recover

                              Damage3 = p — c(S) — a(S)                                 (9)

After salvaging his investment for a(s), his net payoff is his expectancy p — c(S), just as
when the buyer performs. The sellers investment problem is therefore


                                    mgxp—c(S)—S.                                       (10)

To prove that the seller overinvests. compare this problem to the joint surplus maximiza-

Lion problem   (2) and
   (A) observe that (A3) guarantees that when S =     S, salvage is efficient with positive
probability;
   (B) subtract the social planner's objective function from the seller's and observe that
the difference is strictly increasing in 5, because of observation (A) and assumption (Al):
and

   (C) apply Milgrom and Shannon's [1994] Monotone Selection Theorem, which implies
that when comparing solutions to two (single—variable) optimization problems, if the first
problem has an objective function with higher returns to increases in the control than
the second, then maximizen for the first optimization problem (weakly) exceed those for
the second.

   The above observations show that the seller's chosen investment weakly exceeds the
social optimum 5. Moreover, observations A and B together imply that the seller
strictly overinvests because his first-order necessary condition is not satisfied by 5..
(Recall that S is interior by assumption.) Intuitively, the seller is overcompensated
for his incremental investment by the expectation damage remedy, because when trade
Cadillac Contracis and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                               Page 17


is inefficient, he receives the full cost savings   that incremental investment would yield
during production, —c'(S), instead of the lesser "social return" from salvage, u'(S). 0

    Overinvestment results when up-front payments to the investor are impossible and

the value of trade to the non-investor is the source of uncertainty. However, as we
have seen, sufficiently large up-front payments to an investing seller combined with a
commensurately low subsequent price ensure efficient investment. Since the buyer has
already almost fully or even fully performed, she will not breach no matter what her value.
This leaves the decision to breach in the hands of the investor. Under an expectation
remedy, a combined breacher—investor gets the full residual surplus a post, and so has
the incentives a ante to invest to maximize this surplus. This principle applies to far
more general contexts than the Rogerson—Shavell model, as shown by the following two
sections.

3. Imperfectly Informed Courts
This brief section demonstrates that the analysis of Section 2 is essentially unchanged
when courts do not observe the true damages. What is critical is that the courts impose
an unbiased measure of damages. This point, which is made in Edlin [1993), has proved
sufficiently provocative to warrant further elaboration.
   Suppose that when true damages are D, the court observes and imposes D, where


                                                                                         (11)

and c represents the court's error or misperception. Assume that the parties cannot
anticipate the direction of the courts bias (i.e., the expected value of Th is D).
   Since we are ignoring litigation costs, if the seller breaches, the risk-neutral buyer will

still bring a case whenever the true damages D are positive. Given the low trading price
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                          Page 18


p, the buyer always brings the case. The seller's payoff from breach is

                            i(S) — =a(S)+p—v(9)—e,                                   (12)

and from performance is

                                        p—c(S).                                      (13)

The risk-neutral seller breaches whenever the expected payoff from breach exceeds that
from performance. This leads to the same breach rule as when the court's decision is
predictable. Moreover, the seller's expected payoff is the same as before, so the seller
has the same investment incentives. Thus, the unpredictability of court outcomes does

not alter the analysis as long as the court imposes an unbiased judgement D of damages,
which establishes the following proposition:

Proposition 4. Proposition .2 holds even if the court does not observe true damages, as
long as the court (observes some in formative signal and) enforces an unbiased estimate
of damages.

   Proposition 4 partially addresses the criticisms of Schwartz 11993, 406] about the

information requirements of other mechanisms that might be used as problem-solving
defaults. Of course, courts introduce a number of biases. Principal among these is
the "certainty" requirement. Courts will not guess at damages if their information is
woefully inadequate to the task. For instance, the new business rule "prohibits recovery
of lost profits resulting from a breach of contract that has prevented the plaintiff from
establishing a proposed new business, on the ground that profits in such cases are too
speculative" (Fuller and Eisenberg [1990, p. 267]). In parallel fashion, in Freund v.
Washington Square [1974], the Court of Appeals of New York found that Freund was
entitled to only nominal damages for Washington Square's breach of a contract to publish
his book; sales were unpredictable, so only token damages could be awarded. Such a
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                         Page 19


 result biases damages downward. Therefore this model lends support to what Fuller and
 Eisenberg [1990, p. 267] label a "definite trend toward abrogating" the new business
 doctrine, and similarly to the flavor of the Official Comment in the Uniform Commercial
 Code to Section 1—106, which states that "Compensatory damages are often at best
approximate: they have to be proved with whatever definiteness and accuracy the facts
permit, but no more..." For a case in line with these trends, see ['era v. Village Plaza
(19761, where the Michigan Supreme Court upheld a $200,000 jury verdict in favor of the
plaintiffs who had signed a ten-year lease in order to open a "book and bottle" shop.
(The plaintiffs were unable to take possession because the defendant subsequently leased
the space to a third party.)

4. General Settings and a Broad Duty to Mitigate

The principles developed in Section 2.2 are quite general, as this section reveals. This
generality gives the expectation remedy significant advantages over specific performance
in one-sided investment problems. To realize these advantages, a broad duty to mitigate
damages is a useful supplement to an expectation remedy when the seller invests. When
the buyer invests, a divisible contract is correspondingly useful.

   Consider a more general setting where the seller may supply many goods and services
to the buyer, perhaps at different times and in different quantities or qualities. Let q
represent a list of the goods and services delivered, chosen from some set Q. Let v(q, 0)
represent the value to the buyer of q in contingency 9.
   (Ri) Assume Q has a maximal element with non-negative value: i.e.,

                3 s.t. YO,q,      v(q,O) v(,9),           and, v(,9) 0.             (14)

Definition 3. A Cadillac contract is a contract to trade a maximal element      .
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                          Page 20


     Cadillacs are large, luxurious cars, traditionally at the top of GMs line. Accordingly,
 a Cadillac contract is a top-of-the-line contract for a larger quantity or more quality
 than is generally efficient to trade. In fact, we have defined an extreme form of Cadillac
 contract involving the most valuable trade possible. If the Department of Defense orders

 ,5O jet fighters of extraordinary capabilities, this may be & Cadillac contract. It will
 function as one if any renegotiations will be for jets with fewer capabilities and/or for
 fewer jets. Similarly, when a moving company promises to deliver all your belongings to
your new residence intact, this is as valuable as their performance could be. (Those who
have moved will know that many times their performanèe falls a touch below this high
standard.)
     A Cadillac contract generalizes an important feature of any non- random contract to
trade in a discrete trade/no-trade context. It implies that any adjustments in trade are
"downward." This feature was subtly implicit in the contracts in Section 2.
    In this section, we assume the seller can buy m assets, denoted by S e             R, which may
affect the cost of performing q. (Each of the nt assets may vary in scale or quality since
each is associated with a real number.) The assets cost I(S) , where                 I R' ' R Let
the cx post cost of producing q be c(S,q,9). The costs c represent the most economical
method of producing q with S given 9. In some contingencies, this may involve selling
as salvage some of the assets embodied in S; in others, all of S may be fully used in
production. It is worthwhile keeping in mind that the function c is a reduced form,
which may capture sophisticated deployment decisions)8
    Suppose the parties have written a Cadillac contract to "trad&'                    with the entire
        an example, let A E 20 m) represent the indices of the assets put to alternative use. (A can
be any subset of {1     m}.) Then the assets in alternative use can be represented as LEA           where
   is the jUt element of S and e is the ith unit vector (0    1,..., 0). The value derived from the assets
put to alternative use is a(EIEA Seb9) . Suppose further that the costs of production of q using the
assets not in A i (LA Sej, q, 9). Then, we would have
  c(S, q,9) a — max [ä(E,EA Sej, 9)—              S,eg, q.9)]
Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                     Page 21


payment T made up front, so that no payment is required when                 is performed.1° Con-
sider the situation after the investment S is made and contingency U realized. What will
the seller supply? If the seller supplies q , the buyer can accept or reject the tender.
Regardless, the buyer will sue because by (BI), v(.9) v(q,O), so the buyer suffers
non-negative damages.2° If the buyer accepts q, her damages are

                                      D=v(.9)—v(q,9).                                           (15)

lithe buyer rejects q, her damages depend upon the law's view of the duty to mitigate
damages. If mitigation requires accepting partial or inferior performance1 the buyer can
recover at most v(,9) — v(q,O), which motivates the following definition.

Definition 4. Suppose a buyer has paid up front and been promised . Under a broad
duty to mitigate damages, if offered q. the buyer can collect only u(.O) — v(q,6) in
damages.

    Vithout a broad duty to mitigate, the breach victim may secure more than the benefit
of her bargain by threatening to refuse q unless the seller agrees to pay larger damages.
This duty to mitigate is broader than often obtains. For instance, in Parker u. Twentieth
Century-Fox [1970J, the California Supreme Court held that Shirley MacLame Parker did
not need to accept Twentieth Century's offer to star in a western titled "Big Country,
Big Man" to mitigate damages for Twentieth Century1s breach of the contract in which
she was to star in a musical titled "Bloomer Girl." Also, in the context of the sale of
goods, under the Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-601, the buyer has the right to
"reject the whole" if "the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform
  '91t is possible to have some payments made at performance, but that requires a detailed discussion
of the importance of a divisible contract.
  20We assume that the non-conforming performance q call be accepted without compromising the
buyer's rights to her expectancy.
  Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                                      Page 22


  to the contract.'21 Moreover, under Section 2-711 a "rightful" rejection by the buyer
 leaves her with the same remedies as lithe seller had not performed at all. Nonetheless,
 while a broad duty to mitigate may not presently obtain, the next proposition indicates
 it would have some advantages.

 Proposition 5. A Cadillac contract to supply                for an up-front payment T leads to
 efficient investment and breach when an expectation damage measure is applied and the

 buyer has a broad duty to mitigate damages.

     Proof: Joint surplus is maximized by solving the fOllowing iterative program: Ex
 post, given assets S, and the realized contingency 0, choose q to solve

                               Z(S,9) rnaxv(q,9) — c(S,q,9)             .                         (16)

 Ex ante, joint surplus is maximized by choosing S to solve


                                      mg.xEEZ(S,Ofl—I(S)                                          (17)

where E denotes the expectation operator.
    Under a Cadillac contract, with payment T made entirely up front, the seller solves
a nearly identical problem. Suppose the seller delivers q 4. Given the broad duty
to mitigate damages, the buyer's rights will be limited to damages of v(4, 0) — v(q, 0)
regardless of whether he rejects or accepts q. Since the contract is a Cadillac contract,
v(4, 9)— v(q, 0)     0, so the buyer will, in fact, demand, and if necessary sue for, payment
of v(4, 9) — v(q, 0). Therefcre, given S and 0, the seller chooses q ex post to solve


                             W(S,O)=rIaQx—D(q,9)_c(S,q,9) ,                                      (18)

where damages D(q,9) = v(q,9)         —
                                          v(q,9).
  31/is other sections in the Uniform Commercial Code make clear
                                                                 these rights of rejection should not
be read overly broadly, but they do apply to non-conformities that go to "the heart of the agreement."
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                             Page 23


     The seller's ex post objective function is the same as the joint surplus less u(,O), so
 the seller's optimal choices of q match those from surplus maximization. The seller's ex
 ante investment problem is to solve

                                   mgxE[W(S9)]—I(S)                                      (19)
 Since W(S,O)     Z(S,O) — v(, 0), the seller's cx ante choices of S similarly match those
 under joint surplus maximization, and the Cadillac contract to trade         for a payment
 made entirely up front leads to full first-best efficiency. 0

    The expectation damage remedy allows us to find a contract that leads to efficient

 choice of assets; efficient use of assets, and efficient performance or breach. Compare this

 with specific performance. Under a specific performance remedy, when the investment
decision is a one-dimensional decision, fixed-price contracts can be efficient. These results
require a continuous contractible variable q and a number of assumptions about how in-

vestment affects valuations (see Aghion, Dewatripont, and Rey [1994], ('hung [19911, and
Edlin and Reichelstein [19931). None of these assumptions are needed for the approach
above. Moreover, even with those assumptions, the first-best can't be implemented un-
der specific performance when the investment decision is multi-dimensional (Edlin [1993]
revealed, for instance, a bias toward investing in overspecialized assets instead of as-
sets with higher values in alternative uses). No such biases exist under an expectation
damage remedy with up-front payments and a Cadillac contract. Provided the parties
can arrange for one party to make all the cx ante investment expenditures and decisions

together with ex-post breach decisions, expectation damages is an ideal remedy.
   The intuition behind Proposition 5 is as follows. A large up-front payment by the
non-investing buyer to the investing seller ensures that the buyer performs the contract.
A broad duty to mitigate damages, including accepting non-conforming performance.
leaves the breach decision unilaterally in the hands of the investor. Otherwise some

 renegotiation would be necessary because the buyer could refuse a non-conlorming tender;

 such renegotiation would typically involve splitting the returns to investment, which
 could distort investment incentives. The Cadillac contract eliminates contingencies where
 overperformance is efficient. Such contingencies also require bilateral negotiations and
 typically entail sharing the gains from extra performance, again distorting investment
 incentives. (The seller cannot capture all the gains from performing q when u (q. 0) >


     When the buyer invests, instead of the seller, the analysis proceeds similarly. For this
  non•balancing' approach, we would then want the buyer to effectively dictate the level
of performance and capture the residual created beyond the seller's expectancy. Two
features are necessary. A Cadillac contract would ensure that the seller has a duty to
deliver performance at least as valuable as is efficient. Second, if the buyer decides he
wants to cancel (the inefficient) part of performance, this must not discharge the seller's
remaining duty to perform the non-cancelled parts of the contract. This requires that the
court construe the contract as "divisible"—essentially as a number of separate smaller
contracts. Such a construction allows the buyer to cancel inefficient parts of the contract
and still have the seller deliver the efficient parts or pay compensatory damages.22 It
thereby avoids negotiation and surplus—splitting, allowing the buyer—investor to capture
alt residual, just as the broad duty to mitigate allowed the seller-investor to capture all
residual in Proposition 5.
  ln some cases where the buyer invests, a divisible contract is unnecessary. For instance, in our lease
example the economics department (the buyer) invests. The department      has a property right to stay
(or the duration of the tease; moreover, it can move out early without
                                                                      needing any agreement from the
landlord (though it would owe damages). Thus the law allocates decisionrights over q to the lessee, (at
least when q <i), which means no divisible contract is needed.

5. Implications
The central result of this paper is that the expectation damage remedy need not lead to
overinvestment in relationship-specificassets. In fact, even in the very general context
of Section 4. we found that all decisions were first-best. The conventional wisdom in the

law and economics literature about distorted investment resulted from assumptions about

which party breached, a fact noted by Shavell [1980] in the simple discrete-trade context
of Section 2. Yet. even in that simple context, a major part of the puzzle was left out: If

up-front payments to the investor are possible, the party who breaches is not determined
exogenously by which party has uncertain valuations, as Shavell (19S0j assumed. Quite
the contrary. when such up-front payments are possible, the parties themselves control
who will want to breach in low-trade contingencies. When the non-investing party makes

a sufficiently large up-front payment, she will want to carry out the contract even if
her valuation proves unfavorable—any breach will be made by the investing party. This
arrangement provides efficient investment and breach incentives under the expectation

damage formula.
   Thus when one party needs to make a specific investment, it is natural that the other

should make some payment early. An up-front payment is desirable even when neither

party will flee or become bankrupt and the legal system costlessly enforces contracts.
The payment determines who wants to breach, which is critical under an expectation
damage remedy.
   From this analysis we learn a number of lessons about policy. Notice first that we
assumed that the breaching party could not successfully sue. This prevented the "race to
breach discussed in Section 2, allowing the parties to control who breached. This argues
that courts should be skeptical of unjust enrichment claims, or at least honor contracts
that give up the right to sue for unjust enrichment. Similarly, we provide another reason
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlin                           Page 26


 why courts should not invoke the penalty doctrine to return deposits.
    Another lesson is that the courts should take a broader view of the duty to mitigate—
 or at least stand ready to take a broad view if requested in the contract. Such a view of

 mitigation was critical to the efficiency of Cadillac contracts in Section 4. Correspond-

 ingly, when the buyer is the investor, the critical issue becomes the divisibility of the
 contract.

    A third lesson is that specific performance is not always the best remedy when specific
 investments are involved. Edlin and Reichelstein [1993] argued that specific performance
 is superior when both parties make investments (but wheie the investments were simplis-

tic). Vet when the investment and breach decisions can all be allocated to one party, the
expectation remedy is superior because multi-faceted investment can be efficient. There-
fore, when parties neglect to specify a remedy, as they often do, expectation damages is
a good default rule in one-sided investment problems. Its application implies that the ex
ante incentives of the contract breacher were appropriate (at least the incentives arising
from the given contingency). These first-best incentives may very vell be gotten at the
expense of incentives for the victim of breach (see Edlin and Reichelstein [1993]), but
this will not matter if the victim does not make substantial reliance decisions.
   The victim of breach may seek specific performance, because she may use the threat of
forcing inefficient performance to increase her total payoff. The courts, however, should
be loathe to grant it unless she can show some reliance or specific investment of her own.
This proposal might be viewed as giving a new interpretation to the rule that specific
performance is only granted when the "legal remedy" of damages are "inadequate." The
inadequacy of damages is traditionally viewed as meaning that damages are difficult
to measure, such as with unique chattel. Section 3, however, showed that difficulty of
measurement per se is not particularly important. The model indicates that the victim of
breach should have to show that the remedy is "inadequate" because it does not provide
 Cadillac Contracts and Up-Front Payments: by A.S. Edlln                                       Page 27


 partks in her position with appropriate incentives ex ante. Expectation damages                 would
 not provide appropriate incentives to the victim of breach (see Rogerson 11984], Shavell

 [1980], and Edlin and R.eicbelstein 11993J). When the breach victim also must invest,

 then, specific performance is better as it provides more balanced incentives (see Edlin
and Reicheistein (1993)).
     Finally, we should ponder the implications of Section 3, which explained that the
accuracy of the expectation measure is not so important as its unbiasedness. This sug-

gests that it is worthwhile to consider the efficacy of certain legal rules that tend to bias
damages. One such rule is the rule that damages must be "certain".

     Before closing, it is worth recalling some assumptions          that warrant examination in
future work. In particular, we have stuck to the Rogerson 11984] and Shavell [1980)
assumption that courts are costless. This allows a better understanding of their work, h,

relaxing the assumption would clearly be worthwhile to gain a more accurate descripi

theory. Relaxing the risk-neutrality assumption would also be a valuable exercise.
