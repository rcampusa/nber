                                               ABSTRACT

Using Danish administrative data, we estimate the impact of bequests on the level and inequality of
wealth. We employ an event study design where we follow the distribution of wealth over time of
people who are 45-50 years old, and divide them into treatment group and control group depending
on whether a parent dies or not. Bequests account for 26 percent of the average post-bequest wealth
1-3 years after parental death and significantly affect wealth throughout the distribution. We find that
bequests increase measures of absolute wealth inequality (variance), but reduce relative inequality
(top wealth shares). Following the receipt of bequests, variance of the distribution censored at the top/bottom
1% increases by 33 percent, but the top 1% share declines by 6 percentage points from an initial level
of 31 percent and the top 10% share declines by 10 percentage points from a base of around 81 percent.

Intergenerational transfers are one of the main channels through which economic outcomes of

subsequent generations are linked. Influential literature that originated in the 1980s (Kotlikoff and

Summers, 1981; Modigliani, 1988) and is summarized in Davies and Shorrocks (2000) focused on

the contribution of bequests to aggregate wealth (or capital stock). Recent work of Piketty (2011,

2014) brought back to the forefront the question of the role of bequests in shaping inequality.

        In this paper, we use Danish administrative records that allow us to observe wealth of parents

and children and employ an event study design to characterize how the flow of bequests following

death of a parent influences the level and distribution of wealth among children age 45–50.1 In our

companion papers (Boserup, Kopczuk and Kreiner, 2015a,b) we study more generally the strength

of intergenerational wealth correlation, accounting for the role of human capital transmissions,

inter-vivos gifts, and bequests.

        We find that bequests increase average wealth of recipients by about 36 percent implying that

bequests account for 26 percent of average post-bequest wealth.

        It is unclear a priori whether bequests are dis-equalizing or equalizing. Bequests may dispro-

portionately benefit poor individuals and reduce inequality or they may primarily increase wealth

of people who are already wealthy and enhance inequality.

        We find that bequests increase the variance of wealth (censored at 1st and 99th percentiles)

by 33 percent and that this level is the same three years after parental death. The percentiles

in the wealth distribution increase, and the higher the percentile the larger the absolute increase.

Thus, bequests stretch the distribution to the right. This large increase in absolute inequality is not

reflected in relative inequality measures such as top wealth shares. For example, the top 1% wealth

share decreases by 6 percentage points from a pre-bequest level of 31 percent. Thus, whether

bequests are dis-equalizing or equalizing depends on whether inequality is measured in absolute

terms or relative terms.



1        Institutional background

Denmark has forced heir-ship rules implying that 1/4 of the inheritance has to go to the close

family of the deceased, with an equal split between the spouse and their children. For close family

   In a contemporaneous paper, Elinder, Erixson and Waldenström (2015) pursue a related analysis using Swedish
administrative data.

(other) recipients, bequest is taxed at a flat rate of 15 (36.25) percent above the basic allowance,

which in 2015 equals DKK 272,900 (corresponding to around USD 40,000). A spouse may retain

undivided possession of the estate, implying that wealth is not transferred to the next generation

before death of both parents. Gifts above a small yearly allowance are taxed at the same rates as

bequests, and wealth is untaxed in Denmark.



2        Data and empirical approach

Our empirical analysis is based on population and wealth registers from Statistics Denmark. Pop-

ulation registers enable us to link individuals born in 1960 and onwards to their parents. Wealth

registers contain the aggregate value of asset holdings and liabilities of each individual in the popu-

lation at the end of the year. This information is based mainly on third-party reports from financial

institutions to the Danish tax agency about the value of deposits, bonds, listed stocks, and all types

of debt carrying an interest rate. In addition, the cash value of property is assessed by the tax

agency.2 The data does not include information on pension wealth. We observe wealth of both

parents and children from 2003 to 2013 or until death. More details about the wealth registers may

be found in Boserup, Kopczuk and Kreiner (2015b).

        A limitation of our data is that we do not observe inheritances directly. However, we do observe

wealth of a parent in years preceding death, so that we effectively observe potential bequests. We

also observe changes in children’s wealth that reflect receipt of the actual bequest. Another strength

of the data is that the analysis of the consequences for the wealth of the next generation accounts

not only for bequests, but also for other wealth transfers taking place shortly before death and

expenditures of children related to parental deaths.

        The longitudinal nature of our data and large sample size allow us to implement a simple and

transparent approach, where we compare the distribution of wealth among those whose parent dies

in 2010 (treatment group) to those whose parent remains alive (control group) in the years before

and after parental death. We present our results graphically and illustrate that the parallel trends

assumption is consistent with the data. We focus on children who are between 45 and 50 years old

    It is well-known that assessed housing values for tax purposes are often lower than market values. We follow
Leth-Petersen (2010) and scale up registered housing values by the average ratio of actual house prices to assessed
values for the houses sold in the period 2003-2013, which gives a scaling factor of 1.16.

in 2010, so that parents are observed in the data; and restrict attention to those with a single living

biological parent in 2009, so that parental death corresponds to the flow of bequests to children

(rather than to a surviving spouse).3 This yields a sample of 6,252 individuals in the treatment

group and 148,166 individuals in the control group.

        It is well-known that time of death is related to socio-economic status implying that wealth

of parents (and children) is lower in the treatment group than in the control group. To facilitate

comparison of children receiving bequest with those not receiving bequest, we order parents by

average wealth in 2003–2009 and reweight the control group to match the percentile distribution of

the treatment group for each child cohort. In the electronic appendix, we display average parental

wealth in the treatment group compared to the control group before and after reweighting, as well

as the difference in average wealth of the children in the two groups before reweighting, which may

be compared to the weighted version displayed in Figure 1.



3        Results

Figure 1 shows the average wealth of children in the treatment group relative to the (weighted)

control group, with the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval. In years preceding death of

the parent, there is almost no difference between the two groups (note that matching is on parental

wealth rather than child wealth), supporting the parallel trends assumption. After death of the

parent, child wealth increases markedly relative to the level of wealth observed in the control group.

Due to the timing of inheritance, this effect is partially visible in the year of death and is fully

phased in the year after death of the parent. The increase in the year before death of the parent,

although not significant, may reflect pre-death wealth transfers in order to avoid paying the bequest

tax (Kopczuk, 2007). In the second and third year after parental death, the effect weakens slightly

but this is statistically insignificant.

        In Table 1, we report the difference-in-difference estimate of the change in the average wealth

level of the treatment group from t = −2 to t = 1 relative to the (weighted) control group, which is

equal to DKK 127,130. Comparing this estimated change to the average wealth level of the control

    The parent may have remarried. In this case, spouse and children each inherit half of the estate of the deceased
when the parent dies unless stated otherwise in a will. The spouse cannot retain undivided possession of the estate
unless children give their consent.

group at t = 1, we find that bequests on average increase wealth by 36 percent. Equivalently,

bequests account for 26 percent (=0.36/1.36) of overall wealth of the treatment group, which is

closer to the estimate of Modigliani (1988) than the one by Kotlikoff and Summers (1981).4

       In the rest of the paper, we analyze distributional consequences of bequests. Figure 2, top

panel, shows the impact on the variance of wealth. Distributions are censored at percentiles 1 and

99 for each group in each year to abstract from very low and very high wealth; we analyze the

development of the top 1% separately in what follows. The graph shows the difference between

the variances of the treatment and control group measured relative to the variance of the control

group. There is little difference between the groups before parental death. Following death of a

parent, the variance increases by 33 percent relative to the control group. Under the parallel trends

assumption, this is the causal estimate of the effect of receipt of inheritance on the variance of the

wealth distribution outside of the top and bottom 1%.

       The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the impact of bequests on the 75th percentile of the wealth

distribution. It is computed by taking the difference between the 75th percentiles of the treatment

group and of the (weighted) control group. In line with the parallel trend assumption, the curve

is flat until the year before death of a parent, with almost no difference between treatment and

control groups, and then jumps up to a new level of around DKK 150,000. Similar graphs for other

percentiles reveal qualitatively the same type of development, but quantitatively we observe that

the increase is larger the higher the percentile. This is summarized in Table 1, which also shows

the wealth level of each percentile without including bequest, calculated from the control group.

All the percentiles increase, but the amounts are small in the lower part of the distribution and

increase as we move up in the distribution, implying that the distribution widens everywhere.

       Much of recent work on inequality has focused on relative rather than absolute inequality.

While bequests increase variance, they might still equalize relative distribution. For example, a

proportional increase in wealth levels of everybody increases variance without affecting top wealth

shares and the Gini coefficient. In that respect, notice from Table 1 that the median wealth level

increases by more than 90 percent, while the wealth level of the 99th percentile only increases by 17

percent. Thus, although the median increases by a small amount compared to the 99th percentile,
   4
    These results and Figure 1 are based on wealth distributions censored at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Without
censoring, bequests on average increase wealth by 34 percent and bequests account for 25 percent of overall wealth
of the treatment group.

Note: Top 1% share in the treatment and control groups. Weighting as in Figure 1.


the increase is large relative to the low baseline level of wealth holdings.

                         Due to negative wealth at the lower part of the distribution and its high concentration, the Gini

coefficient is not particularly informative. In the following, we focus on the impact of bequests on

wealth shares.

                         Figure 3 displays the development over time in the share of wealth owned by the top 1% richest

within the treatment group and within the control group, respectively. Before death of a parent,

the top 1% wealth share of the treatment group is a little below the level of the control group, but

the two curves are reasonably parallel and co-vary around a share of 20–30 percent. Afterwards,

the gap between the two curves clearly increases and remains stable in the three years after death of

the parent. This implies that bequests decrease the wealth share of the top 1% group. We observe

the same qualitative pattern if looking at the top 5% group or the top 10% group.

                         The results are summarized in Table 2. The first column shows wealth shares without bequests

obtained from the control group. We obtain a top 1% wealth share of 31 percent and a top 10%

share of 81 percent. Our main results in column 2 show that bequests reduce the top shares and

also decrease the wealth shares of the intermediate groups (top 5-1% and top 10-5%). For example,


                                                                                   7

the top 10% share decreases by 10 percentage points from an original level of around 81 percent

(and, correspondingly the share of wealth of the bottom 90% increases by the same amount).

    The estimated wealth shares are comparable to the U.S. ones (see Kopczuk, 2015, for a discus-

sion). The top 1% share in the U.S. is estimated to be between 35 and 40 percent depending on

the method and the top 10% wealth share is around 80 percent. These U.S. estimates are a mix of

before- and after-bequests distributions. Our results suggest that the pre-bequest distribution cor-

responds to higher wealth shares, while the after-bequest distribution corresponds to lower wealth

shares than these estimates indicate.



4     Conclusions

Comparison of wealth holdings of children whose parents die to those whose parents do not allows

for identifying the effect of bequests on the distribution of wealth of the next generation. Our

results show that bequests have on impact a large effect throughout the distribution and increase

the overall variance of wealth by about 33 percent. This large increase in absolute inequality does

not carry over to relative inequality measures such as top wealth shares. On the contrary, top

wealth shares decrease. For example, the top 1% wealth share decreases by 6 percentage points

from the without-bequest level of 31 percent.

    Our estimates are by their nature short term effects. We study the effect only three years out

and, by construction, over time parents in the control group are beginning to die as well. In the



                                                         8
electronic appendix, we follow the same cohorts but look instead at deaths in 2007, where children

are 42-47 years old, and compare the individuals to a control group where the parent is alive in

2013.5 The impact on average wealth is DKK 125,000 at t = 1 as in Figure 1 and more than 60

percent of this effect is still present six years after. The impact on the variance in Figure 2 and on

the top 1% wealth share in Figure 3 becomes slightly larger for this sample and these effects are

almost unchanged up to six years after death of the parent.

       Bequests are only one of the channels behind intergenerational transmission of wealth. Our

companion papers (Boserup, Kopczuk and Kreiner, 2015a,b) study the role of inter-vivos transfers

received in childhood and, more generally, the intergenerational correlation of wealth over the

life-cycle, which depends in part on wealth transfers, but also on intergenerational dependency in

human capital formation and savings patterns.

A     Matching Quality of Reweighting Approach

Figure A.4 below shows average parental wealth in the treatment group and the control group before

reweighting (top panel) and after reweighting (bottom panel). We reweight the control group to

match, for each child cohort, the percentile distribution of parental wealth in the treatment group.

Percentile ranks of the parents are calculated within each child cohort, based on average parental

wealth in the years 2003–2009, where parental wealth is the sum of wealth of the living biological

parents in each year. Without reweighting the two graphs are reasonably parallel, but parental

wealth is significantly lower in the treatment group. This is as expected as it is well-known that

timing of death is correlated with socio-economic status. After reweighting the control group, the

two curves are nearly identical.

    Because of the correlation between parental wealth and time of parental death and intergen-

erational dependency in wealth, it is natural to expect that child wealth of the treatment group

on average is below the level of the control group. Figure A.5 shows the difference between the

average wealth of the treatment group and the control group without reweighting of the control

group. The graph is very similar to Figure 1 in the main text with the exception, as expected, of

a permanently lower level of wealth of the treatment group relative to the control group.

B     Longer Term Effects of Bequests

In the main text, we look at the cohorts who are 45–50 years old in 2010, where the parent dies

in the treatment group, but not in the control group. We can only study the effect three years

out and, by construction, over time parents in the control group are beginning to die as well.

Below, we reconstruct Figures 1–3 in the paper for another sample. We follow the same cohorts

but analyze instead the consequences of parental death in 2007, when children are 42-47 years old,

and compare the individuals to a control group, where the parent is alive in 2013. This gives 4,926

individuals in the treatment group and 136,309 individuals in the control group. The advantage of

this comparison is that we can study a longer term effect. The disadvantage is that the difference

in the timing of parental deaths in the treatment and control groups is now at least seven years,

whereas previously we allowed parents in the control group to die the year after, implying that the

groups are possibly less similar now.

    Figure B.1 shows that the short run impact on average wealth is DKK 125,000, which is the

same as in Figure 1. Six years after death of the parent the effect is slightly above DKK 75,000,

which is more than 60 percent of the effect on impact.

    The effect on the variance of the wealth distribution is displayed in Figure B.2. Bequests

increase the variance by close to 40 percent, which is a little larger than in Figure 2, and the effect

is still 35 percent six years after.

    The top 1% wealth shares of the treatment group and the control group are displayed in Figure

B.3. The graphs are more noisy than those in Figure 3. However, it is still clear that the wealth

share decreases relative to the control group after death of the parent. The difference between the

two curves is approximately 20 percentage points prior to death of the parent and 10 percentage

points after death of the parent, implying that the top 1% wealth share of the treatment group

declines by around 10 percentage points, which is slightly higher than the effects obtained when

studying death of parents in 2010. Finally, note that the curves are completely parallel after death

of the parent. Thus, the effect seems more or less constant over the six year period after receiving

bequest.
