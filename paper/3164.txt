                 NATIONAL SAVING AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT


                                   ABSTRACT

     This paper extends earlier work by Feld.stein and Moriok.a on the relation
between domestic saving rates and international capital f lows or, equivalently,
between domestic saving rates and domestic investment.   The basic conclusion of
the present analysis is that an increase in domestic saving has a substantial
effect on the level of domestic investment although a smaller effect than would
have been observed in the 1960s and 1970s. The savings retention coefficient
for the 1980-86 period is 0.79. down from 0.91 in the l960s and 0.86 in the
1970s.
     The more closely integrated economies of the EEC also appear to have more
outward capital mobility (i.e., a lower saving retention coefficient) than
other OECD countries.
     There is no support for the view that the estimated saving-investment
relation reflecta a spurious impact of an omitted economic growth variable.
     Although budget deficits are inversely related to the difference between
private investment end private saving, we reject the view that this reflects an
endogenoua response of fiscal policy in favor to the alter-native interpretation
that the negative reletion is evidence of crowding out of private investment by
budget deficits. This interpretation is supported by the evidence that
domestic investment responds equally to private saving and to budget deficits.
     The implication of the analysis thus supports the original Feldstein-
Horioka conclusion that increase in domestic saving does raise a nation's
capital stock and therefore the productivity of its workforce. Similarly, a
tax on capital income is not likely to be shifted fully to labor and land by
the outflow of enough capital to maintain the real rate of return unchanged.

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Do tax policies that stimulate a nation's private saving rate increase

its domestic capital stock or do the extra savings flow abroad? Does an

intrease in the corporate tax rate cause an outflow of capital that shifts the

burden of that tax increase to labor and land?

     Theae were the two key questions that motivated the 1980 Feldstein—

Horioka (PH) study of the relation between domestic saving rates and domestic

investment. PH reasoned that if domestic saving were added to a world saving

pool and domestic investment competed for funds in that asne world saving

pool, there would be no correlation between a nation's saving rate and its

rate of investment. The statistical evidence showed that, on the contrary.

the long—term saving and investment rates of the individual industrialized

countries in the OECD are highly correlated. The data were consistent with

the view that a sustained one percentage point increase in the saving rate

induced nearly a one percentage point increase in the investment rate.

      Much has happened in the international capital markets during the decade

since the Feldstein—Horioka study was done. The l980a saw an unprecedented

increase in the international flow of capital to the United Statee. Capital

market barriers in Japan and Europe have been lowered or eliminated. This
                                        2

experience raises the question of whether the empirical regularity observed

for the l96Os and 1970a continued through the 1980s. Even those studies that

followed Feldstein—Horioka1 were limited to data for the l970s or the early

1980s. One purpose of the present study is to examine the experience for the

period 1980 through 1986 and to compare the results with the analysis for

earlier years.



1.1 International Caoital Mobility end Risk Aversion

     The initial PU peper created confusion about the interpretation of the

results by discussing them as evidence about international capital mobility.

Economists who believe that the evidence on interest arbitrage implies that

there is perfect capital mobility were therefore inclined to reject the FH

findings. Fortunately1 Jeffrey Frankel (1986) clarified the issue by

reminding everyone that perfect capital mobility does not imply the
                                                                       -
international equalization of çgj, interest rates.2

     More specifically, as Frankel pointed out, the interest arbitrsge

condition of integrated capital markets refers to nominal interest rates only.

Perfect capital mobility implies equal cx ante real interest rates only for

time periods for which the expected change in the exchange rate equals the

difference in the expected inflation rates. As Frankel stresses, since cx

ante purchasing power parity may not hold even for periods as long as a

decade, the existence of perfect capital markets (in the sense that the



     1 These include Feldstein (1983), Caprio and Howard (1984), Murphy
(1984), Penati and Dooley (1984), Sachs (1981), and Summers (1988). See
Dooley et al. (1987) for a summary of these results,

     2 For a more complete discussion of theee issues, see the essay by
Frenkel in the current volume,
                                       3


interest differential between two countries is equal to the expected change in

the nominal exchange rate) does not imply a continuing equality of expected

real interest rates. An increase in saving in one country that gives rise to

an equal increase in its investment need not violate the nominal interest

arbitrage condition even though it causes a decline in the real interest rate.

     Purchasing power parity does not appear to hold even in the long run that

is relevant for the tax policy questions that motivated this research. But

even if it did, in that very long run the difference between the nominal

interest rates in each pair of countries may no longer equal the expected

change in the exchange rate because of inveator risk aversion. An investor

looking ahead for ten years or more must be concerned about risks of changes

in tax rules on foreign source income or even in political institutions that

can affect the velue of hia international investments. Opportunities to hedge

the interest rate or exchange rate risk on long—term positions are far more

limited than for short—term positions, or at least have been until quite

recently. For such long horizons, investor risk aversion may induce portfolio

investors to prefer investments in their own currency. As a result, expected

real interest retes may also differ internationally in the long run.

     In a risklesa world, long—term nominal interest rate arbitrage could be

achieved even though international investors only took net positions in the

short—term market if domestic investors arbitrsged short—term end long—term

domestic interest rates. Once risk is introduced, however, arbitrage by

hedged international short—term investors and the equilibrium of risk—averse

domestic investors who hold both long—ten and short—tens securities is not

enough to provide international equality of long—term rates.
                                       4

     As an example, a mean—variance investor will allocate his wealth among

assets in proportions that vary positively with yield and inversely with risk.

An investor who has a high degree of risk aversion or who attributes a large

subjective variance to long—term investments in foreign assets may want to

invest a large share of his portfolio in domestic assets (depending on asset

yield covariances) even when a substantial expected yield difference exists in

favor of the foreign assets. Since the mean—variance investor's optimal

proportional allocation of the assets is independent of the total value, an

increase in saving that raiaes the total pool of funds will be invested

primarily in the domestic economy.

     In abort, there is no presumption that real long—term yields would be

equalized even if all investors were completely free to invest wherever in the

world they want. Moreover, broad classes of financial institutions (and, in

some countries nonfinancial corporations as well) are in fact not permitted

by regulatory authorities to take net positions in foreign currencies. Many

nonfinancial corporations also choose to avoid net foreign exchange exposure

as a matter of policy rather than to evaluate the opportunities available at

each point in time, The absence of these substantial pools of funds from the

potential pool of arbitrage funds would not be important if other investors

were risk neutral, However, if the remaining investors are risk averse, the

limited size of the mobile pooi of unhedged funds increases the potential

importance of risk aversion and therefore the scope for expected real rates of

return to remain unequal.
1.2 Government Policies and the Current Account

    Although the lack of cx ante purchasing power parity and the risk—

aversion of international investors are sufficient to permit domestic ssving

rates to influence substantially the rate of domestic investment, the observed

link between saving and investment may also reflect explicit government policy

decisions.

     It is easy to understand why governments would want to restrict the size

of trsde imbalances in general and of changes in trade imbalances in

particular. Since an increase in the merchandise trade deficit means a loss

of exports and the eubstitution of imports for domestic production. the

affected domestic industries are likely to seek government actions to shrink

the trade deficit. A decrease in the merchandise trade deficit caused by a

spontaneous increase in the demand for the country's exports may be welcome if

there is excess capacity in the economy but would be resisted by the

government as a source of inflation if there is not excess capacity. Since a

rise in exports in a fully employed economy also means a fall in the

production of other goods end services, the industries producing for the

domestic market are likely to seek policies to reverse the rise in exports.

     These arguments refer to changes in the trade balance rather than to its

level. Why should a government resist a long—run current account deficit or

surplus? One answer is that en economy that starts in trade balance will not

went to shift to a long—run imbalance because of its reluctance to accept the

dislocations involved in changing the pattern of production from trade balance

to trade imbalance. But there are also reasons why a government would resist

a long—term trade and current account imbalance in addition to the prohlems of

transition.
                                          6


      Because of capital income taxes, a persistent capital outflow diverts

domestic savings to investment abroad that has a lover return to the

originating nation, Each government therefore has an incentive to seek a

capital inflow and to resist the outflow of its own capital.

     A country with a trade surplus and a capital outflow also has the

opportunity to trade a reduction in the trade surplus for a higher level of

real income (through an improvement in the terms of trade) and a temporarily

lower level of inflation (through the favorable "supply shock" of an increase

in the level of the currency)

     There are s variety of policies that governments can use to shift the

economy toward trade and current account balance. In the short run, monetary

policy can be used to influence the exchange rate and the level of economic

activity. Summers (1988) has suggested that governments may tailor the size

of the budget deficit to offset differences between private saving and

investment. Other possibilities include the usa of targeted tax policies

designed to increase or decrease the level of investment or private saving:

the investment tax credit, the schedule of depreciation allowances, the

availability of special tax preferred savings accounts, a difference in the

tax rates on capital and labor income, etc.



1.3 ImvlicaiJ.cj. for the Effects....of Fiscal Policies

     The reason that saving and investment are closely correlated is important

for answering the questions that motivated the original study.

     Consider the Summers hypothesis that the close correlation between

investment and savings reflects the response of government deficit policy co

shifts in private investment and saving. If a cax change that encourages
                                       7

private saving is offset by an increase in the government budget deficit,

there is no rise in capital formation. If however the close correlation

between saving and investment reflects either the reluctance of private risk

averse investors to move capital abroad (so that private investment rises

automatically) or a government tax policy to stimulate private investment

until it absorbs all of the increase in domestic saving (rather then permit a

capital outflow or a contraction of national income), the tax induced rise in

seving does get converted into greater domestic capital formation.

     The reason for the observed saving—investment correlation is also

important for assessing whether a tax on investment income causes a capital

outflow that perrzits the incidence of the tax to be shifted to labor. If the

observed saving—investment correlation reflects the unwillingness of risk—

averse domestic investors to shift capital abroad, the increase in the capital

tax causes a fall in the net of tax rate of return and thus no shifting of the

tax burden. In contrast, if the savings—investment equality occurs because of

a government decision to increase the budget deficit to absorb the capital

that would otherwise go abroad, leaving just enough domestic saving to finance

a level of investment at which the after—tax return is equal to the after—tax

return abroad, the tax is fully shifted.

     In support of the "endogenous deficit policy" hypothesis, Summers

presents a regression for a cross—section of industrialized countries of the

average deficit—CNP ratio for the period 1973 through 1980 on the average

private savings—investment gap (the difference between net private savings and

net private investment) for those same years. He finds a coefficient of 0.72

and concludes that it implies that 72 percent of the net savings gap may be

offset by an explicit hudget deficit policy.
     There ie however a quite different interpretation of the Summers deficit

regression. If the long—run level of the budget deficit is thought of as

exogenous (reflecting political considerations in the county rather than an

attempt to offset the savings—investment gap), then the regression may only

reflect the impact of the budget deficit on the level of investment. This

would be the traditional crowding out of private investment by government

deficita. Summers presents no evidence or reason to think that his regression

should be interpreted as a policy response function rather than as a

description of the crowding out of private investment by government deficits.

We return to this in section 5 below.



1.4 Statistical Estimates

     First however we will turn to the evidence on the link between savings

and investment in the most recently available data. We also take this

opportunity to consider whether the correlation between savinga and investment

is equally strong for different subsets of countries within the OECD,

including separate analyses for the EEC and non—EEC countries.

     Previous comments on the FH regressions raised the issue of the poasible

endogeneity of national aavings rates. This was actually discussed in the

original Fl! paper and estimates using instrumental variables provided as a

check on the possible bias from this aource. The instrumental variables were

demographic and social security variables   The resulting coefficient

confirmed the ordinary least squares results. Since this issue has been

explored rather thoroughly in the earlier paper, we will not present such

instrumental variable estimates in the current analysis.
                                               9
      We will however examine two other issues in some detail. -The first is

the suggestion by Obstfeld thst the observed correlation may reflect the                -




coamon influence of economic growth on both saving and investment. We

replicate the Obstfeld analysis in section 3 and show that although it can in

theory explain the observed sevings—investment correlation, the ectual data

are not consistent with the Obatfeld hypothesis.

      The second is an analysis of the dynamic adjustment process by which

savings snd investment adjust to changes in the savings—investment gap. We

show in section 6 that the process cen be described as an adjustment of

investment to close the gap end not an adjustment of savings. We also present

some evidence that suggests that the desired gap is not zero in all countries

but that countries adjuat investment to close the difference between the

actual savings—investment gap and s preferred gap.                                 -




2.   15 CAPITAL MARKET INTEGRATION INCREAflZGl

      The   reduction in government barriers to international           capital flows, the

creation    of extensive new hedging markets, and the growing sophistication of
financial    institutions around the world have increased the likelihood of net

capital flows. The sharp fall in the U.S. national saving rate in the 1950s

(due to both the increased budget deficit and the decline in private sawing)

also provided a major incentive for the shift of capital to the United States.

      The evidence in this section indicates that there has in fact bean a

substantial decline in the correlation between the rates of gross domestic

saving and gross domestic investment. However, the effect of additional

domestic saving on domestic investment remains quite substantial. Even in- the
                                          10

l980s, each dollar of additional saving is associated with an increase in

investment of more than 50 cents.

        The analysis is based on tha regression equ.ation



                   —
(1.1)                  a0 + a1


where       is gross investment (as defined by the OECD and including inventory

investment), Y is gross domestic product, and         is gross saving. The

estimates use data for 23 OECD countries (excluding Luxembourg). The unit of

observation is a single country and the data for that country has been

averaged over a group of years. The coefficient a1 that indicates the

proportion of the incremental savings that is invested domestically will be

referred to as the "savings retention coefficient."

        Consider first the estimates for gross investment presented in colwsn I

of table 1. In the decade of the l960s, each extra dollar of domestic saving

increased domestic investment 91.4 cents with a standard error of 6.3 cents.

For the next decade this had declined to 80.5 cents with a standard error of

12.1 cents. The decline of 10.9 cents is, however, less than the 13.6 cent

standard error of the difference. The seven available years of the l9SOs

shows a further decline to 60.7 cents with a standard error of 12.6 cents.

Although the 19.8 cents decline from the l970s is only slightly larger than

the associated standard error of 17.5 cents, the pattern of continuing decline

from the 1960s implies a more significant relation. Prom the 1960s to the

1980s the decline of 30.7 cents is more than twice the standard error

associated with this difference.
                                      11

     Another way of comparing the earlier and later parts of the 27 year

sample period is to contrast the earlier fixed exchange rate years (1960—73)

with the later floating rate years (1974—86). During the earlier 14 years the

savings retention coefficient was 0.911 (standard error 0.066), barely

different from the result for the decade of the l960s. The coefficient for

the later 13 years was however 0.669, much more similar to the coefficient for

the 1980s. The difference of 0.242 is approximately 1.5 times its standard

error.

     The final row of column 1 shows that, for the 27 yeer period aa a whole,

the savings retention coefficient was 0.791 with a standard error of 0,094. A

potentially interesting line of analysis that we have not pursued would be to

test whether the investment—savings relation has changed at a constant rate

during this period or has had significant step changes after the beginning of

the floating rate period or in the decade of the 1980s.

     The net saving and investment relations (shown in column 2 of Table 1) do

not indicate a fall over time similar to the corresponding gross saving—

investment coefficients. The key ssvings retention coefficient only declines

from 0.913 in the 1960s to 0.864 in the l970s and 0.792 in 1980—86; none of

the differences, including the difference between the 1960s and the l980s, is

a as large as its standard error.

     This difference between the gross and net saving—investment relations

masks a more complex difference between the changes over time in the European

Economic Community (EEC) countries and among the non—EEC industrial countries

of the OECD. The differences in experience among different groups of

countries is the subject of the next section of this paper.

3. CAPITAL FLOWS AND TEE EEC

     Although capital might in principle flow with equal ease among all

countries or at least all industrial countries, the availability of market

information the existence of institutional relationships, and the perception

of risk might make capital flows greater among some pairs of countries than

among others. More specifically, in the current context, each extra dollar of

saving in one country may be divided between the home capital market (which

gets the largest share) and other individual national capital markets in a way

which depends on a variety of institutional and other country—specific

factors.

     We have explored this possibility by looking separately at the

investment—saving equation for nine of the European Economic Community

(excluding the new entrants Spain and Portugal, aa well as Luxembourg) and

the investment—saving equation for the remaining 14 OECD countries. It should

be emphasized that the EEC savings retention coefficient does not reflect the

extent of the capital flow among the EEC countries but rather the extent to

which individual EEC countries retain their national saving within the saving

country.

     Consider first the behavior of the investment—savings relation in the

nine EEC countries shown in columns 3 and 4 of table 1. The gross savings

retention coefficients, shown in column 3, are lower among the EEC countries

than for the entire OECD group and decline much more rapidly between the l970s

and the 1980s. The decline from 0.742 in the 1960s to 0.652 in the 1970s was

not large but this was followed by a sharp decline to only 0.356 in the 1980—

86 period. By comparison, the coefficients of the 14 non—EEC members of the

OECD were 0.962 in the 1960s, 0.810 in the l970s and 0.578 in the l980s.
                                       13

      We should caution, however, that the standard errors of the coefficients

for the EEC countries are quite large since each ia based on only nine

observations. Thus the sharp decline frost 0.652 in the l970s to 0.356 in the

1980a is only two—thirds as large as its standard error of 0.456. We cannot

reject the hypothesis that there was no change. Even the fall from 0.742 in

the l960s to 0.356 in the l9BOs is only slightly greater than its standard

error of 0.359: the hypothesis of no change cannot be formally rejected with

this smell sample. The test however is of low power because of the small

sample size and we would ersphasizs the large decline rather than its

statistical 'insignificance."

      When we shift from gross to net saving and investment, the pattern of the

savings retention coefficients differs even store sharply between the EEC and

non—EEC countries. As already noted, among the OECO as a whole, the net

saving—investment relation shows virtually no change between the early and

later periods (see column 2). In contrast, column 4 shows that the net

saving—investment coefficients declined sharply within the EEC between the

1970s and 1980s. This contrast is seen most clearly when the EEC coefficients

of column 4 are compared with the non—EEC coefficients of column 6.

      Although the small sample of EEC countries makes it difficult to draw any

firm conclusions, these data appear to indicate that there have been greater

capital flows out of the individual EEC countries (i.e. ,   a   smaller share of

incremental   saving is retained within the saving country) than among the non—
EEC   countries and that the extent of this capital mobility increased in the
l9BOa.
      We have also exsmined the saving—investment behavior in the wider group
of all 17 European OECD countries (columns 7 and S of Table I) and in the non—
                                      14

EEC European OECD countries (columns 9 and 10). The results shows that the

non—EEC European countries behaved more like the EEC countries than Like the

non—European members of the OECD.

     These results are not only interesting in themselves as an indication of

the increasing integration of the European capital markets but also suggest

that the reason why the savings retention coefficients are generally much

greater than rero reflects the extent of informational and institutional links

among the capital markets. The coefficient is lower for the EEC countries

despite formal barriers on capital exports in some countries because of the

strength of institutional links. Even when capital is completely mobile in

principle, actual capital flo's are retarded by ignorance and risk aversion.



4. TIIL"MI$SING" GROWTH VARIABLE

     The surprising strength of the savings retention coefficient in the

original FR study led subsequent researchers to postulate that the strength of

the coefficient may reflect the impact of come missing variables that

influence investment and are correlated with savings. Obstfeld (1986) has

developed the idea that the missing variable may be the growth rate of GDP or

a combination of the GDP growth rate and of labor's share of national income.

     Life cycle theory implies that these two   variab].es   determine the long—

term behavior of a country's saving rate. Obstfeld posits a model in which

the rate of output growth is also an important determinant of the country's

rate of investment; although demand—determined variations in output growth may

have an important influence on the timing of investment, in the current

context of comparing long—term differences in national investment rates we

would be more inclined to regard output growth as the result of previous
                                        15

capital investment than to look upon output growth as an exogenous

determination of investment. Obstfeld (1986) used data on GDP growth and on

the ratio of employee compensation to national income in individual OECD

countries to simulate the saving—QDP ratios and inveatieent—CDP ratios for

those countries that would result in a simple theoretical model. He then used

these simulated investment and saving ratios to estimate statistically the

basic investment—savings ratio.

     The Obstfeld model assumes complete world capital mobility; that is, the

only link between ssvings and investment in each country is that they depend

on common variables. Nevertheless, a regression of the simulated investment—

CDP rstio on the simulated seving—CDP ratio produces coefficients that are

approximately equal to one, with the precise coefficient depending on the

group of countries selected.

     Although we regard this as an ingenious demonstration of how the observed

investment—savings relation might in P.rinciple be just a spurious reflection

of the missing growth and income distribution variables, we do not find it

convincing. The real test of whether the savings variable is just a proxy for

the growth and distribution variables is whether the inclusion of growth and

distribution causes s significant change in the savings retention coefficient

in a regression using the actual saving and investment variables instead of

the simulated ones.

     To test this in a way that makes it strictly comparable to Obstfeld's

analysis we began by following his procedure to create synthetic saving and

investment vsriables. We used     observations for the sac   countries and years

as Obstfeld. Despite the usual OECD dats revisions, we found that we were

able to reproduce his results quite closely. For example, with a sempla of 17
                                      16

countries for the period 1970 through 1979, Obstfeld found a savings retention

coefficient of 0.86 (with a standard error of 0.81) and we found a coefficient

of 1.01 with a standard error of 0.78. Adding the product of the growth and

income distribution variables to the Obatfeld synthetic equation caused the

savings absorption coefficient to become —0.75 with a standard error of 0.10

while the other variable "explained" the variation in the synthetic investment

series,

     However, when we replaced the synthetic variables with the actual saving

and investment variables, the estimated savings retention coefficient was

little affected by adding the growth and distribution variables to the

equation. More specificaily with the ssme Obstfeld sample of countries and

years, but using the actual saving and investment data rather than the

synthetic ones, the estimated coefficient of the savings variable was 0.88

(with a standard error of 0.12) in the basic regression. When   the   growth and

distribution variables were added to the equation, the coefficient of the

saving variable because 0.87 (with standard error of 0.13).

     Similar results were obtained with other combinations of growth ratss and

income. In no case did the inclusion of the growth and distribution variables

substitute for the effect of the savings variable as a determinant of domestic

saving.

     The implication of this is clear. Although the estimated savings

retention coefficient could in theory reflect only the indirect effect of

omitted growth and distribution variables, the evidence indicates that this is

not so.

S. BUDGET DEFICITf

        As we wrote in section 1. Summers (1988) has noted that there is an

alternative possible explanation for the observed relation between investment

and savingd rates. Summers suggests that if governments do not like capital

outflows or inflows, they might adjust their budget deficits to offset the gap

between investment and private saving.

        As evidence for this possibility. Summers presents a regression of the

ratio of the budget deficit to GDP on the difference between the private

savings ratio (i.e. .   the   ratio of domestic savings plus the budget deficit to

CDP) and the investment—GDP ratio:



(5.1)        DEF/Y — b0 + b1 (PS —



where DEF is the general government budget deficit (i.e. ,     the OECD measure of

general government saving with the sign changed), PS is private saving (i.e.,

saving as previously defined plus the budget deficit) and I and 'I are

investment and gross domestic product as previously defined.

        For a sample of 14 countries for the period 1913 through 1980 Summers

obtained a coefficient of O.72. Taken at face value, this would imply that

each dollar of the private saving—investment gap induces governments to

increase their budget deficit by 72 cents. Since the precise sample used by

Summers is not known, we reestimated his equation 5.1 with data for 13 OECD



       The text of Summers paper does not specify the sample of countries or
years for which his regression was estimated but elsewhere in his paper he
indicates that en equation using the deficit variable as an instrumental
variable is limited to this sample of countries and years because of data
limitations.
                                            18

countries for which dats are available for the period 1973 through 1980. The

estimated coefficient of 0.68 with a standard error of 0.15 is quite close to

the original estimate by Summers.

        There are, however, serious problems of interpretation of equation 5.1.

Although such a model of deficit adjustment may have merit as a description of

short—ten stabilization policy, we find it very implausible as an explanation

of why long—term differences in budget deficit ratios persist among countries.

A more likely explanation of the correlation between budget deficits and net

saving ratios is that budget deficit ratios are "exogenous" (reflecting

political and historical characteristics) and that high deficit ratios crowd

out private investment in the traditional way. Similarly, countries with

budget surpluses may "crowd in" more private investment.

        To assess the plausibility of this alternative specification, we reorder

the variables of equation 5.1 and estimate the equation:



(5.2)        I/Y — c0 + c1 DEF/Y + c2   P5/!?.




This is a natural generalization of the basic equation (1.1) that divides

domestic saving into two components: private saving (PS) and government saving

(—DEFY The original basic model implies that the coefficients c1 and c2 are

equal in absolute value but opposite in sign with private saving having a

positive effect and the budget deficit a negative effect.

        The results, presented in Table 2, are generally consistent with this

generalization of the original basic model. For example, with the largest

possible sample (13 count±ies for 1970 through 1985) the coefficient of net

private savings is 0.699 with a standard error of 0.112 while the coefficient
                                                 19

of the budget deficit is —0.865 with a standard error of 0.150. taken at face

value, these coefficients imply that each dollar of gross private saving adds

70 cents to gross investment while each dollar of the budget deficit crowds

out 0.87 cents of investment.

        The higher absolute coefficient on government deficits than on private

saving is what would be expected if governments are likely to invest lass when

they face a budget deficit end to invest wore when tax receipts are large

relative to current spending. To see this, note that total investment

includes government sector investment (Ig) as well as private sector

investment (In) while the government deficit is defined as the difference

between government current outlays and taxes. Assume that private investment

depends on the total pool of national savings net of government borrowing for

both current and investment outlays;



(5.3)        I/Y — a + $ (T — C      —
                                         tg
                                              + PS)/Y +



where T is total tax revenue of the government. Note that this implies that

government investment does not directly reduce (or increase) private

investment but does so only through the domestic availability of funds.

        Adding government inveetment to both sides of the equation end regrouping

terms yields;



(5.4)             +
                      Ig/Y
                             — a + fi (T — C)fY + $PS/Y + (1—fl) Ig/Y +   .
A regression in the form of equation 5.2 is thus equivalent to estimating the

 true" equation 5.4 with the last term omitted. The relstion between the
                                            20

estimated coefficients a1 and a2 of equation 5.2 and the parameter fi          of
equation 5;4 depends on the relation between, government investment end the

other two variables. If government investment does not depend on the level of

private saving but does respond positively to government current budget

surpluses, the estimated coefficient of the government surplus variable

• (T-C)/Y will equal the true coefficient (fi)      plus   the product of (1—fl) and the

regression of Ig/Y and (T—C)/Y. This implies that the coefficient of the

government surplus variable (—c1 of equ.ation 5.2) will exceed the coefficient

of the private saving variable (c2 of equation 5.2), The bias is, however,

relatively small. If the true" coefficient fi          is   0.75 and the long—run

propensity of the government to spend current surpluses on government

investment is as large as 0.4, the estimated value of —c1 will be 0.85 instead

of 0.75.

      In practice, the difference between the estimates of —c1 and a2 is not

statistically significant with a sample of only 13 observations. Estimating

the constrained equation for this sample produces a coefficient of 0.76 on

domestic saving with a standard error of 0.09. Comparing the sums of squared

residuals for the constrained and unconstrained specifications implies an P

statistic of 0.81 with 1 and 10 degrees of freedom. Since the critical value

for 5 percent significance is 4.96, we cannot reject the simple original

specification.

     Note that the estimate of c2 is an unbiased estimate of the true

parameter fi   regardless   of the size of fi   and of the governments propensity to

do public investment as a function of the government's current surplus as long

as the government investment is not influenced by the private ssving rate.
                                      21

     The problem of distinguishing between the "deficit reaction function -

approach" of equation 5.1 and the "components of domestic saving" approach of
equation 5.2 cannot be definitively resolved by these estimates aince the

statistical problem is one of identification and, more fundamentally, of

providing the theoretically correct specification. It is helpful in this to

look at the underlying raw data in the context of what we know about the

particular economies.

     Table 3 presents data on the deficit, net private saving and net

investment for the decade of the l970s and the period 1980—84. Such data are

only available for 13 countries.

     It is noteworthy that in the l9lOs the "deficits" were negative in all of

the countries except the United States and Belgium. The other countries had

surpluses ranging from one percent of COP to seven percent of COP. By the

l980s, most of these countries were experiencing actual deficits. it would be

very interesting but beyond our capability to examine the historic reasons for

these shifts country by country.

     Consider however the case of the United States which went from a deficit

of one percent of OMP in the 1970s to 3 percent in the first half of the

1980g. For the l970s. the U.S. deficit was the largest of all 13 countries;

indaed, none of the others had a deficit. It is hard to argue, however, that

this represented a fiscal policy decision aimed at supporting aggregate demand

since inflation was e serious problem during most of this dacade end there was

a general feeling that national saving was too low. While it might in theory

be argued that the shift to e larger deficit in the l980s was a way of dealing

with the large recession in 1980—82, the actual historic record shows that the

recession was the unintended consequence of a political inability to obtain
                                               22

sufficient domestic spending cuts to pay for the combination of tax cuts

defense spending increases, and higher interest payments on the national debt.

        One caveat should be indicated about this analysis. Government deficits

reflect payments of interest on the national debt because such interest

payments are part of current government outlay. Since inflation differences

among the countries influence the interest rates on the government debt, the

deficits reflect to differing degrees the inflation erosion of the government

debt and are in this sense not "true" deficits. This is likely to be more

important in the international context than over time in individual countries.

        To examine the sensitivity of our conclusions to the fsilure to adjust

for inflation, we have repeated the analysis using inflation—adjusted

government deficits and private ssvings using data constructed by Mullen and

Price (1984) (as given by Roubini snd Sachs (1989). The inflation—adjusted

results are very similar to the unadjusted estimates. Using data for the

largest avsilable sample (13 countries for the period 1971 through 1986), the

disaggregstsd savings coefficients are almost exactly equal in absolute value:



(3.5)        1/'? —   0.019   — 0.89   DEF*/Y + O.8BPS*/Y
                   (0.012) (0.14)              (0.10)




where DEF* and PS are both inflation adjusted. The evidence clearly supports

the view that either source of variation in national saving has the same

effect on domestic investment.

6. DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT

        As Feldstein (1983) and Feldstein—Horioka (1980)   emphasized, the   close

relationship between domestic saving and domestic investment is a long—term

characteristic and does not hold trots year to year. With time series data,

the savings retention coefficients are much loser than in cross—section

analyses.

        It ia possible however to examine the dynamic adjustment process by which

the close association between domestic investment and domestic asving is

maintained. The evidence presented in this section supports the view that it

is domestic investment that responds to changes in domestic saving. The

evidence is not consistent with e view that domestic saving (either private

alone or the combination of private and public) responds -to shifts in

investment.

        Consider therefore the simple adjustment process by which the change in

the investment ratio from year to year (1fi —        1t—lt—l   varies inversely

with the previous year's investment—savings gsp (Il—S..l)/Yl:



(6.1)        Itf'Yt —   t—lt'1t—l — do + d1 't—l —


If   an increase in the gap between investment and saving causes investment to

decline, d1 is negative. Such a decline could be caused by a rise in interest

rates induced by the "shortage" of savings in year t—l. The evidence

presented below shows that d1 is in fact negative, supporting the view that

investment responds to shifts in saving.
                                           24

        A similar regression shows that the saving rate does not respond to the

gap between investment and savings. For this purpoae, we estimate the

equation



(6.2)        St/Yr —   St_1/Yt_i — e0 + e1 Tt—l —   St1)/Yt1.

Although    a shortage of saving could raise saving by increasing the interest

rate or inducing an increase in the government surplus, the evidence auggeet

that this do-es not occur. Of courae, this is quite consistent with much

previous evidence that investment ia more sensitive to interest rates than
                                                -


saving.

        The results are presented in Table 4. Equation 1 presents the reeulta

corresponding to equation 6.1 for the 23 OECD countries (i.e., all OECD

countries except Luxembourg) for the period 1961 through 1986. The

coefficient of —0.227 (vith a standard error of 0.026) implies that an

investmenc-aavings gap of one percentage point of COP causes the investment—

GDP ratio to fall by approximately a quarter of a percentage point in the

following year. After three years the adjustment of inveatment alone would

reduce the gap to less than one half a percent of COP; after six years, 80

percent of --the gap would be eliminated.

        The corresponding saving equation is presented es equation 2 of table 4.

The coefficient of —0.036 is small both absolutely and relative to its

standard-error of 0.024 and of the wrong sign. The data thus imply no

responae of the saving rate to the savings—investment gap.

        Diaagg-regating the adjuatment coefficient into aeparate coefficients for

lagged investment and lagged saving supports this interpretation of the
                                       25

evidence. In the unconstrained investment equation (equation 3 of Table 4)

the coefficients of the lagged investment ratio is —0.275 with a standard

error of 0.028 while the coefficient of the lagged saving variable is 0.198

with a standard error of 0.027. The coefficients are close enough in magni-

tude to be equal for practical purposes. Rut if the point estimates are taken

literally, the evidence implies that a rise in the savings ratio induces a

slightly smaller rise in subaequent investment that a fall in the investment

ratio. This is just what might be expected if the stochastic disturbance

contains a serially correlated determinant of investment.

     Dividing the sample into the fixed rate first half (1961—73) and the

floating rate second half (1974—86) shows that the results are similar in both

subperiods. with aoae indication of a slower response in the second half than

in the earlier period. These results are shoun in equations 5 through 8 of

Table 4. This confirms the results presented in section 2.

     The constant terms in equations 6.1 and 6.2 imply that the investment and

saving ratios would adjust monotonically over time even if there were no

investment—savings gap. Since there is no justification for such a trend, we

have also estimated the equations of Table 4 with the constraint thet there is

no constant term. The results are very similar to the coefficients of Table 4

and are not presented to save space.

     We have also repeated thia dynastic analysis for the nine EEC countries

alone. The basic results, presented in Table 5, are very similar to the

result for the entire OECD. Investment adjusts to the lagged investment—

savings gap while saving does not adjust. The coefficients for the EEC also

imply a small savings retention, confirming the results in section 3. The

other principal difference between the two sets of results is that the
                                             26

unconstrained coefficients euggest        chat   the effect of an increase in saving is

smaller than the effect of an increase in investment. This may reflect only

the bias referred to above that results if          the   disturbance is serially
                                                    -
correlated.     -




        It would be worthwhile to examine the adjustment process more exten-
sively, considering       more general adjustment dynamics and using estimation
methods that are consistent in the presence of serial correlation, although

that may provide little reassurance with such small samples.



6.1 Persistent Current Account Imbalances

        The specification of equation 6.1 implies that each country will adjust

its investment to eliminate eventually the entire investment—savings gap. A

more general specification would recognize that countries may instead have a

"normal' nonzero level of current account surplus or deficit to which they

adjust.

        We consider therefore the following generalization of equation 6.1:



(6.3)        1t/t — It1/Yt1       —
                                      f0 + f1 ((It_1—St_1)/Tt_1—2)


where CAP is        the desired or normal investment—saving gap. Equation 6.3       is
only distinguishable from equation 6.1 when the CAP is permitted to vary among
countries.
        Equation 6.3 has therefore been estimated with individual constant terms
for   each of   the 23 CECD countries using data        for   1961 through 1986. Separate

estimates for the aubperiods 1961—73 and 1974—86 have also been calculated.

The results are presented in Table 6.
                                            27

     Equation 1 of Table 6 corresponds to equation 6.3 for the entire period

1961. through 1986. Equations 2 and 3 correspond to the two subperioda.

     The individual constant terms correspond to substantial positive "normal"

or "target" investment—saving gaps in several countries including Australia,

New Zealand, Portugal, Greeca, Turkey, Denmark, and Ireland. There were fewer

countries with negative target investment—saving balances, but these included

Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands end, since 1974, Japan. It is

clesr that these "normal" or "target" investment—saving balances do correspond

generally to the economic situations of the countries with the lower income

countries more likely to seek capital inflows while the high saving and older

industrisl countries correspond to a target excess of saving over investment.



7. CQNCUISJON

     The basic conclusion of the present analysis is that an increase in

domestic saving has a substantial effect on the level of domestic investment

although a smaller effect than would have been observed in the 1960s and

1970s. The more closely integrated economies of the EEC also appear to have

more outward capital nobility (i.e., a lower saving retention coefficient)

than other OECD countries.

     There is no support for the view that the estimated saving—investment

relatiom reflects a spurious impact of an omitted economic growth variable.

Although budget deficits are inversely related to the difference between

private   investment and   private   saving, we reject the view that this reflects
an endogemous response of fiscal policy in favor      of the alternative

interpretation   that the negative relation is evidence of the crowding out of
private investment by budget deficits. This interpretation is supported by
                                        28

-the evidence that domestic investment responds equally to private saving and

budget deficits.

     The   dynamic adjustment analysis supports the view that domestic
investment   adjusts rather quickly when there is an- unwanted investment—savings

gap while domestic ssving shows little tendency to adjust.

     The implication of- the analysis thus supports the- original Feldatain'—

Horioka conclusions that increases in domestic saving do raise a nation:"a

capital stock and thereby the productivity of its workforce. Similarly, a tax

on capital income is not likely to be shifted to labor and land by the outflow

of enough domestic capital to maintain the real rate of return unchanged.
