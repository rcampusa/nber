1. Initial remarks
In the last Þve to ten years, political economy — or “political economics”, as I
prefer to call it — has been a rapidly growing Þeld. As the label suggests, this
Þeld deals with issues related to politics using the tools of modern economics.
The most recent work is attractive in that it draws on several traditions: the
older public-choice school, the rational-choice school in political science, and the
equilibrium theory of macroeconomic policy. Collected works, monographs and
textbooks now start to appear, drawing on the contributions in the last decade.
One such piece is Persson and Tabellini (2000a), others include Mueller (1997),
Austen-Smith and Banks (1999), Drazen (2000), and Grossman and Helpman
(2000).
    An obvious motivation for this literature comes from observing economic policy
outcomes. Looking across time and place, one observes large diﬀerences in policy,
but also some common patterns. An example is given in Figure 1, which shows
a measure of the size of government in about sixty countries over the last four
decades. In the Þgure we see that government expenditure in a typical year ranges
from below 10 percent of GDP to well above 50 percent. We also see how the
distribution drifts upwards over time, reßecting growth in the average size of
government — the curve in the graph — by about 8 percent of GDP from the 1960s
to the mid 1990s. (I will discuss these data further in Section 3.) Such diﬀerences
and similarities cry out for an explanation. An important goal in the literature
has thus been to construct a positive theory of economic policy.
    This brings me to the subject-matter of my lecture, which I will devote to
current research on largely unresolved issues. As the title suggests, I will focus on
attempts to identify what systematic eﬀect political institutions might have on
economic policy outcomes. This is, of course, a very broad question.1 To narrow it
down, I will conÞne the discussion to the institutions governing electoral rules and
political regimes and their eﬀect on Þscal policy, broadly deÞned. This question
is not only of academic interest. For instance, reform of electoral institutions has
recently taken place in Japan, Italy and New Zealand and is a hotly debated issue
in other countries. Theory and evidence on the policy consequences of alternative
electoral rules would enlighten this debate.
   1
     Other work by economists on the broad question includes the literatures on the links between
budgetary institutions and budget deÞcits (see, for instance, the contributions in Poterba and
von Hagen, 1999) and between Þscal federalism and the size of government (surveyed by Inman
and Rubinfeld, 1997); see Persson and Tabellini (2000a) for further references.



                                               2
    I would like to make two main points. First, the question whether political
institutions shape policy should naturally appeal to an economist. Second, the
answer is yes; empirically, electoral rules and political regimes do seem to sys-
tematically inßuence the choice of Þscal instruments, as well as the incidence of
corruption.
    Next, I will outline the main ideas in a recent wave of theoretical work on the
topic of the lecture (Section 2). Then, I will describe some data we have just
assembled, with the aforementioned theory as the main guide in sampling and
measurement (Section 3). A good part of my lecture will report on two ongoing
empirical projects, dealing with the link from political institutions to Þscal policy
and corruption (Section 4). Finally, I will sum up and discuss where research
might go next (Section 5).

2. Theoretical ideas
2.1. An organizing framework
Let me describe the theoretical ideas against the backdrop of a very simple model.
In particular, let us consider a bare-bones model of Þscal policy which highlights
the size of the government budget and its allocation to diﬀerent purposes. 2
   The population is divided into a large number of groups, labeled by J. Mem-
bership of each group is deÞned by the prospective beneÞts of public spending.
Everybody has the same preferences over policy:

                                    w J = U (cJ ) + H(g)
                                    cJ = y − τ + f J .

Group J has size N J . Its members thus enjoy private consumption, cJ , given by
after-tax income plus a group-speciÞc transfer f J . All groups pay the same tax,
τ , and enjoy the same beneÞts of public spending on g. Government spending can
thus be targeted to speciÞc groups, as in the case of targeted transfer programs,
or local public goods. But it can also take a non-targeted form beneÞting all
citizens, as in the case of general public goods, or broad social programs.
     Policy choices are summarized by q, a vector constrained to include non-
negative elements only:

                                 q = [{f J }, g, τ , r] ≥ 0
  2
      The core of the positive models of Þscal policy in Persson and Tabellini (2000a) is similar.

                                                 3
                                               X
                            r = Nτ − g −            NJfJ .
                                                J

The budget constraint is standard except for one item. The variable r does not
appear directly in the citizens’ payoﬀs. Literally, it represents direct extraction of
rents by politicians for private use. Less literally, it may represent — on reduced
form — corrupt activities, or ineﬃciently designed activities that constitute a drain
for the citizens but beneÞt politicians or their close friends.
     This model is obviously very stylized. Richer economic models can certainly
be studied along the same lines. Citizens would then also interact in markets,
making purposeful economic choices inßuenced by policy. Similarly, we could
replace the simplistic form of rent extraction with a structural model.
     Yet, already the bare-bones model permits a rich analysis of the politics of
policymaking. To see this, note that the choice of q generates conßicts of interest
in three diﬀerent dimensions: (i) First, we have the traditional conßict among
diﬀerent groups of voters over the allocation of targeted spending {f J }. (ii) The
second is an agency problem: the voters at large would like higher g or lower
τ , but rent-seeking politicians would instead like to spend these resources on r.
(iii) A Þnal source of conßict is that diﬀerent politicians, or political parties, will
compete for any available rents.

2.2. General ideas
The basic idea in the recent literature is this: The way the three conßicts are
resolved, and thus what Þscal policy we observe, hinges on the political institutions
in place. This idea should appear very natural to an economist. Consider an
analogy from micro theory. In a market, we have conßicts of interest between
consumers and producers over price and product quality, and among diﬀerent
producers over proÞt. How these are resolved depends on market institutions.
Equilibrium prices, qualities and proÞts hinge on regulation, which determines
the barriers to entry and the scope for competition between producers. They also
hinge on legislation, which determines how easily consumers can hold producers
accountable for bad product quality or collusive pricing behavior. The basic idea
here is the same.
    Political institutions certainly have many dimensions. Arguably, however, the
most fundamental aspects of constitutions decide how the “control rights” over
policy are acquired and how they can be exercised. Thus, which politicians get the
power to make policy decisions is determined by voters, but is crucially inßuenced


                                          4
by rules for elections. Policy choices are made by elected politicians, but are
crucially inßuenced by rules for rule-making and legislation; that is, what political
scientists call the regime type.
    While economists have not paid much attention to the consequences of these
institutions, political scientists certainly have. A large, mostly empirical literature
has focused precisely on electoral rules and regime types. But the analysis has
generally been conÞned to purely political phenomena, such as the number of
parties, the propensity for crises, etc. It has ignored economic policy, our topic
here.3
    This general discussion suggests a way of modeling the outcome of policymak-
ing: q in our simple model. In that approach, policy is the equilibrium outcome of
a delegation game, where the interaction between rational voters and politicians
is modeled on extensive form. Multiple principals, the voters, elect political rep-
resentatives who, in turn, set policy to further their own opportunistic objectives.
The principals have some leeway over their agents because they can oﬀer them
election, or re-election. But these rewards are mostly implicit, not explicit, so
the constitution becomes like an incomplete contract, leaving the politicians with
some power in the form of residual control rights. Alternative constitutions can
now be represented by alternative rules for how this extensive-form game is being
played. An exercise in “comparative politics” amounts to comparing the policy
outcomes across the resulting equilibria.

2.3. Specific predictions
Let me now describe the main ideas in a handful of recent studies that apply this
comparative politics approach. I just outline the results, however, focusing on the
speciÞc predictions. Those interested can Þnd most of the analytical details in
Persson and Tabellini (2000a, Part III).

Electoral rules. I begin with the rules for electing a country’s legislature. Leg-
islative elections around the world diﬀer in several dimensions. The political sci-
ence literature emphasizes two: district size and the electoral formula. District
size simply determines how many legislators acquire a seat in a voting district.
   3
    An exception is a recent book by Lijphart (1999), which includes cursory evidence on eco-
nomic policy outcomes. Modern classics within the political science literature on comparative
politics include Bingham Powell (1982), Lijphart (1984), Taagepera and Shugart (1989), Shugart
and Carey (1992), and Cox (1997); see Myerson (1999) for a discussion of the theoretical liter-
ature on the consequences of diﬀerent electoral rules.

                                              5
The electoral formula determines how votes are translated into seats. Under plu-
rality rule, only the winners of the highest vote shares get seats in a given district,
whereas proportional representation instead awards seats in proportion to the vote
share.
    Anticipating already here the empirical part, we Þnd a strong correlation in
these features across real-world electoral systems. Some systems can be described
as majoritarian, combining small voting districts with plurality rule. Archetypes
here are elections to the UK parliament or the US Congress, where whoever col-
lects the most votes in a district gets the single seat. Some electoral systems
are instead decidedly proportional, combining large electoral districts with pro-
portional representation. Archetypes are the Dutch and Israeli elections, where
parties obtain seats in proportion to their vote shares in a single national vot-
ing district. While we Þnd some intermediate systems, most countries fall quite
unambiguously into this crude classiÞcation.
    Why would district size matter for government spending? One idea is that
larger voting districts diﬀuse electoral competition, inducing parties to seek sup-
port from broad coalitions in the population. Smaller districts steer electoral com-
petition towards narrower, geographical constituencies. Clearly, broad programs,
like g in the model above, are more eﬀective in seeking broad support and targeted
programs, like f J , more eﬀective in seeking narrow support. Proportional elec-
tions with larger districts should thus be more biased towards broad, non-targeted
programs. This point has formally been made by Persson and Tabellini (1999)
in a probabilistic-voting model, where policy is determined by electoral platforms
before the election. Milesi-Ferretti, Perotti and Rostagno (2000) obtain a similar
result in a model of strategic delegation in voting, where policy is set after the
election in bargaining among the elected politicians.
    Larger districts also facilitate entry in the political process by additional can-
didates or parties. Myerson (1993) has used a model of electoral competition to
show how a larger number of candidates under proportional elections may pro-
duce lower equilibrium rents. Essentially, with more available candidates, voters
can throw out corrupt parties at a lower ideological cost.
    How about the electoral formula? The winner-takes-all property of plurality
rule reduces the minimal coalition of voters needed to win the election, as votes
for a party not obtaining plurality are lost. With single-member districts and
plurality, a party thus needs only 25 % of the national vote to win: 50 % in 50 %
of the districts. Under full proportional representation it needs 50% of the national
vote. Politicians are thus induced to internalize the policy beneÞts for a larger


                                          6
segment of the population, which reinforces the previous prediction associating
broader spending programs with proportional elections. Lizzeri and Persico (2000)
make this point in a model with binding electoral promises, while Persson and
Tabellini (2000a, Ch. 9) instead consider policy choices by an incumbent subject
to re-election.
    Under majoritarian elections, electoral competition often becomes concen-
trated to a subset of identiÞable “marginal districts”. As these have close races
with many swing voters, the perceived electoral punishments for ineﬃcient pro-
grams become larger. The smaller expected vote losses under proportional elec-
tions induce candidates involved in electoral competition to chooses policies en-
tailing larger rents (r in the model), a result derived in Persson and Tabellini,
1999.
    While voters cast their ballot among individual candidates under plurality
rule, they cast it among party lists under proportional representation. Such lists
may dilute the incentives for individual incumbents to perform well. Persson and
Tabellini (2000a, Ch. 9) examine the policy consequences of this diﬀerence in a
model where individual politicians have career-concerns in the style of Holmström
(1982). They Þnd that proportional representation (list voting) should be asso-
ciated with a larger extraction of rents, as the career-concern, re-election motive
becomes a weaker counterweight to the rent-extraction motive for collectively ac-
countable politicians. A second prediction is that electoral cycles, showing up in
spending or taxes, should be weaker under proportional representation. This is
because the incumbents’ career concerns are stronger with the individual account-
ability under plurality rule and because these concerns are at their strongest just
before elections.

Regime types. Two especially interesting aspects of the legislative regime con-
cern the powers over legislation: to make, amend, or veto policy proposals. The
Þrst concerns the separation of these powers across diﬀerent politicians and oﬃces.
The second concerns the maintenance of these powers; in particular, whether the
executive needs sustained conÞdence by a majority in the legislative assembly.
    As in the case of electoral rules, we can make a cruder classiÞcation of real-
world regimes. Presidential regimes (abbreviated PRES ) typically have separa-
tion of powers, between the president and Congress, but also between congres-
sional committees that hold important proposal (agenda-setting) powers in dif-
ferent spheres of policy (think about the US). But they do not have a conÞdence
requirement: the executive can hold on to his powers without the support of a


                                        7
majority in Congress. In parliamentary regimes (PARL), the proposal powers over
legislation are instead concentrated in the hands of the government. Moreover,
the government needs the continuous conÞdence of a majority in parliament to
maintain those powers throughout an entire election period.
    Why should separation of powers matter for policy? A classical argument is
that checks and balances constrain politicians from abusing their powers. Pers-
son, Roland, and Tabellini (1997, 2000) formally demonstrate this old point in
models where incumbents, who decide on policy in diﬀerent forms of legislative
bargaining, are held accountable by retrospective voters. They show that a larger
concentration of powers in parliamentary regimes makes it easier for politicians to
collude with each other at the voters’ expense; the weaker electoral accountability
results in higher rents and taxes (r and τ in the model ).
    Another idea has to do with the conÞdence requirement. The parties sup-
porting the executive hold valuable proposal powers which they risk to lose in a
government crisis. Therefore, they have strong incentives to maintain a stable
majority when voting on policy proposals in the legislature. Building on this idea
of “legislative cohesion” due to Diermeier and Feddersen (1998), Persson, Roland
and Tabellini (2000) derive two additional predictions. First, in parliamentary
regimes, a stable majority of legislators tends to pursue the joint interest of its
voters. In presidential regimes, the (relative) lack of such a majority instead tends
to pit the interests of diﬀerent minorities against each other for diﬀerent issues
on the legislative agenda. Equilibrium spending in parliamentary regimes thus
becomes more directed towards broad programs (g rather than f J ). Second, in
parliamentary regimes, the stable majority of incumbent legislators, as well as
the majority of the voters backing them, become prospective residual claimants
on additional revenue. Both majorities favor high taxes and high spending. In
presidential regimes, on the other hand, no such residual claimants on revenue
exist and majorities therefore resist high spending. These forces produce larger
governments (higher τ ) in parliamentary regimes.

2.4. Discussion
Let me summarize the main predictions with the help of Table 1. According to the
theory, presidential regimes should have smaller governments than parliamentary
regimes, less spending on broad programs, and less rents for politicians. Under
majoritarian elections, we should see less spending on broad programs than under
proportional elections, and less rents. These are “cross-sectional” predictions;


                                         8
they have been derived by comparing equilibria in static models. The prediction
of more pronounced electoral cycles under majoritarian elections, however, relies
on a dynamic model and is thus a “time-series” prediction.
    Is this kind of analysis convincing? Some of you may be skeptical. One critique
might question whether the simple assumed game forms capture the essence of
real-world political institutions. This would parallel the critique against theoreti-
cal IO that “you could prove anything by picking the right extensive form and the
right informational assumptions”. A related complaint would parallel the critique
against incomplete-contract theory that “there are many alternative assignments
of control rights and you have no strong basis for choosing this particular one”.
    Such criticism has some force, but may be less damaging in this case, as
long as we deal with positive theory rather than normative ”constitutional en-
gineering”. A wealth of historical, political and legal studies document how the
world’s democracies carry out elections and allocate political and legislative con-
trol. Thus, the rules deÞning a particular game need not rely on the researcher’s
imagination. They can and should be given a solid empirical foundation. From
this perspective, comparative politics might oﬀer a more convincing application
of game theory than other examples in economics.
    Defending the underlying assumptions is not the only way of convincing skep-
tics, however. Another criterion of success is the empirical contents of the theory.
Does it help us uncover new empirical regularities? To shed some light on this
question, I now turn to the empirical part of the lecture.

3. Data and specification
Data. Let me start by brießy describing the data on political institutions and
Þscal policy outcomes we have assembled for ongoing empirical research. More
details can be found in Persson and Tabellini (2000b). In fact, the theory I just
sketched has served as our guide in sampling and measurement. We have data
for at most 61 countries. The data is yearly and runs from 1960 to 1998, a total
of 39 years. This panel includes a large number of economic, social and political
variables. But many observations are missing — for diﬀerent reasons — which makes
the panel unbalanced.
    Which countries are included in the panel? The theory suggest we should study
countries with democratic institutions. To assess a country’s democratic status
in a given year, we rely on the well-known Freedom House indexes of political
rights: the so-called GASTIL-indexes. We have used three selection rules. One is

                                         9
to include a country in the sample from the Þrst year when it reaches a GASTIL-
score of less than or equal to 5, signifying that the country is “free”, or “semi-
free”.4 Two more demanding rules for inclusion in the sample are to require a
score strictly less than or equal to 3.5 or 2, respectively, and to apply these cutoﬀs
year by year. Unfortunately, non-availability of data on political institutions or
Þscal policy cuts down the sample size further. Here, I will only present results
based on the mid-way sampling rule (a GASTIL-score less than or equal 3.5, year
by year). As the more comprehensive analysis in Persson and Tabellini (2000b)
demonstrates, most results are similar in the two alternative sets of democracies.
    Which political institutions do we study? Following the theory discussion in
Section 2, I will report on results which are (mostly) based on two crude classi-
Þcations of electoral rules and regime types. First, we code countries that relied
fully on plurality (or majority) rule in their most recent elections to the legislature
(lower chamber) as majoritarian, and the other countries as proportional. The
dummy variable MAJ takes a value of 1 in the former case, 0 in the latter.5 Sec-
ond, countries where the survival of the executive does not require the conÞdence
of the legislature are coded as presidential, the other countries as parliamentary.
The resulting binary variable is called PRES.
    These classiÞcations change very little over time, reßecting an inertia of polit-
ical institutions sometimes called an “iron law” by political scientists. The lack of
time variation is unfortunate in that it provides us with almost no “experiments”
in the form of regime changes. But it is also an indication that our key maintained
assumption, namely to treat institutions as exogenous and given by history, may
be correct.
    Figure 2 illustrates the institutional variation across countries in 1995. The
colored portions of the map represent the countries in the sample. Striped ar-
eas indicate presidential regimes (PRES = 1), solid areas parliamentary regimes
(PRES = 0). Darker shade indicates majoritarian elections (MAJ = 1), lighter
shade proportional elections (MAJ = 0). The least common system is the US-
style (dark-striped) combination of a presidential regime with majoritarian elec-
tions, with only Þve countries. But each of the other three combinations is well
represented in the sample. As the map illustrates, using theory in the classiÞ-
   4
     There are actually two indexes, one on political rights one on civil liberties. Each index
runs from 1 to 7, where a country with scores of 1 or 2 are ”free”, 3 to 5 ”semi-free”, and 6 to
7 ”not free”. We take the simple average of these indexes.
   5
     In Persson and Tabellini (1999) electoral rules were instead classiÞed on the basis of district
magnitude. The present classiÞcation based on the electoral formula yields a similar, but not
identical grouping of countries.

                                                10
cation sometimes produces results contrary to popular perception. For example,
Switzerland is classiÞed as a presidential regime, whereas France is not.
    We include Þscal policy outcomes suggested by the theory. For the size of
government (corresponding to τ in the model) we use diﬀerent measures: central
government expenditure, central government revenue, and general government ex-
penditure, all as percentages of GDP. For the composition of government spend-
ing (g vs. {f J } in the model) we use two measures: social security and welfare
spending (by central government), either as a percentage of GDP, or as a ratio to
spending on goods and services. We thus presume that it is much harder to target
broad transfer programs, like pensions and unemployment insurance, to speciÞc
voting districts than it is to target spending on goods and services. These various
Þscal policy measures do vary greatly across time and across countries. Indeed,
Figure 1 in the introduction was a plot of our panel data for central government
expenditure as a percentage of GDP.
    At the end of the next section, I will also describe some results from a second
ongoing project (Persson, Tabellini, and Trebbi, 2000). There, we proxy rent
extraction by politicians (r in the model) by available measures of corruption.
We also characterize electoral rules by two continuous measures, rather than by
a single binary measure.

Specification. Our empirical work is certainly motivated by theory. In addition
to testing speciÞc hypotheses, we also aim at establishing empirical regularities,
however. We therefore adopt a relatively eclectic empirical speciÞcation describing
policy outcomes:
                   yit = αi + β i ut + γ i sit + δxit + ηzit + εit .           (1)
Here, yit denotes a policy outcome in country i and year t. We allow for a country-
speciÞc component, αi . Policy can be aﬀected directly by the institutions zit ,
concretely by the value of the two dummy variables MAJ and PRES in i at t.
It also depends on (vectors of) common variables ut and idiosyncratic variables
(sit , xit ). Some slope coeﬃcients are allowed to diﬀer across countries.
     Given (1), we pose the question of a systematic eﬀect from institutions to
policy in two diﬀerent ways. One is to test the nul hypothesis
                                    H0D : η = 0 ,
i.e., the absence of a direct eﬀect. Strictly speaking, this is what most of the
theory discussed in Section 2 was really about. The other way is to test for the

                                          11
absence of an indirect (non-linear) eﬀect

                   H0I : β i = β j and/or γ i = γ j , even if zit 6= zjt ,

i.e., whether diﬀerent institutions make policy respond to common or idiosyncratic
variables in a diﬀerent way. (The rationale for this test will be given shortly.) We
estimate these parameters in several diﬀerent fashions, which are probably best
explained in the context of a speciÞc example.


4. Empirical regularities?
4.1. Size of government
Cross-sectional results. Consider Þrst the size of government. To arrive at
a straightforward test for a direct eﬀect on policy, take the time average of (1) to
obtain
                    y i = (αi + β i u + γ i si ) + δxi + ηzi + εi .              (2)
As (2) shows, the η parameter can be readily estimated on cross-sectional data.
To take account of the unbalanced panel, we use a WLS estimator weighing each
country by the number observations in its panel.
    Results from such regressions are displayed in Table 2. The dependent variable
is either central government spending (as a percentage of GDP), or central gov-
ernment revenue. The control variables in x1 include a number of socio-economic
factors identiÞed by earlier studies as empirical determinants of the size of gov-
ernment. Given the clustering of observations in Figure 2, we use dummies for
continents and colonial origin as additional controls. The table displays the esti-
mated η parameters for the PRES and MAJ dummies. Bracketed expressions
are p-values for false rejection of η = 0. Boldface font denotes a coeﬃcient signif-
icantly diﬀerent from zero, at the 10% level.
    The two institutional dummies always enter with a negative sign. But MAJ
is rarely statistically signiÞcant.6 On the other hand PRES typically is, even
though one can Þnd speciÞcations where it is not. This Þnding is clearly in line
   6
    Milesi-Ferretti, Perotti and Rostagno (2000) Þnd government expenditure to be smaller in
countries with majoritarian elections in their study of the OECD countries over the same period.
When we use general government expenditures as our dependent variable — as did Milesi-Feretti
et al. — we reach a similar conclusion. In this case data availability cuts down our sample size
considerably (to about 40 countries).



                                              12
with the theoretical prediction in Section 2. According to the point estimates,
governments in presidential regimes are smaller by more than 5 percent of GDP.
     As column 3 shows, however, the negative eﬀect of PRES is stronger, above
10 percent of GDP, for cross sections based on data from the 1990s rather than
the whole sample. Moreover, it is statistically more robust (cf. also the empirical
results in Persson and Tabellini, 1999). These results suggest that the negative
estimates largely reßect faster growth of government in parliamentary regimes
in the last four decades. As Figure 3 illustrates, this pattern is clearly visible
already in the raw data. The graph is identical to Figure 1, except that the
data is partitioned into presidential regimes, marked with black diamonds and a
thicker curve for the average, and parliamentary regimes, marked with circles and
a thinner curve.
     While these cross-sectional estimates are suggestive, they are potentially sub-
ject to simultaneity (omitted-variable, selection) bias. We would therefore like
to exploit the time variation in the data. But the lack of institutional variation
over time makes it infeasible to identify the direct eﬀect of institutions in conven-
tional Þxed-eﬀects estimation. For practical purposes, zit is given by a constant,
zi , equal to the time average zi . Thus, we cannot separately estimate the eﬀects
on policy of a country’s institutions zi and other time-invariant, country-speciÞc
features αi .
     This is why we turn to the slightly diﬀerent question embodied in the test of
   I
H0 , namely whether diﬀerent political institutions shape diﬀerent policy responses
to economic and political events. Even if the cross-section results might possibly
be biased due to “historical omitted variables”, it is less plausible to argue that
the forces selecting the observed political institutions in historical times would
be systematically correlated with the response to economic and political events
during our recent sample period.
     Recall, however, that the models in Section 2 are all static, with the exception
of the career-concern model of electoral cycles. Many of our tests for indirect
eﬀects of institutions should thus be seen as a search for empirical regularities
rather than tests of speciÞc predictions.

Unobservable common events It is plausible that a set of common economic
and political events have aﬀected Þscal policy in all countries. Think e.g. of the
worldwide turn to the left in the late 1960s and 70s, or the productivity slowdown
and oil shocks in the 1970s and 80s. But suppose we do not want to commit
to, or cannot observe, all such events. Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) suggest a


                                         13
simple statistical method which they use to estimate how labor-market institutions
might inßuence the adjustment of unemployment to unobservable shocks. Milesi-
Ferretti, Perotti and Rostagno (2000) indeed apply this method to study how the
proportionality of electoral systems aﬀect policy in the OECD countries.
    Assume that the response to observable idiosyncratic variables is the same in
all countries, γ i = γ j in (1). Then we can lump all country-speciÞc variables
together in xit and rewrite (1) as:

               yit = (αi + ηzi ) + [1 + λ(zi − z)]βut + δxit + εit .           (3)

We can use a set of time dummies to estimate, βut , the common eﬀect of the
common events in (3). The institution-speciÞc eﬀect of the common events ut is
proportional to the term λ(zi − z), where z denotes the cross-country average of
zi . The form of (3) suggests that we should estimate the crucial parameter λ by
NLS, and include Þxed eﬀects to control for the country-speciÞc intercept.
     Table 3 shows some results based on annual data. (Persson and Tabellini,
2000b also report results based on Þve-year averages, which may better han-
dle measurement error and allow for discretionary adjustments of policy.) The
country-speciÞc controls are the same variables as in the cross-sectional regres-
sions. The interaction parmeters λ for both PRES and MAJ are negative and
highly signiÞcant. To interpret the results, consider a common event in period
t that raises government spending by 1 percent of GDP in an average country;
i.e., an event such that β(ut − ut−1 ) = 1. Coeﬃcients around −1 and −0.5 mean
that the eﬀect of this event is 1 percent smaller in presidential (compared to
parliamentary) regimes and 0.5 percent smaller under majoritarian (compared to
proportional) elections.
     Another way of gauging the results is to ask how the cumulative eﬀect of the
common events over the course of the sample period, β(uT − u1 ), diﬀers across
institutions. The point estimates suggest that the cumulative diﬀerence between
presidential and parliamentary regimes is above 10 percent of GDP. This number
Þts well with the estimated cross-sectional diﬀerence from the 1990s reported in
Table 2. Thus, we can attribute much of the current size diﬀerence between these
regimes to a diﬀerent adjustement to a set of common shocks in the preceding
decades.

Observable economic events            Alternatively, we can test for an eﬀect of
institutions on the adjustment to observable events. We start by economic events,


                                        14
then turn to electoral events. Yet another rewrite of (1) is given by the following
expression:

             yit = (αi + ηzi ) + (β + φzi )ut + (γ + µzi )sit + δxit + εit .              (4)

In (4) the parameters φ and µ allow for institution-dependent adjustments to
common and idiosyncratic variables. As an observable common variable in ut
we have tried the oil price, and as idiosyncratic variables in sit we have included
lagged policy yit−1 , the share of the population above 65, and the deviation of
income from its (Hodrick-Prescott) trend. One way of estimating the φ and µ
parameters in (4) is to allow for the Þrst, country-speciÞc term by using the Þxed-
eﬀects estimator. To get more eﬃcient estimates of spending and revenue equa-
tions, we also estimate them jointly with SUR. An alternative way, is to wipe the
country-speciÞc intercept out by taking Þrst diﬀerences. In this case, we use two
diﬀerent estimators. One is an IV-estimator: we include ∆yit−1 in the regression
and instrument it by yit−2 and (∆ut−1 , ∆sit−1 , ∆xit−1 ) (plus the corresponding
interaction terms). The other is a GLS-estimator: we do not include ∆yit−1 in the
regression, but allow for panel-speciÞc autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in
εit .7
      The results in Table 4 indicate systematic indirect eﬀects of institutions when
it comes to income shocks and lagged policy. (Results for oil prices and population
shares are less robust.) The Þxed eﬀects (SUR) estimates in columns 1-3 suggest
that negative income shocks raise spending as a share of GDP. But this eﬀect
is absent, or even overturned, in presidential regimes and under majoritarian
elections. These systems are also associated with less inertia in spending, although
here the eﬀect of majoritarian elections is weaker. The instrumental variable
estimates in column 4 and the GLS estimates in column 5 show that the results
for income shocks are very robust, while the results on inertia are a bit less stable.
      Persson and Tabellini (2000b) distinguish between positive and negative in-
come shocks. Their preliminary results point towards an asymmetry: in parlia-
mentary and proportional systems negative income shocks signiÞcantly raise the
spending share, whereas positive income shocks do not lower the spending share.
In presidential and majoritarian systems, on the other hand, positive shocks raise
   7
    It is well-known that the presence of a lagged dependent variable can bias the Þxed eﬀects
estimator (see e.g, Baltagi, 1995). The problem may be less serious in our panel than in the
typical labor context, as the bias diminishes in T and our T is about 40. The IV-estimator we
use was suggested by Anderson and Hsiao (1981) and Arrellano and Bond (1991) to correct for
the bias in dynamic panels.


                                             15
spending, whereas negative shocks do nothing. This suggests ratchet eﬀects in
the growth of government, but of a very diﬀerent nature across political systems.
   Understanding better the reasons behind the diﬀerent adjustments to income
shocks is an intriguing topic for future theoretical and empirical research.

Electoral cycles Finally, we look for an electoral cycle in total government
spending or tax revenue and whether this cycle depends on political institutions.
For this purpose, we expand sit — the country i variables with institution-speciÞc
eﬀects on policy — to also include dummies for election years as well as post-
election years. Otherwise, the speciÞcation, including all the economic shocks
and controls, is the same as in Table 4 (except that the we do not include the oil
shocks but instead include a set of common time dummies to allow more precise
estimates of the electoral cycle). We also use the same estimation methods.
    When the institutional dummies are not included, we Þnd a signiÞcant and
sizeable post-election cycle in spending, with spending cuts being postponed until
after the election. For revenues, we Þnd signiÞcant cuts in the election year and
(less robust) hikes in the post-election year. These results are remarkable in
their own right, as earlier studies have typically not found robust evidence of an
electoral cycle in international data, with the exception of the recent study by Shi
and Svensson (2000).8
    As Table 5 reveals, however, these electoral cycles are highly institution-
dependent. The post-election cycle — a cut in spending by about 1 percent
of GDP and a gain in revenue by 0.5 to 1 percent of GDP — is clearly present
only in presidential regimes. The pre-election tax cuts, on the other hand, are
visible only in parliamentary regimes. As in the case of the adjustment to income
shocks, we do not have a good explanation for these diﬀerences.
    We have also tried to test the prediction of the career-concern model discussed
in Section 2 of a stronger pre-electoral cycle under majoritarian elections. While
the signs of the point estimates are consistent with this prediction, their signiÞ-
cance is not robust across samples and estimation methods.

4.2. Composition of government
Let me turn to the composition of government. Recall that our measures here
are central government spending on social security and welfare as a percentage
   8
    See Alesina, Roubini and Cohen (1997) and Drazen (2000) for surveys of the earlier litera-
ture.


                                             16
of GDP and the ratio of the same variable to spending on goods and services.
Persson and Tabellini (2000b) carry out the same battery of tests as those for
government size above. Here, I will just give a brief overview of the results.
    The cross-sectional results show that broad, non-targeted programs are indeed
smaller under majoritarian elections, as predicted by the theory. Ceteris paribus,
social security and welfare spending appears to be about 2 percentage points
smaller as a share of GDP, and 20-30% lower as a ratio to spending on goods and
services. Statistically, these results are more fragile than the results for overall
spending. Qualitatively, they are in line with Þndings of Milesi-Ferretti et al
(2000) for the OECD countries. In this case, however, we Þnd no systematic
eﬀect of the regime type.
    Unobservable common events are estimated to have a much smaller eﬀect on
the spending ratio under majoritarian elections. The cumulative eﬀect on this
ratio (from the early 1970s to the 90s) is on the order of 10 %. Common events
have a smaller eﬀect on social security and welfare in presidential regimes, with a
cumulative eﬀect of 4-5 percent of GDP. But the latter result may largely capture
the higher overall growth of government in parliamentary regimes.
    Observable economic events again trigger institution-speciÞc adjustments. As
for aggregate spending, we Þnd negative eﬀects of income shocks on social security
and welfare spending. But these eﬀects are signiÞcantly smaller, or even nulliÞed,
under majoritarian elections and presidential regimes.
    For electoral cycles, Þnally, the Þndings are quite intriguing. When we do not
condition on political institutions, no electoral cycle is observed. But when we
do, we Þnd systematic evidence of both pre-election and post-election eﬀects. In
connection with a typical election, spending on social security and welfare rises
by about 0.2 percent of GDP both before and after the election in countries with
proportional elections in parliamentary regimes. Under majoritarian elections
in parliamentary countries no eﬀects are visible, however, while in presidential
regimes social spending tends to fall by 0.1-0.2 percent of GDP after elections
(in consistency with the results for aggregate spending). It is perhaps plausible
that we should see spending hikes in parliamentary and proportional systems if
politicians in these systems indeed have stronger incentives to rely just on broad
programs to get elected or re-elected, as suggested by the theory surveyed in
Section 2. A theory of the composition of the electoral cycle under diﬀerent
political institutions has not yet been worked out, however, and constitutes a
further challenge for future research.



                                        17
4.3. Corruption
It is not easy to Þnd empirical counterparts to rent extraction (r in the simple
model) which are comparable across countries. The best proxies are probably
those international surveys that try to measure the extent of corruption. I will
end by reporting on another ongoing project (Persson, Tabellini and Trebbi, 2000)
that relies on such corruption data.
    Transparency International conducts a careful survey, including measures of
“grand corruption” at the highest levels of government which conforms well with
the theoretical models discussed in Section 2. The TPI score runs from 0 (perfectly
clean) to 10 (highly corrupt). Unfortunately, these scores are only available an-
nually from the late nineties. Therefore, we must limit our study to cross-country
data.
    On the other hand, this study includes Þner measures of the electoral rule
than the single, dichotomous MAJ dummy. Based on the theory, we use two
continuous variables. DISMAG measures district size (1 minus the inverse of
average district magnitude, in legislative elections). PLIST instead measures the
electoral formula, namely the share of legislators elected via party lists (rather
than individually). Both measures run between 0 and 1: a score of 0 on both of
them corresponds to Þrst past the post in one-member districts, whereas a score
of 1 on both corresponds to full proportionality in very large districts.
    The intersection of our corruption, electoral and socio-economic data limits
the study to at most 82 countries. Some results are shown in Table 6. The con-
trol vector xb consists of a dozen economic, social and cultural variables found
to correlate closely with corruption in earlier studies (see Persson, Tabellini and
Trebbi, 2000). As the Þrst (empty) column shows, these variables explain close
to 90% of the cross-country variance in corruption. Nevertheless, the earlier di-
chotomous dummies, PRES and MAJ, improve the Þt (in terms of adjusted R2 ).
Both have the negative sign expected from theory, but only MAJ is statistically
signiÞcant.9
    But this crude measure turns out to mask two eﬀects running in opposite
directions. Larger districts — higher DISMAG — lowers corruption, whereas greater
use of list voting — higher PLIST — raises it. Both results are consistent with the
   9
     We also use alternative, non-parametric matching estimators to allow for more ßexible func-
tional forms and correct for potential non-random selection (of the electoral rule) on observables
(for further discussion see Persson, Tabellini and Trebbi, 2000). The matching estimates largely
accord with the regression estimates, suggesting that majoritarian elections indeed have a robust
negative eﬀect on corruption.


                                               18
theory in Section 2: lower barriers to entry (larger districts) decrease corruption,
while blunter career concerns (more party list voting) increase it. As columns 3 to
5 demonstrate, these eﬀects are robust to including other institutional variables,
namely the legal and colonial origin of countries, earlier empirical studies have
found to correlate with corruption (see e.g., Treisman, 2000).
   These eﬀects are not only statistically signiÞcant, but also quantitatively im-
portant. Consider Chile, a country considerably less corrupt than its South Amer-
ican neighbors; its residual from the regression in the Þrst column in Table 6 is
about - 2.5, whereas the average South-American country has a residual close to
0. Our results suggest that between a quarter and a half of this diﬀerence might
be due to Chile’s electoral system, the only one in the region where voters cast
their ballots for individual candidates under plurality rule (in two-seat districts).


5. Final remarks
Do political institutions shape economic policy? I have argued that this question
is theoretically appealing and that posing it oﬀers an attractive opportunity for a
convincing application of game theory. I have also reported on ongoing empirical
work, which suggests that the answer is a resounding yes.
    The results are summarized in Table 7. Empirically, presidential regimes are
associated with smaller governments than parliamentary regimes, a smaller and
less persistent response of spending to income shocks, a stronger post-election
cycle in aggregate spending and revenue, but a weaker cycle in social transfers.
Majoritarian elections are associated with smaller broad spending programs than
proportional elections and with less corruption; they also have smaller (and per-
haps less persistent) spending responses to income shocks, and a weaker election
cycle in social transfers. Several of these empirical regularities, those marked with
black and bold in Table 7, are in line with the Þrst wave of theory. But others,
marked in gray and bold, are still awaiting a theoretical explanation. This is es-
pecially so for the results indicating institution-dependent adjustments of policy
to economic events and the institution-dependent electoral cycles.
    These are promising Þrst steps in a research program. Much work certainly
remains, however. So, where might research go next? One direction is clearly
to reÞne the theory of policy. As just noted, our empirical results on policy
adjustments and electoral cycles are in search of a theory. To understand them,
we need dynamic rather than static models of the relationship between institutions
and policy. Dynamic models are also necessary to understand government deÞcits.

                                         19
The results in Persson and Tabellini (2000b) indeed point to systematic diﬀerences
in deÞcit behavior across political institutions.
    On the policy side, the research so far has concentrated on government spend-
ing. It would be interesting — and certainly feasible — to use similar methods
in studying other policy instruments, such as the structure of taxation including
trade policy. On the institutional side, one should study the eﬀect on policy of
more detailed constitutional features; for instance, diﬀerent types of checks and
balances, or diﬀerent types of conÞdence requirements.
    This suggests another direction, namely reÞned measurement of political insti-
tutions. In some cases this will involve a mere, but time-consuming, compilation
of data from existing sources. One example is to trace detailed changes in elec-
toral rules over time; concretely, to compile panel data for variables like DISMAG
and PLIST.
    In other cases, better measures will require the collection of new primary data.
A concrete example is to construct empirical measures of the separations of powers
in diﬀerent political regimes. As this may be a labor-intensive and open-ended
task, it is important to use theory as a guide.10
    Some econometric issues certainly need to be explored in more detail. Even
with reÞned measurement, considerable measurement error will remain in our
data. Sharper theory would help in trading oﬀ the prospective biases due to
measurement and speciÞcation errors. Sharper hypotheses, derived from dynamic
models, would be especially helpful in avoiding the pitfalls of estimation in dy-
namic panels.
    All in all, a close interplay of theory, measurement and statistical work appears
essential for making progress on the broad question I have dealt with in this
lecture. I hope some readers will provide some help, both in posing the question
more precisely, and in probing the data for an answer.
