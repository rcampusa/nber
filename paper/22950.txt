Targeting Policies: Multiple Testing and Distributional Treatment Eects

                                          ABSTRACT

Economic theory often predicts that treatment responses may depend on individuals’
characteristics and location on the outcome distribution. Policymakers need to account for such
treatment effect heterogeneity in order to efficiently allocate resources to subgroups that can
successfully be targeted by a policy. However, when interpreting treatment effects across
subgroups and the outcome distribution, inference has to be adjusted for multiple hypothesis
testing to avoid an overestimation of positive treatment effects. We propose six new tests for
treatment effect heterogeneity that make corrections for the family-wise error rate and that
identify subgroups and ranges of the outcome distribution exhibiting economically and
statistically significant treatment effects. We apply these tests to individual responses to welfare
reform and show that welfare recipients benefit from the reform in a smaller range of the earnings
distribution than previously estimated. Our results shed new light on effectiveness of welfare
reform and demonstrate the importance of correcting for multiple testing.

1       Introduction
Individuals differ not only in their characteristics but also in how they respond to a partic-
ular treatment or intervention. Treatment effects may vary between subgroups defined by
individual characteristics such as gender or race. For example, welfare programs that provide
work incentives may affect welfare recipients differently according to their demographic and
socio-economic characteristics such as education or number and ages of children. In addition,
individuals’ response to a particular treatment may vary across quantiles of the unconditional
outcome distribution. After all, welfare programs induce kinks in the recipients’ budget con-
straint, so the treatment effect may also vary depending on the location of their pre-treatment
earnings.
    This diverse and heterogeneous behavior has not only changed how economists think
about econometric models and policy evaluation but also has profound consequences for the
scientific evaluation of public policy.1 Although the importance of heterogeneous treatment
effects is widely recognized in the causal inference literature, common practice remains to
report an average causal effect parameter, even in cases where it is not possible to identify
for which subset of individuals this effect applies to.2
    While an increasing number of studies account for possible treatment effect heterogeneity
in evaluating social programs, most conduct statistical inference without allowing for depen-
dence across subgroups. For example, Fink, McConnell, and Vollmer (2014) report that over
75 percent of studies that analyze data from field experiments published in 10 specific jour-
nals estimate separate average causal parameters for different subgroups. Fink, McConnell,
and Vollmer (2014) argue that it is inappropriate in those studies to apply traditional stan-
dard errors and p-values when testing for heterogeneous treatment effects through interaction
terms or subgroup analyses. After all, each interaction term represents a separate hypothesis
beyond the original experimental design and results in a substantially increased type I error.3
Lee and Shaikh (2014) address this issue in their study of data from a randomized experi-




    1
       James Heckman stresses this point in his 2001 Nobel lecture, where he notes that conditional mean impacts
including the average treatment effect may provide limited guidance for policy design and implementation
(Heckman, 2001).
     2
       In particular, a large academic debate (e.g., Deaton, 2009; Imbens, 2009; Heckman and Urzua, 2010)
questions whether the local average treatment effect parameter obtained from an IV estimand has policy
relevance.
     3
       The problem when testing multiple hypotheses jointly is the potential over-rejection of the null hypothesis.
Intuitively, if the null hypothesis of no treatment effect is true, testing it across 100 subsamples, we expect
about five rejections at the 95 percent confidence level. However, if these subsamples depend on each other,
more than five rejections may occur. Hence, the type I error would exceed the nominal level of the test (see,
e.g., Romano, Shaikh, and Wolf, 2010). The same issue arises when testing a hypothesis across the percentiles
of an outcome variable, as we discuss in the text below.


                                                        2
ment by adopting a multiple testing procedure for subgroup treatment effects that controls
the family-wise error rate (FWER) in finite samples.4
    A similar observation can be made for distributional treatment effects. A growing num-
ber of studies examine if there are different treatment effects across quantiles of the outcome
variable, i.e. they estimate quantile treatment effects (QTEs) (e.g., Heckman, Smith, and
Clements, 1997; Friedlander and Robins, 1997; Abadie, 2002; Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes,
2006; Firpo, 2007). Individual test statistics at different quantiles involve their sample coun-
terparts across different quantiles, which are correlated. A naive approach of comparing
individual test results to find quantile groups with positive and statistically significant treat-
ment effects inevitably suffers from the issue of data mining due to the reuse of the same
data as emphasized by White (2000).5
    In this paper, we develop a multiple testing procedure to analyze different dimensions
of treatment effect heterogeneity across subgroups and outcome quantiles. Our flexible ap-
proach allows us to analyze treatment effect heterogeneity using various hypothesis testing
procedures. First, investigating the existence of positive treatment effects for some subgroups
or some outcome quantiles is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. Second, the pro-
cedure enables us to identify the subgroups and outcome quantiles for which the treatment
effect is estimated to be conspicuous beyond sampling variations. As the result is obtained
through a formal multiple testing procedure, it properly takes into account the reuse of the
same data for different demographic groups or quantile groups and controls the FWER so
that it is unaffected by data mining.6 Controlling the FWER in multiple comparisons across
different quantiles is crucial for the validity of the inference procedure, as estimated treatment
effects across different quantiles of the outcome distribution are not independent.7
    The multiple testing approach provides not only a basis for judging the empirical relevance
of treatment effect heterogeneity. It also provides further information on the pattern of
treatment effect heterogeneity across different population groups.8 This information can
    4
      The FWER is defined as the probability of falsely rejecting at least one true hypothesis when performing
multiple tests.
    5
      In part as a response, statistical inference procedures developed in Heckman, Smith, and Clements (1997),
Abadie (2002), Rothe (2010) and Maier (2011), among others, focus on the whole distribution of potential
outcomes to side-step multiple comparisons.
    6
      More specifically, our procedure involves multiple inequalities of unconditional quantile functions, and
draws on a bootstrap method for testing for inequality restrictions. To construct a multiple testing procedure
that controls the FWER, we adapt the step-down method proposed by Romano and Wolf (2005a) to our
context of testing multiple inequalities of unconditional quantiles.
    7
      Lee and Shaikh (2014) also adopt a multiple testing procedure to identify subgroups of conspicuous
treatment effects. However, there are several notable differences. First, they do not account for within-
subgroup treatment effect heterogeneity in contrast to our approach. Second, Lee and Shaikh (2014) require
the treatment to be randomly assigned unconditionally. In contrast, our approach is built on the assumption
of selection on observed variables. Hence it accommodates non-experimental data whenever the assumption
is deemed plausible.
    8
      Our approach differs from Crump et al. (2008) in several aspects. First, Crump et al. (2008) focus
on heterogeneity of the average treatment effect across subgroups, while our focus is on treatment effect

offer important insights about how scarce social resources are to be distributed. Policymakers
would have richer information to more effectively assign different treatments to individuals
so as to balance competing objectives. For example, some welfare recipients may not change
their labor supply when faced with work incentives because they are constrained by other
factors such as childcare needs. Moreover, policymakers can design welfare programs more
effectively if they know over which ranges of the earnings distribution welfare recipients
increase and reduce labor supply.
    Our use of various formal testing procedures for treatment effect heterogeneity is not
solely motivated by policy considerations but also economic theory. We demonstrate that
a simple static model of labor supply predicts heterogenous responses to changes in the pa-
rameters of a welfare reform policy within and between subgroups. To illustrate the tests
we explore the extent of heterogeneity in labor supply responses in the Jobs First welfare
experiment across percentiles of the earnings distribution. This paper builds on earlier re-
search that examines the extent of heterogeneity in labor supply responses with this data
including Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006).9 A follow-up paper by Bitler, Gelbach, and
Hoynes (forthcoming) presents evidence that treatment effect heterogeneity in terms of quan-
tile treatment effects cannot be all ascribed to cross-subgroup variations in mean treatment
effects with this data. In contrast to Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (forthcoming), we consider
treatment effect heterogeneity both across subgroups and within subgroups by estimating
QTEs for each subgroup. Importantly, we do not assume that treatment effects are constant
within subgroups, but rather estimate subgroup specific QTEs. Therefore, our results not
only relax assumptions but shed additional light on the effects of welfare reform. Specifically,
we identify both the subgroups and within subgroups the range of the earnings distribution,
for which treatment effects are positive and statistically significant.
    In addition, we make an important methodological contribution to the literature that tests
for treatment effect heterogeneity. While Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (forthcoming) allow for
multiple tests across subgroups, we also adjust for dependencies between quantiles. Thereby,
we provide a unified framework to test for treatment effect heterogeneity. Finally, we believe
that these tests are important since recent work by Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge (2015)
has shown that even when unconfoundedness holds (or with experimental data), researchers


heterogeneity across quantiles of the outcome distribution, motivated by the findings of Bitler, Gelbach, and
Hoynes (2006). Second, Crump et al. (2008) use a joint test for treatment effect heterogeneity covering all the
subgroups. In contrast, we use a multiple testing procedure to detect quantiles and/or subgroups for which
there is a positive treatment effect. Finally, unlike Crump et al. (2008), we also investigate treatment effect
heterogeneity across quantiles within each subgroup, so that the focus here is also on whether treatment effect
heterogeneity across quantiles is mostly due to subgroup differences or not.
    9
      In related work, Kline and Tartari (2016) demonstrate how economic theory imposes restrictions that can
be used to develop bounds on the frequency of intensive and extensive margin responses to welfare reform. Our
primary goal is not to develop tests to see if observed behavior is consistent with the quantitative predictions
of a theory but rather whether qualitative differences in the pattern of QTEs between subgroups emerge.

who estimate models that do not account for heterogeneous effects may provide inconsistent
estimates of average effects.10
     The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we motivate the tests that
we develop by describing both the policy and data being investigated, and in Section 3 we
present a simple labor supply model that predicts heterogenous treatment effects both within
and across subgroups. We next describe the general testing procedures for treatment effect
heterogeneity without and with subgroups in Section 4. In Section 5, we present results from
an empirical application of the methods to Jobs First data which yields two main findings.
First, while there is clear evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity in the full sample, this is
observed in most but not every subgroup. Second, we demonstrate the importance of making
corrections for multiple testing since approximately half of the QTEs become statistically
insignificant when we account for potential dependencies. Taken together, our results shed
new light on the effectiveness of welfare reform, further indicating how the composition of
the labor force changes in response to public policy. The concluding Section 6 discusses the
benefits of this approach and discusses directions for future research.


2        Policy Background and Data
Following years of debate and after President Clinton vetoed two earlier welfare reform bills,
the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)
was passed in 1996.11 PRWORA provided a major change in how federal cash assistance
would be provided by requiring each state to replace their Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program with a Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program.
In addition, PRWORA gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery. Several
states, including Connecticut, conducted randomized experiments to provide an evidence
base for subsequent reforms as well as to receive a waiver from the federal government which
allowed state governments to implement their own version of TANF.
     Connecticut’s Job First experiment was carried out by the Manpower Demonstration
and Research Corporation and involved about 4,800 women residing in New Haven and
Manchester in 1996 and 1997 who were either new welfare applicants or had applied for a
continued receipt of benefits. Participants were randomly assigned to either receive a new
program called Jobs First, which was the basis of the subsequent TANF program, while

    10
      Under unconfoundedness, it is well known that matching and regression estimators may yield different
estimates since they weight observations differently. Intuitively if there are heterogeneous treatment effects
across groups in the sample, the OLS estimator gives a weighted average of these effects. The weights depend
not only on the frequency of the subgroups, but also upon sample variances within the subgroup. This differs
from the sample-weighted average which would be given by the average of each subgroup’s partial effect
weighted by its frequency in the sample.
   11
      Haskins (2006) details the political battles underlying the passage of this act.


                                                      5
participants assigned to the control group received the original AFDC benefits. In contrast
to AFDC, Jobs First imposed a time limit of 21 months on welfare receipt. In addition,
participants assigned to the Jobs First group were required to attend job training programs
or provide proof of job search activities to remain eligible for benefits. On the other hand,
Jobs First included more generous earnings disregards. Specifically, under Jobs First, all
earnings up to the federal poverty level (FPL) were disregarded, whereas AFDC participants
faced an implicit tax rate of 49 percent during the first three months of employment and 73
percent thereafter.12 Participants and their families were followed up until 2001 via surveys
and administrative records from multiple sources including unemployment insurance earnings,
food stamps, and AFDC/TANF benefits. The Jobs First experiment is well-studied (Bitler,
Gelbach, and Hoynes, 2006, forthcoming; Kline and Tartari, 2016, among others). We use it
to illustrate the methods proposed in the paper because it facilitates comparisons with the
existing literature that used the same data.
    Summary statistics are reported in Table 1 where the second and third columns present
characteristics of those women respectively assigned to the Jobs First and AFDC groups. On
average, the single mothers in this sample have lower educational attainment and are much
more likely to be part of a minority than the general population. About 60 percent of the
sample have a child under the age of six, indicating that there may be additional constraints on
their labor supply decisions. The women in this sample earn less than $800 per quarter before
random assignment and therefore rely heavily on welfare and food stamps. The standard
deviation of earnings is high relative to the mean, suggesting heterogeneous responses to
different welfare policies across the earnings distribution. The last column in Table 1 contains
p-values for the test that individuals assigned to the Jobs First and AFDC groups do not
differ in observed characteristics. For most characteristics and as shown in Bloom et al.
(2002) and Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006), we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no
difference. There are small but statistically significant differences in a few variables, and two
differences are particularly surprising given the random assignment protocol. Specifically, we
observe that women assigned to the control group (AFDC) have significantly higher earnings
and hence receive significantly lower welfare benefits before random assignment. To ensure
covariate balance we make adjustments via propensity score weighting in our analyses.

     Other differences include a $3,000 asset disregard and two years of transitional Medicaid for Jobs First
and a $1,000 disregard and one year of transitional Medicaid for AFDC (see Bloom et al., 2002; Bitler, Gelbach,
and Hoynes, 2006).

where X1 and X2 denote characteristics that may affect earnings and individual preferences,
respectively, and W p¨q denotes the welfare benefit function, which depends on the level of
earnings Ep¨q, household characteristics X3 , and policy parameters Z t with t “ tAF DC, JF u.
The vector Z t includes the base grant amount, earnings disregards, and time limits, so it
traces out the budget constraint faced by a welfare participant in the AFDC or Jobs First
group. Following Saez (2010), we assume that the marginal utility of consumption is positive

( BC ą 0) and the marginal utility of earnings is negative ( BE ă 0).
     We use the panels of Figure 1 to demonstrate how economic theory predicts treatment
effect heterogeneity. This heterogeneity arises because there is a differential labor supply
response on both the intensive and extensive margins between the AFDC and the Jobs First
program due to different budget constraints and earnings distributions in the two experimen-
tal groups.14 The solid line in the top panel of Figure 1 illustrates the budget constraint
faced by Jobs First participants and is defined by the points A0 , F1 , E and G0 . A0 denotes
the base grant amount. The segment A0 F1 is parallel to the 45 degree line due to the implicit
tax rate of 0 for welfare recipients with earnings below the FPL. The dashed line represents
the budget constraint faced under AFDC and is defined by the points A0 , C and G0 , where
C corresponds to the eligibility threshold, which is below the FPL. In particular, the segment
A0 C represents the earnings disregard under AFDC with a positive implicit tax rate. The
middle panel of Figure 1 presents hypothetical cumulative distribution functions of earnings
for those in AFDC (dashed) and Jobs First (solid) groups that are the result of different wel-
fare program parameters. QTEs are presented in the bottom panel and equal the horizontal
distance at each quantile between the two earnings distributions in the middle panel.

      Static models are commonly used in the literature on single mothers’ labor supply (Keane, 2011, p.
1070). Our discussion follows earlier work on static labor supply models including Kline and Tartari (2016).
We extend this literature by considering differences across subgroups.
   14
      We abstract from welfare stigma and the hassle associated with not working while on welfare modeled
by Kline and Tartari (2016). We are interested in the distribution of earnings and how it varies by subgroup,
but not in the welfare participation decision or decomposing labor supply responses into the extensive and
intensive margin here.

    To provide intuition for the shape of the QTEs presented, we consider the thought exper-
iment of moving individuals from AFDC to Jobs First. First, consider an individual located
at point A0 under AFDC. Supposing she is assigned to receive Jobs First, she can now either
remain at point A0 or can move along the budget constraint to point A1 . The observed
choice depends on her preferences over consumption and earnings. In particular, women with
steeper indifference curves at point A0 are less likely to change their decisions between AFDC
and Jobs First. The potential move from A0 to A1 corresponds to less mass at zero in the
earnings distribution under TANF compared to AFDC in panel (b).
    We next consider a woman on AFDC at point B0 who works while receiving welfare.
Transitioning to Jobs First lowers her implicit tax rate from either 49 or 73 percent to 0,
therefore boosting her net wage.15 If the substitution effect exceeds the income effect, the
labor supply response moves her to point B1 and leads to a rightward shift in the earnings
distribution. Hence, for workers whose earnings lie in the segment between A0 and C, theory
predicts positive QTEs.
    The QTEs in panel (c) shift from positive to negative around the point D0 , which corre-
sponds to the earnings of women who are ineligible for welfare under AFDC but who would
be eligible under Jobs First. Theory predicts moving to Jobs First would lead to a reduction
in labor supply to point D1 , if we make the standard assumption that leisure is a normal
good. Intuitively, by moving fro AFDC to Jobs First at point D0 (where welfare benefits
are not available under AFDC), women now gain the base grant, resulting only in an income
effect.16 Similarly, negative QTEs arise for women located at point F0 . These women would
neither qualify for AFDC nor Job First at point F0 . However, the generous earnings disregard
under Jobs First would incentivize women to reduce their labor supply to qualify for the new
benefits leading to a movement to point F1 that is characterized by higher consumption and
lower earnings.
    Last, women with relatively high earnings under AFDC at point G0 face a trade-off when
moving to Jobs First, since the point G1 “ F1 does not strictly dominate point G0 . For women
whose marginal disutility from earnings outweighs the marginal utility from consumption,
labor supply will fall from G0 to G1 , whereas women with different preferences may choose
to remain at point G0 and not change their labor supply. Thus, we predict the QTEs to be
negative around G0 but at higher quantiles, the QTEs may become zero. Taken together,
theory predicts that the earnings QTEs of Job First will start at zero and be positive for a
range of quantiles before becoming negative and eventually reaching zero again as illustrated
in panel (c) of Figure 1.


  15
       Note that we will use changes in labor supply and earnings interchangeably here because the gross wage
is assumed to be constant.
    16
       Note, to avoid clutter, we set D1 “ B1 without loss of generality.


                                                     10
    The above discussion concerned the general shape of treatment effect heterogeneity but
did not consider subgroups. Subgroup membership denoted by X1 , X2 , and X3 in equa-
tions (1) and (2) affects preferences and the budget constraint. Hence, the parameters in
this optimization problem vary, so the resulting QTEs could be shifted to the left or right,
be compressed or stretched, or otherwise be transformed without losing their overall shape
depicted in panel (c) of Figure 1. To illustrate, consider subgroups defined by maternal ed-
ucation. We ignore the potential effect of education on preferences, but assume that women
with more education receive higher wage offers. Therefore, we expect a larger fraction of
women with higher educational attainment to be located around the points F0 and G0 and
correspondingly less mass around A0 , B0 , and D0 compared to women with less education.17
Thus, we expect an overall shift of the QTEs to the left with less mass in the lower tail of
the distribution where the QTEs equal zero for higher educated women.
    A similar shift is anticipated for subgroups defined by earnings and welfare history, where
we also expect qualitative differences in the shape of the QTEs. Recent welfare recipients
have little if any positive earnings in the period before the experiment, so there is little mass
around points D0 , F0 , and G0 relative to A0 and B0 . Thus, we expect more positive QTEs
(i.e. moves from B0 to B1 q for these individuals and more negative QTEs (i.e. switches from
D0 to D1 or from F0 to F1 ) for individuals with less recent welfare participation and higher
previous earnings.
    Finally, we consider subgroups defined by either the age or number of children. Additional
children will mechanically influence the size of benefits because the latter increase with family
size. Yet, under Jobs First the potential loss of welfare benefits when time limits are imposed
might be higher for women with additional children. While it is not possible to predict
differences in the range of positive and negative QTEs by the number of children, it is
reasonable to expect larger QTEs among women with more children. Similarly, women with
older children may exhibit a similar pattern of larger QTEs. This arises since young children
impose a higher opportunity cost of work for mothers relative to older children and this
cost is fixed independent of receiving AFDC or Jobs First. In summary, economic theory
predicts treatment effect heterogeneity both within and between subgroups, motivating the
development of tools to assess its extent in general, as well as in the specific context of the
Jobs First experiment.




  17
    The average level of education is much lower in our sample of welfare recipients than in the general
population. Therefore, we split the sample into high and low education subgroups by whether individuals
have either a high school degree or a GED versus no degree at all.

4     Methodology
In this section, we begin by introducing three tests for treatment effect heterogeneity in the
full sample. Motivated by the discussion in the previous section, we then propose three
additional tests for treatment effect heterogeneity both within and between subgroups.

4.1   Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Without Subgroups
Each test we introduce requires estimates of QTEs that in the full sample are calculated
by subtracting the unconditional outcome at quantile τ for the control group from the re-
spective outcome at quantile τ for the treatment group. To control for possible selection
on observed variables into treatment and control groups, we weight the outcome variable by
inverse propensity score weights (IPSW). We define the IPSW as

                                            Di                             1 ´ Di
                                 ω̂1i “                 and ω̂0i “
                                          p̂pXi q                        1 ´ p̂pXi q

for treated and control individuals, respectively, where Di is the treatment indicator, Xi is a
vector of observed characteristics, and p̂p¨q is the estimated propensity score. We then obtain
quantiles of the weighted outcome as follows:
                                                        n
                                                        ÿ
                             q̂1,τ “ arg min                  ω̂1i ρτ pYi ´ qq       and
                                                    q
                                                        i“1
                                                        ÿn
                             q̂0,τ “ arg min                  ω̂0i ρτ pYi ´ qq ,
                                                    q
                                                        i“1

where ρτ pxq “ x¨pτ ´1tx ď 0uq is the check function and n is the size of the full sample. That
is, q̂τ,1 and q̂τ,0 are the τ -th empirical quantiles of the propensity score weighted outcome
variable                         "             *n                                "                  *n
                 ! )n                 Yi Di                     ! )n                 Yi p1 ´ Di q
                  Ŷ1i       “                          and      Ŷ0i        “
                       i“1           p̂pXi q    i“1                    i“1           1 ´ p̂pXi q     i“1

for treatment and control group, respectively.
    Formally, the estimated QTE at τ is then defined as

                                                q̂τ∆ “ q̂1,τ ´ q̂0,τ .

Intuitively, and as shown in panels (b) and (c) of Figure 1, the QTE is equal to the horizontal
difference between the graphs of the unconditional outcome distributions of treatment and
control group at quantile τ .




                                                              12
4.1.1    Testing for the Presence of Positive Quantile Treatment Effects

The first test is designed to determine whether an intervention had any detectable positive
effect on the outcome of interest.18 We consider the following null and alternative hypotheses:

                                       H0 : qτ∆ ď 0 for all τ P T
                                       H1 : qτ∆ ą 0 for some τ P T ,                                      (H.1)

where T Ă r0, 1s is the finite set of quantiles considered. The alternative hypothesis states
that there exists a positive treatment effect for at least one quantile. Therefore, the null
hypothesis is rejected if treatment has any positive effect on some range of the outcome
distribution, given reasonable power.
    To develop a bootstrap test of the null hypothesis of no positive treatment effect (H.1),
we consider a test statistic of the following form:

                                                Tn “ max q̂τ∆ .                                              (3)
                                                         τ PT

Intuitively, since the null hypothesis states that all QTEs are weakly negative, the largest
observed QTE provides the clearest evidence against the null hypothesis (White, 2000). To
implement the test, we calculate a critical value using a bootstrap method. Specifically,
we first resample with replacement from the original sample B times and construct the
propensity score weighted outcomes Ŷ1i˚ “ Yi˚ Di˚ {p̂˚ pXi˚ q and Ŷ0i˚ “ Yi˚ p1´Di˚ q{p1´ p̂˚ pXi˚ qq,
where tYi˚ , Di˚ , Xi˚ uni“1 denotes each bootstrap sample and p̂˚ pXi˚ q the estimated propensity
score using the bootstrap sample. Then the bootstrap test statistic for bootstrap draw
b “ t1, . . . , Bu is given by
                                              “ max q̂τ∆˚ ´ q̂τ∆ ,
                                          ˚
                                                                (
                                         Tn,b                                                                (4)
                                                  τ PT

where q̂τ∆˚ “ q̂τ,1
                ˚ ´ q̂ ˚ and q̂ ˚ and q̂ ˚ are the τ -th empirical quantiles of tŶ ˚ un
                      τ,0      τ,1      τ,0                                        1i i“1 and
tŶ0i˚ uni“1 , respectively. By subtracting q̂τ∆ we re-center the bootstrap test statistic in order
to impose the least favorable configuration under the null hypothesis. We then compare the
test statistic (3) to the bootstrap critical value, which is equal to the p1 ´ αq-th empirical
quantile of the B bootstrap test statistics (4), where α is the nominal level of the test. We
reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic exceeds the critical value. Rejection of the
null hypothesis (H.1) indicates evidence for positive treatment effects for some range of the
outcome distribution.



   18
     The idea for this test has policy appeal since, given limited resources, policymakers first need to know if
individuals react to a specific policy intervention at all. In contrast, the average treatment effect may conceal
positive QTEs if they are entirely offset by negative QTEs in a different range of the outcome distribution.


                                                         13
4.1.2     Testing for General Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

We now test for treatment effect homogeneity, which provides an answer to the policy-relevant
question of whether individuals across quantiles differ in their response to a particular inter-
vention. While one may obtain information from a visual inspection of QTEs across quantiles
of the outcome distribution, a formal test is necessary to properly account for sampling vari-
ations.
    We consider the following hypotheses:

                               H0 : qτ∆ “ c for all τ P T and for some c P R
                               H1 : qτ∆ ‰ c for some τ P T and for all c P R.                               (H.2)

The alternative hypothesis indicates heterogeneity of QTE across quantiles. When the null
hypothesis is rejected, it suggests evidence for differential reactions by individuals to the
treatment depending on where on the outcome distribution they are located.19
    To test (H.2) we construct the following test statistic:
                                                     ˇ            ˇ
                                            Tn “ max ˇq̂τ∆ ´ q̄ ∆ ˇ ,                                          (5)
                                                    τ PT

                 1
where q̄ ∆ “                  q̂τ∆ is the sample mean of the estimated QTEs. That is, we set the
                       ř
                |T |   τ PT
constant c in (H.2) equal to the sample mean, q̄ ∆ , and subtract it from the estimated QTEs,
so the test statistic will be small if the QTEs are very similar across τ .20 The max appears
in equation (5) to detect the existence of quantiles at which the deviation of the QTE from
its mean occurs.
    We then follow the same bootstrap approach as in Section 4.1.1 above and calculate the
following bootstrap test statistic:
                                             ˇ
                                       “ max ˇq̂τ∆˚ ´ q̂τ∆ ´ q̄ ∆˚ ´ q̄ ∆ ˇ .
                                   ˚

The bootstrap test also incorporates re-centering in order to impose the null restriction. To
test null hypothesis (H.2), we compare the test statistic (5) to the critical value obtained from


    19
       Note that testing for treatment effect heterogeneity has appeared in Appendix E of Heckman, Smith, and
Clements (1997) though in a different form. Their null hypothesis posits that the variance of the individual
treatment effect Y1i ´Y0i is zero, i.e. there is no treatment effect heterogeneity across individuals. On the other
hand, our null hypothesis allows for treatment effect heterogeneity across individuals. Our null hypothesis
rather states that the QTEs are constant across quantiles. After all, randomness of the individual treatment
effect appears to be a less interesting hypothesis to test, given that it is well accepted that individuals have
heterogeneous responses to policy interventions including experiments such as PROGRESA (see, e.g., Djebbari
and Smith, 2008).
    20
       Since the null hypothesis involves an equality, we take the absolute value of the difference between QTE
and mean QTE.

4.1.3    Testing for Which Quantiles the Treatment Effect Is Positive

The next test employs a multiple testing approach to identify the ranges of the outcome
distribution that exhibit positive treatment effects. This is important since rejecting null
hypothesis (H.1) only informs us that individuals in some range of the outcome distribution
exhibit positive QTEs, and rejecting (H.2) just provides evidence that the treatment effect
is not constant across the outcome distribution. The identified range can be of considerable
interest for policymakers when they wish to define a target group for their policies in a
way that carries empirical support. We follow recent developments in the multiple testing
literature (see, e.g., Romano and Wolf, 2005a,b) and use a bootstrap based step-down method
to identify the quantiles for which positive treatment effects are present.21 To do so, it is
necessary to update the critical value at each step, for example by using a bootstrap method.
By combining bootstrap tests of inequality restrictions with multiple testing procedures, we
produce a testing procedure suitable for analyzing treatment heterogeneity that controls the
FWER at the desired level.
    We first define individual hypothesis testing problems as follows: for each τ in a range
T Ă r0, 1s,

                                                  H0,τ : qτ∆ ď 0
                                                  H1,τ : qτ∆ ą 0.                                   (H.3)

Then the goal is to find a set of individual hypotheses, for which the null is false, in a way
that controls the FWER.22
    To implement this approach, we follow Romano and Wolf (2005a) and Romano and Shaikh
(2010) by conducting stepwise elimination of quantiles using the bootstrap. More specifically,
setting T1 “ T , we find the smallest ĉ1 such that

                                            B

where Tn,b 1        τ PT1 q̂τ ´ q̂τ               denotes the bootstrap one-sided test statistic using
the b-th bootstrap sample and α is the level of the test. That is, at ĉ1 , the fraction of test
statistics across the B bootstrap samples that exceed that critical value is at most α. Then,

     Other adjustments have been proposed in the literature, starting with the very conservative Bonferroni
method (see Romano, Shaikh, and Wolf, 2010, for a recent overview).

we retain those quantiles that do not exceed the critical value ĉ1 , i.e. we define

                                         T2 “ τ P T1 : q̂τ∆ ď ĉ1 ,
                                                                 (

                                                                                  (
This procedure is repeated until at step k, we obtain Tk “ τ P Tk´1 : q̂τ∆ ď ĉk´1 such that
no further element of Tk is eliminated (i.e. Tk “ Tk´1 ). Then the resulting set Tk is the subset
of T such that there is no empirical support for positive and statistically significant treatment
effects at quantiles τ P Tk . Conversely, this procedure provides evidence for positive treatment
effects at quantiles in the set T zTk . From the result of Romano and Shaikh (2010), it is not
hard to show that this multiple testing procedure asymptotically controls the FWER at α.23

4.2     Incorporating Subgroups
The preceding three tests did not consider treatment effect heterogeneity across different
subgroups. Tests involving subgroups can be useful when policymakers want to identify
subgroups defined by observed variables that exhibit differential treatment effects, or when
they are interested in the extent of heterogeneity within subgroups. For example, given
limited resources, policymakers may be reluctant to extend programs to groups where a
significant fraction does not receive gains. Finally, and consistent with the arguments in Lee
and Shaikh (2014) and Fink, McConnell, and Vollmer (2014), it is important to develop tools
for statistical inference in this setting that account for dependence both within and across
subgroups.24
    We assume that the subgroup vector Zi is a subvector of Xi , so we write Xi “ pX1i , Zi q,
where X1i indicates the vector that is not included in Zi . As before qτ,1 pzq and qτ,0 pzq are the
quantiles of the outcome distributions of treatment and control group, respectively, but now
defined separately by subgroup z. Formally, we define qτ,1 pzq and qτ,0 pzq to be the solutions
   23
       See the Online Appendix for a sketch of proofs for the validity of all testing procedures introduced in the
paper.
    24
       Our interest is not in optimal treatment assignment in the spirit of Manski (2004), Dehejia (2005), and
others. Armstrong and Shen (2015) recently extended optimal treatment assignment to additionally consider
multiple testing procedures for treatment effects that control for the FWER. In contrast, we do not assume
that the researcher ex ante has full knowledge of the distribution of outcomes in the population. Our interest
is rather to propose a multiple testing framework for identifying subpopulations with positive responses to the
outcome variable.

where Y1i and Y0i are the potential outcomes under treatment and control, respectively, and
Zi is the subgroup vector taking values from a finite set Z “ Jj“1 Z j , where Z j is the set

of values from the j-th category (i.e. each category j corresponds to one observed variable
that can take on multiple values). Hence qτ,1 pzq and qτ,0 pzq are the quantiles of the outcome
variable in the treatment and control groups conditional on subgroup z. Then the subgroup
QTE is defined by
                                           qτ∆ pzq “ qτ,1 pzq ´ qτ,0 pzq.

   To account for covariates in the analyses, we continue to use inverse propensity score
weighting with the weights given by

                                            Di                             1 ´ Di

where p̂pX1i , zq denotes the estimated propensity score p̂pXi q except that Zi is replaced by
z.25 We define the empirical quantiles of the outcome variable for subgroup z in the treatment
and control group as

4.2.1      Testing for Which Quantiles and Subgroups the Treatment Effect Is Pos-
           itive

This test extends the test of hypothesis (H.3) to a setting with subgroups. That is, we identify
the quantile-subgroup cells that have statistically significantly positive treatment effects. We
consider the following individual hypotheses: for each τ P T and z P Z,

                                                H0,τ,z : qτ∆ pzq ď 0
                                                H1,τ,z : qτ∆ pzq ą 0.                                    (H.4)

  25
       Following Smith and Todd (2005), the propensity score p̂pxq is estimated using data from the full sample.


                                                         17
Hence, we test a total number of |T |ˆ|Z| hypotheses. We denote the set of quantile-subgroup
cells by W “ T ˆ Z.
   The test is constructed as follows. First, by resampling with replacement from the original
sample, we construct Ŷ1i˚ “ Yi˚ Di˚ {p̂˚ pXi˚ q and Ŷ0i˚ “ Yi˚ p1 ´ Di˚ q{p1 ´ p̂˚ pXi˚ qq. Then we
take our bootstrap one-sided test statistic to be

                                                     q̂τ∆˚ pzq ´ q̂τ∆ pzq ,

tŶ0i˚ uni“1 , respectively, at quantile τ within the samples with Zi˚ “ z. To perform multiple
testing, we proceed by eliminating subgroup-quantile cells stepwise. At each step, we retain
those pτ, zq cells for which no evidence for positive treatment effect can be found. That is,
pτ, zq cells that are eliminated throughout this procedure constitute the subgroup-quantile
groups with evidence for positive treatment effects.
   Specifically, we take W1 “ T ˆ Z, and find the minimum ĉ1 such that

of W such that there is no empirical support that the treatment effect at quantile-subgroup
pair pτ, zq P Wk is positive. This procedure will yield all the combinations of subgroups
and quantiles where positive treatment effects are present; specifically they are given by
quantile-subgroup pairs pτ, zq P WzWk .

4.2.2    Testing for Subgroup-Specific Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Across Quan-
         tiles

Here we focus on the question of whether differences across subgroups can explain the ob-
served heterogeneity of QTEs in the full sample. More specifically, we search for evidence that
all subgroups exhibit heterogeneity of treatment effects across different quantiles τ P p0, 1q:

                 H0 : qτ∆ pzq “ cz for all τ P T , for some cz P R, and for all z P Z
                 H1 : qτ∆ pzq ‰ cz for some τ P T , for all cz P R, and for some z P Z.              (H.5)

The null hypothesis states that the heterogeneity in treatment effects disappears when we
condition on Zi . In other words, it posits that the QTEs are constant across quantiles within
all subgroups z. However, the null hypothesis still allows for treatment effect heterogeneity
across different subgroups. Rejection of the null hypothesis suggests the presence of QTE
heterogeneity across quantiles even after we control for Zi . Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes
(forthcoming) ask exactly this question. In contrast to their paper, however, we do not
constrain the treatment effect to be constant within subgroups.26
    Hypothesis (H.5) explicitly tests the validity of the above assumption by using the fol-
lowing test statistic:
                                                        ˇ                   ˇ
                                           Tn “ max max ˇq̂τ∆ pzq ´ q̄ ∆ pzqˇ ,                         (8)
                                                  zPZ τ PT
                    1
where q̄ ∆ pzq “                     q̂τ∆ pzq is the sample mean of the estimated QTEs for each subgroup.
                          ř
                   |T |       τ PT
As with test statistic (5), we impose the null hypothesis by subtracting q̄ ∆ pzq. For each
subgroup, the highest deviation of the estimated QTEs from their sample mean provides
the clearest evidence against the null hypothesis. Then to obtain a test statistic that covers
all subgroups z P Z, we take the maximum value over each subgroup’s test statistic. In-
tuitively, we search for evidence that there exists a subgroup that exhibits treatment effect
heterogeneity, so we restrict our attention to the subgroups that have the largest degree of
heterogeneity.
    To construct a bootstrap critical value, we consider the following bootstrap test statistic
that is an analog of (6) with subgroups:
                                         ˇ
                               “ max max ˇq̂τ∆˚ pzq ´ q̂τ∆ pzq ´ q̄ ∆˚ pzq ´ q̄ ∆ pzq ˇ .
                           ˚
                                                                `                    ˘ˇ
                          Tn,b                                                                          (9)

pothesis (H.5) provides a simple and flexible way to see if most treatment effect heterogeneity
across quantiles is in fact due to treatment effect heterogeneity across subgroups.

4.2.3    Testing for Which Subgroups Treatment Effects Are Heterogenous

The test described in the previous section tests whether treatment effect heterogeneity across
quantiles exists even after controlling for subgroups. If we reject null hypothesis (H.5), we
may also be interested in identifying the subgroups that exhibit QTE heterogeneity. The
final test is able to do so by exploring subgroup by subgroup, if there is treatment effect
heterogeneity within subgroups. For each z P Z, we test

                                  ∆
                          H0,z : qτ,1 pzq “ cz for all τ P T for some cz P R
                                  ∆
                          H1,z : qτ,1 pzq ‰ cz for some τ P T for all cz P R.                         (H.6)

The null hypothesis (H.6) posits that the QTEs are constant within subgroup. This test can
identify the subgroups that exhibit heterogeneity of QTE while accounting for dependencies
both between quantiles and for each z P Z. This test differs from the test of hypothesis (H.5)
above since we do not condition on z and test if treatment effect heterogeneity disappears,
but we rather test for treatment effect heterogeneity separately for each z.27
    We consider the following test statistic:
                                                  ˇ                   ˇ
                                     Tn pzq “ max ˇq̂τ∆ pzq ´ q̄ ∆ pzqˇ ,                               (10)
                                               τ PT

which is equal to the test statistic (5) with QTEs calculated by subgroup. As before, we
follow Romano and Wolf (2005a) and eliminate the subgroups, for which we cannot reject
the null hypothesis (H.6) in a step-down procedure. Then the remaining subgroups (if any)
are the ones for which we reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect heterogeneity. The
bootstrap test statistic is defined as
                                         ˇ
                         pZ1 q “ max max ˇq̂τ∆˚ pzq ´ q̂τ∆ pzq ´ q̄ ∆˚ pzq ´ q̄ ∆ pzq ˇ ,

where we first take Z1 “ Z. We then find bootstrap critical values ĉz,1 for each subgroup z
such that
                                        B
                                     1 ÿ      ˚

  27
     This test nevertheless differs from testing for treatment effect heterogeneity (hypothesis (H.3) for the
entire sample) separately for each subgroup since we use the Romano and Wolf (2005a) approach to identify
the subgroup(s) that exhibit heterogeneity in QTEs.


                                                      20
and define
                                          Z2 “ tz : Tn pzq ď ĉz,1 u ,

i.e. Z2 is the set of subgroups, for which the test statistic (10) does not exceed the critical
value. Hence z P Z2 are subgroups that do not exhibit significant treatment effect hetero-
geneity. We then repeat these steps with Z2 , find a critical values ĉz,1 analogously, and so
on, until no additional subgroup is eliminated (resulting in the set of subgroups Zk ). Hence,
there is evidence for treatment effect heterogeneity for subgroups z P ZzZk .


5     Empirical Application
In this section, we use data from the Jobs First experiment to conduct the battery of tests
presented in the preceding section. Following Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006) we use
quarterly earnings pooled over the seven quarters after random assignment as our outcome
variable and estimate QTEs for percentiles 1 to 97.28 To balance covariates between the
Jobs First and AFDC groups, we estimate the propensity score p̂pxq using a series logit
specification.29 For the results that follow, we set the level of each test to α “ 0.05. The test
results for the whole sample are based on bootstraps with B “ 9999 replications while we
use B “ 999 for the subgroup-specific tests.
    Figure 2 shows our estimated QTEs for the full sample along with pointwise 90 percent
confidence intervals.30 Similar to Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006) we find pointwise
significant treatment effects extending from the 48th to the 80th percentile.31 Above the
86th percentile the point estimates for treatment effects become negative but the pointwise
confidence intervals mostly include zero. Hence, the shape of the estimated QTEs aligns with
the theoretical prediction in Section 3.
    Table 2 summarizes the test result for hypotheses (H.1) and (H.2) proposed in Section 4.1.
First, we test the null hypothesis of no positive treatment effect at any percentile. As shown
in Figure 2, the largest QTE (which occurs at the 61st percentile) equals 600, so this value

   28
      Hence, we have a total of 7 ˆ 4803 “ 33621 observations. To infer treatment effects for specific individuals
from QTEs we have to assume that there are no rank reversals in the earnings distribution between the Jobs
First and AFDC groups. This assumption is likely violated and even predicted not to hold by labor supply
theory (see Section 3). However, positive QTEs imply that the treatment has a positive effect for some interval
of the earnings distribution (Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes, 2006).
   29
      We use a nonparametric approach since the tests are also nonparametric. That said, the vast majority of
our results are robust to using a parametric logit estimator to calculate the weights via the propensity score.
   30
      We show 90 percent CI because they corresponds to a one-sided test with a level of five percent, and we
implement one-sided tests that hold the FWER at that level.
   31
      Our results look slightly different from the QTEs shown in Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006, Figure
3) because we use Firpo’s (2007) check function approach as described in Section 4.1 instead of estimating
empirical cumulative distribution functions of Jobs First and AFDC earnings. The QTEs are in multiples of
100 because the quarterly earnings data are rounded to the closest $100, which does not affect the validity of
the results (Gelbach, 2005).

                     Note: Multiple testing results show quantiles for which the QTE is positive at a FWER of 5%
                     (see Section 4.1.3). Dollar amounts are quarterly earnings at smallest and largest quantiles
                     with positive and statistically significant QTE.

becomes the test statistic in the first row of Table 2. Comparing this test statistics to the
bootstrap critical value of 300 indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis. The associated
p-value equals 0.0003. Thus, there is clear evidence that the Jobs First experiment had the
desired effect of increasing earnings for at least some individuals. Next, we present results
from the test of no treatment effect heterogeneity across quantiles (H.2). The test statistic,
which is calculated as the largest deviation from the mean estimated QTE (q̄ ∆ “ 100), equals
500. With a bootstrap critical value of 294.85, we also reject this null hypothesis at a p-value
of 0.0017. This result implies that treatment effects are heterogenous across quantiles, thereby
indicating that individuals vary in their response to welfare reform.32
    Having rejected the null hypothesis of no treatment effect heterogeneity, we now identify
the range of the earnings distribution where positive treatment effects are located, i.e. we test
hypothesis (H.3). As described in Section 4.1.3, this test accounts for potential dependencies
across quantiles of the same outcome variable and the number of individual hypotheses (|T | “
97). The shaded area in Figure 2 corresponds to the set T zTk , i.e. the percentiles where
the treatment effect remains significant using a FWER of α “ 0.05. Examining the plot
we observe that the set of significantly positive QTEs supports the distributional effects
predicted by labor supply theory. However, we find that individuals located between the

(2002), which yields the same conclusions.

48th and 54th and the 71st and 80th percentiles of the earnings distribution do not exhibit
significant QTEs once we adjust for multiple testing. The smallest and largest quantiles at
which QTEs are significantly positive correspond to quarterly earnings of $300 and $1,500,
respectively. Hence, we can conclude that the benefits of this particular welfare reform are
more confined than one would otherwise find based on traditional statistical inference that
ignores potential dependencies and testing at multiple percentiles. Given the predictions
derived in Section 3, we find that there is a more limited range of individuals who increase
their labor supply when assigned to the Jobs First group.33
    Next, we present results incorporating subgroups using the tests described in Section 4.2.
As discussed in Section 3, labor supply theory predicts that individuals with different observed
characteristics may react differently to the same welfare rules. In particular, characteristics
such as age and number of children, and prior earnings and welfare receipt may determine for
which range of the earnings distribution we observe an increase or decrease in labor supply.
Following Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (forthcoming) and informed by the model presented
in Section 3, we consider subgroups defined by proxies for standard demographics, wage
opportunities, fixed costs of work, preferences for income versus leisure, and employment and
welfare histories.34
    Figures 3 and 4 present QTEs conditional on demographic observables and individuals’
labor market and welfare histories. Shaded areas denote significant QTEs based on our
multiple testing procedure of testing hypothesis (H.4). These figures provide an easy and
intuitive way to check which subgroups benefit from the welfare reform (heterogeneity across
subgroups). In addition, we can inspect the figure for each subgroup to determine the range
of the earnings distribution in which individuals exhibit positive subgroup-specific QTEs
(heterogeneity within subgroup).

   33
      We provide results using alternative testing procedures based on Bonferroni (1936), Holm (1979), and
Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Melly (2013) in the Online Appendix.
   34
      Note that in our application the number of hypotheses being tested is quite small particularly relative to
genomic studies from genome wide association studies. If the number of hypotheses were large it is well known
that FWER controlling procedures typically have low power, and in response Gu and Shen (2016) propose an
optimal false discovery rate controlling method.

    First, we split the sample by observable characteristics that may determine single mothers’
wage offers (education) and labor supply (marital status, age and number of children). The
multiple testing results illustrated in Figure 3 show that women with a high school degree or
GED, who were never married, those with older and with two or more children, respectively,
have higher earnings under Jobs First than AFDC over a wider range of the earnings dis-
tribution. These results confirm the theoretical predictions from Section 3. Better educated
women who receive higher wage offers may benefit more from the generous earnings disre-
gards under Jobs First and therefore increase their labor supply more. At the same time,
women without a high school degree or GED are more likely to lower their labor supply in
order to become eligible for Jobs First benefits, leading to negative QTEs in the upper range
of the earnings distribution. Single mothers with young children are more restricted in their
time allocation, so they are less likely to change their labor supply in response to different
welfare rules. The wider range of significant QTEs among mothers with two or more children
may be due to the welfare rules that make benefits a function of family size. These results
are important because they can show policymakers which subgroups should be targeted with
a welfare reform such as Jobs First.
    We now move to individual characteristics that reflect outcomes before random assign-
ment, in particular past earnings and welfare receipt.35 Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (forth-
coming) find that subgroup-specific constant treatment effects conditional on previous earn-
ings and welfare receipt come closest in explaining the observed QTEs in the entire sample.
Figure 4 shows the QTEs and multiple testing results for subgroups defined by earnings and
welfare receipt before the experiment. The only subgroups that exhibit jointly significant
QTEs are those with either no earnings or with the highest levels of welfare receipt before
random assignment. Compared to the results for the whole sample in Figure 2, women in
these subgroups benefit from the reform in higher ranges of the earnings distribution, roughly
between the 60th and 80th percentile when considering pre-random assignment welfare receipt
and between the 75th and 95th percentile for single mothers who had no positive earnings in
the seven quarters before the experiment. These percentiles correspond to quarterly earnings
up to $2,000 to $3,800 depending on the subgroup category.
    The results for subgroups defined based on prior earnings and welfare receipt are con-
sistent with a static labor supply model. Welfare recipients who were not employed before
participating in the Jobs First experiment, but instead relied on welfare, benefit the most
from this policy. They move from non-employment to a point on the budget constraint where
they have positive earnings and may take advantage of the generous earnings disregards un-
der the new welfare rules. On the other hand, individuals who had positive earnings before
the experiment are located further to the right on the budget constraint and may increase
   35
      Heckman and Smith (1998) provide evidence that groups based on pre-treatment earnings are a better
predictor of treatment effect heterogeneity than groups based on standard demographic variables.

their labor supply only a little. Those with high earnings may even reduce their labor supply
to become eligible for Jobs First. These predictions are clearly borne out by the results in
Figure 4. For example, among women with an above-median share of pre-random assign-
ment quarters with positive earnings, the range of negative QTEs is largest, because many
of them reduce their labor supply in response to the Jobs First rules. Overall, our multiple
testing results have clear policy implications as they show that a substantial share of the
most disadvantaged women benefit from this reform.
   We now formally test for treatment effect heterogeneity between and within subgroups.
Table 3 presents the results for hypothesis (H.5) for the same subgroups as above. This
null hypothesis posits that there are no differences across subgroups that can explain the
observed heterogeneity of QTEs in the full sample. We can reject the (H.5) for all but two
sets of subgroups at a level of five percent. The p-value is largest for subgroups defined by
education and the share of quarter on welfare before random assignment. Hence, for these
two subgroup categories, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effect is
constant across earnings percentiles for all subgroups. Overall, however, we conclude that
differences across subgroups do not explain the observed distributional treatment effects in
the whole sample. While this result may appear similar to Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes
(forthcoming), our test relaxes the strong assumption of treatment effect homogeneity within
subgroups that is implicit in their test.
   The tests of hypothesis (H.6) shown in Table 4 additionally account for potential depen-
dencies within and across subgroups. These test results provide additional insight beyond

Notes: This table shows test results for hypothesis (H.6), i.e. these tests show for which subgroups in each
subgroup category we can reject homogenous treatment effects. p-values are calculated using a grid with
step size 0.005. Hence an entry of zero indicates that the corresponding p-value is below 0.005.

testing (H.5) because they identify the individual subgroups that exhibit treatment effect het-
erogeneity. In these results, a p-value below 0.05 indicates that the corresponding subgroup
exhibits a statistically significant amount of treatment effect heterogeneity across the earning
distribution. The only subgroup categories for which we do not find evidence of treatment
effect heterogeneity are share of quarters with positive earnings and welfare receipt, respec-
tively. These results confirm the findings in Figure 4. In particular, they indicate that
individuals with little past welfare receipt of positive past earnings generally do not increase
their labor supply, so we also do not find any heterogeneity in the QTEs for these sub-
groups. Overall, however, our results clearly suggest a substantial amount of treatment effect
heterogeneity between subgroups and across the earnings distribution within subgroups.


6    Conclusion
In this paper we develop six general tests for treatment effect heterogeneity in settings with
selection on observables. These tests allow researchers to provide policymakers with guidance
on complex patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity both within and across subgroups. In
the present context, the results can guide policymakers in adjusting welfare rules, for example
by introducing more (or different) conditions for welfare receipt. In contrast to much of the
existing literature, these tests make corrections for multiple testing and therefore provide valid
inference under dependence between subgroups and quantiles. Further, our tests generalize
the idea of tests considered in Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (forthcoming) by not restricting
treatment effects to be constant across quantiles within a subgroup when determining if the
distributional heterogeneity across the full sample is characterized by subgroups.
    Using data from the Jobs First experiment, we not only present evidence of considerable
treatment effect heterogeneity for most subgroups, but show in which subgroups and which
earnings quantiles within subgroups the benefits of welfare reform are highest. In addition,
our empirical analysis emphasizes the importance of correcting for multiple testing. Testing
across different subgroups is policy relevant, and while Crump et al. (2008) provide an ap-
proach to select which subpopulations to study, our tests go further by considering treatment
effect heterogeneity conditional on observable characteristics.
    We would like to emphasize that our multiple testing approach is generally applicable in
various other ways beyond what this paper demonstrated. First, the tests can be applied
to situations with multiple treatments (e.g., List, Shaikh, and Xu, 2016) or situations where
there is selection on unobservables that explore if there is heterogeneity in marginal treatment
effects (e.g., Heckman and Vytlacil, 2005; Brinch, Mogstad, and Wiswall, forthcoming). Sec-
ond, instead of using inverse propensity score weighting, we may directly use the conditional
distribution functions or conditional quantile functions to identify the treatment effects as
proposed by Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Melly (2013). Certainly we can extend their

thresholds in the distribution function or quantiles in the quantile function with or without
subgroups.
