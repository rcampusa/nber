A Review of IPO Activity, Pricing, and Allocations

                                             ABSTRACT

        We review the theory and evidence on IPO activity: why firms go public, why they reward
first-day investors with considerable underpricing, and how IPOs perform in the long run. Our
perspective on the literature is three-fold: First, we believe that many IPO phenomena are not stationary.
Second, we believe research into share allocation issues is the most promising area of research in IPOs
at the moment. Third, we argue that asymmetric information is not the primary driver of many IPO
phenomena. Instead, we believe future progress in the literature will come from non-rational and agency
conflict explanations. We describe some promising such alternatives.

                           A Review of IPO Activity, Pricing, and Allocations




       From 1980 to 2001, the number of companies going public in the United States exceeded
one per business day. The number of initial public offerings (IPOs) has varied from year to year,
however, with some years seeing fewer than 100 IPOs, and others seeing more than 400. These
IPOs raised $488 billion (in 2001 dollars) in gross proceeds, an average of $78 million per deal.
At the end of the first day of trading, their shares traded on average at 18.8 percent above the
price at which the company sold them. For an investor buying shares at the first-day closing
price and holding them for three years, IPOs returned 22.6 percent. Still, over three years, the
average IPO underperformed the CRSP value-weighted market index by 23.4 percent and
underperformed seasoned companies with the same market capitalization and book-to-market
ratio by 5.1 percent.
       In a nutshell, these numbers summarize the patterns in issuing activity, underpricing, and
long-run underperformance, which have been the focus of a large theoretical and empirical
literature. We survey this literature, focusing on recent papers. Space constraints force us to
take a U.S.-centric point of view and to omit a description of the institutional aspects of going
public. The interested reader can consult Jenkinson and Ljunqvist (2001), Ellis, Michaely and
O’Hara (2000), Foerster (2000), and Killian, Smith, and Smith (2001) for descriptions of the
institutional process. Jenkinson and Ljungqvist give extensive coverage to international patterns
and practices.
       Averages hide the time trends and year-by-year variation in these phenomena, as shown
in Table 1. The 1980s saw modest IPO activity (about $8 billion in issuing activity per year). In
the 1990s, issuing volume roughly doubled to $20 billion per year during 1990-1994, doubled
again from 1995 to 1998 ($35 billion per year), and then doubled again from 1999 to 2000 ($65
billion per year), before falling to $34 billion in 2001. Average first-day returns show a similar
pattern, increasing from 7.4% in the 1980s to 11.2% in the early 1990s, to 18.1% in the mid
1990s, and to 65.0% in 1999 and 2000, before falling back to 14.0% in 2001. The long-run
performance of IPOs also varies over time. Three-year market-adjusted buy-and-hold returns are
negative in every subperiod, but not for every cohort year. Style-adjusted buy-and-hold returns




                                                  2
are not as reliably negative, with many cohorts, and some subperiods, having positive style-
adjusted buy-and-hold returns.
       Our article seeks to review different explanations for these patterns in issuing activity,
underpricing, and long-run underperformance. But it also weighs in with our personal
perspective on issues that are still contentious. We believe that the time-variation in these
phenomena deserves more emphasis. For example, the long-run performance of IPOs is not only
sensitive to the widely debated choice of econometric methodology, but also to the choice of
sample period, as shown in Table 1. Further, we argue that asymmetric information theories are
unlikely to be the primary determinant fluctuations in IPO activity and underpricing, especially
the excesses of the internet bubble period. Instead, we believe that specific non-rational
explanations and agency explanations will play a bigger role in the future research agenda. In
discussing theories of underpricing, we devote significant attention to the topic of share
allocations and subsequent ownership. In our view, how IPO shares are allocated is one of the
most interesting issues in IPO research today.
       The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section I, we survey IPO
activity. Section II covers IPO pricing and allocation. Section III presents evidence and analysis
on the long-run underperformance of IPOs, and Section IV concludes.

                  Number of IPOs, First-day Returns, Gross Proceeds, Amount of Money
                 Left on the Table, and Long Run Performance, by Cohort Year, 1980-2001
The equally weighted (EW) average first-day return is measured from the offer price to the first CRSP-listed closing price. Gross
proceeds is the amount raised from investors in millions (2001 purchasing power using the CPI, global offering amount,
excluding overallotment options). Money left on the table (millions of dollars, 2001 purchasing power) is calculated as the
number of shares issued times the change from the offer price to the first day closing price. EW average 3-year buy-and-hold
percentage returns (capital gains plus dividends) are calculated from the first closing market price to the earlier of the 3-year
anniversary price, the delisting price, or September 30, 2001. Buy-and-hold returns for initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring
after Sept. 30, 2000 are not calculated. Market-adjusted returns are calculated as the buy-and-hold return on an IPO minus the
compounded daily return on the CRSP value-weighted index of Amex, Nasdaq and NYSE firms. Style -adjusted buy-and-hold
returns are calculated as the difference between the return on an IPO and a style -matched firm. For each IPO, a non-IPO
matching firm that has been CRSP-listed for at least five years with the closest market capitalization and book-to-market ratio as
the IPO is used. If this is delisted prior to the IPO return’s ending date, or if it conducts a follow-on stock offering, a replacement
matching firm is spliced in on a point-forward basis. IPOs with an offer price below $5.00 per share, unit offers, REITs, closed-
end funds, banks and S&Ls, ADRs, and IPOs not listed on CRSP within six months of issuing have been excluded. Data is from
Thomson Financial Securities Data, with supplements from Dealogic and other sources, and corrections by authors.

I. IPO Activity: Choosing to Go Public
        The first question must be "why do firms go public?" In most cases, the primary answer
is the desire to raise equity capital for the firm and to create a public market in which the
founders and other shareholders can convert some of their wealth into cash at a future date. Non-
financial reasons, such as increased publicity, play only a minor role for most firms: absent cash
considerations, most entrepreneurs would rather just run their firms than concern themselves
with the complex public market process. This still leaves the question of why IPOs are the best
way for entrepreneurs to raise capital, and why the motivation to do an IPO is stronger in some
situations or times (see Table 1) than in others. Stepping outside our own sample, Gompers and
Lerner (2001) report that there were fewer U.S. IPOs from 1935-1959 than the 683 in 1969
alone, and La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) report wide differences in
IPO activity across countries.
A. Life Cycle Theories
        The first formal theory of the going public decision appeared in Zingales (1995). He
observed that it is much easier for a potential acquiror to spot a potential takeover target when it
is public. Moreover, entrepreneurs realize that acquirors can pressure targets on pricing
concessions more than they can pressure outside investors. By going public, entrepreneurs thus
help facilitate the acquisition of their company for a higher value than what they would get from
an outright sale. In contrast, Black and Gilson (1998) point out that entrepreneurs often regain
control from the venture capitalists in venture capital-backed companies at the IPO. Thus, many
IPOs are not so much exits for the entrepreneur as they are for the venture capitalists.
        Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1999) develop the more conventional wisdom that IPOs allow
more dispersion of ownership, with its advantages and disadvantages. Pre-IPO “angel” investors
or venture capitalists hold undiversified portfolios, and therefore are not willing to pay as high a
price as diversified public-market investors. There are fixed costs associated with going public,
however, and proprietary information cannot be costlessly revealed—after all, small investors
cannot take a tour of the firm and its secret inventions. Thus, early in its life cycle a firm will be
private, but if it grows sufficiently large, it becomes optimal to go public.
        Public trading per se has costs and benefits. Maksimovic and Pichler (2001) point out
that a high public price can attract product market competition. Public trading, however, can in
itself add value to the firm, as it may inspire more faith in the firm from other investors,


                                                   5
customers, creditors, and suppliers. Being the first in an industry to go public sometimes confers
a first-mover advantage. The quintessential company often cited as an example is Netscape.
However, Spyglass was a browser company that went public two months before Netscape---and
quickly faltered under Netscape’s competition. Schultz and Zaman (2001) report that many
internet firms that went public in the late 1990s pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy,
which they interpret as an attempt to pre-empt competitors.
B. Market-Timing Theories
       Lucas and McDonald (1990) develop an asymmetric information model where firms
postpone their equity issue if they know they are currently undervalued. If a bear market places
too low a value on the firm, given the knowledge of entrepreneurs, then they will delay their
IPOs until a bull market offers more favorable pricing. In Choe, Masulis, and Nanda (1993),
firms avoid issuing in periods where few other good-quality firms issue. Other theories have
argued that markets provide valuable information to entrepreneurs (“information spillovers”),
who respond to increased growth opportunities signaled by higher prices (Subramanyam and
Titman (1999), Schultz (2000)).
       We suggest that in addition to these rational theories for IPO volume fluctuations, a
plausible semi-rational theory without asymmetric information can also explain cycles in issuing
activity: entrepreneurs’ sense of enterprise value derives more from their internal perspective,
their day-to-day involvement with the underlying business fundamentals, and less so from the
public stock market. Sudden changes in the value of publicly traded firms are not as quickly
absorbed into the private sense of value held by entrepreneurs. Thus entrepreneurs adjust their
valuation with a lag. As a result, even if the market price is driven by irrational public sentiment
or the entrepreneur’s price is driven by irrational private sentiment, entrepreneurs are more
inclined to sell shares after valuations in the public markets have increased.
C. Evidence
       For the most part, formal theories of IPO issuing activity are difficult to test. This is
because researchers usually only observe the set of firms actually going public. They do not
observe how many private firms could have gone public. Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998)
escape this criticism with a unique data set of Italian firms. They find that larger companies and
companies in industries with high market-to-book ratios are more likely to go public, and that
companies going public seem to have reduced their costs of credit. Remarkably, they also find


                                                  6
that IPO activity follows high investment and growth, not vice versa. Lerner (1994) focuses on a
single U.S. industry, biotechnology. Lerner documents that industry market-to-book ratios have
a substantial effect on the decision to go public rather than to acquire additional venture capital
financing.
        The academic literature has tended to view increases in the valuation of comparable firms
as reflecting improved growth opportunities. But more favorable investor sentiment could also
play a role in the increased valuations. When investors are overoptimistic, firms respond by
issuing equity in a “window of opportunity.” Baker and Wurgler (2000) investigate a prediction
of this framework. Using annual data starting in the 1920s on aggregate equity issuance relative
to debt plus equity issuance, they find that the higher that the fraction of equity issuance is, the
lower the overall stock market return is in the following year. Lowry (2002) finds that investor
sentiment (measured by the discount on closed-end funds), growth opportunities, and adverse
selection considerations all are determinants of aggregate IPO volume. A glance at Table 1 also
conveys some of the correlation between IPO issuing activity and underpricing, investigated in
greater detail in Lowry and Schwert (2002). They and other authors find that high IPO first-day
returns lead high IPO activity by about six months.
        High IPO activity may follow high underpricing because underwriters encourage more
firms to go public when public valuations turn out to be higher than expected and because
underwriters discourage firms from filing or proceeding with an offering when public valuations
turn out to be lower than expected. For example, in 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index had the
lowest return in Nasdaq’s thirty-year history, and the ratio of withdrawn offerings to completed
offerings increased to 38 percent, a proportion much higher than normal (Ljungqvist and
Wilhelm (2002b)).
D. The Changing Composition of IPO Issuers
        Aggregate numbers disguise the fact that the type of firms going public has changed over
the years. Table 2 shows that the percentage of technology firms increased from about 25
percent of the IPO market in the 1980s and early 1990s, to 37 percent after 1995 and an amazing
72 percent during the internet bubble, before returning to 29 percent in 2001.1 The increase in

and communications services, but do not include biotechnology.


                                                       7
the percentage of technology firms over time is mirrored in the number of firms with negative
earnings in the twelve months prior to going public. In the 1980s, only 19 percent of firms had
negative earnings before going public. This gradually increased to 37 percent by 1995-1998, and
then rose precipitously to 79 percent during the bubble. Although we do not show it in our
tables, it was unusual for a prestigious investment banker in the 1960s and 1970s to take a firm
public that did not have at least four years of positive earnings. In the 1980s, four quarters of
positive earnings was still standard. In the 1990s, fewer and fewer firms met this threshold.
Still, the investment banking firm’s analyst would normally project profitability in the year after
going public. During the bubble, firms with no immediate prospect of becoming profitable
became common. For example, public forecasts for eToys projected no profits for at least two
years. At the time of going public in May 1999, forecasted EPS was -$0.27 for 1999 and -$0.55
for 2000. These turned out to be overly optimistic forecasts, as eToys liquidated in 2001.
         It is conventional wisdom among both academics and practitioners that the quality of
firms going public deteriorates as a period of high issuing volume progresses. Helwege and
Liang (2001) provide evidence, however, that in 1982-1993 there was little difference in the
observable characteristics of firms in low volume and high volume markets. Consistent with
this, Loughran and Ritter (2001) report that the median age of firms going public has been
remarkably stable at about 7 years old since 1980. The exception to this pattern is the internet
bubble period, when the median age fell to 5 years, and 2001, when the median age rose to 12
years.
         Table 2 shows that there is a reasonably strong relation across time between the
percentage of firms with negative earnings and the average first-day returns. The last two
columns report average first-day returns, conditional on whether the firm had positive earnings
or not. Except for the bubble period, there is little difference between the two columns in the
average first-day returns. Thus, the relative lack of a cross-sectional pattern suggests that the
increase in the fraction of firms with negative earnings is not a primary cause of the increase in
underpricing over time.

        Remarkably, IPO volume fluctuation in the late 1990s is attributable almost entirely to
the tech sector: the number of old-economy stocks going public remained at a level of about 100
firms per year, before, during, and after the bubble. The large number of IPOs by young internet
firms in 1999-2000, and their almost complete disappearance in 2001, raises the issue of what
determines bubbles. But this is a question that transcends the IPO literature.
E. Summary
        We interpret the evidence on the going public decision as suggesting that firms go public
in response to favorable market conditions, but only if they are beyond a certain stage in their life
cycle. Perhaps the most important unanswered question is why issuing volume drops so
precipitously following stock market drops. Although offer prices are lowered, many firms
withdraw their offering rather than proceed with their IPO. In other words, why is there quantity




                                                   9
adjustment, rather than price adjustment? This is a puzzle not only for the IPO market, but for
follow-on offerings as well.


II.     IPO Pricing and Allocation
        Stoll and Curley (1970), Reilly (1973), Logue (1973), and Ibbotson (1975) first
documented a systematic increase from the offer price to the first day closing price.2 Academics
use the terms first-day returns and underpricing interchangeably. In our sample of 6,249 IPOs
from 1980-2001 in Table 1, the average first-day return is 18.8 percent. 3 Although not shown
here, approximately 70 percent of the IPOs end the first day of trading at a closing price greater
than the offer price and about 16 percent have a first-day return of exactly zero.4 We know of no
exceptions to the rule that the IPOs of operating companies are underpriced, on average, in all
countries. The offerings of non-operating companies, such as closed-end funds are generally not
underpriced.
A. Theoretical Explanations of Short-run Underpricing
        Ibbotson (1975) offered a list of possible explanations for underpricing, many of which
were formally explored by other authors in later work. Before going into detail, it is important to
understand that simple fundamental market misvaluation or asset-pricing risk premia are unlikely
to explain the average first-day return of 18.8 percent reported in our Table 1. To put this in
perspective, the comparable daily market return has averaged only 0.05 percent. Furthermore, if
diversified IPO first-day investors require compensation for bearing systematic or liquidity risk,
why do second-day investors (purchasing from first-day investors) not seem to require this
premium? After all, fundamental risk and liquidity constraints are unlikely to be resolved within




2
  The opening market price is close to an unbiased indicator of the closing market price on the first day, so results
are insensitive to whether the opening or closing market price is used. The vast majority of empirical work has used
the first closing price to measure the first-day return. This is also frequently called the initial return.
3
 The annual volume numbers reported in Table 1 are lower than those reported in Ritter (1998, Table 2) because of
our exclusion of “penny” stocks (defined as IPOs with an offer price of below $5.00 per share) and unit offers.
Ritter reports annual volume numbers for IPOs starting in 1960. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, penny stock IPOs
were a major portion of the number of IPOs, although only a small portion of aggregate proceeds.
4
 From 1980-1994, only 15 out of 3,614 IPOs doubled in value on their first day of trading. During 1995-1998, 34
out of 1,752 IPOs doubled on the first day. In the internet bubble years of 1999-2000, 182 out of 803 offerings
doubled in price on the first day, with the last occurrence in November 2000.

one day. Thus, the solution to the underpricing puzzle has to lie in focusing on the setting of the
offer price, where the normal interplay of supply and demand is suppressed by the underwriter.
         One way of classifying theories of underpricing is to categorize them on the basis of
whether asymmetric information or symmetric information is assumed. The former can in turn
be classified into theories in which IPO issuers are more informed than investors (perhaps about
internal projects) and into theories in which investors are more informed than the issuer (perhaps
about demand). Because we believe that recent share allocation- and trading-related
explanations offer considerable promise, we take the liberty to discuss these newer theories in
their own section, even though they could also be distributed into asymmetric and symmetric
information theories.
A.1. Theories Based on Asymmetric Information
         If the issuer is more informed than investors, rational investors fear a lemons problem:
only issuers with worse-than-average quality are willing to sell their shares at the average price.
To distinguish themselves from the pool of low-quality issuers, high-quality issuers may attempt
to signal their quality. In these models, better quality issuers deliberately sell their shares at a
lower price than the market believes they are worth, which deters lower quality issuers from
imitating. With some patience, these issuers can recoup their upfront sacrifice post-IPO, either
in future issuing activity (Welch (1989)), favorable market responses to future dividend
announcements (Allen and Faulhaber (1989)), or analyst coverage (Chemmanur (1993)). In
common with many other signaling models, high quality firms demonstrate that they are high
quality by throwing money away. One way to do this is to leave money on the table in the IPO.
However, on theoretical grounds, it is unclear why underpricing is a more efficient signal than,
say, committing to spend money on charitable donations or advertising.
         The evidence in favor of these signaling theories is, at best, mixed: there is evidence of
substantial post-issuing market activity by IPO firms (Welch (1989)), and it is clear that some
issuers approach the market with an intention to conduct future equity issues.5 However, there is
reason to believe that any price appreciation would induce entrepreneurs to return to the market




5
  It is worth noting that there is little controversy about whether issuing firms pursue a dynamic strategy, in which
the IPO is just one part. The controversy is whether post-issuing activity can explain underpricing, not IPO activity.


                                                         11
for more funding.6 Jegadeesh, Weinstein, and Welch (1993) find that returns after the first day
are just as effective in inducing future issuing activity as the first-day returns are. Michaely and
Shaw (1994) outright reject signaling: in a simultaneous equation model, they find no evidence
of either a higher propensity to return to the market for a seasoned offering or of a higher
propensity to pay dividends for IPOs that were more underpriced. Still, aside from the
persistence of the signaling explanation on the street, its most appealing feature is that some
issuers voluntarily desire to leave money on the table to create “a good taste in investors’
mouths.” As such, it is relatively compatible with higher levels of IPO underpricing.
        If investors are more informed than the issuer, for example about the general market
demand for shares, then the issuer faces a placement problem. The issuer does not know the
price the market is willing to bear. In other words, an issuer faces an unknown demand for its
stock. A number of theories model a specific demand curve.
        One can simply assume that all investors are equally informed, and thus purchase shares
only if their price is below their common assessment. Observed (successful) IPOs thus are
necessarily underpriced. There are, however, some overpriced IPOs going public, which would
not be predicted because all investors are assumed to know that these would be overpriced. A
more realistic assumption is that investors are differentially informed. Pricing too high might
induce investors and issuers to fear a winner’s curse (Rock (1986)) or a negative cascade (Welch
(1992)).
        In a winner’s curse, investors fear that they will only receive full allocations if they
happen to be among the most optimistic investors. When everyone desires the offering, they get
rationed. An investor would receive a full allocation of overpriced IPOs but only a partial
allocation of underpriced IPOs. Thus, his average return, conditional on receiving shares, would
be below the unconditional return. To break even, investors need to be underpriced. Koh and
Walter (1989) have rationing information, and find that an uninformed strategy in Singapore
indeed just about broke even.
        In an informational cascade, investors attempt to judge the interest of other investors.
They only request shares when they believe the offering is hot. Pricing just a little too high
leaves the issuer with too high a probability of complete failure, in which investors abstain

 van Bommel and Vermaelen (2001) find that firms with higher first-day returns spend more money on investment
after the IPO.

                                                     12
because other investors abstain. In support, Amihud, Hauser, and Kirsh (2001) find that IPOs
tend to be either undersubscribed or hugely oversubscribed, with very few offerings moderately
oversubscribed.
        Benveniste and Spindt (1989), Benveniste and Wilhelm (1990), and Spatt and Srivastava
(1991) argue that the common practice of “bookbuilding” allows underwriters to obtain
information from informed investors.7 With bookbuilding, a preliminary offer price range is set,
and then underwriters and issuers go on a “road show” to market the company to prospective
investors. This road show helps underwriters to gauge demand as they record “indications of
interest” from potential investors. If there is strong demand, the underwriter will set a higher
offer price. But if potential investors know that showing a willingness to pay a high price will
result in a higher offer price, these investors must be offered something in return. To induce
investors to truthfully reveal that they want to purchase shares at a high price, underwriters must
offer them some combination of more IPO allocations and underpricing when they indicate a
willingness to purchase shares at a high price.
        Book-building theories lend themselves unusually well to empirical tests with available
data. The most commonly cited evidence in favor of book-building theories is the effect of
revisions in the offer price during the filing period, first documented by Hanley (1993). She
finds that underwriters do not fully adjust their pricing upward to keep underpricing constant
when demand is strong. Thus, when underwriters revise the share price upward from their
original estimate in the preliminary prospectus, underpricing tends to be higher. Table 3 shows
that this pattern has held throughout 1980-2001: When the offer price exceeds the maximum of
the original file price range, the average underpricing is significantly above average (53 percent
instead of three percent for IPOs adjusting their offer price downward and 12 percent for IPOs
priced within their filing range). This extra underpricing is interpreted to be compensation that is
necessary to induce investors to reveal their high personal demand for shares. Consistent with
the information revelation theory of bookbuilding, Lee, Taylor, and Walter (1999) and Cornelli
and Goldreich (2001) show that informed investors request more, and preferentially receive
more, allocations. In related work, Cornelli and Goldreich (2002) examine orders placed by




7
  Benveniste and Busaba (1997) consider whether book building or cascade creation is more profitable from the
issuer’s point of view.

                                                      13
institutional investors and find that underwriters set offer prices that are more related to the
prices bid than to the quantities demanded.
        The information gathering perspective of book-building is certainly useful, but the theory
also suggests that the information provided by one incremental investor is not very valuable
when the investment banker can canvas hundreds of potential investors. Thus, it is not obvious
that this framework is capable of explaining average underpricing of more than a few percent.
The average underpricing of 53 percent, conditional on the offer price having been revised
upwards, reported in Table 3, seems too large to be explained as equilibrium compensation for
revealing favorable information.

        Baron (1982) offers a different, agency-based explanation for underpricing. His theory
also has the issuer less informed, but relative to its underwriter, not relative to investors. To
induce the underwriter to put in the requisite effort to market shares, it is optimal for the issuer to
permit some underpricing, because the issuer cannot monitor the underwriter without cost.
Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989), however, find that when underwriters themselves go public,
their shares are just as underpriced even though there is no monitoring problem. This evidence
does not favor the Baron hypothesis, although it does not refute it either. After all, underwriters
may want to underprice their own offerings in order to make the case that underpricing is a
necessary cost of going public.
        Habib and Ljungqvist (2001) also argue that underpricing is a substitute for costly
marketing expenditures. Using a dataset of IPOs from 1991-1995, they report that an extra
dollar left on the table reduces other marketing expenditures by a dollar. As with almost all other
theories of underpricing, however, these tradeoff theories do not plausibly explain the severe
underpricing of IPOs during the internet bubble. During the bubble, the IPOs of many internet
firms were the easiest shares ever to sell because of the intense interest by many investors. It is
difficult to believe that an underwriter could not have easily placed shares with half the
underpricing that was observed.
        All theories of underpricing based on asymmetric information share the prediction that
underpricing is positively related to the degree of asymmetric information. When the
asymmetric information uncertainty approaches zero in these models, underpricing disappears
entirely. Consequently, a strategy of selling IPOs only in bundles could reduce the uncertainty
about the average value of offerings, and with it the average underpricing necessary to
successfully go public. In other words, because underwriters have discretion regarding whom
shares are allocated to, they could insist on selling IPOs only to investors who agree to buy both
hot and cold IPOs. For average levels of underpricing that were observed in the 1980s, 7.4
percent, the bundling costs (e.g., waiting for sufficiently many IPOs to become available, taste
differences across investors, disagreements among issuers about value) may be higher than the
bundling benefits. However, for the 65 percent underpricing in 1999 and 2000, this is not likely
to be the case.

        There are also theories of underpricing that do not rely on asymmetric information that is
resolved on the first day of trading. Tinic (1988) and Hughes and Thakor (1992) argue that
issuers underprice to reduce their legal liability: an offering that starts trading at $30 that is
priced at $20 is less likely to be sued than if it had been priced at $30, if only because it is more
likely that at some point the after-market share price will drop below $30 than below $20. In
spite of this, Drake and Vetsuypens (1993) find that sued IPOs had higher, not lower
underpricing, i.e., that underpricing did not protect them from being sued. However, Lowry and
Shu (2002) point out that this may be because IPOs more likely to be sued later also underpriced
more. In our opinion, leaving money on the table appears to be a cost-ineffective way of
avoiding subsequent lawsuits. But the most convincing evidence that legal liability is not the
primary determinant of underpricing is that countries in which U.S. litigative tendencies are not
present have similar levels of underpricing (Keloharju (1993)).
        One popular related explanation for the high IPO underpricing during the internet bubble
is that underwriters could not justify a higher offer price on internet IPOs, perhaps out of legal
liability concerns, given the already lofty valuations on these companies. One way of
interpreting this is that underwriters were “leaning against the wind” by not taking advantage of
temporary overoptimism on the part of some investors. Although this argument has a certain
plausibility, we find it unconvincing because investment banking firms were making other
efforts to encourage overvaluations during the internet bubble, such as subsequently issuing
“buy” recommendations when market prices had risen far above the offer price.8
        Boehmer and Fishe (2001) advance another explanation for underpricing. They note that
trading volume in the aftermarket is higher, the greater is underpricing. (See Krigman, Shaw,
and Womack (1999) and Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2000) for related evidence.) Thus, an
underwriter that makes a market in a Nasdaq-listed IPO gains additional trading revenue. Unlike
the lawsuit-avoidance explanation of underpricing, it is not clear how the issuing firm benefits
from the underpricing, unless the increased liquidity is persistent (Booth and Chua (1996)).

  For example, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) took Corvis public on July 28, 2000 at an offer price of $36.00.
At the closing price of $84.719 on the first day of trading, the first-day return was 135%. When the quiet period
ended 25 calendar days after the IPO, the five co-managing underwriters all put out “buy” recommendations, and
CSFB initiated coverage with a “strong buy” recommendation, even though the price had increased to $90. At $90
per share, Corvi s had a market capitalization of $30 billion, despite never having had any revenue. (In December
2001, its market valuation was less than $1 billion.) Bradley, Jordan, and Ritter (2002) report that 87% of analyst
initiations at the end of the quiet period were “buys” or “strong buys” during 1996-2000.

B. Theories Focusing on the Allocation of Shares
       In recent years, more attention has been drawn to how IPOs are allocated and how their
shares trade. Part of the reason for the increased academic attention on share allocation is related
to the increased public attention on perceived unfairness in how shares are allocated, given the
large amount of money left on the table in recent years. Specifically, the allocation of shares to
institutional investors versus individuals has been a topic of interest. The development of the
literature on IPO trading activity has required access to detailed data, information that has only
recently become available. We discuss this literature on allocation and trading initiation
separately from the previous papers that we have reviewed because we believe that it explores
the most interesting open questions today. How do investors decide in which issues to request
IPO allocations, and how heavily influenced is this by perceptions of what others are going to
do? Who receives IPO allocations? How do allocations relate to other business provided by the
investor? How much effective bundling of shares across issues (and thus a reduction of average
uncertainty) do subscribers experience? Do large institutions receive preferential treatment
based on valuable information, and if so, what is it? Unfortunately, not only do the answers to
these questions depend upon the sample period, but underwriters also usually guard information
about the specifics of their share allocations, posing significant challenges to empiricists. Still,
progress has already been made. Table 4 classifies this literature into some popular lines of
inquiry and lists some recent representative papers.
       The seminal model focusing on the allocation of shares was Benveniste and Spindt
(1989), which we have previously discussed along with other asymmetric information-based
theories. In this model, underwriters use their discretion to extract information from investors,
which reduces average underpricing and increases proceeds to the issuers. As Sherman (2000)
and others have noted, the average level of underpricing required to induce information
revelation is reduced if underwriters have the ability to allocate shares in future IPOs to
investors. Sherman and Titman (2002) argue that there is an equilibrium degree of underpricing
which compensates investors for acquiring costly information. Many models are at least partly
based on the notion that if IPOs are underpriced on average, investors have an incentive to
acquire information about the firms to try and discern which will be underpriced the most.
       Loughran and Ritter (2002) explore the conflict of interest between underwriters and




                                              19
issuers. If underwriters are given discretion in share allocations, the discretion will not
automatically be used in the best interests of the issuing firm. Underwriters might intentionally
leave more money on the table then necessary, and then allocate these shares to favored buy-side
clients. There is some evidence that underpriced share allocations have been used by
underwriters to enrich buy-side clients in return for quid pro quos (Pulliam and Smith (2000,
2001), SEC news release 2002-14), to curry favor with the executives of other prospective IPO
issuers in a practice known as “spinning” (Siconolfi (1997)), or even to influence politicians.
        The mystery is why issuing firms appear generally content to leave so much money on
the table, and more so when their value has recently increased. 9 Loughran and Ritter use
prospect theory to argue that entrepreneurs are more tolerant of excessive underpricing if they
simultaneously learn about a post-market valuation that is higher than what they expected. In
other words, the greater the recent increase in their wealth, the less is the bargaining effort of
issuers in their negotiations over the offer price with underwriters.
        It is interesting to put the magnitude of the underpricing and its possible influence on
trading volume into perspective. In Table 1, we report that $66 billion was left on the table
during the internet bubble. If investors rebated 20 percent of this back to underwriters in the
form of extra commissions, this would amount to $13 billion. 10 At an average commission of 10
cents per share, this would amount to 130 billion shares traded, or an average of 250 million
shares per trading day during 1999-2000. Because combined Nasdaq and NYSE volume
averaged about ten times this amount during these years, this would suggest that portfolio
churning by investors to receive IPO allocations may have accounted for as much as 10 percent
of all shares traded during the internet bubble. Although 10 percent might be an overestimate of


9
 A deeper question is why firms do not choose a different mechanism for selling IPOs altogether. For selling many
other items where there is valuation uncertainty, auctions are the dominant mechanism. Worldwide, however,
auctions have been losing market share relative to bookbuilding when it comes to selling IPOs (Sherman (2001)).
10
  The $100 million settlement of abusive IPO allocation practices between Credit Suisse First Boston and the SEC
and NASD on January 22, 2002 includes the statement that “CSFB allocated shares of IPOs to more than 100
customers who, in return, funneled between 33 and 65 percent of their IPO profits to CSFB. These customers
typically flipped the stock on the day of the IPO, often gaining tremendous profits. They then transferred a share of
their flipping profits to CSFB by way of excessively high brokerage commissions… The customers paid these
commissions on uneconomic, limited-risk trades in highly liquid, exchange-traded shares unrelated to the IPO
shares—trades that they effected for the sole purpose of paying IPO flipping profits back to CSFB.” (SEC News
Release 2002-14). The NASD specifically mentions churning of Compaq and Disney stock for the purpose of
generating commission payments. A number of hedge fund managers have told us that they generated commissions
by churning massive numbers of shares in highly liquid stocks without ever paying more than eight cents per share.



                                                    20
the effect on overall trading volume, the SEC settlement states that extra share volume was
concentrated in certain highly liquid stocks. Market microstructure empirical work may need to
take this trading volume into account, much as “dividend capture” schemes by Japanese
insurance companies in the 1980s led to artificially high volume for U.S. stocks paying high
dividends around the ex dividend date.11
        At this point, there has been no academic research investigating how the money left on
the table during the internet bubble was split among buy-side participants (individual investors,
mutual funds, hedge funds, “friends and family,” etc.) and sell-side participants (the stockholders
of investment banking firms through higher profits; and analysts, traders, and corporate finance
employees through bigger bonuses). Ljungqvist and Wilhelm (2002b) document that the
frequency of directed share programs (friends and family shares) increased dramatically between
1996 and 1999. They argue that this reduced the opportunity cost of underpricing for firm
managers.
        Both the Benveniste and Spindt bookbuilding theory and the Loughran and Ritter conflict
of interest theory predict sluggish price adjustment: the final offer price is not fully adjusted from
the midpoint of the file price range when underwriters receive favorable information. Although
the information revelation theory can explain underwriters’ sluggish price adjustment to private
information, it does not predict that there should be anything less than full adjustment to public
information. In contrast, the prospect theory explanation predicts that there will be sluggish
adjustment to both private and public information, because prospect theory makes no distinction
about the source of good news. Lowry and Schwert (2002) and Loughran and Ritter (2002)
present evidence that when the overall stock market rallies during the road show period,
underwriters do not fully adjust their pricing. However, this alone cannot fully explain the
relationship between price adjustment and first-day returns, pointing to a role for private
information extraction, too.
        The prospect theory explanation of the partial adjustment phenomenon predicts that all
IPOs that are in the road show stage of going public when there is an overall market rally will
have higher expected underpricing, because offer prices are not raised as much as they could be



11
  See Koskie and Michaely (2000) for evidence on the effects of Japanese dividend capture schemes on reported
share volume.




                                                 21
in this scenario. Because the bookbuilding period is typically about four weeks in length, the
first day returns of these IPOs will be correlated. This provides a partial explanation for the
phenomenon of hot issue markets. Empirically, the autocorrelation of monthly average first-day
returns is 0.60 from 1960 to 1997 (Lowry and Schwert (2002)). The autocorrelation is even
higher if 1998-2001 is included in the sample period, due to the extremely high first-day returns
during the internet bubble. Every single month from November 1998 to April 2000 had an
average first-day return of more than 30 percent.
        Many empirical papers examining IPO allocations focus on the distinction between
institutional and individual (or retail) investors. Institutions are different from retail clients, in
that their scale should make it more likely that they are both better informed and more important
clients. The evidence to date is still conflicting as to how successful institutions are at receiving
preferential allocations. Using U.S. data, Aggarwal, Prabhala, and Puri (2002) and Hanley and
Wilhelm (1995) find that institutions are favored, as do Cornelli and Goldreich (2001) using
U.K. data, but Lee, Taylor and Walter (1999) find the opposite using data from Singapore. The
measurement here is difficult, because theories and evidence suggest that regular investors
participate in bundled IPOs. Cornelli and Goldreich (2001) also find that more information-rich
requests are favorably rewarded. Future research is likely to further distinguish among different
classes and characteristics of institutional investors.
        Institutions are also naturally blockholders, potentially capable of displacing poorly
performing management. Who purchases an IPO’s shares may in turn influence IPO activity,
underpricing, and long-run performance. A good number of companies begin implementing
takeover defenses as early as the IPO (Field and Karpoff (2002)). Booth and Chua (1996),
Brennan and Franks (1997), Mello and Parsons (1998), and Stoughton and Zechner (1998) all
point out that underpricing creates excess demand and thus allows issuers and underwriters to
decide to whom to allocate shares. Stoughton and Zechner argue that underpricing is needed to
create an incentive to acquire a block of stock and then monitor the firm’s management, creating
a positive externality for atomistic investors. Mello and Parsons point out that a two-part issuing
strategy may be more efficient, with the IPO aimed at atomistic investors and a private
placement aimed at a blockholder. In the U.S., large blockholders are common prior to the IPO
in the form of venture capitalists and leveraged buyout financiers, but the venture capitalists




                                               22
typically distribute shares to their limited partners as soon as the lockup period ends.
Furthermore, the general partners typically also relinquish control via open market sales, rather
than selling a strategic block. This suggests that corporate control considerations related to
blockholders may not be of primary importance for many of these companies.
        In a sample of 69 British IPOs, Brennan and Franks (1997) find that when shares are
placed more widely rather than placed with just a few powerful large shareholders, the
entrepreneur is less easy to oust from the company. Brennan and Franks also find that directors
continue to hold onto shares more than other investors, again presumably trying to retain control
of the company.
        In contrast to models in which big investors add value, Booth and Chua (1996) link
allocation to after-market trading and argue that small investors are more valuable. Issuers like
the increased liquidity associated with more aftermarket trading brought about by more investor
dispersion.
        In all of these models, underpricing results in excess demand, which permits underwriters
to place shares with specific clienteles. To raise the same amount of capital, if the shares offered
are underpriced, the issuing firm must sell more shares, diluting the existing shareholders. It is
not at all obvious that the benefits of placing shares with specific clienteles outweigh the control
benefits of insiders retaining a larger fraction of the firm. Field and Sheehan (2001) find that
clienteles are rather temporary, casting doubt on the usefulness of explanations based on future
services from investors who receive allocations of shares at the time of the IPO.
        A number of articles focus on the actions of the lead underwriter when after-market
trading begins. Underwriters can influence the after-market price not only by their pre-IPO
decisions on pricing and allocation, but also through actively participating in the after-market
themselves.
        Underwriters not only have price discretion, but also quantity discretion. In allocating
shares, they control not only who gets shares, but how many shares in the aggregate are
allocated. Almost all IPOs contain an overallotment option for up to 15 percent of the shares
offered.12 In allocating shares, if there is strong demand, the underwriter will allocate 115


12
  The overallotment option is also called a “Green Shoe” option, after the first company that included one in its
1963 IPO.




                                                    23
percent of the shares. Then, if the price weakens in aftermarket trading, the underwriter can buy
back up to the extra 15 percent and retire the shares, as if they had never been offered in the first
place.
         Aggarwal (2000) and Zhang (2001) focus on the number of shares that are allocated.
Aggarwal reports that if the underwriter anticipates weak demand, it will typically allocate up to
135 percent of the offering, taking a naked short position. The underwriter then buys back the
incremental 20 percent, and has the option of buying back the other 15 percent, treating the
shares as if they were never issued in the first place. Zhang argues that the allocation of these
extra shares boosts the aftermarket demand for the stock. This is because institutional investors
who are allocated shares are likely to continue holding them, whereas if they had not received
any shares in the first place, they would have been unlikely to buy them in the aftermarket. The
extra buy-and-hold demand that results from the overallocation boosts the aftermarket price and
increases the price at which issuers can offer shares. If the demand for an IPO is strong,
underwriters do not take a naked short position because covering it would be too costly.
         Once trading commences, if there is weak demand, the lead underwriter might attempt to
“stabilize” the price through various activities aimed at reducing selling pressure. Price
stabilization is the only instance in which the SEC permits active attempts at stock price
manipulation. Price stabilization activities include pre-IPO allocation policy, post-IPO purchases
of shares by the lead underwriter, and the discouragement of selling.
         Flippers are temporary investors who purchase shares at the IPO and quickly turn around
to sell their shares. Underwriters have a quixotic view towards flippers: on the one hand, the
new conflict of interest theories of underpricing argue that underwriters sometimes allocate
shares specifically to investors so that these investors can make a quick profit. Furthermore,
underwriters desire liquid after-market trading, if only because they are usually the prime market
maker. On the other hand, the “artificial” demand of flippers can make it difficult both to gauge
the buy-and-hold demand for shares pre-IPO and to properly price shares.
         For IPOs with weak demand, underwriters discourage flipping through moral suasion
(i.e., the threat of withholding future allocations on hot issues) and the imposition of penalty
bids. A penalty bid occurs when the lead underwriter takes back the selling concession (the
commission) from a broker who has allocated shares that are flipped. The existence of penalty




                                              24
bids gives a broker an incentive to allocate shares to clients who are likely to be buy-and-hold
investors. More controversially, after the shares have been allocated, a penalty bid also gives a
broker a financial incentive to discourage a client from selling shares. For IPOs where there is
strong demand and a price jump, penalty bids are rarely imposed, and flipping may even be
encouraged in order to keep market demand from pushing the price to unsustainable levels. The
practice of encouraging sales in this scenario explicitly assumes that there is a negatively sloped
demand curve, and that the market price is not exogenous.
        One question that arises is whether flipping by institutions can be used to predict long-
term returns on IPOs. That is, do institutions succeed in identifying IPOs that are being
overvalued when trading commences? Krigman, Shaw, and Womack (1999) and Houge,
Loughran, Suchanek, and Yan (2002) find evidence suggesting that indeed they do.
        Underwriters are prohibited from initiating analyst coverage for 25 calendar days (the
“quiet period”). Typically, the managing underwriters (lead and co-managers) initiate research
coverage at the end of the quiet period, usually with a “buy” or “strong buy” recommendation.
Michaely and Womack (1999) provide evidence that the investment bank’s analysts regularly
provide “booster shots” in the form of buy recommendations which are greeted with a positive
stock market reaction, even though these IPOs subsequently underperform. Oddly, the market
does not seem to recognize the full extent of this bias, so that this service remains valuable to the
issuer. However, the underwriters’ analysts are not unique in being optimistic: Rajan and
Servaes (1997) find that analysts of investment banking firms that did not co-manage the IPO
tend to disproportionately follow underpriced IPOs and also are overly optimistic on average.
Bradley, Jordan, and Ritter (2002) find that IPOs from 1996 to 2000 rise an average of three
percent when their quiet periods ended. For IPOs where analyst recommendations occur, the
market-adjusted return is four percent. For other IPOs, the market-adjusted return is close to
zero. The positive average effect of three percent is difficult to reconcile with market efficiency,
because the fact that positive recommendations will be forthcoming 25 days after going public is
not a surprise.
        For shares not sold in the offering, pre-issue shareholders commit to a specified lockup
period, during which they agree not to sell any shares without the written permission of the lead
underwriter. Although there is no statutory minimum, most lockup periods are 180 calendar




                                              25
days in length and almost none are less than 90 days (Field and Hanka (2001)).
       Eventually, IPOs transition to become ordinary stocks. Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara
(2000) and Aggarwal and Conway (2000) document that the lead underwriter is typically the
dominant market maker for Nasdaq-listed IPOs. The underwriter knows with whom shares are
placed, and thus has a comparative advantage at contacting investors if there is an order
imbalance. Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2000) report that market making is a profitable activity
for the lead underwriter, with the profits during the first three months amounting to about two
percent of the issue size. Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2002) further report that market making
activity in Nasdaq-listed IPOs continues to be concentrated long after the offering. For smaller
IPOs, the lead underwriter’s market share declines from almost 100 percent at the inception of
trading to less than 50 percent on average about half a year after the offering.
C. Valuation
       An immediate question raised by the difference between the offer price and the first-day
market price is whether issuers or the stock market is pricing offerings in line with a firm’s
fundamentals. The most common method for valuing firms going public is the use of
comparable firm multiples. But unfortunately, accounting data are in many cases too unreliable
a measure of valuation to facilitate powerful tests, especially because many firms going public
are being valued on the basis of their growth options, not their historical financials. As a result,
the power of tests to explain pricing relative to some “true fundamental value” is too low to
make much headway in testing whether IPO pricing or after-market valuation better reflects the
IPOs’ fundamental valuations unless the sample is large. Kim and Ritter (1999) find only a
modest ability to explain the pricing of IPOs using accounting multiples, even when using
earnings forecasts.
       Purnanandam and Swaminathan (2001) construct a measure of intrinsic value based on
industry-matched Price/Sales and Price/Ebitda from comparable publicly traded firms (“comps”)
for a sample of over 2,000 IPOs from 1980-1997. They find that, when offer prices are used,
IPO firms are priced about 50% above comparables, which is an enormous difference. They also
find that this initial overpricing with respect to comparables helps predict long-run
underperformance.
       Although it is difficult to come up with accurate valuation measures for IPOs, this




                                              26
literature is promising. The next step may involve the use of earnings forecasts with more
detailed corporate information to enhance the power of these tests.
D. Summary
       As readers of this literature, we come away with the view that underpricing is a persistent
feature of the IPO market, and, while cyclical, may have increased in magnitude over time.
While asymmetric information models have been popular among academics, we feel that these
models have been overemphasized. In our view there is no single dominant theoretical cause for
underpricing. Thus, it is not so much a matter of which model is right, but more a matter of the
relative importance of different models. Furthermore, one reason can be of more importance for
some firms and/or at some times. To date, there has been little empirical work attempting to
quantify the relative importance of different explanations of underpricing.


III.   Long-run Performance
       Perhaps the facet of IPOs that has attracted the most interest from academics in recent
years is the stock price performance of IPOs in the years after the offering. Efficient markets
proponents would argue that once an IPO is publicly traded, it is just like any other stock and
thus the after-market stock price should appropriately reflect the shares’ intrinsic value.
Consequently, risk-adjusted post-IPO stock price performance should not be predictable. In this
sense, post-IPO long-run performance is less of an IPO (or corporate finance) issue than it is a
standard asset-pricing issue. Still, many IPO shares have been difficult to sell short and thus
have retained some peculiarity even post-IPO.
       In measuring long-run performance, one can focus either on raw (absolute) performance,
or performance relative to a benchmark (abnormal returns). Table 1 shows that investing in an
equal-weighted portfolio of IPOs over a three-year horizon did not lose money in absolute terms,
but an investment in the value-weighted market portfolio would have yielded about twice the
return, resulting a three-year market-adjusted return of –23.4%. Still, there is far from a
consensus with respect to the proper measurement technique. We believe that the sample used,
both in terms of the sample period and the sample selection criteria, is also an important

A. Long-Run Performance Evidence
        Statistical inference is problematic when the returns on individual IPOs overlap, as they
do when multi-year buy-and-hold returns (as in Table 1) are used. Indeed, this is a problem for
all long-term performance studies, not just those examining IPO performance. These
measurement issues have been addressed in Brav (2000) and other papers. Nevertheless, Table 1
highlights one important issue plaguing this literature: When publicly traded firms similar in
market capitalization and book-to-market values are used as a benchmark, it becomes clear that
the poor long-run performance of firms “similar to IPO firms” extends beyond the IPO market.
IPOs are strongly tilted towards small growth firms, and this has been the worst-performing style
category of the last several decades. In Table 1, the three-year average market-adjusted return on
IPOs is –23.4%, whereas the average style-adjusted return is –5.1%.13 In other words, seasoned
firms matched by market capitalization and book-to-market underperform the broader market by
almost as much as IPOs do.
        An alternative statistical approach that avoids the overlap problem with buy-and-hold
returns is to measure returns in calendar time rather than event time. In Table 5, we report time-
series regression results using the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor model. The intercepts reported
in Table 5 are measures of abnormal performance. An intercept of –0.32 is minus 32 basis
points per month, or about –4 percent per year. Row 1 reports the results of a simple one-factor
regression, with the market excess return as the explanatory variable. Row 2 reports the results
of a regression that includes a lagged market return. The lagged beta is significantly positive,
and the summed beta is 1.73, indicating that IPOs have a high level of systematic risk. This
accords with the common sense notion that IPOs tend to be risky stocks. The row 2 intercept is

   A careful reader may wonder about the accuracy of the style-adjusted 3 -year buy-and-hold return of –74.2 percent
for the IPOs going public in calendar year 1999 that we report in Table 1. Since the average buy-and-hold return on
IPOs is –46.2 percent, this implies an average matching firm return of +28.0 percent, even though growth stocks did
very poorly in 2000 and 2001. Part of the high benchmark return is due to chance: one IPO was matched with a
seasoned firm that had a 2,200 percent return in the four months after the date of the IPO, at which point the
matching firm conducted a follow-on stock offering and was replaced on a point-forward basis by another matching
firm. This second firm then had a return of over 100 percent before being delisted, at which point it was replaced on
a point-forward basis by another firm that had a 36 percent return until the end of September 2001, when our returns
data ended. The compounded return for these three matching firms was 6,300 percent, which boosts the average
benchmark return for the 457 firms in the 1999 cohort by 14 percent. A few other matching firms in this cohort also
had relatively high returns. The 6,300 percent outlier affects the average style-adjusted return for the 6,249 IPOs
from 1980-2001 by only 1.0 percent. Note that for IPOs from October 1998 and later, the 3-year buy-and-hold
return is actually less than three years, since our returns end on September 2001. Our returns end in September 2001
because this was the most recent available version of returns data from CRSP as of January 2002.

–47 basis points per month, suggesting that the row 1 intercept is underestimated due to the
underestimation of systematic risk when the lagged effect is ignored.

           Multi-factor Regressions with an Equally Weighted Portfolio of U.S. IPOs
All regressions use 345 observations when the sample period is from January 1973 to September 2001.
The dependent variable is the equally weighted monthly percentage return on a portfolio of IPOs that
have gone public during the prior 36 months. A coefficient of –0.32 represents underperformance of 32
basis points per month, or –4 percent per year. rpt - rft is the excess return over the risk-free rate on a
portfolio in time period t, rmt - rft is the realization of the market risk premium in period t, SMBt is the
return on a portfolio of Small stocks Minus the return on a portfolio of Big stocks in period t, and VMGt
is the return on a portfolio of Value stocks Minus the return on a portfolio of Growth stocks in period t.
Value and growth are measured using book to market ratios, and VMG is denoted HML in the literature
(High book-to-market (value) Minus Low book-to-market (growth) stocks). The factor returns are
supplied by Kenneth French, using “research factors” with annual rebalancing, as distinct from
“benchmark factors” with quarterly rebalancing. T-statistics are in parentheses.

       Row 3 of Table 5 reports regression results with the three traditional Fama-French (1993)
regressors, and row 4 adds the lagged Fama-French factors. The intercepts in rows 3 and 4
return to a value of about –2.5 percent per year. As Brav and Gompers (1997) note, Fama-
French 3-factor regressions tend to have negative intercepts for portfolios of small growth firms,
whether or not the portfolio is composed of IPOs. Brav and Gompers show that a large fraction
of IPOs fall in the extreme small growth firm category, so this is an important concern. In our
Table 5, we have excluded most of the smallest firms by screening out IPOs with an offer price
below $5.00 per share. There is another bias in multi-factor regressions, as normally
implemented. Loughran and Ritter (2000) point out that the right-hand side variables, the Fama-
French factor returns, are themselves partly composed of the returns on IPOs. Because IPOs
tend to be small growth stocks, a small firm portfolio will have more IPOs than a large firm
portfolio, especially after periods of heavy issuing volume. Similarly, a portfolio of value stocks
will have fewer IPOs than a portfolio of growth stocks. Thus, SMB will have a low return and
VMG will have a high return following heavy IPO issuance if IPOs underperform. This “factor
contamination” biases the intercept towards zero. Table 6 of Loughran and Ritter (2000) reports
that the effect of this bias is 18 basis points per month during 1973-1996.
       Rows 5 through 8 split the sample into different time periods. The underperformance in
the 1990-1999 period is virtually identical to that in the 1973-1989 period, a statistically
insignificant –14 or –15 basis points per month. The estimates, however, are very sensitive to
the ending date. While the internet bubble was inflating in the late 1990s, post-IPO returns were
exceptionally good. If the sample is extended by just one year, from December 1999 to
December 2000, the row 6 intercept of –14 basis points for 1990-1999 changes in row 7 to –48
basis points for 1990-2000.
       Most remarkably, however, are the row 8 subperiod results from January 2000 to
September 2001. This time period shows how methodology and time period matter in a most
startling fashion. Table 1 showed that IPOs from 1999 and 2000 performed poorly by any
measure during the well-known collapse of the internet bubble. For IPOs from calendar year
2000, the average return from the closing price on its first day of trading until September 2001
was –64.7 percent. From January 2000 to September 2001, our dependent variable in Table 5,
the equally weighted portfolio of IPOs from the prior 36 months, had an average monthly return




                                             31
of –355 basis points. Yet, row 8 of Table 5 shows a positive intercept of 62 basis points per
month! The reason is that the regression attributes the collapse to the negative market returns
and concurrent collapse of technology stocks, which is reflected in positive realizations on
VMG.
        This evidence suggests two areas of caution: First, one must be careful comparing papers
which attribute a weakening or disappearance of the IPO effect to novel measurement
techniques; instead, the sample period may be responsible for some of the conclusions. Second,
unless one is comfortable concluding that IPOs with –64.7 percent returns offered investors
positive risk-adjusted returns, one should be wary of considering the Fama-French factors to be
equilibrium risk factors and using them as controls. When using either a multifactor model or
matching firms to examine abnormal performance, these tests should be regarded as testing
“similarity to certain public firms,” rather than as tests of IPO mispricing.
        Furthermore, long-run returns, even if remarkably low, are sufficiently noisy to make any
statistical inference difficult. For example, in Brav (2000), it can require an abnormal return of
–40 percent (depending upon specification) to reject the hypothesis that long-run buy-and-hold
returns are not underperforming. After controlling for the poor performance of size and book-to-
market matched non-IPO firms, “similarity” between IPO and non-IPO firms can no longer be
rejected for some sample periods. Eckbo and Norli (2001) use size and liquidity matching, and
find that similar publicly traded firms also performed poorly. 14
        Because the asset-pricing literature itself has failed to provide an accepted model of risk-
adjusted performance against which one can measure post-IPO performance, it still remains
unclear how abnormally poor post-IPO performance is. Relative to other firms with similar size
and book-to-market characteristics, IPOs have had very modest underperformance, whether one
uses buy-and-hold returns or Fama-French regressions. Nevertheless, it is clear that IPOs and
firms with characteristics similar to IPOs had rather unappealing performance at a time when the
overall stock market performed exceptionally well. It is not in dispute that equally weighted
post-IPO returns have been low relative to broad market indices during recent decades.



14
  Barber and Lyon (1996), Barber and Lyon (1997) and Lyon, Barber and Tsai (1999) consider various statistics
used in the literature, and propose some good intuitive measures of long-run performance. Teoh, Welch, and Wong
(1998) suggest a Fama-MacBeth type procedure. Loughran and Ritter (2000) and Schultz (2001) discuss the
influence of weighting schemes.



                                                 32
B. Sources of Long-run Underperformance
       We know of only two semi-rational explanations for the long-run underperformance of
IPOs. Miller (1977) assumes that there are constraints on shorting IPOs, and that investors have
heterogeneous expectations regarding the valuation of a firm. The most optimistic investors buy
the IPO. Over time, as the variance of opinions decreases, the marginal investor’s valuation will
converge towards the mean valuation, and its price will fall. This argument works better when
the float is small and not too many investors are required. This is consistent with the drop in
share price at the end of the lockup period (when more public shares become available to the
public), as documented by Bradley, Jordan, Roten, and Yi (2001), Field and Hanka (2001), and
Brav and Gompers (2002). Bradley et al show that the negative effect is much more pronounced
for venture capital-backed IPOs. Typically with these IPOs, the VCs distribute shares to their
limited partners on the lockup expiration date, and many limited partners immediate sell. This
shows up not only in negative returns, but exceptionally high volume.
       Schultz (2001) offers a second explanation: he argues that more IPOs follow successful
IPOs. Thus, the last large group of IPOs would underperform and be a relatively large fraction
of the sample. If underperformance is being measured weighting each IPO equally, the high-
volume periods carry a larger weight, resulting in underperformance, on average. Although this
is a logical argument, it cannot predict underperformance when each time period is weighted
equally, as is done in Table 5 or the time-series regressions of Loughran, Ritter, and Rydqvist
(1994) and Baker and Wurgler (2000).
       Other papers are less ambitious, and simply attempt to find variables that result in cross-
sectional predictability. Jain and Kini (1994) and Mikkelson, Partch, and Shah (1997) document
that long-run return performance is also accompanied by poor financial accounting performance
post-IPO relative to pre-IPO performance and/or industry conditions. So, what drives this long-
run underperformance and can it be predicted?
       Heaton (2001) argues that managers tend to be overoptimistic, and thus prone to
overinvestment if the funds are available. Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998) attribute some of the
poor post-IPO stock performance to “optimistic” accounting early in the life of the firm. It is not
surprising that firms are eager to look good when they conduct their IPO, and that the market has
difficulties in disentangling carefully hidden warning signals. This suggests that at least a part of




                                              33
the poor long-run performance is due to a market that is unduly optimistic and unable to properly
forecast tougher times ahead. Similarly, Purnanandam and Swaminathan (2001) find that IPOs
that are priced high relative to public market comparables tend to perform worse in the long run,
even though they show higher first-day returns. Both papers point towards overconfidence,
perhaps by both entrepreneurs (Bernardo and Welch (2001)) and investors (Daniel, Hirshleifer,
and Subramanyam (1998)).
          There have been some other less successful attempts to correlate long-run performance to
pre-IPO characteristics. For example, there is no reliable relationship between short-run
underpricing and long-run performance, although this evidence is sensitive to whether penny-
stock IPOs are included or not. These IPOs, which were common before the 1990s, frequently
had high first-day returns and exceptionally low long-run returns. Many of these issues involved
stock price manipulation. For samples excluding penny stock IPOs, whether there is a reversal
of the highest first-day returns in the long run depends mostly on whether the internet bubble
period is included in the sample. Almost all of the IPOs from 1999-2000 with large first-day
returns have subsequently collapsed. Since most of these were internet related, the number of
independent observations is limited.
          The recent bubble has made it amply clear that even if there is systematic long-run
underperformance, it is difficult or impossible to exploit it in a reliable manner. Many short
sellers lost a great deal of money on internet bubble IPOs, and had to close out their shorts before
they would have paid off. Still, we hope to see further work to tell us which subsamples are
particularly prone to poor post-IPO performance, both in the United States and in other countries.


IV.       Conclusions
          This paper has focused on three areas of current research on IPOs: reasons for going
public, the pricing and allocation of shares, and long-run performance.
          There are myriad theoretical reasons for firms wanting to go public, but only sparse
evidence due to a general lack of data on the pool of private firms. Still, the evidence of large
variation in the number of IPOs suggests that market conditions are the most important factor in
the decision to go public. The stage of the firm in its life cycle seems to be the second important
factor.




                                               34
       The underpricing of IPOs has been a topic of theoretical investigations for decades.
Recently, this topic has enjoyed a resurgence of activity, motivated by the astonishingly high
first-day returns on IPOs during the internet bubble. We argue that theories based on asymmetric
information are unlikely to explain average first-day returns of 65 percent. Underwriters did not
bundle multiple offerings together, which would have lowered the average uncertainty and the
need for underpricing in the context of information models. Thus, we believe that future
explanations will need to concentrate on agency conflicts and share allocation issues on one hand
and behavioral explanations on the other hand. The challenge for such theories will be to explain
the dramatic variations in underpricing over the last few decades.
       The allocation of shares by underwriters is perhaps the most active area of current IPO
research. Share allocation has an impact on many topics, including theories of underpricing,
post-issue ownership structure, and underwriter compensation. To date, empirical research has
been limited due to the lack of micro-level data on share allocations in the U.S. As this data
becomes available, we expect that it will be able to shed light on many questions. Micro-level
trading data has already resulted in light being shed on some of these important issues.
       Long-run performance may be the most controversial area of IPO research, with some
researchers lining up behind an efficient markets point of view and others lining up behind a
behavioral point of view. Although we tend to favor the behavioral point of view, our main
perspective is that caution is advisable. First, the results are sensitive not only to methodology,
but also to the exact time-period chosen. Depending on whether and how one includes 1999,
2000, and 2001, one can come to rather different conclusions. Second, Fama-French multifactor
regressions can produce very odd results. They indicate that the period during which the internet
bubble collapsed were great years for recent IPOs, even though an equally weighted portfolio of
recent IPOs lost on average 355 basis points per month.
