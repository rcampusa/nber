     One major finding of this paper is that prices    in most basic materials
producing industries are responsive to demand while    prices in most finished
goods producing industries are not. If the reverse     were true, stabilization
policies would. have more effect in the short run on   prices and less effect
on output than is currently the case.

     A second finding relates to the 1971—4 period of wage and price controls
and the period immediately following their termination. During controls, prices
in most manufacturing sectors did rise somewhat slower than their historical
relationship to costs would suggest. But after controls ended prices rose
relative to costs by considerably more than the amount of their shortfall during
controls. This suggests that some fundamental change in price—cost relationships
may have taken place in 1974.

        In 1970 at a conference on.   the   econometrics of price determination

William Nordhaus [1972a] in his review of recent price behavior analysis concluded,

"Most    of the specifications and interpretations have proceeded without the benefit
of formal. theory." Three years later David Laidler and Michael Parkin [1975] in
surveying       inflation cotntnented that the finding of Nordhaus (and Godley) [1972b]

about price behavior in the United Kingdom was based on an incorrect specification:

"It is at odds both with the usual theory of price setting and with         earlier empirical
work .    . .

     These      comments are not intended to goad these researchers into further
criticisms      of each other's work;all three papers are especially valuable contrib-

utions to the literature on price behavior. Instead they are cited to point up the

difficulty of formulating theoretically sound specifications that can be tested

empirically, particularly when the analysis is directed at sectoraLl. price changes

rather    than the aggregate price level.
     The research reported in this paper is a further attempt to wed theory and
practice, particularly with respect to         the existence and effect on price behavior

of snort—run disequilibria between production and demand. In this paper

attention is given to the roles of the level and change in capacity utilization

and to a previously untested excess demand variable ——        the   ratio of new orders to

output. But before the reader focuses too intently on the success of this endeavor,

it should be pointed out that the research has a second objective. It is to examine

price    behavior in the manufacturing sector for a disaggregadon of sixteen industries

classified by where they are located in the stages—of—process by which raw materials

are transformed into finished goods. The empirical results of this analysis are

price equations which are imbedded in an integrated model of final and intermediate

demand by stage of process. (For a description of this model see Popkin [1977].)
                                      2


        Typically, price behavior analysis for the manufacturing sector is

directed at the twenty 2—digit industries that comprise it. But such analysis

requires treatment of such industries as pulp, paper and allied products and

chemicals and allied products, both of which consist of industries that convert

raw materials to basic industrial materials which are then transformed into

semi—manufactures and finished goods in those 2—digit industries and in others.

On the demand side the sources of derived demand for the basic materials are

lost and the pattern of lagged adjustment processes clouded. On the supply

side possible differences in substitution possibilities, say for iron ore in

steel plants vis—a—vis those for steel—based versus aluminum—based car parts,

are not reflected. Such problems can be alleviated if manufacturing industries

are viewed by stage—of—process rather than the aggregative SIC categories to

which they have been assigned.

        The sixteen stage—of—process industries on which this research focuses

fall into three groups. The first consists of six industries that produce

largely finished goods. They are automotive, consumer home goods (primarily

nonauto durables), food, beverage and tobacco manufactures, other consumer

staples (nonedible nondurables excluding fuels), machinery and equipment

other than ordnance and transportation equipment, and an industry composed of

shipbuilding, ordnance, aircraft and railroad equipment. The second group

consists of one industry that produces intermediate, or semi—manufactures.

Finally, there are nine primary industries defined wherever possible as the

first processors of raw materials. They are textiles, lumber, paper, chemicals

fertilizers, stone, clay and glass, steel, nonferrous metals and petroleum

refining.

The behavioral hypothesis
            The strategy used to analyze price behavior in these sixteen industries

consisted of testing the hypothesis that each consists of competitive firms

but that prices may be in disequilibrium. It was assumed that the firms

produce     output       subject to a Cobb—Douglas production function with constant

returns     to   scale (see Nadiri [19771 and Popkin (1978] for use of similar, assumptions):


 (1)             =   AK    La2   Na3 e1         wiere eq +      a2 ÷ a3     1

 and X is output,
     K, capital,
     L, labor,
     N, materials and
       t,
        a term representing Hick's—neutral technological change.



Maximizing short—run profits with respect to this production function yields the

following price equation which can be viewed as describing short—run

equilibrium by holding capital constant:

 (2)           i\—1  /             (ct2/1—al)       (a3/1—ct)         (al/i—ui)
        PeC(l__)    W                           m               X/K               e
                            b,

where e is the     equilibrium price,
        b, the price elasticity of demand,
        w, the wage rate and
        in, the price of materials.




In the short run, the cost of capital does not enter the price equation

because capital stock is assumed fixed, only its utilization may vary.

A bridge between short run pricing behavior and the long—run pricing rule can

be established by relying on the first—order profit maximizing conditions

with respect to capital input:

                           I      i'\x
(3)
             ;;_ale_).
where   r is the rental price of capital.
                                                      4


    Substituting (3) into (2) for r yields Nordhaus' [1972a) derivation of the long—rut
    competitive pricing rule:

    (4)
                       i\ rU1 w2 t3m —ht
              re_C1/ 1——             e

    In words, in the short run, equilibrium price depends positively on wage rates

    and materials prices, each weighted by their proportion to the sum of both,

    and on movements in output vis—a--vis capital stock which may be assumed fixed.

    In the long run price depends on, aside from wage rates and materials prices,

    the rate at which capita]. grows relative to output. Their relative growth

    mirrors what is happening to the cost of capital under the assumption of a

    Cobb—Douglas     production function with constant returns to scale.
               Equation (2) depicts the movement of both short run and long            run

    equilibrium     prices. The      change in equilibrium price may be expressed by

    transforming (2) into:

                          (                (n                    f_\           / U••

                                                                           1
                                                                                1-cu

    But prices may      not   always be in equilibrium so that actual price change may
    differ   from equilibrium price change. Actual price change is given by:



    (6)
              Pt              __

              Pt—i            Pt_i
•   That is prices in any time period are assumed to change by some changing

    fraction (     X)   of the change in equilibrium price. As long as prices are

    in dynamic     equilibrium,        will equal unity. But, for a number of well—known

 reasons,       prices need not always be in equilibrium. Therefore                         is   a measure
 of disequilibrium:

 NO is new orders.                          \X J—
 The rationale for (7) is that the demand curve is a schedule of the demand for
 orders at various prices, the supply curve, a schedule of output. If price is
 not    in equilibrium new orders differ from output, implying that unfilled
                                                                                1/

finished       goods inventories change in opposite directions in adjusting to a gap

of a given algebraic sign.                  It   can be demonstrated that the parameter             is

equal     to   the reciprocal of the sum               of   the absolute valu of the elasticities
                                                   6



of supply and demand. If these elasticities are not constant, then the ratio

      for any given value of NOIX may vary. For example, if supply becomes more

inelastic at higher output levels, the same gap at higher output levels will

imply a larger gap between equilibrium and actual price. This nonlinearity

may be represented by specifying the output—capital ratio as an exponent of

the ratio of new orders to output. Hence, the degree of price disequilibrium

is represented by (7).

        Substituting (5) and (7) into (6), combining labor and materials prices

into one variable, and expressing the relationships in logs yields:

          This equation       is estimated by ordinary least squares for each of two

 sample periods 1960:1—1971:11 and 1960:I—1975:IV, the former period ending with

 the institution of price and wage controls. For the longer sample period a

 dummy variable for post—controls effects is specified alternatively in some sectorS.

         Equation 8 makes explicit the role of the level and change in excess

 demand, as reflected in the output—capital ratio which is a measure of capacity

 utilization. The level is appropriate only when there is short—run disequilib-

 rium and then only if supply and demand elasticities are not constant. The

 constant term,       ,   includes     the technical progress term from (5) which has an
                  0

expected negative algebraic sign. Other factors might obscure this, however,
                                         7



including changes in monopoly power. If the data fit the Cobb—Douglas constant

returns to scale assumptions, 8i should equal unity and 2 should equal the

capital share divided by the noncapital share      a1

          Laden has shown [1972) that in industries using average—cost pricing

since   the results depend importantly on the appropriateness of the underlying

assumptions, it would be         prudent to interpret the algebraic signs of the

estimates of 82 and 83 merely as indicators of whether margins behave

procyclicly, anticyclicly or are cyclicly neutral.

The data and estimation

          The data are taken from five primary sources: Censuses and Annual

Surveys of Manufactures (Census Bureau), monthly series on manufacturers'

inventories, shipments, new and unfilled orders (Census Bureau), component

series of the monthly wholesale price index (Bureau of Labor Statistics),

monthly series on employment, hours and earnings (Bureau of Labor Statistics)

and components of the monthly industrial production index (Federal Reserve

Board). Capital stock estimates were prepared using perpetual inventory

techniques by extrapolating LS benchmarks by census annual investment data

interpolated quarterly by data from BEA. Data at the three and four digit SIC

level (six and eight digit wholesale price index categories) are combined to
                                         8


form aggregates for each of the sixteen manufacturing sectors. The four—digit
composition of each of the sectors is available on request. All variables are

measured quarterly. For flow variables, the monthly series are seasonally

adjusted and quarterly averages formed. The various series have been

constructed for 1958—1975 and most are available monthly.

          A more detailed description of sources of data and methods of

construction of particular series is avaL1able from the author on request.

           Lag Structure.—— The lag structure for the materials and labor

input price variable had been determined by fitting Almon lags using a second

degree   polynomial and a lag distribution running from   t to   t—7. The
results   were   used to construct single variables incorporating the relevant
information   obtained by using the Almon technique. Insignificant or negative

lag coefficients were eliminated; those terms remaining were combined

using approximate values of the Almon weights. Separate weights were so

derived for each sample period. Upon analysis, it appeared that where

they differed it was due to the fact that materials prices affect output prices

with a lag structure different from that of labor prices. Accordingly, separate

iags were estimated for materials and labor prices, again based on Almon tcclriiques,

with the result that the same lag structure seemed applicable to both time periods.

          The same general strategy was used to develop distributed lag weights

for the other two variables, the change in the log of the output—capital ratio

and the output—capital ratio times the log of the orders—output ratio.      (The

latter measure of disequilibrium is assumed to operate only with a lag.) For

these two variables first degree polynomials were fitted running from t to

t—3 and t—l to t—4 respectively. The technique described above was used to

select the distributed lag weight for these variables as well, except that
                                           9


significant negative weights for the disequilibrium variable were accepted

because      there could be "overshooting." It   turned out to be necessary to use

different     lag   structures for each sample period for these two variables. The

lags   and   their weights are given in Appendix A.

Re suits

           The   results are found in Table 1.   For the shorter time period more

than   half of the price variation is explained in only eight of the sixteen
industries. Results are particularly poor for lumber, chemicals, fertilizers, nonfer-
rous   metals and petroleum. In virtually every industry, the amount of explained price

variation increases when the sample is extended through 1975. But in a number

of cases the improvement is associated with the emergence of significant serial

correlation, a sharp rise in the standard error and some unacceptably large

shifts in the estimates of some parameters. In those cases a dummy variable

was incorporated to test for post—control bulges in 1973 and 1974. (In some

sectors decontrol began in the second half of 1973, preceeding the general

decontrol that took place in April 1974.) The result is more rational para-

meter estimates and the virutal elimination of significant serial correlation;

this suggests that the serial correlation present before the inclusion of the

dummy variable was due to a missing variable during the 1972—1975 period, and

that variable seems to be one reflecting post—controls developments.

             The analysis of the results can best be accomplished by looking at the

       exceeds 60 percent; in ejeven sectors it is greater than 80 percent. The

most of the parameter estimates are significant and relatively stable when

viewed over both sample periods.

      With respect to parameter estimates, the coefficient of the labor and

materials price variable is significant in fifteen of the sixteen sectoral

equations based on the longer sample period (all but five for the shorter period).

In seven of the fifteen sectors the coefficient is not significantly different

from one. The sectors in which such coefficients exceed unity are largely primary

industries while those less than unity are finished goods industries.

      The output—capital ratio is significant in eight of the sixteeen industries.

But the coefficient has a negative sign in sectors other than primary manufacturing.

      The disequilibrium variable is significant in eleven industry sectors. In

two of these —— consumer home goods and staples ——     the coefficient has a negative
sign. Further tests in which XIK was deleted from the disequilibrium variable

produced results that precluded rejecting the hypothesis that supply and demand

elasticities are not constant. In general inclusion of X/K resulted in a slight

improvement in the fit of the equations.

      The hypothesis put forward that price behavior reflects competitive behavior

among firms in an industry in which the production function is Cobb-Douglas with

constant returns to scale cannot be rejected in two sectors ——     textiles   and lumber.

But the existence of perfect competition may   be   obscured in some of the other

industries because the production function assumption is too restrictive. The

results show that in eight other industries the behavior of margins, as reflected

by the output—capital ratio and the disequilibrium variable, is procyclical, a

pattern not inconsistent with competitive behavior. Procyclical margin behavior

requires that one or both of the two margin—related variables must be significant,

and when so, the sign must be positive. The eight industries are consumer food,

machinery and equipment, paper, chemicals, fertilizers, nonferrous metals, refined

petroleum products and semi—manufactures, only two of which are finished goods

indus tries -
                                           11


      In three industries the sign of neither margin—related variable is significant,

suggesting constant mark—up or cyclically neutral margin behavior; the three are

autos, steel and stone, clay and glass.

      Anti—cyclical margin behavior is indicated in two sectors —— consumer home

goods and staples —— where both variables are negative and significant. However,

the effect of import competition in these sectors should be examined before accept-

ing the competitive implications of the results presented here.

      Margin behavior in the ordnance, et al industry cannot be determined because

the two variables have coefficients of opposite sign.

      The general picture that emerges from this analysis is that price behavior

in primary industries is consistent with the competitive model while that in

finished goods industries is not. It is interesting however that post—controls

dummies are significant in many of both kinds of industries, not just competitive

industries where controls may have suppressed the response of prices to rising

demand.

      Post—controls dunimyvariables are significant in eleven of the sixteen sectors.

Two   of   the sectors in which they are not significant are those with cyclically

neutral or anticyclical margin behavior ——      autos and consumer home goods. Such
variables are also not significant in three industries that fit the competitive

pattern ——     textiles,   lumber and petroleum. In the first two, demand began to

decline in early 1973 when new housing and apparel expenditures weakened at the

final demand level: and petroleum prices have never been fully decontrolled.


        That such dummies are not significant in textiles and lumber —— the two
industries which appear to fit best the competitive hypothesis tested here —— is
understandable in the fact that demand for the output of these sectors began to
decline early in 1973 when new housing and apparel expenditures weakened at the
final demand level.

      The extent of the post—controls price rise ——   the coefficient of the dummy

variable times the number of quarters its value was one —— is shown in the first

column of table 2 for each sector in which the effect is significant. In most

of these sectors price behavior is consistent with the competitive hypothesis,

but there are several exceptions ——   steel,   stone, clay and glass, consumer staples

and (possibly) ordnance et al. That most of the sectors in which the dummy

variable is significant are those that fit the competitive hypothesis is to be

expected   since the controls program tended to impose cost pass—through behavior
in most sectors.
      The second column of table 2 contains the sum of the residuals during
controls. In all but two instances they are. negative, suggesting controls held
prices down. But the price rise explained by the post controls dummy exceeds
substantially the measure in column 2 of the downward impact of controls
during the period in which   they were in place.

       These  results with respect to the effect of controls fall somewhere in between
the   polar findings of R.J. Gordon 119751 that the post—controls bulge in margins
over materials and labor   costs about offset their contraction during controls and

£he   finding of Al—Samarrie, Kraft and Roberts t1977] that controls had little
effect in manufacturing. The    conclusion   here is that while controls had some
effect in holding down margins in many manufacturing sectors, their termination
does not explain even half of the post—controls bulge.
       The general picture of price behavior duing 1960—75   that   emerges from this
analysis is that price behavior in primary industries is consistent with the
competitive hypothesis while that in finished goods industries is not. Regardless
of the reason for the finding, it suggests a reason for what is regarded as in-
sensitivity or considerable delay in the response of prices to a change in aggregate
demand policies, particularly a restrictive change. According to this analysis,

the initial response to a restrictive change on the part of most finished goods

manufacturers is a reduction in output, not in the ratio of output to input prices.

This reduction in the volume is greater than would be the case if the output—input

price ratio behaved procyclicly. As a result there are larger cutbacks in orders

placed by finished goods producers for materials and supplies than would occur

otherwise. when these cutbacks in orders impact on those semifinished and primary

manufacturing industries in which the output—input price ratio does behave pro—

cyclicly, prices in these industries weaken. Such weakness then feeds forward to

final demand prices, but of course with a lag, affecting prices in all finished

manufacturing and distribution sectors, whether or not the output—input price ratio

in those industries behaves procyclicly. It would appear that if the findings

reported here were reversed ——   that   procyclical margin behavior were more char-

acteristic of finished goods producers than of primary producers, aggregative demand

policies would be more efficient.
