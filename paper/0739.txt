     This paper proceeds   as follows. We first   identify the essential

services provided by a financial system and then derive the characteristics
of the system that would exist in a technologically advanced society
unfettered by nonneutral taxes and regulations. Next we consider how taxes
and. regulations have shaped the existing American financial structure.
Finally, we posit likely tax and regulatory changes and conjecture as to
how technological innovation will further interact with these changes to
alter the American financial system. Our basic contentions are that
the tax and regulatory influences are eroding and that the system will
eventually move toward the unfettered financial system described in the
first section.

           HOUSING FINANCE IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE YEAR 2001



      As the title suggests, this paper is an exercise in futureology.

 Such exercises are not uncommon. What distinguishes this attempt from the

 usual is the time frame; we view the system at the beginning of the next

century rather than over the coming decade. This makes our task less

difficult in one sense and more difficult in another: less difficult

because the memory of 20 year forecasts is vague; more difficult because

one needs to go beyond simple extrapolations of ongoing trends and to identify

the underlying forces of change.

     Had the time frame been shorter, e.g., a decade, a more traditional

approach would suffice. This could entail:

     1. a determination of "housing needs" through the next decade,
         based on extrapolations of household formation and demo-
         graphic trends,

     2. a calculation of the demand for "housing credit" these needs
         generate,

     3. an estimate of the supply of housing credit from "traditional"
         sources, and

     4. an assessment of the secondary market and federal policy
         response to the projected "gap" between the demand for and
         supply of housing credit.

     This sort of analysis, although somewhat useful for short time periods,

is not very enlightening of the more distant future. The financial system

is currently undergoing revolutionary changes. Lines of demarcation between

banks, thrifts, other financial intermediaries, and industry are rapidly

eroding.   Existing firms are expanding beyond traditional functions, and
new firms are performing nontraditional functions as innovation renders
                                      2


regulatory   boundaries obsolete. New financial institutions and instruments
are developing in response to fundamental economic, regulatory and institutional
forces. Identification of these forces and of the logical end to which they
will   lead is necessary to understand both current developments and the likely

evolution of the housing finance system into the 21st Century.

       This paper proceeds as follows. First, we identify the essential

services provided by a financial system and then derive the characteristics

of the system that would exist in a technologically advanced society unfettered

by nonneutral taxes and regulations. Next we consider how taxes arid regulations

have shaped the existing American financial structure. Finally, we posit

likely tax and regulatory changes and conjecture as to how technological

innovation will further interact with these changes to alter the American

financial system. Our basic contentions are that the tax and regulatory

influences are eroding and that the system will eventually move toward the

unfettered financial system described in the first section.


I. The Essential Elements of Finance

       The first step in understanding the financial structure   and in distinguishing
between regulatory and economic induced    innovation is to identify those

elements of finance that are essential to household portfolio optimization.1

From this, the characteristics of a minimal financial sector (utilizing

current technology) follow in a straight—forward manner.



1/
     See Silber (1975) for an enlightening discussion of financial systems and
     innovations.
                                        3


     A. Essential Financial Services

    We identify four essential financial services that would be provided in

some form in any well-developed financial system: 1) a medium of exchange,

2) security underwriting, 3) security brokerage and 4) denomination intermedia-

tion. Each of these is discussed briefly in the remainder of this section.

           1. Medium of Exchange. The first and most important financial

     service is the provision of a "medium of exchange." Brunner and Meltzer

     (1971) have shown that the costs of exchanging goods in an uncertain

    world can be reduced if one good serves as a medium of exchange.

    This medium, generally labeled money, must exhibit two characteristics.

    First, it should be generally acceptable. To accomplish this, it

    must   convey information regarding its ability to be converted to real
    goods. Second, it     should   be "portable." The more   portable it is,

    the   greater are the efficiency gains it generates. As will be discussed

    later, technology is the limiting factor in conveying information and

    transporting money.

           2. Security Underwriting. The second most important financial

    service is the provision of a financial claim that allows the transfer

    of inccme from surplus to deficit units [see Gurley and Shaw (1956)].

    This transfer reallocates real resources from less useful or less

    productive activities to more productive activities. The key

    characteristic of this transfer is the information embodied in the

    financial claim regarding the probability the deficit unit will repay

    the surplus unit. The primary function of security underwriting is

    to identify the parameters affecting expost nominal returns and to

    provide   information to surplus units to allow theu to form reasonable
                                  4

subjective probability distributions regarding the future value of
these parameters and thus the probability that the terms of the contract
will be met. Because a given value of a parameter may increase the
expost nominal return on some instruerits and decrease the return on
others,    diversification reduces the variability of portfolio returns.

     3. Security Brokerage. The need for brokerage stens from the desire

by households either to reallocate their' portfolios or to change their net

worth. The reallocation—induced deand for brokerage services arises

primarily   from diffring expectations of future outcomes affecting portfolio
returns.    Secondarily, households reducing net worth (deficit units) need a

mechanism to transfer assets to households increasing net worth (surplus

units). Again, the essential characteristic of brokerage is the transfer

of infonnation between surplus and deficit households to facilitate the

exchange.

     4. Denomination Intermediation. Deficit units issue financial

instruments that presumably reflect their needs and available collateral.

There are two fundamental characteristics of these instruments.

These are those parameters that affect expost nominal and real returns.

A major benefit of finance is its contribution to superior allocation

of risk bearing in the economy [Arrow (1964)]; this derives from the

ability   of economic units to diversify risks associated with multiple
securities. The optimal portfolio for a household may include the
obligations   of many issuers, but in smaller amounts than are efficient

for the issuer to supply. The major role of financial intermediaries

is to provide these smaller denominations.
                                        5

     Denomination intermediation also allows diversification of inflation

risk through maturity intermediation. In a tax-neutral world, the real

value of capital should be unaffected by inflation, anticipated or unanticipated.

Thus, to the extent that financial contracts finance real assets, inflation

does not affect real wealth. Human capital may be considered a real asset,

but households cannot issue equity shares. Insofar as households issue debt

contracts, which provide a claim on future nominal income, to increase current

consumption above current income, the real value of those contracts will fall

in response to an increase in inflation. To the extent that the inflation

is unanticipated —-   not   built into the contract interest rate --   the   real

wealth of deficit units increases at the expense of surplus units. Theoreti-

cally, individual households can hedge their debt portfolios against uncertain

inflation   rates by either selling financial assets short or writing options
contracts. But as long as some households issue claLns on future nominal
income, unanticipated inflation will have distributional consequences.
     In summary, there are few essential financial services. Deficit units

would issue instruments reflecting the collateral —-    either   the market

value of the asset or, in the case of unsecured debt, the income stream the

unit produces. Some form of banks would be created to provide a medium of

exchange, and some form of underwriters would develop to convey appropriate

information regarding the return parameters of the instruments. Brokers would

arise to facilitate the transfer of assets, and denomination intermediaries

would be created to facilitate diversification of nominal and real risk.


     B. Characteristics of an Unfettered Financial System

     Before returning to the existing financial structure, it may be useful

to speculate on the characteristics of a financial structure utilizing
                                        6


existing technology but unfettered by taxes, regulation or fixed institutional

capital (hereafter institutional memory). In a subsequent section, we will

contrast   this system with the existing    structure and identify the consequences

of   taxes, regulations and institutional memory.
      Consider a simple world in which the private capital stock consists of

residential and industrial capital. Producers of housing services and other

goods and services would issue both ownership shares in individual units

(or collections of units) of capital and debt instruments collateralized by

individual units or collections of these units. We denote the demand for

shares of the jth unit of capital by

                  Cj
                       =
                           f(P,d,7r),
where P, the anticipated productivity of the jth unit (or collection of

units) of capital, d, the anticipated depreciation rate, and 2T j, the

anticipated rate of price increase, are subjective probability distributions.

We note that productivity is defined as the rents accruing to capital.

      An interesting question is, are there any reasons why households would

want to corner the :narket on an individual housing unit? That is, would full

homeownership exist in a well-developed financial system without tax pre-

ferences? Households desire manage'ent control to allow them to make all

decisions regarding the use of this capital, just as some shareholders of

industrial capital desire to maintain a majority interest, but, given the current

management prerogatives of shareholders, this explains a 51 percent ownership

share, not a 100 percent     share. In fact, homeownership is most prevalent in
very prinative societies without financial systems. Rental markets exist in
                                      7

more developed societies and require a more developed financial system to

sell equity shares. Expost returns on equity shares in different houses

will vary for the same reason as they do on equity shares in different

industrial   plants and companies. That is, the actual returns will depend
on the expost value of the parameters. Portfolio optimization implies
diversification   among shares in residental as well as industrial capital.

      What does all this imply for security supplies? Thus far, our analysis

suggests the existence of supplies of equity shares financing residential

and   industrial capital and of debt collateralized by residential and industrial
capital. Intermediaries will offer these four instruments in smaller
denominations. Whether or not these are a sufficient number of instruments
for all   households to optimize their portfolios, i.e., to reduce the benefits

from further diversification to zero, depends on the characteristics of

the debt instruments. This leads to a more fundamental question. That

is, what information does the debt collateral convey?

      Two of the three parameters in the demand functions for shares, P,j and

d3, reflect the physical characteristics of the capital and are independent

of the third parameter, inflation. This information is most fully utilized if:

1) the instruments offer a fixed real interest rate, and 2) the principal is

repaid at the depreciation rate. The difference between debt and equity is

that the risks embodied in P3 and d3 are borne mostly by the equity holders.

A specific example may be useful here. Assume capital markets are efficient

and there exists a security (government?) of maturity k with a "certain"

real rate of interest r. In risk neutral markets, the "most likely" or

mean expected real return on a capital good with a life k and no physical
                                         8

depreciation is also r. Suppose further that the capital good is one-half

equity financed and one-half bond financed. The bondholders' expost yield

is    r   plus a small default prerniumS so long as the equity share has positive

value. The return on equity reflects the actual productivity and depreciation

rates of this particular piece of capital and the extent of bond leveraging.

In this case, if ex post earnings were twice those expected (r), then the

return to equity would be almost three times (3r-S) that expected.

          The bond instrument described above contracts for the "most likely"

real return on existing capital plus . .       How does this differ from a perfectly

diversified equity portfolio? The expected real return on the latter would

reflect the mean value of the subjective probability distributions of the

parameters Pj and d, i.e., the variance of these parameters for a perfectly

diversified equity portfolio is zero. But suppose that subjective probabili-

ties turn out to be wrong "across the board," resulting in a lower (or higtier)

expost return on capital generally. This will be reflected in the return

on the perfectly diversified equity portfolio hut not the bond return (unless

the return on capital were markedly lower). The same certain return could be

achieved with a diversified equity portfolio and options contracts.2

That is, debt instruments are not an essential instrument of finance! Thus

the primary consequence of bonds is on the distributional impact of the

actual      real earnings generated by existing capital.

2/
—
    For example, suppose the holder of a perfectly diversified equity portfolio
    is extremely averse to actual productivity of capital generally falling
    short of exante expected productivity. He can write a contract, the value
    of    which depends on the difference between actual and expected productivity.
     If f is the expected forward price and f the actual forward price, the
    difference will reflect the difference between expected and actual productivity.
    The options contract would simply give the writer the ability to "put" the
    equity shares into the portfolio of the holder of the option at .f.
                                         9

        We have thus far ignored instruments to finance consumption in excess

of income. These "unsecured" instruments are collateralized by the

productivity   or   earnings potential of human capital. Conceptually, at

least,   there would exist equity and debt instruments with characteristics
similar to those financing nonhuman capital
        If all households shared the sane    expectations and were risk—neutral,

then    no other nonmoney financial instruments would exist.3 If expectations
regarding inflation differed, then some households would Nrite o7tions to
other households reflecting these differences, and an options market could
develop.

II. The Current Housing Finance System
       Our previous discussion implied that 1)     residential capital would be
financed   with equity shares and    mortgage debt, 2) mortage   underwriters

would   originate real-denominated housing finance instruments, and 3)
financial institutions would develop as pooling arrangements to facilitate
diversification by lowering minimum denominations. The existing housing
finance system differs in important respects from this hypothetical model
Equity shares in    residential   capital are scarce; mortgage instruments pay
nominal returns; and "housing finance"       intermediaries have undiversified

portfolios. In this section we attenpt to explain the roles that taxes,

regulation, and institutional memory have played in the formation of the

current system.


3/
  It takes time to produce capital , and the production period is uncertain.
  Consequently, optional delivery markets would develop for real and financial
  instruments.
                                       10

        A. Tax Preferences and Regulations

        The most important consequences of current tax law stem from the failure

to tax imputed rent on owner—occupied housing and the preferential treatment

of capital gains for homeowners. This explains why almost two—thirds of

all    households own their own homes and the ownership rate is higher for
higher—income households.4 This, in turn, gives rise to mortgage instruments
collateralized by individual housing units and to many households having
real housing assets far in excess of their net worth. As a consequence,
the total stock of financial debt is draniaticilly increased, and most

household balance sheets are extree1y undiversified and leveraged. Because

of the latter, the return to household net worth varies far more than

proportionately    with the returns on individual houses for these homeowners.

        The ultimate constraint on arbitrage between owner-occupied housing

and financial markets is the diminishing marginal utility of housing

services. In equilibrium, wealthier households (and those lower income

households for whom honeownership does not pay) ultimately finance the

owner—occupied    housing of middle—income households. There is a general
loss to society in that benefits of diversification are foregone. In
addition, the portfolios of wealthier households will be tilted toward
more debt and less equity. There are thus distributional consequences to

other than the "most likely" outcomes of Pj, d and, particular1y,i7'.




4/
     See Hendershott and Shilling (1981) and Rosen and Rosen (1980) for analysis
     of the determination of tenure choice in the U.S.
                                      11

       The second major tax policy affecting the housing financial system is
the preferential tax treatment of income from mortgages held in     thrift

institution   portfolios. Currently savings and loans are allowed to put up

to   40 percent of their earnings into a "bad debt" reserve without paying
federal tax on the income so long as at least 82 percent of their assets
are invested in residential mortgages.5 Virtually all institutions have been
induced to meet this requirement. This, combined with regulatory prohibitions

(or threats of the same) against variable-rate loans, has resulted in an

industry with a substantially undiversified portfolio of fixed-rate mortgage

investments. From    the depositor's perspective this is counterproductive

to the essential financial service of thrifts, i.e.,   to issue   small denomination

shares of diversified portfolios paying market interest rates.

      These tax preferences have provided r3tionales for federal regulation.

One tax—policy, the tax preference on owner-occupied housing, results in

"excess" mortgage debt issues by middle—income households, justifying protective

consumer regulation, and a second tax preference results in this debt being

financed by, in part, even lower—income depositors who are less able to

diversify and thus are in need of protective deposit regulation. For

many years, virtually all consumer protections and safeguards focused on

the types of liabilities households were allowed to issue and basically

prohibited all but fixed nominal rate instruments. Lenders were subjected

to numerous regulations affecting who got credit and at what risk, e.g.,

  the portfolio behavior of thrifts and the relationship between mortgage
  and bond rates, see Hendershott and Villani (1980) (1981).

Truth    in Lending, CRA, HMDA and RESPA. Depositors, in contrast, were

prohibited from diversifying out of this long-term fixed rate mortgage

portfolio by limits imposed on the minimum denomination of alternative

investments. Although thrift deposits are essentially equivalent to mutual

fund pools in Treasury bills, the yields on Treasury bills were not iade

generally available to depositors who thus paid the price for the years of

protective mortgage regulation.6

        B. Debt Instruments and Returns

        In the previous section, we argued that debt instruments were not

essential elements of finance and that, if issued, would reflect the real

value of the underlying collateral. There are thus two issues regarding

the use of debt instruments in the current system. The first is why they

exist at all. The second is why they are denominated in nominal terms.

Of    course, these issues pertain to the entire financial system, not simply
housing finance. We have several observations but no definitive answer to
the questions.
        As already explained, households issue mortgage debt because their tax—

induced demand for owner-occupied housing generally exceeds net worth.

Selling shares in owner-occupied residential capital has not developed as

an alternative and would probably result in a loss of the tax preference.

This does not explain corporate bonds. Whereas owner-occupied residential

capital is tax favored, industrial capital is tax penalized. That is,



6/
—
     See Kane (1970) and Hendershott and Viliani (1978, Chapter 6) for discussions
     of the distributional impacts of ninimum purchase requirements in conjunction
     with deposit rate ceilings.
                                    13

returns to shareholders are taxed twice, at the corporate and individua1

levels. It is somewhat of an anomaly that double taxation of corporate

income leads to the same result with respect to corporate debt as no

taxation leads to regarding household debt. Because returns to bondholders

are taxed only once, the substitution of bond for equity financing reduces

the tax burden on industrial capital generally.

     The second reason for the existence of bonds is that it may be more

efficient for households to hold bond portfolios than the alternative of

fully diversified equity portfolios with options contracts. Diversification

is obtained at some costs. Because there are fixed costs of obtaining

information, diversification costs are not proportional to portfolio size.

     Reasons why debt pays nominal, rather than real, returns are more

numerous but less convincing. With respect to owner—occupied residential

capital, the most obvious reason is regulatory prohibition. In fact,

"equity kickers" have existed in commercial mortgage contracts for some

time. While regulation may have affected the design of mortgage instruments

offered by depository intermediaries, it does not explain why other firms

have failed to originate mortgages paying real returns. A'prlori, one

would expect mortgage bankers to originate whatever instruments households

desire to issue and investors are willing to purchase. There are two

constraints on mortgage bankers, however. First, the primary outlets for

the loans mortgage bankers originate -- GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC --   are   federal

or quasi federal. Their regulations In large measure determine the

characteristics of mortgage banker-originated loans. If, for example,

FNMA follows the recent example of FHLMC in refusing to purchase loans
                                       14

with negative amortization, a conventional graduated—payment loan is less
likely to develop. Second, there may be economies of scale to mortgage
originations that require sufficient volume of issues of any specific type
of    mortgage to make the process profitable.

        But this does not explain the absence of indexed corporate debt. One

reason may be innovation lag. Existing instruments were designed in a

noninflationary environment, and tax and accounting procedures developed

around these instruments. Other factors may be the difficulties in choosing

the appropriate index and/or appraising the value of residential and

industrial capital. Another reason that has been offered (with little

enthusiasm) is that lenders as a group are more optimistic about infLation

than borrowers (Fischer, 1979).

       C. Underwriting, Brokerage and Exchange

       The preferred tax treatment of mortgages in thrift portfolio's and

regulations limiting asset selection also help explain the structure of

the   mortgage underwriting industry. Mortgage underwriting conceptually
involves the same tasks as bond underwriting. What distinguishes mortgage
baiking   from investment banking is the greater need for local verification

of loans collateralized with residential as opposed to industrial capital.

The production function for mortgage loan underwriting is thus quite similar

to the production function for denomination intermediation. The thrift

industry has, in fact, become increasingly cognizant of the value of the

existing plant in producing mortgages as deposit flows have slowed. The

development of mortgage "brokerage" services by the FHLMC simply reflects

the comparative advantage of thrifts in mortgage banking given their existing

physical deposit—taking capacity.
                                        15

        Much significance has been imputed to the various "secondary" mortgage

market institutions: FNMA, GWMA and FHLMC. Actually, these institutions

act largely as demanders in the "primary" market for new mortgage securities;

they provide little brokerage. In essence, their role is to provide

denomination intermediation (to facilitate diversification), as well as to

diversify    risks of holding mortgages. They also provide ultimate investors
an essential element of underwriting, i.e., additional information (Van
Order and Villani, 1981). Mortgage bankers provide      investors information

pertaining to the quality of the collateral. Federal and quasi federal

institutions provide information on the quality of the underwriters. There

are    obvious scale economies to producing and providing this information,
which is why,     for example, GNMA is actually quite profitable.

        Where   then, are existing mortgages brokered? The secondary market
for these mortgages is made up mostly of private "dealers"     who seek out

private    placements. Trades are relatively   infrequent because there is

little    to be gained. The perceived gains from trade reflect a) the different
expectations     of the buyer and seller or b) the need for liquidity. Expectations

regarding existing mortgages are homogeneous, and few institutions typically

need to sell mortgages for liquidity (the 1981 environment is an exception).

       The story is somewhat different for owner—occupied residential capital.

There are a variety of reasons why people move, some of which are financial.

When an owner-occupant moves, ownership must change hands.7 This gives

rise to frequent trades during the life of the house. The real estate

brokerage industry is not publicly regulated, but subject only to self-policing

of roles of appropriate industry practices established by a representative

trade organization.

       By definition, the accepted mediums of exchange are currency and demand

deposits at commercial banks. The McCarran—Furguson Act and Douglas Amendment

prevent bank mergers and branching across state lines, resulting in a fragmented

industry. Thrift institutions have been prohibited by law from offering

demand deposits, resulting in a duplicity of physical capacity to provide a

payment mechanism. But the barriers to entry for transactions mechanisms

are already crumbling. The implications of this are explained more fully in

the next section.


III.   Evolution    of the Housing Finance Structure

       In   this section first we consider the basic economic and regulatory forces
of change in the existing financial structure and then derive the implications
for housing financ. The forces are viewed as driving the system toward
the hypothetical unfettered model developed in Section I.
       A. The Forces for Change
       Inflation   has been the most powerful economic force behind changes in

the financial structure. It has resulted in windfall gains to existing

homeowners, increased the demand for owner-occupied housing, and resulted in

an explosion in the supply of home mortgage debt (Hendershott and Hsieh, 1980).

Simultaneously, it significantly raised nominal interest rates and now

  United States, see Hendershott and Villani (1978).
                                       17

threatens the viability of thrift institutions. These developments have

temporarily abated the regulatory arid legislative sympathies for borrowers,

created empathy for depositors, and heightened concern for the federal

insurance funds. The deregulation of deposit rate ceilings, which began in

March 1980 with enactment of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and

Monetary Control Act9, is being accelerated.'° A decade of debate over the

appropriate consumer safeguards in variable—rate mortgage contracts ended

with the virtual total deregulation of these contracts.11 The economic

forces in this case simply overwhelmed the    existing   regulations.

       Concern with the viability of the federal insurance funds, i.e., the

FDIC and more seriously the FSLIC, is providing additional impetus to

reform.     The first step will be a provision to allow commercial banks to

purchase "troubled' thrifts across state lines. This is essentially a

device to test the waters for repeal of McCarran—Furguson and the Douglas

Amendment. The ultimate step is elimination of prohibitions on branching,

mergers and acquisitions.

—
  Deposit rate deregulation provides another example of a belated regulatory
  response to an innovation, in this case the money market certificate
  introduced in June 1978 to circumvent existing regulations.

10/
     Thrifts perceived the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee as
     proceeding too fast and sued in Federal District Court for slower
     deregulation in the summer of 1980. The Congress has criticized the
     Committee only for moving too slowly, however, and the new Administration
     has accelerated the pace of deregulation.

—
11/
    In April 1981, several weeks after Richard Pratt became Chairman, the
     FHLBB issued extremely flexible regulations regarding interest rate
     adjustability.
                                      18

     A   major distinction between thrifts and commercial banks has   been   the

prohibition   of the former from issuing demand deposit liabilities. This

law is particularly capricious because the physical capital of the two

types of institutions is virtually identical. Higher interest rates on

existing deposits and disiritermediation enhanced the attractiveness of

demand deposits at thrifts. The law was ultimately circumvented first by

iarketing innovation (e.g., a deposit is not a demand deposit if you do not

call it one) and then by technological innovation (bill-payer accounts by phone,

etc.). Thrift institution demand deposits were legitimized in the WOW

Account provisions of the Depository Institutions Act.

     Further evidence of the belated regulatory response to innovation with

the payments mechanism and the ultimate inability of regulators to prevail

is provided by the experience with international banking. Foreign deposits

easily evaded American regulations by flowing to other countries. Domestic

banks responded by establishing Carribean subsidiaries to handle these

funds. In June 1981, the Federal Reserve issued regulations approving the

establishment of international banking facilities in the United States,

thus ending the prohibition and the flow.

    Technological innovation is providing an additional powerful economic

force; computer technology will ultimately facilitate a revolution of the

transactions mechanism. On May 29, 1981, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board

eliminated existing geographic restrictions on "remote service unit"

operations. The rationale for this first step into interstate banking by

thrift institutions was parity with commercial banks.
                                        19

      With this blurring of distinction between thrifts and commercial banks
came a similar blurring of distinction between deposit and nondeposit
financial intermediaries. Merrill Lynch's cash management account may be
the closest substitute to currency as a nationally recognized medium of
exchange.     As existing financial firms are moving into banking, industrial

firms are moving into finance.

      Existing tax preferences favoring housing will also be of declining

significance. The bad debt allowance will soon be phased out, contributing

to the transition of thrifts into banks. The immediate impetus for the

removal of the bad debt allowance is provided paradoxically by the current

earnings squeeze. This earnings squeeze is attributable to low rates on

past nortgage loans, the existence of which is attributable to the bad debt

allowance, limited asset powers and restrictions against variable-rate

mortgages. Thrifts have already been granted expanded asset powers; these

powers   will he   enlarged further and the mortgage tax preference will be

reduced when thrift earnings make doing so feasible.

      B. The Ultimate Financial Structure

      Our   point is that economic and technological forces will ultimately ——
over the next 20 years -— render most existing regulations obsolete.12
This has three major implications for the financial structure and, in
particular,    housing finance institutions. First, various types of firms

will offer a medium of exchange. Money transfers will, for the most part,

be electronic. Banks and thrifts will still exist (although the two will

       an expanded discussion of regulation—induced innovation in banking,

                                       20

not    be readily distinguishable), but in far fewer numbers and with significantly

less physical capital. The primary purposes of most reiiaining branches

will be to convert small deposits to currency (and vice versa) and to produce

mortgages. Federal deposit insurance will contract corniiensurate with   the
reduced role of deposit (or denomination) internediaries, and the two insurers

will be merged into one.

       Second, mortgage banking subsidiaries will be formed by commercial

bank holding companies, savings and loan service corporations, and investment

bankers.    For the most part, mortgage origination arid mortgage finance will
be carried out by separate entities. Mortgages will be financed by various
pooling arrangements developed by the above institutions. The federal role
in   pOoling mortgages will likely   decline in response both to the improved
transfer of underwriting information in     the private sector and the political

backlash to the expanding use of federal guarantees. Private mortgage

insurance will play a larger role in the formation of these pools.

       Third,   the real estate brokerage industry will he agglomerated. There
are currently 600,000 firms, 63 percent of which only have one office
(HUD, 1980, pp. 11.20 and 11.22). The recent entry of Merrill Lynch into the
real    estate brokerage industry on a national scale will he followed by other

firms as the ability to readily transmit information expands. In this regard,

one could envisage long—distance sales via tele—communication. In addition,

the larger firms with sufficient net worth will become dealers in houses,

following the lead of the Merrill Lynch and Sears executive relocation

services. Small firms will still dominate in less populated areas where

volume is insufficient to achieve the economies of scale necessary for

telecommunication and dealer inventory turnover.
                                           21


           Our previous discussion indicated that the housing finance institutions

 are unlikely to exist In near their current form by the beginning of the next

 century. The key issue is what this implies for the financing of owner—occupied

 housing in the year 2001. The quantity of housing —- as opposed to the

 quantity of housing credit --     will   depend on the real user cost or rental

 price of housing capital.13 The absolute tax advantage to owner-occupied

 housing will remain due to politically insurmountable obstacles, but the

 relative advantage will be reduced by successive reductions in the corporate

 income tax and increases in accelerated depreciation and investment tax

 credits. The result will be a general rise in before-tax interest rates

and a fall in the demand for housing services. The disappearance of housing

finance institutions will have a negligible effect on the quantity of

mortgage credit available. In a previous paper (Hendershott and Villani,

1980), we argued that by the end of the past decade housing finance had

been substantially integrated with the capital markets, and thus mortgage

markets cleared at capital market interest rates. Further, empirical

forecasts of housing demand in 1979 and the first half of 1980 suggested that

the most recent housing collapse in the United States can be fully explained

without appeal to rationing effects (Hendershott, 1980). The expected

gradual      disappearance of institutions identifiable as "housing finance
institutions" is consistent with this integration of markets.
       C. The Mortgage Instrument
       The most important concern regarding housing finance in the year 2001
is    the design of the mortgage instrument. This concern arises from the

13/

     and   estimates of its empirical relevance.
                                         22

fact that, for many homeowners, mortgage debt will coitinue to far exceed

net worth. The tax advantage will continue to provide incentives to issue

mortgage debt, and many households will still not have the flexibility in

the remainder of their portfolio to take actions offsetting undesirable

mortgage characteristics. To put it another way, some households may have

no alternative to accepting more cash—flow risk in a mortgage contract than

their income and balance sheets warrant.

       We     are not advocating regulation of mortgage contracts, Our point is
that, at least in the short run, they are designed by existing financial

instititions and their regulators and thus reflect existing problems facing

the institutions and regulators (insurers). Our concern is that the pendulum

nay have swung too far in the direction of depositor and federal insurer interests

to redress past grievances. In our view, this appropriately characterizes

the    FHLBB regulations issued this spring. Here we assime the pendulum
will    reach balance within the next several decades (and hopefully much
sooner),      at which point the mortgage instrument will reflect the needs of

the issuer as well as capital market realities.

       The principal change is that mortgage contracts with fixed nominal

interest rates will be rare. Most mortgages will contain various provisions

For adjustment, as described more fully below. The rate flexibility in the

contracts will remove the economic incentive for lenders to require "due

on    sale"   clauses. The application of computer technology will likely

result in an adjustable mortgage principal. Thus nortgages will be assumed

with greater frequency simply to avoid the transactions costs of repeat

underwriting.       Similarly, flexible mortgage rates and adjustable   loan

principal      will remove the economic incentive for borrowers to refinance.
                                       23

Finally, the concepts of maturity and amortization will likely lose

significance. That is, once the principal balance becomes flexible, a

timetable for repaying debt will disappear. The mortgage instrument will

resemble a line of credit in this regard, with the maximum balance moving

with   the current market value of the asset. Lenders and property tax
appraisers may combine forces to produce current market appraisals.
       The primary concern of borrowers with real rates of interest    in mortgage

contracts   is the cash—flow   risks some instruments pose. The traditional

problem   with the fixed—rate level—payment mortgage is that, with inflation,
this   mortgage causes too rapid a build-up of real homeowner equity and consumes

too large a share of homeowner income. Homeowners unable to issue other

forms of debt are constrained to save more income and/or own less housing

than they desire. Flexible rate contracts that require full payment of

nominal   interest when it accrues, in addition to scheduled principal payments
(due to amortization), expose the borrower to even greater cash flow risks.
       The secondary concern of borrowers regarding real-denominated loans

relates to the types of index chosen. There are essentially two ways to

index. The first indexes yields to the actual real productivity of the

house, in effect converting the mortgage to an equity share. The second

way is to index yields to the expost real yield on new capital. An example

of the former Is the shared-appreciation mortgage (SAM). Technically, the

lender receives a share of the appreciation —-    either   when the house is

sold or at some prespecified date -— as an interest payment. But the

amount of this payment will reflect the real expost productivity of the
                                        24

specific housing capital and is thus in essence an equity interest. An
example of the latter is the variable-rate mortgage, e.g., the Wachovian
Plan.'4 The yield under this plan is indexed to the new-issue six-month

Treasury bill rate.

        The first type of index provides a complete hedge to the hornebu.yer.

Lenders can diversify their implicit residential equity shares to earn the

average expost real rate on housing equity by diversifying the SAM portfolio.

With the Wachovian plan, the lender earns the actual real return on new

capital    in each future period; households thus bear both   the risk of the

return    on an individual house being below average and the risk that future
real returns will rise above returns on existing residential housing.
The SAM is thus the preferred real—denominated mortgage contract from the

borrower's perspective. Moreover, it may be preferred from society's

viewpoint in that lenders are far better able to diversify away the risk

of returns on individual houses.


IV.     Sumary
       There are four essential services provided by a financial system:        a


medium of exchange, security underwriting, security brokerage, and denomination

intermediation. These avoid the costs of barter, increase the productivity

of investment by separating the investnent and saving decisions, reduce

    This plan was first introduced by the Wachovian National Bank in
      North Carolina. Variants have sprung up around the country.
      Presently (June 1981) Wachovian mortgages also reduce the cash—flow
      problems of borrowers because mortgage payments are based on a 13 3/4
      percent interest rate, far below the 16-17 percent rate available on
      fixed-rate mortgages.
                                    25

transactions costs by providing marketability or liquidity, and lower risk

by permitting asset diversification. In a housing finance system unfettered

by nonneutral taxes and regulations, residential capital would be financed

by equity shares and (mortgage) debt; nortgage underwriters would originate

real-denominated housing finance instruments (paying real returns and

indexed, at least roughly, to the nominal value of the underlying house

asset); and financial institutions would facilitate portfolio diversification

by holding a wide variety of assets, including mortgages, and offering

small denomination liabilities.

     The current housing finance system in the United States differs widely

(at least until very recently) in all respects from this hypothetical

model. That large part of residential capital which is owner-occupied is

financed by a single equity share (100 percent ownership); mortgages have

carried fixed nominal rates and negative amortization has been precluded;

and housing finance institutions exist with undiversified portfolios.

These differences can be attributed virtually entirely to the existence of

nonneutral taxes and a myriad of government regulations. Because the tax

subsidy to homeownership is available only to owner-occupiers, there are

strong incentives against issuing multiple equity shares. Because tax

preferences for thrifts are contingent upon   large   percentage investment in

mortgages, thrifts hold undiversified portfolios. Finally, regulations,

or the threat of them, have prevented thrifts from originating variable—rate

mortgages and investing in certain classes of assets.

     The driving force for change of the housing finance system has been

the acceleration of inflation. Increased nominal interest rates have
                                         26

threatened the viability of thrift institutions and created enormous cash-

flow problems for homebuyers. As a result, regulators now favor variable-

rate mortgages, and mortgages with negative amortization —-          graduated
payaient, shared—appreciation, and Wachtovian -—       are   being utilized.

Moreover, because returns on shared-appreciation mortgages are tied to the

movement in the price of the underlying house, this instrument is equivalent

to an equity and allows diversification of part of the risk of investment

in individual     houses. We expect such      instruments to become widespread in

the future. The early disappearance of fixed-rate mortgages is obvious.

       Other likely changes affecting housing finance include the following.

The tax preferences of thrifts and relative tax advantage of owner-occupied

housing will e reduced, the latter by cutting effective tax rates on other

assets (reductions in the corporate and capital gains tax rates and increases

in tax depreciation and investment tax credit). There will be fewer

brokerage     firms and financial institutions, and there will be few, if any,
undiversi fi ed "housing finance" institutions. Mortgage on gi nation and
finance will be carried out almost entirely by different institutions.
Finally,     the federal role in housing finance and insurance will be contracted.

       The   reduction in   the relative tax advantage for owner—occupied housing

will   obviously tilt households away from ownership and tend to reduce the
quantity of housing desired, but the development of mortgages with negative
amortization will act to raise housing demand. The projected demise of
traditional housing finance institutions will have little          impact on housing

demand   because the mortgage market is already integrated with capital
markets generally.
