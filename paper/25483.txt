                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze the role that the launch of new drugs has played in reducing the number of years of
life lost (YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries.

We estimate 2-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and country-specific
age-standardized YLL rate. The models control for the average decline in the YLL rate in each
country and from each disease.

One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85
YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before
year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%. (A drug’s utilization peaks 8-10 years after
it was launched.) Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are
unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched.

The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would
have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was. We estimate that pharmaceutical expenditure per
life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by post-1981 drugs was $2837. This amount is about 8% of
per capita GDP, indicating that post-1981 drugs launched were very cost–effective, overall. But
the fact that an intervention is cost-effective does not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”

                       How many life-years have new drugs saved?
           A 3-way fixed-effects analysis of 66 diseases in 27 countries, 2000-2013
                                     Extended abstract

        We perform an econometric analysis of the role that pharmaceutical innovation—the
introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years of life lost
(YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries. We estimate 2-
way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and country-specific age-
standardized premature mortality rate. The models control for the average (across diseases)
decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and the average (across countries)
decline in the premature mortality rate from each disease. This approach is feasible because the
relative number of drugs launched for different diseases has varied considerably across
countries.
        One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-
age-85 YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years
before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%. The larger estimated effect of drugs
launched 12 or more years before year t is not surprising, considering the gradual diffusion of
new drugs and the likelihood of a lag from utilization to mortality reduction. When lower YLL
age thresholds are used, the estimates are qualitatively similar to, but larger in magnitude than,
the YLL85 estimates. Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are
unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched.
        The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013
would have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was. For a subset of 22 countries for which
complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available, we estimate that the number of
life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7 million. We
also estimate that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before age 70 and 44.9
million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013. The fraction of life-years saved by more
recent drugs is slightly larger than their fraction of drug volume, which is consistent with the
hypothesis that the average quality of new drugs is superior to the average quality of older drugs.
        We estimate that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by
post-1981 drugs was $2837. This amount is about 8% of per capita GDP, so these estimates
indicate that the new drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall.
Post-1981 drug launches are estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% between 2000 and 2013,
which is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%. Similarly, the estimated
2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) are larger than the
actual (24% and 28%) reductions. One possible explanation for the finding that the estimated
drug-launch-induced YLL declines are larger than the actual declines is that trends in other
factors (e.g. diabetes and obesity prevalence) were increasing mortality. Another possible
explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover effects (e.g. cardiovascular
drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-reducing spillover effects
(e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce cardiovascular mortality). But even if the
number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the amount implied by our
estimates (which do not account for between-disease spillover effects), the evidence indicates
that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall. But the fact that an
intervention is cost-effective does not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”

I.      Introduction


        Global health has improved during the 21st century. Life expectancy at birth increased
from 66.5 years in 2000 to 72.0 years in 2016 [1]. Also, according to the WHO’s Global Health
Estimates, the number of years of life lost 1 per 100,000 population declined by 29% between
2000 and 2016 [2]. Longevity has increased, despite the fact that the global prevalence (age-
standardized) of diabetes has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult
population [3], and the global prevalence of obesity (BMI > 30) among adults increased 39%
(from 8.7% to 12.1% of the population) between 2000 and 2013 [4].
        Some researchers have argued that biomedical innovation has been the principal cause of
recent improvements in health. Fuchs [5] said that “since World War II…biomedical
innovations (new drugs, devices, and procedures) have been the primary source of increases in
longevity,” although he did not provide evidence to support this claim. Cutler, Deaton and
Lleras-Muney [6] performed a survey of a large and diverse literature on the determinants of
mortality, and “tentatively identif[ied] the application of scientific advance and technical
progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by education) as the ultimate
determinant of health.” They concluded that “knowledge, science, and technology are the keys
to any coherent explanation” of mortality. Other research has shown that most technological
progress is “embodied”: to benefit from technological progress, people must use new products
and services. 2
        Most scholars agree with Jones’ [9] statement that “technological progress is driven by
research and development (R&D) in the advanced world” (pp. 89-90). In 1997, the medical
substances and devices sector was the most R&D-intensive 3 major industrial sector in the U.S.:
almost twice as R&D-intensive as the next-highest sector (information and electronics), and
three times as R&D-intensive as the average for all major sectors. [10]. According to Dorsey et


1
  Years of life lost (YLL) is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if he or she had not died
prematurely. It is, therefore, a measure of premature mortality. One can calculate the number of years of life lost
before different ages. If a person died at age 60, he or she lost 10 years before age 70 and 25 years before age 85.
2
  Solow [7] argued that “many if not most innovations need to be embodied in new kinds of durable equipment
before they can be made effective. Improvements in technology affect output only to the extent that they are carried
into practice either by net capital formation or by the replacement of old-fashioned equipment by the latest
models…” Hercowitz [8] concluded that “‘embodiment’ is the main transmission mechanism of technological
progress to economic growth” (p. 223).

  R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D to sales.

al [11], in 2008, 88% of privately-funded U.S. biomedical research expenditure was funded by
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms; the remaining 11% was funded by medical device
firms.
         The purpose of this study is to assess econometrically the role that pharmaceutical
innovation—the introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years
of life lost before 3 different ages (age 85, 70, and 55) in 27 countries. During the period 1982-
2015, 4 1300 new chemical entities (NCEs) 5 were launched 6 in one or more of those countries.
For reasons discussed below, there is likely to be a substantial lag between the launch of a new
drug and its maximum impact on the burden of disease, so we will allow for considerable lags in
the relationship between new drug launches and the burden of disease.
         Figure 1 shows the number of NCE launches during 1982-2015, by country. The number
of NCE launches in the two countries with the smallest number of launches (Israel and
Venezuela) was about half as large as the number of NCE launches in the two countries with the
highest number of launches (the USA and Germany). The number of new drug launches also
varied considerably across diseases. Figure 2 shows the number of new chemical substances
used to treat 30 diseases that were launched in at least one country during 1982-2015.
         We have (“three-dimensional”) data on both the number of drug launches and the age-
standardized premature mortality rate by country, disease, and year, so our analysis will be based
on a three-way fixed effects model of the premature mortality rate. From that model, we will
derive a 2-way fixed-effects model (which is easier to estimate) of the rate of decline of the
premature mortality rate. That model will include both country fixed effects, which control for
the average (across diseases) decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and disease
fixed effects, which control for the average (across countries) decline in the premature mortality
rate from each disease. This approach is feasible because the relative number of drugs launched
for different diseases has varied considerably across countries. This is illustrated by Figure 3,
which shows the number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 in Japan and Portugal for 19 types
of cancer. The mean (across cancer sites) number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 was

almost identical in Japan and Portugal (3.3 and 3.2, respectively), but Japan launched 4 more
drugs for leukemia and 4 fewer drugs for ovary cancer.
         Different organizations use different age thresholds to compute YLL. The age threshold
used in the OECD Health Statistics database [12] is age 70. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention website [13] allows one to calculate YLL before ages 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85. The
Global Burden of Disease 2010 reference life table used an age threshold of 86 years. WHO
Global Health Estimates uses an age threshold of 91.93 years. 7 We will analyze the age-
standardized rate of years of life lost before three ages (85, 70, and 55).
         In the next section, we will describe the econometric model that we will use to assess the
role that pharmaceutical innovation has played in reducing premature mortality from 66 diseases
in 28 countries during the period 2000-2013. The data sources used to estimate this model are
discussed on Section III. Empirical results are presented in Section IV. Some implications of
the estimates are discussed on Section V. Section VI provides a summary.


II.      Methods


         The first models we will use to assess the impact that pharmaceutical innovation had on
premature mortality will be based on the following 3-way fixed effects equation:
ln(Ydct) = β0-11 LAUNCHES_0_11dct + β12+ LAUNCHES_GE_12dct + αdc + δdt + γct + εdct                               (1)
where Ydct is one of the following variables:
           YLL85dct = the age-standardized rate of years of life lost before age 85 per
                    100,000 population below age 85 due to disease d in country c in year t
                    (t = 2000, 2013)

           YLL70dct = the age-standardized rate of years of life lost before age 70 per
                    100,000 population below age 70 due to disease d in country c in year t

7
  Some of the experts consulted by WHO argued that it was not appropriate to set the normative loss of years of life
in terms of currently observed death rates, since even for the lowest observed death rates there are a proportion of
deaths that are preventable or avertable. In fact, Japanese females have already exceeded the GBD 2010 reference
life expectancy at birth, with a life expectancy at birth in 2013 of 87.1 years. Since the loss function is intended to
represent the maximum life span of an individual in good health, who is not exposed to avoidable health risks, or
severe injuries, and receives appropriate health services, the WHO chose to base its Global Health Estimates YLL
age threshold on the frontier national life expectancy projected for the year 2050 by the World Population Prospects
2012. The highest projected life expectancies for the year 2050 are projected to be achieved by women in Japan and
the Republic of Korea, with a life expectancy at birth of 91.9 years. While this may still not represent the ultimate
achievable human life spans, it does represent a set of life spans which are thought likely to be achieved by a
substantial number of people who are alive today [14]. See World Health Organization [15].

           YLL55dct = the age-standardized rate of years of life lost before age 55 per
                    100,000 population below age 55 due to disease d in country c in year t

and
     LAUNCHES_0_11dct = the number of new drugs to treat disease d that were launched in
                      country c 11 or fewer years before year t

    LAUNCHES_GE_12dct = the number of new drugs to treat disease d that were launched in
                      country c more than 11 years before year t

                          αdc = a fixed effect for disease d in country c

                          δdt = a fixed effect for disease d in year t

                           γct = a fixed effect for country c in year t

         Eq. (1) may be considered a health production function [16], and the number of new
drugs launched may be considered a measure of the stock of pharmaceutical “ideas.” Jones [17]
argued that “long-run growth is driven by the discovery of new ideas throughout the world.” 8
Nordhaus [18] argued that “improvements in health status have been a major contributor to
economic welfare over the twentieth century. To a first approximation, the economic value of
increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as large as the value of measured growth
in non-health goods and services.” The specification of eq. (1) incorporates the assumption of
diminishing marginal productivity of drug launches: each additional drug launch for a disease
results in a diminishing absolute reduction in mortality.
         Estimates based on eq. (1) will provide evidence about the impact of the launch of drugs
for a disease on the burden of that disease, but they will not capture possible spillover effects of
the drugs on the burden of other diseases. These spillovers may be either positive or negative.
For example, the launch of cardiovascular drugs could reduce mortality from cardiovascular
disease, but increase mortality from the “competing risk” of cancer. On the other hand, the
launch of drugs for mental disorders could reduce mortality from other medical conditions.
Prince et al [19] argued that “mental disorders increase risk for communicable and non-


8
  The discovery of new ideas could increase economic output for two different reasons. First, output could simply
be positively related to the quantity (and variety) of ideas ever discovered. Second, output could be positively
related to the (mean or maximum) quality of ideas ever discovered, and new ideas may be better (of higher quality),
on average, than old ideas.
                                                                                                       6


communicable diseases, and contribute to unintentional and intentional injury. Conversely, many
health conditions increase the risk for mental disorder, and comorbidity complicates help-
seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, and influences prognosis.”
           The launch of a drug in a country indicates that patients could have been treated with that
drug, not necessarily that patients were treated with that drug. We would prefer to estimate
models in which the explanatory variables measured the drugs actually used to treat patients, by
disease, country, and year. We have annual data for 2007-2017 on the utilization of each drug in
each country. However, many drugs have multiple indications—50% of drugs have 2 or more
indications (causes of disease in the WHO Global Health Estimates disease classification), and
7% of drugs have 5 or more indications—and our data do not enable us to determine how often
each drug was used for each of its indications.
           Since our drug launch variables are imperfect measures of exposure to pharmaceutical
innovation, the estimated coefficients on those variables are likely to be biased towards zero, and
our estimates of the number of life-years saved by new drugs are likely to be conservative. Here
is the first paragraph of the eminent MIT econometrician Jerry Hausman’s article on
mismeasured variables in econometric analysis [20, p. 57]:
           The effect of mismeasured variables in statistical and econometric analysis is one of the
           oldest known problems, dating from the 1870s in Adcock (1878). In the most
           straightforward regression analysis with a single regressor variable, the least squares
           estimate is downward biased in magnitude toward zero. While a mismeasured right-hand
           side variable creates this problem, a mismeasured left-hand side variable under classical
           assumptions does not lead to bias. The only result is less precision in the estimated
           coefficient and a lower t-statistic.

           Models based on eq. (1) will be estimated using data on 66 diseases in 27 countries in
2000 and 2013. 9 We will also estimate models based on more general versions of eq. (1) that
will allow either (1) the effect of drugs launched 0-5 years before year t to differ from the effect
of drugs launched 6-11 years before year t, and (2) mortality to depend on the number of new
classes of drugs launched in addition to the number of new drugs launched.
           In eq. (1), drugs launched in two periods (11 or fewer years before year t vs. more than
11 years before year t) are allowed to have different effects on mortality in year t. We will
perform tests of the null hypothesis β0-11 = β12+, but we expect |β0-11| < |β12+|, i.e. we expect drugs


9
    Data on drug launches or (in a few cases) on YLL rates were not available for other countries.
                                                                                                                   7


launched more than 11 years before year t to have a more negative impact on mortality in year t
than drugs launched 11 or fewer years before year t. There is likely to be a substantial lag
between the launch of a new drug and its maximum impact on the burden of disease. Utilization
of recently-launched drugs tends to be much lower than utilization of drugs launched many years
earlier. Evidence about the shape of the drug-age (number of years since launch) drug-utilization
profile can be obtained by estimating the following equation:
         ln(N_SUmcn) = ρmc + πn + εmcn                                                                      (2)
where
              N_SUmcn = the number of standard units of molecule m sold in country c n
                      years after it was first launched (n = 0, 1,…, 18)

                     ρmc = a fixed effect for molecule m in country c

                       πn = a fixed effect for age n
         The expression exp(πn - π8) is a “relative utilization index”: it is the mean ratio of the
quantity of a drug sold in country c n years after it was launched to the quantity of the same drug
sold 8 years after it was launched. We estimated eq. (2), using annual data for the period 2007-
2017 on 721 molecules. Estimates of the “relative utilization index” are shown in Figure 4.
These estimates indicate that utilization of a drug reaches a peak about 8-10 years after it was
launched. It is used about twice as much then as it was two years after launch.
         Due to gradual diffusion of new drugs, the maximum impact of a drug on disease burden
is likely to occur a number of years after it was launched, but the peak effect could occur either
more than or less than 8-10 years after launch. The lag might be longer because some drugs for
chronic diseases (e.g. statins) may have to be consumed for several years to achieve full
effectiveness. But the lag might be shorter because the impact of a drug on disease burden is
likely to depend on its quality (or effectiveness) as well as on its quantity (utilization), and drugs
launched more recently are likely to be of higher quality than earlier-vintage drugs. 10, 11

10
   Grossman and Helpman [21] argued that “innovative goods are better than older products simply because they
provide more ‘product services’ in relation to their cost of production.” Bresnahan and Gordon [22] stated simply
that “new goods are at the heart of economic progress,” and Bils [23] said that “much of economic growth occurs
through growth in quality as new models of consumer goods replace older, sometimes inferior, models.” As noted
by Jovanovic and Yatsenko [24], in “the Spence–Dixit–Stiglitz tradition…new goods [are] of higher quality than old
goods.”
11
   The impact on mortality may depend on the interaction (quantity * quality) of the two variables. The mortality
impact will increase with respect to drug age (time since launch) if the rate of increase of quantity with respect to
age is greater than the rate of decline of quality with respect to age; otherwise the mortality impact will decline.
                                                                                                                    8


         In our analysis, a drug is a (5th-level) chemical substance (e.g. atorvastatin, ATC code
C10AA05), as defined in the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification
System. 12 A new drug launch is the first observed launch of a (5th-level) chemical substance
corresponding to a new chemical entity (NCE), as defined by IQVIA. Our data on NCE
launches are left-censored: we only have data on NCEs that were launched anywhere in the
world after 1981; data on pre-1982 launches are not available. Consequently, our drug launch
variables (especially LAUNCHES_GE_12) are subject to measurement error: if a drug that was
first launched anywhere in the world before 1982 was first launched in one of our 27 countries
after 1982, it will not, but should, be counted as a new drug launch. If this measurement error is
random, it is likely to bias estimates of the drug launch coefficients (especially β12+) towards
zero.
         Due to data limitations, LAUNCHES_0_11 and LAUNCHES_GE_12 are the only
disease- and country-specific, time-varying regressors in eq. (1). The very large number of
fixed effects in the equation 13 control for many unobserved potential determinants of premature
mortality, e.g. they control for the possibility that the severity of ischemic heart disease tends to
be greater in Brazil than it is in the United States. The country-year fixed effects (γct’s) control
for changes in a country’s attributes (e.g. its average income, educational attainment, and health
care expenditure) to the extent that they have similar effects on mortality from different
diseases. 14
         If the data were available, we would like to include other regressors in eq. (1), including
(1) disease incidence, and (2) the number of non-pharmaceutical medical innovations (e.g.
medical device innovations) for disease d that had been launched in country c. However, there is

12
   The ATC Classification System is used for the classification of active ingredients of drugs according to
the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties [25].
This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which
they act, their therapeutic intent or nature, and the drug's chemical characteristics. Different brands share the same
code if they have the same active substance and indications. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a
pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one
drug can have more than one code, for example acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has A01AD05 as a drug for
local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic; as well as one
code can represent more than one active ingredient, for example C09BB04 is the combination of perindopril with
amlodipine, two active ingredients that have their own codes (C09AA04 and C08CA01respectively) when
prescribed alone.
13
   There are 1782 (= 66 × 27) fixed effects for disease d in country c (αdc’s).
14
   For example, suppose that ln(Ydct) depends on EDUct (where EDUct = average educational attainment in country c
in year t), and that γd—the marginal effect of EDUct on ln(Ydct)—does not vary across diseases (γd = γ, all d). Then
γd EDUct = γ EDUct, which can be written as γct.
                                                                                                                    9


good reason to believe that failure to control for those variables is unlikely to result in
overestimation of the magnitudes of β0-11 and β12+; exclusion of those variables may even result
in underestimation of the magnitudes of those parameters. Higher disease incidence is likely to
result in both higher disease burden and a larger number of drug launches:

                                                                       mortality ↑
             disease incidence ↑
                                                           number of new drug launches ↑

Previous studies have shown that both innovation (the number of drugs developed) and diffusion
(the number of drugs launched in a country) depend on market size. Acemoglu and Linn [26]
found “economically significant and relatively robust effects of market size on innovation.”
Danzon et al [27] found that “countries with lower expected prices or smaller expected market
size experience longer delays in new drug access, controlling for per capita income and other
country and firm characteristics” (emphasis added).
         Although incidence data are not available for most diseases, annual incidence data for
Canada during the period 1992-2010 are available for 31 cancer sites (breast, lung, etc.). As
expected, there is a significant positive correlation across cancer sites between ln(CASESst)
(where CASESst = the number of Canadian patients diagnosed with cancer at cancer site s in year
t) and ln(CUM_DRUGst) (where CUM_DRUGst = the number of chemical substances to treat
cancer at site s that had ever been launched in Canada by the end of year t). But estimates of the
equation ln(CUM_DRUGst) = π ln(CASESst) + αs + δst + εst indicate that the growth rate of
CUM_DRUG is uncorrelated across cancer sites with the growth rate of incidence. This
suggests that estimates of β0-11 and β12+ in eq. (1) are unlikely to be biased by the omission of
incidence in that equation.
         Failure to control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation (e.g. innovation in
diagnostic imaging, surgical procedures, and medical devices) is also unlikely to bias estimates
of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on the burden of disease, for two reasons. First, as
noted earlier, 88% of privately-funded U.S. funding for biomedical research came from
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms [11].15 Second, previous research based on U.S. data


15
  Much of the rest came from the federal government (i.e. the NIH), and new drugs often build on upstream
government research [28]. The National Cancer Institute [29] says that it “has played a vital role in cancer drug
discovery and development, and, today, that role continues.”
                                                                                                                10


[30, 31] indicated that non-pharmaceutical medical innovation is not positively correlated across
diseases with pharmaceutical innovation.
        The dependent variable of eq. (1) is the log of the level of premature mortality in year t.
We will use data for two years: 2000 and 2013. From the 3-way fixed effects model of the log of
the level of premature mortality in year t, which includes 1970 parameters, we can derive a 2-
way fixed effects model of the 2000-2013 growth of premature mortality, which includes only 95
parameters. Substituting the two values of t into eq. (1) yields:
ln(Ydc,2000) = β0-11 LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2000 + β12+ LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2000
                          + αdc + δd,2000 + γc,2000 + εdc,2000                                            (3)
ln(Ydc,2013) = β0-11 LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2013 + β12+ LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2013
                          + αdc + δd,2013 + γc,2013 + εdc,2013                                            (4)
Subtracting eq. (3) from eq. (4) yields:
∆ln(Ydc) = β0-11 ∆LAUNCHES_0_11dc + β12+ ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12dc + δd + γc + εcd                                (5)
where
                    ∆ln(Ydc) = ln(Ydc,2013 / Ydc,2000)
     ∆LAUNCHES_0_11dc = LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2013 - LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2000
 ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12dc = LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2013 - LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2000
                            δd = δd,2013 - δd,2000
                            γc = γc,2013 - γc,2000
                           εdc = εdc,2013 - εdc,2000
        Eq. (5) is a 2-way fixed effects regression of the 2000-2013 growth in premature
mortality from disease d in country c on the 2000-2013 changes in the number of drugs launched
0-11 years and more than 11 years earlier. To address the issue of heteroskedasticity, 16 eq. (5)
will be estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by (POPc,2000 * (Ydc,2000 + Ydc,2013) / 2),
where POPc,2000 = the population of country c in 2000. Disturbances will be clustered within
diseases.
        In eqs. (1) and (5), all new drugs launched within a given period (e.g. 0-11 years before
year t) are assumed to have the same effect on mortality in year t. It is possible that the launch of


16
  Growth rates of observations with low average mortality exhibit much greater variance and volatility than growth
rates of observations with high average mortality.
                                                                                                                   11


some drugs reduces mortality more than the launch of other drugs. In particular, it is possible
that the launch of the first drug in a drug class, or 4th-level ATC chemical subgroup, reduces
mortality more than the launch of subsequent drugs in the same 4th-level ATC chemical
subgroup. 17 We can assess the relative mortality impact of the launch of new drugs and the
launch of new classes of drugs by generalizing eq. (5) to include two additional variables:
∆ln(Ydc) = β0-11 ∆LAUNCHES_0_11dc + β12+ ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12dc +
            µ0-11 ∆CLASSES_0_11dc              + µ12+ ∆CLASSES_GE_12dc + δd + γc + εcd                          (6)
where
       ∆CLASSES_0_11dc = the 2000-2013 change in the number of new classes (4th-level ATC
                       chemical subgroups) of drugs to treat disease d that were launched in
                       country c 11 or fewer years earlier

     ∆CLASSES_GE_12dc = the 2000-2013 change in the number of new classes of drugs to
                      treat disease d that were launched in country c 12 or more years
                      earlier

If mortality depends only, or primarily, on the number of new chemical subgroup launches,
rather than on the number of new chemical substance launches, estimates of µ0-11 and µ12+ will
be statistically significant, and estimates of β0-11 and β12+ will be insignificant. 18


III.     Data sources


Age-standardized rates of years of life lost. Age-standardized rates of years of life lost before
ages 85, 70, and 55, by disease, country, and year, were constructed from death registration data
published by the WHO [32], and from population data published by the United Nations (United
Nations Population Division [33]. The disease classification used is described in Annex Table A
of World Health Organization [15]. Age-standardized rates of years of life lost due to all causes
before ages 85, 70, and 55 per 100,000 population, by country, are shown in Table 1.
Drug launch data. Data on the years in which post-1981 new chemical entities were first
launched in each of 28 countries were obtained from IQVIA’s New Product Focus database.


17
   For example, the launch of lovastatin (C10AA02), the first HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (C10AA), might have
reduced mortality more than the launches of the seven subsequently-launched HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.
18
   Due to left-censoring of the drug launch data, our data on the number of new drug classes, as well as our data on
the number of new drugs, are subject to measurement error. Errors in the measurement of the number of new drug
classes are likely to be greater than errors in the measurement of the number of new drugs.
                                                                                                               12


Drug indications data. Indications (coded by ICD-10) of chemical substances were obtained
from Theriaque, a database produced by the French Centre National Hospitalier d'Information
sur le Médicament [34]. 19
Drug utilization and expenditure data. Data on the quantity (number of standard units) and
value (in USD) of prescription drugs sold, by chemical substance, country, and year (2007-2017)
were obtained from the IQVIA MIDAS database.


IV.        Results


           Estimates of drug launch coefficients from nine different models of the 2000-2013 log
change in the disease- and country-specific age-standardized rate of years of life lost are
presented in Table 2. Models 1-3 in the table are estimates of eq. (5) for each of the three YLL
age thresholds (ages 85, 70, and 55). The YLL age threshold in the first model, shown in rows 1
and 2, is age 85. 20 Estimates of the coefficients of both drug-launch regressors
(∆LAUNCHES_0_11 and ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12) are negative and highly significant (p-value <
.0001). This signifies that premature (before age 85) mortality from a disease in a country is
inversely related to the number of drugs for that disease that were previously launched in that
country, ceteris paribus. The magnitude of the ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12 coefficient is 85% larger
than the magnitude of the ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 coefficient. The chi-square statistic and its
associated p-value (in the two columns on the right of the table) indicate that the null hypothesis
of equality of the two coefficients is strongly rejected (p-value = 0.012). One additional drug
launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 YLL rate in year t by
3.0% (= 1 – exp(-0.031)), and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before year t is
estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 YLL rate by 5.5%. The larger estimated effect of
drugs launched 12 or more years before year t is not surprising, considering the gradual diffusion
of new drugs and the likelihood of a lag from utilization to mortality reduction.
           The YLL age threshold in the second model in Table 2, shown in rows 3 and 4, is age 70.
Once again, estimates of the coefficients of both drug-launch regressors are negative and highly
significant (p-value < .0001). The null hypothesis of equality of the two coefficients is strongly

19
     Theriaque provides data only on labeled indications; it does not provide data on off-label indications.

     Complete estimates of this model are shown in Appendix Table 1.
                                                                                                                    13


rejected. One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the
pre-age-70 YLL rate in year t by 3.6%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before
year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-70 YLL rate by 6.6%.
         The YLL age threshold in the third model in Table 2, shown in rows 5 and 6, is age 55.
The estimates are qualitatively similar to, but larger in magnitude than, the pre-age-85 and pre-
age-70 YLL estimates. One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have
reduced the pre-age-55 YLL rate in year t by 4.3%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more
years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-55 YLL rate by 7.3%.
         In models 4-6 of Table 2, ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 is separated into two parts: changes in the
number of drug launches 0-5 years and 6-11 years before year t (∆LAUNCHES_0_5 and
∆LAUNCHES_6_11, respectively). In each model, the coefficients of all three regressors are
negative and significant, but the chi-square statistics indicate that the hypothesis of equality of
the ∆LAUNCHES_0_5 and ∆LAUNCHES_6_11 coefficients cannot be rejected.
         Models 7-9 in Table 2 are estimates, for each of the three YLL age thresholds, of the
model (eq. (6)) that includes two additional variables (∆CLASSES_0_11 and
∆CLASSES_GE_12) to allow us to assess the relative mortality impact of the launch of new
drugs and the launch of new classes of drugs. The coefficients of both variables are insignificant
in all three models: controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are
unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched. This finding may be interpreted in
several different ways. It may signify that patients benefit from having multiple drugs within a
chemical subgroup. 21 Alternatively, perhaps health outcomes depend on the number of drug
classes, but some drug classes are more important or valuable than others, and more valuable
classes may have larger numbers of drugs. 22 The insignificance of the ∆CLASSES_0_11 and
∆CLASSES_GE_12 coefficients may also be partly attributable to the fact that these variables
are subject to greater measurement error than ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 and ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12.




21
   A later entrant in a chemical subgroup (“drug 2”) may be therapeutically superior to the first-in-class drug (“drug
1”). Even if drug 2 is not superior to drug 1, on average, it may be superior for a subset of patients.
22
   If the YLL rate depends on the number of drug classes previously launched, weighted by their therapeutic value,
and the number of drugs in a class is indicative of the therapeutic value of the class, the YLL rate would depend on
the number of drugs.

V.      Discussion


        Now we will use the estimates of β0-11 and β12+ in models 1-3 in Table 2 to calculate
several important measures: (1) the number of life-years saved (i.e., the reduction in years of life
lost) before ages 85, 70, and 55 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; (2) pharmaceutical
expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; and (3)
the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates attributable to new drug launches.
         The first set of calculations is shown in Table 3. Calculation of the number of life-years
saved before age 85 is shown in rows 1-3. The mean reduction (which we denote by Φ) in
ln(YLL85) in 2013 attributable to drugs launched after 1981 is Φ = β0-11 *
mean(LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2013) + β12+ * mean (LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2013). The estimated ratio
of YLL85 in the absence of new drugs to actual YLL = 1 / exp(Φ). The estimates imply that, if
no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would have been 2.16 times as high
as it actually was. Actual total YLL85 in a subset of 22 countries (listed in Table 4) for which
complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available was 128.1 million. 23 Therefore,
the estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would
have been 276.8 million, and that the number of life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from
drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7 million.
        Calculations of the number of life-years saved before ages 70 and 55 are shown in rows
4-6 and 7-9, respectively, of Table 3. The estimated ratios of YLL in the absence of new drugs
to actual YLL are higher (2.45 and 2.83, respectively) for the lower YLL age thresholds. We
estimate that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before age 70 and 44.9
million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013.
        The figures in Table 3 indicate that 79% of the life-years saved before ages 85, 70, and
55 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981 were saved by drugs that were launched 12 or more
years before (i.e. during 1982-2001). Most of those drugs probably faced generic competition:
Danzon and Furukawa [35, Figure 2] showed that, in 10 countries, (unweighted) mean molecule
age at generic entry was 10.2 years. Duflos and Lichtenberg [36] showed that in the US, the



23
  For the year 2000, the WHO Global Health Estimates figure for YLL (based on an age threshold of 91.93 years) is
63% higher than YLL85.
                                                                                                                  15


average price of a drug 17 years after it was launched is 61% lower than the average price of the
drug 12 years after it was launched.
         For all three YLL age thresholds, the share of the 2013 YLL reduction attributable to
drugs launched fewer than 12 years before (i.e., during 2002-2013) is 21%. This share is slightly
(17%) higher than the ratio (18%) of the number of standard units (“number of pills”) sold in
2013 of drugs launched during 2002-2013 to the number of standard units sold in 2013 of drugs
launched during 1982-2013. The fact that the fraction of life-years saved by more recent drugs is
larger than their fraction of drug volume is consistent with the hypothesis discussed above that
the average quality of new drugs is superior to the average quality of older drugs, especially
when we consider the likelihood of a lag from drug utilization to YLL reduction.
         Now we will calculate an estimate of pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved
before age 85 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981. Data on pharmaceutical expenditure,
by country, are shown in Table 4. The first column of figures shows 2013 expenditure on drugs
launched after 1981, derived from the IQVIA MIDAS database. The second column shows 2013
expenditure on all drugs, derived from the same source. Post-1981 drugs accounted for 54% (=
$346 b. / $638 b.) of total drug expenditure. An estimate of total expenditure in 2014 from an
alternative source [37] is 22% (= ($778 b. / $638 b.) – 1) higher than the IQVIA estimate of total
expenditure in 2013. We will use the higher (IFPMA) estimate of total expenditure, and assume
that 54% of that expenditure was on post-1981 drugs, so our estimate of 2013 expenditure on
post-1981 drugs was $421.8 billion (= 54% * $778 billion). As shown in Table 3, the number of
life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from post-1981 drugs was 148.7 million, so we estimate
that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by post-1981 drugs
was $2837 (= $421.8 billion / 148.7 million).
         As noted by Bertram et al [38], authors writing on behalf of the WHO’s Choosing
Interventions that are Cost–Effective project (WHO-CHOICE) suggested in 2005 that
“interventions that avert one DALY for less than average per capita income for a given country
or region are considered very cost–effective; interventions that cost less than three times average
per capita income per DALY averted are still considered cost–effective.” 24 Weighted (by


24
  Other authorities use reasonably similar cost-effectiveness thresholds. The U.K. National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence [39] says that, "in general, interventions with an ICER [Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio] of
less than £20,000 per QALY gained are considered to be cost effective." The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Health Economics Resource Center [40] says that “a cost-effectiveness analysis may indicate that Drug A is a good
                                                                                                                  16


population) mean per capita GDP was $35,543 in 2013, so these estimates indicate that the new
drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall.
         Several considerations suggest that $2837 may be an overestimate of the true net cost in
2013 per life-year saved of post-1981 drugs. First, that estimate is based on drug cost measured
at invoice price levels; rebates and discounts are not reflected. 25 Second, a previous study based
on U.S. data [42] showed that about 25% of the cost of new drugs is offset by reduced
expenditure on old drugs. 26
         The last calculation we will perform will be of the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates
attributable to new drug launches. This calculation is similar to the ones in Table 3, but instead
of the 2013 levels of LAUNCHES_0_11 and LAUNCHES_GE_12, we use the 2000-2013
changes in those variables. The estimated drug-launch-induced 2000-2013 log change in YLL is
(β0-11 * mean(∆LAUNCHES_0_11) + β12+ * mean (∆LAUNCHES_GE_12)). The weighted
mean values of ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 and ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12 were about -3.6 27 and 9.4,
respectively. Consequently, the estimated log change in YLL85 was -0.417, i.e. post-1981 drug
launches are estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% (= 1 – exp(-0.417)) between 2000 and
2013. This is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%. Similarly, the
estimated 2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) are larger
than the actual (24% and 28%) reductions.
         One possible explanation for the finding that the estimated drug-launch-induced YLL
declines were larger than the actual declines is that trends in other factors were increasing
mortality. As noted above, the global prevalence of diabetes and obesity have increased
sharply. 28 Another possible explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover
effects (e.g. cardiovascular drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-
reducing spillover effects (e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce cardiovascular
mortality). But even if the number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the



value relative to Drug B, because it has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $40,000 per Quality-
Adjusted Life Year.”

   In the U.S. in 2014, rebates reduced total brand name drug cost by 17.5% [41].
26
   That study also demonstrated that pharmaceutical innovation has reduced work-loss and school-loss days.
27
   There were fewer launches during 2002-2013 than there were during 1989-2000.
28
   However, another behavioral risk factor—smoking—has been declining. For example, smoking prevalence
among men declined from 44.2% in 2000 to 36.1% in 2013.

estimates imply that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall.


VI.    Summary


       We have performed an econometric analysis of the role that pharmaceutical innovation—
the introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years of life lost
(YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries. We used
“three-dimensional” data on both the number of drug launches and the premature mortality rate
by country, disease, and year, to estimate 2-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the
disease- and country-specific age-standardized premature mortality rate. The models controlled
for the average (across diseases) decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and the
average (across countries) decline in the premature mortality rate from each disease. This
approach was feasible because the relative number of drugs launched for different diseases has
varied considerably across countries.
       This study is subject to a number of limitations. Our measures of pharmaceutical
innovation (the number of drugs and drug classes launched in a country) are imperfect. Our drug
launch data are left-censored: only drugs launched anywhere in the world after 1981 are
captured. Off-label use of drugs is not accounted for. Our drug indications data were obtained
from a French database, and some drugs launched in other countries have not been launched in
France. Our estimates provide evidence about the impact of the launch of drugs for a disease on
the burden of that disease, but they do not capture possible spillover effects of the drugs on the
burden of other diseases. Also, our estimates control for the effects on YLL of changes in a
country’s health system and macroeconomic conditions, to the extent that those effects don’t
vary across diseases, but those effects might vary across diseases.
       Premature (before age 85) mortality from a disease in a country is inversely related to the
number of drugs for that disease that were previously launched in that country, ceteris paribus.
One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85
YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before
year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%. The larger estimated effect of drugs
                                                                                                    18


launched 12 or more years before year t is not surprising, considering the gradual diffusion of
new drugs and the likelihood of a lag from utilization to mortality reduction.
        When lower YLL age thresholds are used, the estimates are qualitatively similar to, but
larger in magnitude than, the YLL85 estimates. One additional drug launch 0-11 years before
year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-55 YLL rate (YLL55) in year t by 4.3%, and one
additional drug launch 12 or more years before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL55 by
7.3%.
        Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are unrelated to the
number of drug classes previously launched.
        We used the estimates to calculate several important measures: (1) the number of life-
years saved (i.e., the reduction in years of life lost) before ages 85, 70, and 55 in 2013 by new
drugs launched after 1981; (2) pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in
2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; and (3) the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates attributable
to new drug launches.
        The estimates implied that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in
2013 would have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was. For a subset of 22 countries for
which complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available, we estimated that the
number of life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7
million. We also estimated that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before
age 70 and 44.9 million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013.
        The fraction of life-years saved by more recent drugs is slightly larger than their fraction
of drug volume, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the average quality of new drugs is
superior to the average quality of older drugs.
        We estimated that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013
by post-1981 drugs was $2837. This amount is about 8% of per capita GDP, so these estimates
indicate that the new drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall.
        Post-1981 drug launches were estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% between 2000
and 2013, which is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%. Similarly, the
estimated 2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) were larger
than the actual (24% and 28%) reductions. One possible explanation for the finding that the
estimated drug-launch-induced YLL declines were larger than the actual declines is that trends in
                                                                                                     19


other factors (e.g. diabetes and obesity prevalence) were increasing mortality. Another possible
explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover effects (e.g. cardiovascular
drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-reducing spillover effects
(e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce cardiovascular mortality). But even if the
number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the amount implied by our
estimates (which do not account for between-disease spillover effects), the evidence indicates
that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall.
       As several scholars have pointed out, the fact that an intervention is cost-effective does
not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.” Sendi and Briggs [43] argued that “decision-makers
are constrained by a fixed-budget and may not be able to fund new, more expensive
interventions, even if they have been shown to represent good value for money.” In response to
this limitation, those authors introduced the 'affordability curve' which reflects the probability
that a program is affordable for a wide range of threshold budgets. They argued that the joint
probability that an intervention is affordable and cost-effective is more useful for decision-
making since it captures both dimensions of the decision problem faced by those responsible for
health service budgets. In a similar vein, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health
Economics Resource Center argues that in addition to a cost-effectiveness analysis—which
evaluates whether an intervention provides value relative to an existing intervention (with value
defined as cost relative to health outcome)—it may be necessary to conduct a budget impact
analysis. That analysis estimates the financial consequences of adopting a new intervention, and
evaluates whether the high-value intervention is affordable.
       We estimated the impact on the 2013 pharmaceutical budget—$421.8 billion—as well as
the average cost-effectiveness of the drugs that were launched since 1982. Presumably,
decision-makers considered those drugs to be “affordable.” However, as shown in Figure 1,
many potential drug launches did not occur, perhaps because decision-makers did not consider
those drugs to be both cost-effective and affordable.
