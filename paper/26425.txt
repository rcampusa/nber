                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate equilibrium impacts of federal policies such as free-college proposals, taking into
account that human capital production is cumulative and that state governments have resource
constraints. In the model, a state government cares about household welfare and aggregate
educational attainment. Realizing that household choices vary with its decisions, the government
chooses income tax rates, per-student expenditure levels on public K-12 and college education,
college tuition and the provision of other public goods, subject to its budget constraint. We
estimate the model using data from the U.S. Using counterfactual simulations, we find that free-
public-college policies, mandatory or subsidized, would decrease state expenditure on and hence
the quality of public education. More students would obtain college degrees due to increased
enrollment. Over 86% of all households would lose while about 60% of the lowest income
quintile would gain from such policies.

        A BSTRACT. We investigate equilibrium impacts of federal policies such as free-college pro-
        posals, taking into account that human capital production is cumulative and that state gov-
        ernments have resource constraints. In the model, a state government cares about household
        welfare and aggregate educational attainment. Realizing that household choices vary with its
        decisions, the government chooses income tax rates, per-student expenditure levels on public
        K-12 and college education, college tuition and the provision of other public goods, subject
        to its budget constraint. We estimate the model using data from the U.S. Using counter-
        factual simulations, we find that free-public-college policies, mandatory or subsidized, would
        decrease state expenditure on and hence the quality of public education. More students would
        obtain college degrees due to increased enrollment. Over 86% of all households would lose
        while about 60% of the lowest income quintile would gain from such policies.

    As one of the most important determinants of one's lifetime income, college education
has attracted much policy interest, largely centered around accessibility. For example, the
Obama administration proposed free tuition in two-year public colleges; Senator Bernie
Sanders has proposed free tuition in all public colleges in his 2016 and 2020 presidential
campaigns. Directly, policies of this sort would improve opportunities for disadvantaged
college-bound individuals. However, to assess these policies, one needs to go beyond their
direct effects and account for at least two factors. First, human capital production is a
cumulative process, where later achievements rely on investments made in the past.1 As

such, if pre-college investment by households and/or government does not increase for dis-
advantaged students, free college education alone may not help them effectively.2 Second,
without revenues from college tuition, the government may have fewer resources to invest
in the public education system: K-12 and/or college. After all, how free can "free" colleges
be?
    We develop and estimate an equilibrium model that incorporates the factors mentioned
above in a coherent framework. In the model, educational outcomes depend on student
characteristics (including past achievement) and monetary inputs, i.e., tuition in the pri-
vate sector and government expenditure in the public sector, via technologies that may
differ across the two sectors. Agents in the model include a government and a distribution
of households. The government cares about a weighted average of household welfare (with
welfare weights that may differ across household groups) and may also care about aggre-
gate educational attainment. It makes decisions on income tax rates, per-student expendi-
ture levels on public K-12 and college education, college tuition and the provision of other
public goods, subject to a budget constraint. Households care about consumption, their
children's education and the burden of college loans. Taking as given the government's de-
cision, households make sequential choices between private and public K-12 schools, then
between the options of no college, two-year colleges, four-year public colleges and four-year
private colleges, and on how much student loan debt to take on. Realizing that household
choices and hence equilibrium outcomes vary with its decisions, the government chooses
the policy that maximizes its objective.
    Although the essence of the model and its main policy implications apply to any public
education system, the U.S. is a particularly interesting case. Public expenditure on educa-
tion in the U.S. is largely controlled at the state level, with significant cross-state variation
in education outcomes and in the proportions of revenues allocated to lower and higher
education. We treat each state in the U.S. as a single economy in our empirical application.
States differ observably in their (non-tax) revenues and distributions of households, and
2
 The parallel argument also holds: if households increase investment in their children's pre-college education
in expectation of easier college access, the impact of free tuition policies can be enhanced.

unobservably in how productive their public education systems are, which jointly lead to
different government policies and equilibrium outcomes. We use data from the Education
Longitudinal Study, the American Community Survey, and the Survey of Governments to
estimate the model via indirect inference. In particular, we estimate structural parameters
that are essential information for assessing counterfactual education policies, including pa-
rameters governing educational production technologies, household preferences, and state
government objectives.
  We use our estimated model to evaluate two sets of counterfactual free-college policies.
The first set mandates that state governments charge zero tuition in public colleges. In
response, state governments increase tax rates and decrease per-student expenditure on
both K-12 and college education. College enrollment increases but the graduation rate
decreases from 62% to 58% in public 4-year colleges; the net effect is a small increase in
the fraction of students with a 2-year or 4-year college degree. The welfare effect of this
policy is unevenly distributed: 60% of households in the lowest income quintile would gain,
but most households in other income groups would lose. Overall, 86% of households lose
from the free-college intervention.
  In the second (perhaps more realistic) counterfactual scenario, each state government
chooses whether or not to make their colleges free, in exchange for a subsidy from the
federal government: the subsidy per enrollee amounts to a certain fraction of the state's
baseline college tuition. The federal subsidy nationwide is funded via a proportional in-
crease in federal income taxes. The total subsidy is an equilibrium outcome that depends
on how many state governments take the subsidy, how they change their own policies and
how many students attend public colleges in these states. State and household responses
in turn depend on the subsidy rate and the federal tax surcharge. At different federal
subsidy rates, we solve for the budget-balancing federal tax surcharge and trace the rate
at which states take up the offer, and also the changes in educational outcomes and social
welfare. We find that a 10% subsidy rate would induce 12% of states to comply, while all
states would comply at a 30% subsidy rate. In general, subsidized free college policies lead
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                          4

to less disturbance in state policies. The welfare effects are similar to those in the manda-
tory case: fewer than 14% of households would win, and winners are concentrated among
the lowest income group.
  Our paper relates to several literatures. The first literature studies the effects of cross-
state college tuition differences, as summarized in Kane (2006, 2007). A major challenge
in these studies is that the variation in tuition levels across states is not random, and
that omitted variables may be correlated with both tuition and education outcomes. One
approach to tackle this issue has been to use large changes in the net cost of college at-
tendance induced by interventions such as the introduction of the Georgia Hope Schol-
arship (Dynarski (2000)), the elimination of college subsidies for children of disabled or
deceased parents (Dynarski (2003)), and the introduction of the D.C. Tuition Assistance
Grant program (Kane (2007)). Using variation in exposure to state budget shocks, Deming
and Walters (2017) find large impacts of spending on enrollment and degree completion,
with limited impacts of tuition changes. Using a structural model of joint migration and
college enrollment decisions, Kennan (2015) finds substantial evidence that both tuition
and spending affect enrollment (although the spending result is found only for two-year
colleges). Murphy et al. (2017) study the shift of the English higher education system from
a free college system to one with high tuition fees, and find that the shift has resulted in
increased funding per head, rising enrollments, and a narrowing of the participation gap
between advantaged and disadvantaged students.
  There is a relatively small recent literature examining education policies while taking
into account the dynamic complementarity of human capital investments as highlighted in
works such as Cunha and Heckman (2007). For example, Caucutt and Lochner (forthcom-
ing) develop a dynastic model of household investment in children to study the importance
of borrowing constraints and uninsured labor market risk. Using the calibrated model,
they explore the effects of policies targeted at different ages. Abbott et al. (forthcoming) ex-
amine the equilibrium effects of college financial aid policies in an overlapping generations
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                       5

life cycle model and find significant crowd-out of parental transfers by government pro-
grams. Also using an overlapping generations life cycle model, Becker et al. (2019) study
the interplay of taxation and education subsidy policies. Our paper well complements these
studies. While they focus on household responses to given policies, we are more interested
in how state policies are chosen in response to federal policies. As such, we embed a simpler
and more stylized household decision model in an equilibrium framework with endogenous
government policies.
  The role of government in education has been studied for a long time (e.g., Friedman
(1955)). Hanushek (2002) reviews more recent work and provides an evaluation of vari-
ous controversial aspects including issues of causality, consumer behavior, and estimation
approaches. Although abstracting from some important details, such as those involving
political economy considerations, our paper takes a step forward in addressing these is-
sues. We explicitly model dynamic choices by households, the cumulative nature of human
capital production, and state governments' endogenous decisions on educational expendi-
ture and tuition. While our work focuses on government decisions at the state level, other
studies (e.g., Epple and Sieg (1999), Epple and Romano (2003), Ferreyra (2007) and Epple
and Ferreyra (2008)) have explored heterogenous impacts of school finance reforms across
local areas within a state.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3
explains our estimation strategy. Section 4 describes the data and our auxiliary models.
Section 5 shows the estimation results. Section 6 analyzes the counterfactual experiments.
Section 7 concludes. Additional details and tables are in the appendix.

  There are S states, each treated in isolation. State s is characterized by a state-specific
distribution Fs (x) of households with characteristics x (household income, education of the
adult(s), and race), state-level observable variables zs and unobservable productivity vector

s = (s1 , s2 ) for public K-12 (s1 ) and public college education (s2 ). In the following, we
suppress the state and individual subscripts s and i. Time is discrete, with three periods.

      · Period 0: the government chooses its policy  = (, t, t, e1 , e2 , g ) : an income tax
        rate , tuition for public 2-year college (t) and public 4-year college (t), per-student
        expenditure levels for public K-12 education (e1 ) and public college education (e2 ),
        and per-capita expenditure on other public goods (g ).
      · Period 1: with probability q (x), a household with x will have a child, in which case
        they choose whether or not they would use private K-12 education, denoted as o1 
        {0, 1}.3
      · Period 2: K-12 educational outcomes are realized; households with children make
        decisions on children's higher education (o2 ) and college debt (d) , where o2  {0, 1, 2, 3} ,
        corresponding to {no college, 2-year college, 4-year public college, 4-year private col-
        lege}.4

2.1. Technology. There is a finite number of possible outcomes at each educational stage;
these are stage-specific stochastic functions of inputs, via technologies that may differ be-
tween the public and the private sectors. All children are exposed to K-12 education, and
the outcome is denoted as k1  {1, .., 5}, with k1 = 1 indicating a dropout and k1 = 5 being
the highest quartile of achievement (as measured by math test scores). College enrollment
is optional, and the outcome is denoted as k2  {0, 1, 2} (no college degree, 2-year degree,
4-year degree).

2.1.1. K-12 Education. A child can attend the public school for free; the outcome depends
on the state and household characteristics z, 1 and x, as well as the per-pupil government
expenditure e1 . A household can also pay p1 for the child to attend private school, where
3
  Here, we present a simplified model, where a household makes one choice for the entire K-12 education.
In the full model that we apply to the data, one choice is made for elementary education and another for
secondary education.

  In the empirical analysis, students choosing out-of-state public colleges are treated as if they had chosen a
private college. We further assume that tuition paid by out-of-state students at public colleges is equal to
the amount spent on them, with zero net impact on a state government budget. This assumption, although
not ideal, allows us to avoid having to model inter-state-government strategic interactions. See further
discussion in Section 2.5.

the outcome depends on p1 , x and z. A child's K-12 outcome (k1 ) follows a sector-specific
ordered-logit function
                                     
                                      L0 (x, z, e1 , 1 )     if o1 = 0

2.1.2. College Education. Educational outcomes in public colleges depend on x, z, 2 , K-
12 achievement (k1 ), and the per-student government expenditure on higher education e2 .
Within the state public college system, a student can choose either a 2-year college with
gross tuition t, or a 4-year college with gross tuition t. Educational outcomes in the private
(4-year) college depend on x, k1 and tuition p2 .5 The outcome is deterministic with k2 = 0 (no
college) for high school dropouts (k1 = 1) or those who choose not to attend college (o2 = 0).
Otherwise, the outcome (whether or not one obtains a degree) follows a sector-specific logit
function
                               
                                L1 (k , x, z, e2 , 2 )     if o2 = 1, k1 > 1

2.1.3. Unobserved Productivity Differences. We model s                       1, 1 × 2, 2      as a draw
from a distribution that depends on population characteristics in the state (Xs ), given by


(2.3)             Pr (s1 =  1 | Fs (x)) = L 1   1
                                            0 + 1 X s


            Pr (s2 =  2 | Xs , 1 = 1 ) = L 2   2
                                           0 + 1 Xs + 2


            Pr s2 =  2 | Xs , 1 = 1       = L 2   2
                                              0 + 1 X s - 2

                                  E (1 ) = E (2 ) = 0, V ar (1 ) =  1
                                                                      , V ar (2 ) =  2




where L is the logistic function. The distribution of s is governed by parameters (, 1 , 2 ) .
The parameters n
               1 capture the correlation between a state's educational productivity at

5
 We abstract from private 2-year colleges and model all 2-year colleges as in state and public. Focusing
on cross-state heterogeneity in the public sector, we assume a common (average) private 4-year college for
students in all states.
                   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                   8

level n with state observables; 2 allows for correlation between  's at different education
levels conditional on observables. In the estimated model, Xs in (2.3) is the fraction of
college-educated adults in the state.6

Remark. Two aspects of the production technology deserve comment. First, we allow for
unobservable state factors  in the public education production but not in the private edu-
cation sector, because our data are not rich enough and our focus is on the heterogeneity of
public education across states. Second, households within each x group are assumed to be
homogeneous up to random shocks. Household unobservable heterogeneity (e.g., unobserv-
able ability) has been the focus of a large literature on household educational choices. We
have a different goal of studying the equilibrium impact of federal policies across states
and groups of households. In this setting, household-level unobservables are not essen-
tial, because as long as the distribution of household unobservables conditional on x is
common across states, cross-state variation will still be driven by differences in Fs (x) and
other state-level factors. In contrast, state-level unobservables, such as s , are important
confounding factors to account for in studying effects of state policies.



2.2. Household Problem. Given government policy  , the problem for households with
children can be solved backwards.




2.2.1. Decision 2: College Education. Let x1 be household income, and let A (C, x, k1 ) be
financial aid, which is a function of college cost (C ), household characteristics x and K-
12 achievement (k1 ). Let v (x, k1 , k2 , d) be the terminal value as a function of household
characteristics, educational outcomes (k1 , k2 ) and debt level d. A household's problem at

 We have estimated a more complicated specification of (2.3) that includes additionally state average income.
However, it adds little to improve the fit, so we chose the simpler specification.

the college stage is

                         k2 follows (2.2) .


Households derive utility from consumption, other government expenditure (g ) and college
enrollment (which varies by college type). Households with different characteristics may
value the last two components differently relative to consumption, hence the preference
parameter vectors  and 2n are allowed to vary with x. We also allow household preference
for g to vary with state observables z. The expectation of v (·) is taken over the realization
of k2 . Each college choice o2 is associated with an i.i.d. payoff shock                        2   (o2 ), drawn from the
Type-1 extreme value distribution. The first constraint lays out the household's budget,
where C is the cost of college, depending on household choices, and y (, 0 , x1 ) is after-tax
income, with 0 being the exogenous federal tax and  being the endogenous state tax. The
constraint on d means that is a loan that is available only for college students. Denote the
optimal choice as (o                          
                    2 (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  ) , d (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  )).


2.2.2. Decision 1: K-12. At the K-12 level, the household's problem is


  V1 (x, 1 ; , z,  ) = max {ln (c1 ) +  (x, z ) ln (g ) + 1 (x) o1 +  EV2 (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  ) +                 1   (o1 )}
                        o1 {0,1}


                 s.t. c1 + p1 o1 = y (, 0 , x1 ) ,

                    k1 follows (2.1) ,


where preference for private relative to public schools may depend on x. Each choice is
associated with an i.i.d. Type-I extreme value payoff shock                          1   (o1 ). The expectation of V2 (·)
is taken over (k1 , 2 ) . Denote the optimal choice as o1 (x, 1 ; , z,  ) .

2.2.3. Households without Children. Households without children do not make decisions
in this model. The value function is given by


                 V 0 (x;  ) = (1 +  ) ln (y (, 0 , x1 )) +  (x, z ) ln (g ) +  2 v (x, 0, 0, 0) .

2.2.4. Aggregate Choices. Given government policy, enrollment in public K-12 education
(N1 ) , enrollments in 2-year (N2l ) and 4-year public colleges (N2h ) are given by

        N1 =     q (x) I (o1 (x,    1 ; , z,  )   = 0) dF (x,   1) ,

                                                                                                               
                                                                            Pr (k1 |x, o1 ) ×
(2.4)   N2l =    q (x)              I (o1 (·) = o1 )
                                                                                                                dF (x,   1) ,
                         o1 {0,1}                      k1       I (o2 (x, k1 ,   2 ; , z,  ) = 1) dF ( 2 )
                                                                                                               
                                                                            Pr (k1 |x, o1 ) ×
        N2h =    q (x)              I (o1 (·) = o1 )
                                                                                                                dF (x,   1) .
                         o1 {0,1}                      k1       I   (o2 (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  )   = 2) dF ( 2 )

N1 is the sum of households who have children (with probability q (x)) and choose o1 (·) = 0.

To calculate N2l , we start with the inner integral over I (o2 (·) = 1), which gives the measure

of students attending 2-year public colleges given (x, k1 ) . This measure is integrated over
the probability of obtaining k1 conditional on household x and K-12 choice o1 (governed by
(2.1)), which is in turn integrated over household choices of o1 . Finally, the outermost inte-
gral aggregates over the distribution of households. N2h is calculated in the same manner.




2.3. Government Problem. A government cares about a weighted average of household
expected welfare and may also directly care about aggregate educational attainment.7 Let
 be the discrete set of policy options,8 including the zero tuition option. The government




7
  Notice that public education provides an option value to all households in expectation, regardless of whether
or not they end up using it ex post.
8
  The appendix contains details of these options.
                      GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                 11

solves the following problem


(2.5)  = max               (x) q (x) EV1 (x, 1 ; , z,  ) + (1 - q (x)) V 0 (x;  ) dF (x) + W (N2 , K2 )
                 


        s.t. z1 +     (x1 ) dF (x) + N2l t + N2h t = e1 N1 + e2 (N2l + N2h ) + g,

            Aggregate choices: (2.4),


where  (x) is the welfare weight given to households with characteristics x. This weight is
applied to the average welfare of households with and without children. The government's
direct preference for aggregate educational outcomes is captured by W (·). The government
faces a budget constraint, where the revenue consists of an exogenous part (z1  z ) , and
endogenous parts, i.e., state income tax and tuition at public colleges. The revenue is used
to fund public K-12 and college education, as well as other public goods (g ).9The second
constraint requires that aggregate enrollment and education outcomes are consistent with
household choices and production technology. A government's optimal choice is denoted by
  (F (x) , z,  ) .
     To reduce the size of the government choice set, we assume the following structure for
the income tax schedule
                                                (x1 ) =  R ·  b (x1 ),

where  b (x1 ) is the common base schedule, estimated using NBER TAXSIM. We assume
that each state chooses its own  R but not  b (x1 ) .


Remark. Instead of a political economy framework, we model a state government as a
maximizer that cares about various factors. We estimate the parameters governing  (x)
and W (·) from the data, without specifying the underlying forces. For example, W (·) may
reflect possible spillover effects of education that individual households do not internalize;
it may also come from a government's political concerns.


2.4. Equilibrium. We define an equilibrium as follows
9
    The parameter  is set at 0.5, to account for the different lengths of 2-year versus 4-year education.
                  GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                 12

Definition (Equilibrium). An equilibrium is a tuple {o                         
                                                      1 (·) , o2 (·) , d (·) ,  (·)} such that

1. Given (, z,  ) , o                                                                 
                     1 (x, 1 ; , z,  ) is an optimal K-12 choice for every (x, 1 ) , o2 (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  ) and

d (x, k1 , 2 ; , z,  ) are optimal college and loan choices for every (x, k1 , 2 ) .
2. Given (F (x) , z,  ),   (F (x) , z,  ) solves the government problem (2.5).


2.5. Discussion. Some aspects of the model deserve further discussion. First, we treat
each state in isolation and government decisions as being static. Related to the former,
a household's choice depends on the equilibrium quality of public education in its home
state but not on the quality of public education in other states; we also abstract from
migration and treat the distribution of households Fs (x) as policy-invariant.10 We thereby
avoid having to model strategic interactions among state governments. Similarly, viewing
government decisions as static abstracts from complications such as time consistency and
commitment issues in dynamic policy-making settings. Extensions in either dimension
would require a more complicated equilibrium model, which we leave for future work.
     Second, we model public investments in both K-12 and college education as being de-
termined at the state level, abstracting from within-state variation in K-12 educational
funding. We make this choice for both tractability and data reasons.11 The current model
nevertheless captures the essential message of this paper: to design an effective educa-
tional policy, regardless of the level at which it is determined, one needs to recognize that
human capital development is a cumulative process and that resources are to be allocated
across different public goods, including different educational stages.
     Third, we model household investment as choices between different types of schools and
colleges, while abstracting from more detailed choices, such as investment in terms of
parental time, books and tutoring services. Incorporating these choices to the model would
make the predication in our counterfactual policy analysis more precise, but it would re-
quire much richer data.

10
  Thus our counterfactual policy impacts are best interpreted as short-run impacts.
11
  Otherwise we would need to model the interaction across local governments and we would need local-level
data on government expenditure, household characteristics, choices and outcomes.
                   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                  13

                                     3. E STIMATION S TRATEGY

     We estimate parameters governing the college financial aid function A (C, x, k1 ) outside of
the model. All the other model parameters () are estimated via indirect inference, which
consists of two steps. The first step estimates a set of "auxiliary models" that summa-
rize the patterns in the data to be targeted for the structural estimation. The second step
involves repeatedly simulating data with the structural model, computing corresponding
auxiliary models using the simulated data, and searching for the model parameters that
cause the auxiliary model estimates computed from the simulated data and from the true
data to match as closely as possible. Let  denote our chosen set of auxiliary model param-
eters computed from data. Let  () denote the corresponding auxiliary model parameters
obtained by simulating datasets from the model (parameterized by a particular vector )
and computing the same estimators. The structural parameter estimator then solves


                               = argmin  () -  W  () -  ,


where W is a weighting matrix. We obtain standard errors for  () by numerically com-
          
puting    
             and applying the delta method to the variance-covariance matrix of  .

3.1. Identification. We discuss identification of the three categories of parameters in our
model, governing household preferences, education production technologies and the gov-
ernment objective. First, as in other discrete choice models, the observed distribution of
household choices conditional on x identifies the relative value of each option for these
households. The option-specific value is a combination of the value households attach
to achievement and direct tastes for enrollment in different types of schools. Two as-
sumptions allow us to separate these elements: (A1) conditional on x, the distribution
of household preferences is common across states, (A2) there are no unobserved ability
differences across households.12 Given A2, the expected achievement gap between private
and public schools for given x within each state is observed. Given A1, for households
12
  These assumptions are strong, yet as discussed in the model section, within-x variation is not the focus of
the paper.
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                        14

with characteristics x, the cross-state covariation of public-private achievement gaps and
household choices identifies how much the households value achievement. The remaining
unexplained part of household choices arises from direct preferences over different types
of schools. The dispersion of taste shocks is identified from the sensitivity of school choice
to tuition levels, given that utility is measured as the log of household consumption.
  Identification of the education production technology needs to tackle a standard endo-
geneity problem: education productivity (s ) affects government investment in education
but is unobserved. Other factors affecting expenditure policies include state-level observ-
ables zs and the distribution of households Fs (x) . We allow s to be correlated with some
but not all of these factors: specifically, we exclude state racial composition and the gov-
ernment's outside revenue from the s distribution. These excluded variables then serve
as model-consistent instruments for education expenditure. Thus regressions of educa-
tion outcomes on x and instrumented expenditure identify the productivity of these inputs.
Contrasting the expenditure effect with state fixed-effect regressions informs us of the dis-
tribution and importance of s .
  Finally, to identify the government objective function, notice that a government faces
essentially a discrete choice problem. The value of choice  is essentially given by


(3.1)               x Fs (x) V (x, , s ) + x g (, z1s ) +    Fs (x) K (, x, s ).


Given parameters governing household preference and education technologies, including
the unobserved productivity distribution, the three underlined components in (3.1) are
known functions of . That is, (3.1) is known up to parameters x , x , , the identification
of which follows the usual argument in identifying discrete choice models. However, with
one state being an observation, the limited sample size restricts the flexibility in our speci-
fication. For this reason, we have assumed that x and x varies only with income, instead
of all dimensions of x. These identification arguments guide our choice of auxiliary models,
which are described in the next section.
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                      15

                             4. D ATA   AND   AUXILIARY M ODELS

  For our empirical analysis, we combine information from the Education Longitudinal
Study (ELS) of 2002, the American Community Survey (ACS) of 2002, the Census of Popu-
lation (CP) of 2000, the Census of Governments (CG) of 2002, and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES).
  ELS interviewed 15,244 individuals from a representative sample of 10th-graders in
2002, with follow-ups in 2004, 2006, and 2012. It provides a wide range of information
on household characteristics, education choices and outcomes at high school and college
levels. We use the base-year (2002) interview data to determine household income and
other characteristics (x), as well as high school choices (private vs public). We measure
K-12 achievement k1 by the standardized math test score in 2004 and the eventual high
school dropout status. We use the college attendance history in 2006 and 2012 interviews
to determine college choice o2 , the outstanding college loan level in 2006 to measure d, and
degree completion status in 2012 for the college outcome k2 . ELS also contains adminis-
trative Pell grant information, which we use along with self-reported aid information to
estimate the college financial aid function A (·).
  Since primary school choice information is not available in ELS, we use primary school
students in ACS to measure the private primary school attendance rate given state s and
household characteristics x. We also use pairs of siblings at different stages of K-12 (pri-
mary vs high school) in ACS to get private high school attendance rates conditional on
primary school choices.
  Our sample from CP consists of households with women aged 35-40 (regardless of mari-
tal status) and those with single men aged 37-42. The age range of women is chosen such
that the binary fertility outcome in our model is likely to have been realized for the house-
hold, with the child still living in the household (and thus observable in CP). The age range
of single men is chosen such that they were in approximately the same marriage market as
the women, so that the sample is expected to represent one cohort of households. We use
this sample to estimate the state-specific demographic distribution Fs (x) and the fertility
                  GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                  16

rate qs (x). Combined with ELS and ACS, this allows us to obtain state-level household
choices and outcomes. We also combine this sample with the NBER TAXSIM program to
estimate the federal tax income schedule  0 (·) and the baseline state tax schedule  b (·).
     From NCES, we obtain information on private college tuition, state-specific public college
tuition and region-specific private K-12 tuition.13 Data counterparts are still needed for
state-specific non-tax revenue, tax rate, K-12 expenditure, college expenditure and other
expenditure, which we obtain from CG. We use the combined budgets of state and local
governments of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. For each state in the sample, we construct
per-household measures of state and local government revenues from taxes, educational
institutions, and other sources (i.e., z1 ); and net expenditure on K-12 and colleges. Other
public expenditure is then defined as the difference between total revenue and total edu-
cation expenditure. The appendix contains details of the data construction.



4.1. Empirical Definitions of Model Variables. The components of the household char-
acteristics vector x include income quintile, minority status, and whether or not any adult
in the household went to college.14 State observables z include state state non-tax revenue
(z1 ) and a dummy for the Northeast Census Region.15
     We consider the discrete probability distribution over households' education choices and
outcomes, as well as the amount of college loans. Choices include public or private schools
at the primary and secondary levels, 2-year or 4-year public or 4-year private at the tertiary
level, as well as college loans. K-12 outcomes fall into 5 levels: the lowest level corresponds
to high school dropouts, and the higher levels correspond to quartiles of the 12-th grade
math score distribution. College outcomes are graduation or not conditional on the type of
colleges attended.


13
   NCES does not provide reliable state-specific private K-12 tuition information due to small sample sizes.
We assume a common private K-12 tuition within each region.
14
   Within each income quintile, household income is assumed to equal to the within-quintile median.
15
   We include a region dummy in household preference for private colleges to absorb some possible regional
differences in the distribution of private colleges.
                   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                       17

     Government choices s to be matched include 5 variables: per-household tax revenue (in
logs), government expenditure on K-12 and on college; and 2-year and 4-year public college
tuition levels.

4.2. Auxiliary Models. We target the following auxiliary models, guided by our identifi-
cation argument.

      (1) At the household level, we match coefficients from regressions of choices and out-
         comes on household characteristics xis and other relevant observables wis .
          (a) For primary school choice and high school choice, we use linear probability re-
              gressions, where wis consists of log per-household K-12 expenditure and private
              tuition.
          (b) For loans taken by students attending each type of college, we use OLS regres-
              sions, where wis is college tuition net of financial aid.
          (c) For college choice, we use a multinomial logit regression with the latent utility
              being              
                                 
                                    u0is =
                                 
                                             0is
                                 
                                 
                                 ujis = wjis + xis j +
                                 
                                                                jis   j = 1, 2, 3

              where wjis is the net tuition for each college option j , xis consists of household
              characteristics, high school outcome dummies, a private high school dummy, log
              per-household college expenditure and a Northeast state dummy.16
          (d) We map the five K-12 outcome categories to numerical scores, where we use
              the within-category median score as the test score for all students in the same
              outcome group.17 We treat these scores as the dependent variable in an OLS
16
  We use the derivatives of the log likelihood as targets instead of the coefficient vector  = (, 1 , 2 , 3 ) to
reduce computational time. In particular, let pj (x, w; ^) be the choice probability evaluated at the    ^ coeffi-
cient estimated using the actual data. We match E                                           ^
                                                                wjis djis - pj (xis , wis ; ) and the regression
                                                          j =1,2,3

coefficients of djis - pj (xis , wis ; ^) on xis between the actual data and the model. These auxiliary statistics
are zero in the data due to the first order conditions of the multinomial logit.
17
  The structural production function is ordered logit and logit for K12 and college outcomes, respectively.
To summarize the data, we use linear regressions in auxiliary models, because IV and fixed effect analyses
are better suited in a linear setting and linear regressions are computationally more economical. See the
appendix for the detailed mapping between ordinal and cardinal outcomes in these auxiliary models.
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                         18

           regression, where wis is log of per-household K-12 expenditure for public schools
           and private tuition for private schools.
       (e) For graduation among students attending each type of college, we use linear
           probability regressions, where wis includes high school outcome dummies, a pri-
           vate high school dummy, and in the case of public colleges, wis also includes log
           per-household college expenditure.
        (f) We also run IV variants of the regressions in 1 (d) and 1 (e) , in which log per-
           household expenditure ln (e) is replaced by its projection on the minority frac-
           tion and government extraneous revenue. We target coefficients associated with
           the instrumented ln (e).
   (2) To identify the distribution of education productivity levels (s1 , s2 ) as specified in
      (2.3), we run state fixed effect variants of the regressions in 1 (d) and 1 (e) and target
      the standard deviations of state fixed effects at both education levels, covariance of
      the two fixed effects, the fraction of each fixed effect above its mean, and regression
      coefficients of each of the two fixed effects on the fraction of college-educated adults.
   (3) We run OLS regressions of government policy choices s on state-level observables,
      and we treat the regression coefficients from these regressions and the cross-state
      variance of  as targets to be matched. The regressors in each case include the mean
      and standard deviation of log income across households, the fraction of households
      with college-educated adults, the fraction of minority households, log-revenue from
      extraneous sources, and a Northeast dummy.




4.3. Summary Statistics. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of choices and outcomes
by household characteristics. Students from lower-educated, minority and low-income
households are less likely to attend private high schools and 4-year colleges (especially
4-year private), but are more likely to attend 2-year colleges. Cross-group differences in

the highest income group and 46% for the lowest income group.
  Table 2 summarizes state government policies. The greatest disparity across states is in
the fraction of expenditure on college education and college tuition levels. The rightmost
columns show coefficients from regressions of each of the policy variables on the 6 state-
level characteristics (Auxiliary Model 3). Controlling for other factors, K-12 expenditure
fraction, college tuition levels are positively correlated with average household income and
negatively correlated with income dispersion, while tax revenue per household is positively
correlated with both the mean and the dispersion of household income.

5.1. Parameter Estimates. We present estimates of selected parameters in Table 3 (with
more detail in the appendix); standard errors are shown in parentheses. Panels A and B
show the estimated education production parameters associated with expenditure, school
type and previous achievement. There are two noticeable observations. First, all else
equal, the effect of government educational expenditure (e) is slightly higher for higher in-
come groups at both K-12 and 4-year college levels. For 2-year college outcomes, public ex-
penditure is effective only for the lower income group. Second, high school test scores con-
tribute positively to college graduation probabilities.18 Enrollment in private high schools
also has a direct positive effect on college outcomes.
18
  High school outcome is ordinal, but to save on parameters, we use the median test score within each
quartile as inputs in the college production function.

  Panel C shows the estimated parameters for the educational productivity distribution.
The fraction of college-educated adults is positively correlated with a state's (unobserved)
college productivity, but not directly with its K-12 productivity. The two productivity levels
are positively correlated. Given these estimates, we report the support of the productivity
distribution (the mean is normalized to zero), and the joint distribution Pr (s1 , s2 ) across
the 48 states in our sample; we find that 37% of states have low productivity at both K-12
and college levels (and 29% have high productivity at both K-12 levels)
  Panel D reports parameter estimates of the government's objective function. The welfare
weights are strongly tilted in favor of the higher income groups. In addition to household
welfare, government directly cares about aggregate education outcomes, which is necessary
to rationalize the observed government policies.


5.2. Model Fit. Table 4 shows model fit results for household choices and outcomes. The
first two columns of Table 5 show the fit for the mean and standard deviation of each
of the government policy variables, while the other columns show the fit of the auxiliary
regression models. In these tables, asterisks indicate predictions that are outside the 95%
confidence interval for the corresponding statistic in the data. With a few exceptions, the
equilibrium model predictions closely match the data.

                                 6. C OUNTERFACTUAL E XPERIMENTS

     We use the estimated model to evaluate equilibrium impacts of free public college poli-
cies, implemented in two different ways.19 In the first set of experiments, free public college
policies are mandatory; in the second, the federal government offers subsidies to induce
state governments to charge zero college tuition.


6.1. Free Public Colleges (Mandatory). Under a mandatory free-college policy, the
choice set of a state government is restricted to be c  , such that for all   c , t = 0,
and t is no greater than the baseline 4-year college tuition if 2-year colleges are required to
be free, and t = t = 0 if all public colleges are required to be free. Table 6 shows the policy
impacts. The state government decreases per-student expenditure at both levels of educa-
tion, and increases tax rates. While state taxes are increased proportionally for all income
groups, we illustrate this change by showing the case for the middle income group only.
When 2-year tuition is free, in many cases the state government re-optimizes by reducing

19
  We treat parameters governing fertility and household terminal value functions as invariant to our counter-
factual policies. Thus our policy impacts are best interpreted as short-run rather than long-run equilibrium
impacts.

4-year college tuition, which helps to reduce enrollment shifts from 4-year public colleges
to free 2-year colleges.20
     Panel B of Table 6 shows the impact on the college enrollment rate, the graduation rate,
and the fraction of all students with a college degree. For example, when both 2-year
and 4-year public colleges are free, enrollment in 4-year public colleges increases, while
it decreases in private 4-year colleges.21 The graduation rate in public 4-year colleges
decreases from 62% to 58%.
     Panel C of Table 6 shows the fraction of households whose welfare is improved, across
all households and by income groups.22 Holding state policies fixed, any individual house-
hold would gain under zero-tuition policies, but these gains may vanish when the resource
constraint and the government's policy choices are taken into account. Indeed, our results
show that most households would lose from the free-tuition policy; the distribution of win-
ners is uneven across income groups, with nearly all of the winners in the lowest income

20
   This response is substantially more likely when unobserved educational productivity is high.
21
   In the text, we fix private college tuition at its baseline level. In the appendix, we allow private tuition to
adjust to maintain the baseline enrollment level. The results are similar.
22
   Household welfare is measured by the ex ante value before fertility is realized, i.e., q (x) EV1 (·) +
(1 - q (x)) V 0 (·) .

group. For example, when all public colleges are free, although the fraction of winners is
only 14% among all households it is 60% for the lowest income group.



6.2. Free Public Colleges (Subsidized). In this experiment, the free college policy is
voluntary, and complying states obtain a subsidy from the federal government. Such a
voluntary cost-sharing policy is similar in spirit to many other policies (e.g., the expansion
of Medicaid) and is perhaps more realistic. There are different ways to implement the sub-
sidy, one of which is to subsidize a fraction r of the original college tuition. To balance the
federal budget, we assume that the subsidy is funded via a federal tax surcharge with the
new tax rate 0 (x1 ) = (1 + ) 0 (x1 ),23 such that the increased federal income tax revenue
equals the total tuition subsidy S (, r) from the federal government to the states, i.e.,


                                 S (, r) =               (0 (x1 ) - 0 (x1 )) dFs (x)
                                                 s   x


     To calculate S (, r), we need to solve the state's problem first. Given the federal policy
(, r), the problem for state s is modified as

                                      v
                                      s (, r) = max {s () , s (, r)} ,


where the superscript v refers to voluntary. A state chooses between non-complying with
value s () and complying with value s (, r). Here s () is the optimal value from (2.5)
under the new federal income tax 0 (x1 ) = (1 + ) 0 (x1 ) . The value of complying is given
by

where t       
       s and ts are the original optimal tuition choices associated with (2.5) in the baseline.

Compared with (2.5), (6.1) requires that the policy be chosen from the constrained choice
set c with t = t = 0; in return, the state receives a total subsidy of r (t          
                                                                           s Ns2l + ts Ns2h ).

  The federal subsidy nationwide is therefore given by


                     S (, r) =          I (s () < s (, r)) r (t          
                                                               s Ns2l + ts Ns2h )
                                    s


which is an equilibrium outcome that depends on how many state governments take the
subsidy, how they change their own policies and how many students attend public colleges
in the new equilibrium in these states. State and household responses in turn depend on
the subsidy rate (r) and the federal tax surcharge (). Thus solving for  given r involves
a fixed point problem. At different subsidy rates r, we can trace the take-up rates and
changes in outcomes and welfare (solving for  to balance the federal budget). To illustrate,
we show the equilibrium effects of subsidizing at rates of r = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 under the
condition that both 2-year and 4-year public colleges are free in complying states.
  The first column of Table 7 shows the fraction of subsidy-taking states: at r = 0.1, only
12% of states would take the subsidy while all states would comply at r = 0.3. Using
the case of r = 0.1 as an example, the rest of Table 7 compares state-level characteris-
tics between complying and non-complying states. Complying states tend to have more
low-income households, who are more likely to benefit from the policy. More significantly,
complying states are much less likely to have high education productivity levels. Because
educational productivity and expenditure are complements in producing educational out-
comes, states with higher productivity are more reluctant to reduce tuition to zero, which
                      GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                                  26

may lead to less expenditure per student. Finally, complying states also tend to have higher
outside revenue, which acts as a buffer against the loss of tuition revenue.
     Panel A of Table 8 shows the equilibrium outcomes across all states in the baseline, in
each of the three subsidy cases, and in the mandatory policy case. In general, subsidized
free college policies lead to smaller changes in state policies. For example, comparing the
last two rows in Panel A, although public colleges are free in all states in both cases (since
all states comply when r = 0.3), state investment in public education is higher in the
subsidy case, leading to a slightly higher fraction of college graduates.

     Panel B of Table 8 reports the benefit and cost of each subsidy policy. We report welfare
effects for all households, and particularly for the lowest income quintile, who are most
likely to benefit from the policy.24 Households in all states are affected by the subsidized
free-tuition policy due to the federal tax surcharge, which implies a flow of resources from
non-complying to complying states. The first two columns show that the fraction of winners
increases with the subsidy rate but is always small. When all states comply, the fraction
of winners among all households is the same as it is under the mandatory free college
policy (13.7%). However, the benefit is even more concentrated among the lowest income
24
     For each of the other 4 income quintiles, the policy effect on average household welfare is negative.

groups, partly because higher income groups are more affected by the federal tax increase.
The next four columns show the change in welfare levels. In complying states, the overall
impact is negative, but welfare increases for the lowest income group.25. The last two
columns show the cost of subsidies measured in terms of dollars per household and the tax
surcharge ().
     To provide a better benefit-cost measure, we examine how household welfare would
change if the same amount of the additional federal tax revenue S (, r) were to be spent
in two alternative ways. Note that neither of the two alternatives should be considered
as competitors of the subsidized free college program; rather, they merely serve to mea-
sure the relative welfare impact of this program. Under Alternative 1, we allocate federal
money to mandated spending on other public goods (g ). This is a naive calculation since it
holds state policies fixed. Under Alternative 2, we allocate the federal money to states in
the form of increased outside revenue, and search for the new equilibrium where the state
government re-optimizes over its original policy space .26
     Table 9 shows the results. Given the same amount of federal money per household (as
shown in Panel B of Table 8), the (weakly) dominant alternative is mandated spending
on other public goods (with other government choices held fixed). When state government
responses are taken into account, an average household would rather spend the additional
federal tax revenue to increase a state's revenue than spend it to subsidize free public
college, while the lowest income group would have the opposite preference.


25
  In non-complying states, the welfare effect is of course negative for all households.
26
  To the extent that the additional federal tax burden increases with household income, this policy measures
the equilibrium effect of a re-distribution of resources from richer to poorer states.

                                           7. C ONCLUSION

     The idea of "free" public colleges is politically seductive. But of course a college education
can't actually be free ­ someone must pay for it. We develop a model that can be used to
systematically analyze some of the implications of this simple observation. We emphasize
that since education is a cumulative process, allocating additional resources to the college
stage may be self-defeating if this entails a reduction of public expenditure in the earlier
stages. As has been stressed by Cunha and Heckman (2007), this is not just a question
of the overall level of investment in public education, since investments at earlier stages
enhance the returns to later investments.
     Our analysis interprets data on government tuition and expenditure policies, household
enrollment choices, and educational achievement, as an equilibrium outcome of a Stack-
elberg game in which the government chooses an optimal policy, anticipating the best re-
sponses of households. We treat each state in isolation, and use the cross-state variation
in the data to estimate the underlying parameters governing household and government
preferences and educational technologies, and we then use the estimated model to predict
the consequences of free college policies introduced at the federal level. Our main finding
is that such policies would lead to lower per-student expenditure on K-12 and college edu-
cation, and thus lower welfare for a typical household. But we also find that these policies
tend to slightly benefit households in the lowest income group.
     Our framework and empirical findings are promising for future research, with several
important yet challenging extensions worth pursuing. The first is to allow for migration,
in which state governments best respond to each others' policy choices. This extension will
help us better understand the ripple effects of policies implemented in some but not all
states.27 The second extension is to fine tune the model to better fit the U.S. educational
system, where K-12 education is funded mainly via local property taxes. This extension
will better address issues such as cross-district inequality within a state, which, however,


27
 The state of New York recently launched the Excelsior Scholarship to make four-year colleges free for those
with annual family income lower than $125,000.
               GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                     29

requires local-level data on government expenditure, household characteristics and out-
comes. Finally, given the static nature of government choices, our model is best suited to
answer policy questions in the short run. A third extension would add dynamics into the
government problem to better answer long-run policy questions.

12 choice is denoted by o1 = (o1L , o1H ), a pair of indicators referring to primary school (o1L )
and high school (o1H ). Taking the typical durations of primary and high school education
into account, the utility from consumption during the K-12 stage is specified as
                   8                                              12

                  t=1                                             t=9


where  = 0.95 is the annual discount factor. The taste function for K-12 choice is given by

Private and high school stages are assumed to affect the final K-12 education outcome
proportionally to their durations.

A.2. College Education. We specify the utility from consumption during the college pe-
riod as
 
  4  t-1 ln (y (, 0 , x1 ))
 
                                                                                                                if o2 = 0
      t=1
 
      2    t-1                                                                4
      t=1      ln (y (, 0 , x1 ) + d + Ao2 (C, x, k1 ) - C ) +                t=3    t-1 ln (y (, 0 , x1 ))     if o2 = 1
 
  4  t-1 ln (y (,  , x ) + d + A (C, x, k ) - C )
 
                                                                                                                if o2  {2, 3}
      t=1               0    1          o2         1


We use the conditional mean of an estimated Tobit model as the aid function:


                     Ao2 (C, x, k1 ) = µA                A                A    A
                                        o2 (C, x, k1 )  µo2 (C, x, k1 ) + o2  µo2 (C, x, k1 ) .



  The taste for college education is given by


           2o2 (x, k1 , o1 , z ) = 1           2        3        4        5         6
                                   2o2 (x1 ) + 2o2 x2 + 2o2 x3 + 2o2 k1 + 2o2 o1H + 2o2 I (o2 = 3) z3 ,



where z3 is an indicator for states in the Northeast region, to reflect the fact that this
region is historically endowed with more private college options. The college outcome (k2 )
is generated from a logit model with the following latent outcome functions                                      2o2   with o2 
{1, 2, 3}.

A.3. Terminal Value. We assume that the terminal value function is additively separable
in debt, K-12 outcome and college outcome, such that


           v (x, k1 , k2 , d) = f (d, x1 ) + b1x1 k1 + b2x1 I (2-year degree) + b3x1 I (4-year degree) ,
                 GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                              33

where each of the bnx1 (n = 1, 2, 3) parameters takes two values, for lower and higher income
households respectively. The borrowing cost function is given by


         f (d, x1 ) = 1 (x1 ) ln (1 - 2 (x1 ) · Ro2 · (d + 3 max {0, d - (C - A (C, x, k1 ))})) .


Note that f (d, x1 ) = 0 if d = 0. The parameter 3 allows for an extra cost associated with
borrowing more than the net tuition (C - A (C, x, k1 )), which helps to fit the borrowing
statistics in the data. Ro2 is the ratio of the final outstanding debt to the annual borrowing
d, which is set to                     
                                           2

                               Ro2 =

The annual gross interest rate 1 + r is set to the inverse of the annual discount factor.

A.4. Preference for other public expenditures. We specify the household's preference
for other public expenditure g as  (x, z ) ln (g ) , where


                      (x, z ) = exp (0 (1 - I(x1 = 1)) + 1 I(x1 = 1) + 2 ln (z2 )) .


The preference for g among the lowest income group may differ from the other groups (for
example, low-income households are more likely to benefit from welfare programs). We
also allow a systematic correlation between federal transfer z2 (z2 is one part of z1 , z2  z1 )
and the "preference" for g, to allow for the possibility that federal transfers may reflect a
state's need to spend on public goods other than education. The exponential function is
used to guarantee non-negative preference for g.

A.5. Government Policies. In the tax schedule  (x1 ) =  R ·  b (x1 ), ln  b (x1 ) is given by
the income group fixed effects in a regression of log tax rate on state dummies and income
dummies from TAXSIM. The estimated income-specific  b (x1 ) values are 1.00, 1.15, 1.21,
1.26, and 1.35 for each x1  {1, . . . , 5}, with the lowest income group as the reference group.
  We set the space for state choices  =  R , e1 , e2 , t, t , with 7 × 8 × 8 × 7 × 8 = 25, 088 support
points. Along each dimension of the policy choices, the grid is wider than the support of
                GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM                        34

the observed policy distribution to allow for the possibility that government choices may
be out of the empirical range in counterfactual scenarios, and the grid points are assigned
to provide good coverage of the empirical distribution (see the online appendix).

  In conducting our counterfactual analyses, we have kept private college tuition fixed at
its baseline level. Although it is beyond this paper to predict how private colleges would
respond to free public college policies, as a robustness check on our counterfactual policy
experiment, we consider one arguably reasonable scenario: when all public colleges are
made free, private tuition adjusts such that the private college enrollment rate is main-
tained at its baseline level. We do so for the most extreme counterfactual experiments in
the main text, i.e., a mandatory zero tuition policy for all public colleges. We find that pri-
vate tuition would need to decrease by 7.1% to maintain the baseline level enrollment in
the new equilibrium, labeled as (P) in Table 10. State governments respond to the reduc-
tion in private tuition by cutting college expenditure even further, while increasing K-12
expenditure and reducing tax toward the baseline levels. The final fractions of college
graduates in the population are similar in these two cases. A higher fraction of households

would win under the free-college policy when private tuition adjusts, and now 76% of the
lowest income group benefits. However, overall, winners are still in the minority (28.6%).
