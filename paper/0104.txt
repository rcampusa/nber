      Human capitalists often find themselves confronted with the charge

that the human capital framework, although consistent with empirical results,

does not appropriately capture the true direction of causality. In partic-

ular, Spence (1972) has argued that education may simply provide a signal

to employers of the applicant's ability and may not actually increase the

individual's productivity) Although the signalling hypothesis has impli-

cations with respect to the social returns to education which differ from

those of the traditional human capital story, the implications for the

individual are essentially the same. Regardless of whether schooling is a

screen or a truly productive asset, it is still traditional for the individual

investor to acquire formal schooling up to the point where the present value

of additional education is equal to the cost of its acquisition. There is,

however, another motivation for the connection between schooling and wealth

which has implications at the level of the individual different from those

traditionally ascribed to human capital. Specifically, it can be claimed

that education is simply a normal consumption good and that like all other

normal goods, an increase in wealth will produce an increase in the amount

of schooling purchased. Increased incomes are associated with higher

schooling attainment as the simple result of an income effect. Bowles (1972),

for example, finds that 52% of the variation in levels of schooling can be

explained by family background variables. He argues that the exclusion of

these variables from earnings functions causes an upward bias in the estimated

returns to schooling.2 If this is so, schooling increases an individual's

wealth only by the consumption value of the good, since it is a non—saleable

asset. This paper will attempt to determine empirically the amount by

which an increase in wealth is caused by schooling as distinguished from

the amount by which the demand for schooling increases as the result of

an increase in wealth.

       The problem then is to estimate the amount of education that would

be acquired in the absence of its consumptive benefits.3 There are two

conceptual ways to do this; one can measure the difference between the total

amount of education acquired and that amount which would be acquired in

the absence of the wealth—increasing properties of education. The residual

can then be called the investment component. This approach, for one thing,

requires that all uses of education as a consumption good be known. A

considerable amount of research has been done on the use of education in

non—market activities. Michael (1973), for example, claims that more

educated individuals consume other commodities as if they have higher wealth.

Libebowitz (1974) finds that an increase in a mother's level of education

is associated with a higher measured IQ for her child. In the areas of the

family, Michael (1973a) has found that more educated individuals are better

contraceptors and are thus less likely to experience an unwanted birth.

Benham (1974) finds that an increase in a woman's education is associated

with higher earnings on the part of her spouse, given his education.

Education thus can have an impact on an individual's health as well. Williams

(1974) finds that a child's birthweight (which is generally positively related

to its chance of survival) is also positively associated with parental

education, given family income. Additional examples can be given, but the

point is clear —   education   affects many aspects of an individual's behavior

in addition to its impact on his earnings capacity. Yet it would be extremely


                                                                                  .
                                   3

difficult to attempt to estimate the total impact that education has on

one's ability to consume. Nor, as it turns out, would this assist us in

disentangling consumption from investment components of educatjon.

       There have also been attempts to establish the existence of an

education effect on worker productivity. Welch (1970, 1973) and Griliches

(1964, 1968), among others, have argued that education plays an important

role in the formation of and adaptation to technological change. An alter-

native approach is to treat the problem as one of finding the difference

between the wealth-maximizing and utility-maximizing levels of education.

In the model developed below, this is found to be a more conceptually

appropriate and empirically useful formulation of the problem.


A Model

       Let us start by defining the opportunity set of values of goods

consumed (including leisure), c, and education "consumed", Ec, by the

individual. An individual starts out with an endowment (X,E) = (Xe,O).

He may convert resources into education according to the following relation-

ship, E =   f(X)   where X is the amount of resources/he production

of schooling (measured in terms of grades completed). f(X) is assumed

to be monotonic, continuous, and differentiable throughout. If X is the

numeraire commodity, then the individual may "sell" a unit of education for

the present price, E goods, where "present" is defined as the date of

birth. The individual sells his education by working at jobs which pay

higher wages to more educated individuals. It is assumed that the selling

price of all units of schooling are the same.4 The individual then maxi—

mizes his wealth by producing education up to the point, E*, where
                                              4

      1   =   P
                  E
                      (since              is the      marginal   cost of producing a unit of
f'(X)                          f'(X)
education). This can           be   seen on Figure 1.

                                        FIgure 1

Education is plotted along the horizontal axis and goods are plotted on

the vertical axis. If the individual starts with an endowment at
                                                                                               .
he produces education by moving along the curve, f(X3. The individual's

ex post measured wealth position is given by the intersection of the line

through G (with slope =                   with the vertical axis. Thus, if the
                                                          c
individual maximizes his measured wealth, he can consume x * goods.

However, he also consumes E* of education because the "sale" of education

does not preclude the simultaneous use of education in consumption. The

amount of education produced and sold equals the amount consumed so that

Ec = E.5      If the individual were to produce E0 education, his opportunity

to purchase goods would be given by X0 and his consumption of education

would equal E0 so that he would end up at point B. It is clear that Q

is superior to B and all other points along e as long as both X and
                                     5

E are goods. However, if the individual were to produce E1 units of

education, he would be able to consume at C. If E is a good, no unambig-

uous statement can be made with respect to the superiority of any point

between Q and C to C since this essentially depends upon the individual's

willingness to trade consumption of goods for consumption of education.6

       One may describe the opportunity set through XeBQC by


(1)    c h(X, Xe) =       e+   [f(X)]PE —


Since E =   (X)    is monotonic and continuous, there exists an inverse

function X =     f1(E)   so that (1) can be rewritten as


(2)    X = g(E,   Xe) = Xe + EPE —   f(E)
If E enters the utility function at all, the consumptive optimum can occur

at Q only if there is a kink in g(E,Xe) at point Q. But since f(X)

is differentiable and non—zero, the inverse of f(X) is also differentiable.

Thus, g(E,Xe) is differentiable throughout so that no kink can occur at

Q. This simply states that as long as education enters the utility function

(either positively or negatively), there exists some price at which the

individual is willing to trade some goods for more, or in the case where E

enters negatively, less education.7 Thus, the separation principle is

invalidated because one of the factors of wealth production, namely education,

enters the utility function directly. The individual necessarily acquires

an amount of education different than the wealth—maximizing level.

       The problem facing the consumer, then, is to maximize utility given

by U = U(Xc,E)    subject to the constraint that XC =      g(E).   Therefore,
                                           6


(3)         = U(XC,E) — X[XC —     g(E)]

so that the first order conditions for an optimum are given by


(4)       (a) Uc—A=O
          (b) UE + Ag' = 0
               C
          (c) X — g(E) = 0

or,


(5)       (a) UE + U' = 0
          (b)          g(E)    0


      The importance of the conclusion that the optimal level of schooling

acquisition differs from the wealth maximizing level depends, of course,

on the magnitude of the effect. If UE is close to zero for all levels of

E, then most of education's effect on behavior works through its ability

to alter wages. On the other hand, it may be the case that       is close

to zero. If so, education is acquired primarily because it has a positive

(direct) effect on the individual's utility. In order to ascertain the

relevant magnitudes, it is necessary to parameterize the functions. Thus,

let


(6)   U(XC,E) =        xc0E

and let


(7)       E =   f(X)   =   ((P)1

where A is a scalar which converts units.
                                              7

               The choice of the functional forms is not arbitrary. The exponential

form of (7) is natural since it yields f(0) =           0, f > 0   and f" <   0 for
o <    y   <    1.    The form of the utility function is less obvious. The main
                                                                                2
reason for its choice is that it has the very unusual property that                 =
                                                                               dE
e2x > 0             for all values of 0. This implies that an interior solution is

always obtained. Since we observe that individuals consume positive levels

of both c and E, this property is indeed desirable (although institu-

tional constraints may account for the failure to observe corners to some
                8
extent)

               From equation (2),


(8)            g(E,Xc) =    e + PEE — - E11
The wealth maximizing level of education, E*, is found when gt(E,Xe) = 0,

or when


(9)            g' PE_E1 =0
so that


(10)       E* =
                             1
                      (AWE)''

           The wealth-maximizing level of education, E*, is independent of

initial wealth because the way by which an individual will maximize his

wealth does not vary with initial endowment in the absence of capital

constraints. From (5a) the optimization condition is

and upon substituting 5(b) into (11) one obtains

or



(13)   E =
             ._(XP_Xe) + (1) (1) (X) —       *
       Equation (13) identifies E' and could be estimated by OLS except
that E appears on both sides of the equation. This by itself is easily

treated, but before pursuing that, a few points should be made.

       First, the model gives a framework in which observed levels of

schooling can differ across individuals even though their ability levels

do not.9 This is an important aspect of the model; it does not suffer

from the drawback that all individuals are assumed to be alike and yet

obtain different levels of education. The reason that individuals differ

in their levels of schooling, at least up to this point, is that their

endowed wealth differs and their post—schooling wealth therefore differs.

       Additional variation in schooling may result when it is recognized

that endowments may affect the cost of obtaining schooling. In particular,

any aspect of an individual's endowment which affects his wage rate will

certainly alter the cost of spending time at school. As found below (see

Table 1), tlendowedfl characteristics which are important in the determination

of wage rates are endowed IQ, mother's level of education and a white/non-

white dummy. Thus rewrite (7) as


(14)   E = (/J(P)YKMfleXD
                                   9

where K is a measure of endowed IQ (defined below)

       M is the highest grade of schooling completed by the mother

       D is a dummy equal to one for whites)0

Equation (14), it should be remembered, is essentially an identity which

relates the number of years of education to cost of acquiring them.- Thus,

5, for example, measures the effect of IQ on the costs of producing education

as it works by changing the cost of time. For a given dollar expenditure,

higher ability individuals produce fewer years of education since time is

more valuable to them. Any correct measure of X will reflect this

variation.

       If endowment variables affect the costs of schooling by making

individuals more productive workers, it is also reasonable to expect that

their ability to learn productive skills will be affected by these same

variables. More able individuals, for example, are expected to acquire

more units of human capital per year spent at school than less able ones.

Therefore, let the present price of a unit of education vary with the

endowment variables so that l/PE in (13) becomes


       1
        E

where the      are unknown parameters.

       So far, it has been assumed that all expenditure on education is

financed by the individual. However, some parents clearly contribute

toward financing their child's education. That part of parental aid which

is contingent upon the child's attending school reduces the cost of schooling

to the child by that same amount.12 Although it is only the child's expendi-

ture on schooling X, which directly enters the calculation of the opportunity
                                      10

set [equations (1) and (2)], it is total expenditure by parent and child

which is appropriate for the education production function. The X term

of   (14) should then be replaced by          where F is the proportion of

total schooling expenditure financed by parental subsidy (i.e., total

expenditure times (1—F) equals X, the expenditure of the child).'3

        Incorporating the changes, (14) becomes


(15) E= -j-j KMe
                AX      (5 n AD




so that (8) is rewritten as
                                                                   1   —(5    —n   —AD

(16)     g(E,Xe,K,M,D) =      e+     + 1K + 2M + 3D]1E —               KMe
Equation (9) then becomes


(17) =

so that (10) becomes
                                                                                         .
(18)     E* =    [( + 1K     +     + 3D)1(- K' M1 e1 )]11


Finally, the identifying equation (13), can be rewritten as


         E =
(19)            0(XP_Xe) + 1K(XP_Xe) + 2M(XP_Xe) + 3D(XP_Xe)

           +    o fx'    +   1K x ÷ 2M x        +   3D fx)     i
                0 yE          0 E    0 IE           0   yEJ    0


         The term y in equation (19) is a technological and not a behavioral
parameter. It is determined exogenously from information on the costs of

attending school and should not be thought of as estimable from (19).

Theoretically, one could solve algebraically for y, (5,        and     A     simply
                                    11

by knowing how the endowment variables affect wages and therefore the

foregone earnings component of school costs. However, the computer can

be used more easily to find an appropriate solution for y, 6, r, and A.

Rewrite (15) as

                            1xp '
                y 2n A + y £n—J + 6 Lu K ÷ r Ln M + AD
(20)   Ln E =


Once values of E, K, M and D are selected, X is determined by the

technological relationship between schooling costs and foregone earnings

(described in more detail below). Any five arbitrarily chosen, linearly

independent, vectors of E, K, M, and D will therefore allow one to solve

for y, A, 6, r, and A. The extent to which the solutions will vary

with different arbitrary sets of vectors depends upon how good an approxi-

mation the exponential production function is to the true production function.

One may go further and select any T number of arbitrary vectors and solve
                                            2
for the parameters by least—squares. As R approaches 1, the exponential

approximation becomes exact and invariant to subsets of different arbitrary

vectors. This is the procedure followed below.    R2 is quite high:and it

was found that the estimates of A, y, 6, r, and A were insensitive to

different sets of arbitrary vectors.

       Finally,      and * can be estimated from (19) directly, and although
overidentified, maximum—likelihood techniques are easily applied to obtain

unique estimates.

       Again it is clear that        can conceivably be close or equal to

zero. That is, the wealth—increasing component of education can be small

or non—existent. In that case, education should be regarded simply as a

consumption good, the correlation between education and income being purely
                                     12

the result of an income effect. The framework therefore does what it sets

out to do; namely, it isolates the wealth—increasing effect of education.

In addition, since the parameters can be identified, one can solve for E*.

Thus (E —   E*),   the amount of education acquired in excess of the wealth—

maximizing level, is also identified)4


Estimation Procedure

       Before actually estimating (19), a good deal of data manipulation

must be done to resolve definitional questions. The first part of this

section is devoted to this methodologically cumbersome task. The data used

come from the National Longitudinal Survey (1966—69) on young men, 14—24

years of age in 1966. When estimating (19), a subsample was selected

such that no individual was currently attending school, nor had he attended

during the previous two years.15 E is therefore defined as the highest

grade of schooling completed.16

       Direct information on IQ is not available for each individual.

However, all persons in the survey were given a test which measures their

"knowledge of the world of work," (KWW). Scores range from zero to 56

with a mean of 32.6 and a standard deviation of 9.2. Griliches (1974)

reports that this variable is highly correlated with IQ and in many cases,
                   17
performs better.        However, it is still true that measured KWW may not

be an accurate representation of endowed ability. Since it is the endowed

values which are appropriate in a theoretical sense, KWW rather than KWW

is used as a measure of K where KWW is constructed as follows:

       One would like to know what the IQ level (even measured IQ level)

would have been in the absence of schooling. That more highly schooled

individuals tend to have higher IQ's is, in part, attributable to the fact

                                                                               .
                                   13

IQ tests often measure what is taught in school.18 One may estimate the

effect that schooling has on measured KWW by specifying the following

relationship :19



(21)       =       +    + 2(S66)2 +     +     + 5F + a6FI


where KWW is the 1966 test score

       S66 is the highest level of schooling completed in 1966

         D is a dummy equal to 1 for whites

         N is the highest grade of school completed by the mother

         F is the highest grade of school completed by the father

        Fl is the median income of the father's occupation according

            to the 1960 Census.

       The immediate problem is one of potential simultaneity bias. That

is, not only may there be an effect of schooling on measured IQ, but there

may also be an effect of true IQ on the optimal level of schooling. To the

extent that measured and true IQ are correlated, simultaneity bias exists.

One way to avoid this problem is to estimate (21) for groups for which

there is no relationship between currently observed schooling levels and

optimal schooling. For example, if all individuals in the sample attended

school through grade 12, but some are still in the process of doing that,

we can measure the effect of schooling on measured IQ correctly for these

levels of schooling. Extrapolation then gives unbiased estimates of the

effect of schooling on measured IQ. This is what was done. Since in 1966,

individuals in our sample were 14—24 years old, a substantial portion were

still a long way from the school—leaving margin. Thus a sample was selected

with the following characteristics: all individuals in the sample were in
                                    14

1966 currently attending schools in a grade of 12 or less. By 1969, all

had graduated from high school. There is therefore no relationship between

the observed level of schooling in 1966 and the optimal level since all in

the sample had completed at least through 12th grade. The effect of

schooling on measured IQ is therefore given correctly by a1 and a2 of

equation (21) in Table 1. One should note in passing that mothers' education

and both fathers' education and occupational status are positively associated

with measured IQ. It comes as no surprise that measured IQ depends on race

as well.

       The value of endowed measured IQ — what measured IQ would have been

in the absence of schooling — can now be estimated. Let 1(14W be defined

as (21) with S66 set equal to zero so that2°


       1(14W E a0 + a3D + ct4M + a5F + a6FI



Although it is true that D, M, F and Fl affect measured IQ, we do not want

to hold these constant when defining the endowed ability level since they

are all part of the endowment themselves. (We are not claiming to find

"true" IQ, but simply endowed measured IQ where endowed means "in the

absence of schooling.")

       The most difficult variable to obtain information on is e, the

endowed wealth of the individual. From Figure 1, the endowed wealth of

the individual is seen to be the level that his wealth would have been in

the absence of any schooling. The major component of e is thus the

present value of the individual's earnings stream with zero years of

education. The value of this stream is not equal for all individuals;

higher IQ persons earn higher wages even with zero years of schooling;
                                          15

individuals who grow up in the homes of highly educated parents may obtain

human capital at home even without any formal schooling; whites earn more

than blacks. To ascertain the level of wages at each age with zero years

of schooling, the following relationship can be estimated:21


(22)    W69 =   a + a1S69 + a2 Age + a3 KWW + a4M + a5D + a6IS
where W69 is the wage rate in cents—per—hour during 1969 and IS is a

dummy equal to 1 for individuals who are currently attending school.

        Cross—sectional estimation of (22) done in the usual way suffers from

a fundamental flaw in the context of this analysis. By calling a1 the

effect of schooling on wage rates, one assumes the answer to the question

posed; i.e., the total correlation between schooling and wage rates would

be called production. Longitudinal data allows one to avoid this problem

by taking differences so that (22) implies


        W69 — W66
                    =            —                + a6(1S69 —
(22')                   a1(S69       S66) + a2(3)             IS66)

One can argue that the a1 obtained from (22') does not contain the effects

of income on schooling as the result of consumption. If all wage changes

are anticipated, there is no reason why more rapid wage growth during any

particular period in one's life should affect optimal schooling consumption.22

Even if some of the wage changes are unanticipated, the consumption bias on

a1 should be very small for the following reasons: First, even if this

period's wage change reflects a true change in permanent income, only a

small part of the increased consumption of schooling should take place

during this period since individuals tend to spread consumption evenly over

their lifetimes. Thus, S69 — S66               induced by a given change in permanent
                                     16

income is likely to be small. Second, even if some of the wage change is

unanticipated, it is unlikely that a large part of it is unexpected. As

the unanticipated component falls, the amount of       a1 that reflects the

consumption effect falls. Finally, even if all of the wage change were

unanticipated, the elasticity of wealth with respect to the wage change

is likely to be small for two reasons. First, to the extent that the change

is regarded as a transitory phenomenon, the effect on total wealth will be

trivial. Second, even the part that is not regarded as transitory can only

affect the calculation of future wages which will lessen the elasticity of

wealth with respect to current wage changes as well.

          Taking the estimates from (22) to be unbiased, one can then estimate

the constrained version of (22) to obtain unbiased estimates of
                                                                       a0, a3, a4
and a5. The constrained equation is:23


(221t) W69 —
                a1 S69 — a2
                            Age —
                                  a6
                                     IS =
                                          a0 + a3KWW
                                                       +
                                                           a4N + a5D

          For estimation, one would like to have information on individuals

throughout their lifetimes. The Census tapes, for example, provide earnings

data on individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, they do not provide data

on the crucial endowment variables. Specifically, IQ data are missing from

almost all data sets which contain variation in other variables (schooling

levels and age, especially). We are therefore forced to rely on the NLS

and to extrapolate to older age levels.2

          Define W, the hourly wage in cents at age t, as the predicted

value from (22) when S69 is set equal to zero, age is set equal to t,

and   IS is equal to zero.     (When Wt <   0, W is set equal to zero). The
present value in dollars of the earnings stream with schooling equal to zero

is then

(Based on a 2000 hour work year). R is a correction for vintage effects.

Since (26) is estimated from a cross—section, W overstates the obtainable

wage at age t       for   individuals who are older than the sample mean age and

understates if for those who are younger. The annual vintage effect is
                          25
estimated elsewhere                to be 1.3% per year.26 Estimates of the wage and

        It is now necessary to measure X, the value of resources used In

the production of schooling. Let the cost to the individual of attending

the jth grade of schooling be approximated by

       The indirect cost of schooling, C, consists of hours spent in

school times the price of time. Hours spent in school is approximated

by the following linear function, consistent with 25 hours per week at

grade 1 to 58 hours per week at grade 18.29


(27)   11(j) =   830 + 70j


       The price of time can be estimated by examining the wage rates of

individuals who are not currently attending school. In order to find the

price of time during, say, the 11th grade, one can look at the mean wage

of individuals who are not currently enrolled in school and whose highest

level of education is grade 10. It is possible, however, that individuals

in these two groups are not alike with respect to other variables which

influence the wage rate. For example, those who remain in school may have

higher values of KWW than those out of school. Since KWW enters (22),

correction for this must be made in calculating the price of time. Define

W. as the corrected wage rate for the ith individual during the jth year

of school. As above, W. is the predicted wage rate for individual i

from (22) where S69 is set equal to j—i, age is equal to j+5 and KWW,

N   and D   assume their actual values. (IS is equal to zero since the

wage rate understates the price of time for those in school by minus the

coefficient of IS). So


(28)   Wc = [—560.6 + 2.67(j—1) + 28.7(j+5) + 7.134 KWW   + 3.388M + 67g2D]R.1_Age

       By using this corrected wage (which varies over years of schooling)

one can obtain an estimate of the cost to each individual of his actual

level of education. The cost of J years of schooling to individual i is

given by




                                                                                     A

       Finally,   one needs a measure of F. Since by assumption, T./l.5C

is constant over all j, we can take T to be the current year's financial

aid from the parent where j      refers to the 1969 schooling level. A problem

immediately arises. In order to have a well—defined F, the individual must

currently be attending school. However, to estimate (19), the sample is to

be restricted to those not attending school in 1969 (or during the previous

two years) so that F is not obtainable for this sample.

       As above, the solution is to estimate T. by regressing it on

exogenous endowment variables M, D, F, Fl, NFAN and      (NFAN)2 where NFM{

is the number of members in the individual's family other than himself.

(KWW is excluded since it is a linear combination of other included variables).

The sample for estimation purposes is restricted to those individuals for

whom non—zero values of T. were obtained.30 The results are contained in
                           J
Table 2. The only important variable in the determination of T was the

number of other family members. Most significantly, there seems to be no

relationship between parental wealth and the level of transfer for schooling.31

This suggests that parental—wealth related schooling cost differences across

individuals may well be small.     (This does not state, of course, that all

cost differences are small. Schools are more likely to give scho1arships,

for example, to more able individuals).

       Estimation of (20) is now a simple matter. As described above,

arbitrary vectors of E, M, K and D can be used to generate the solutions

for A, y, S, r, A. Observations from the NLS sample were used as the
                                    21

arbitrary vectors. The results are contained in Table 2 and yield the

following estimates: y       .2061; A = 963,400   = —.5659; r = —.0478;

and A = —.0019.   The selection of different subsets of vectors yielded

very similar coefficients.

      We are now ready to estimate equation (19). There are two diff i—

culties encountered. First, E appears on both sides of the equation so

that the independent variables are not uncorrelated with the error. The

solution to this is to use a two—stage estimation procedure. The first

stage consists of obtaining predicted values for the right—hand variables

by regressing them on a set of instruments. Then E is regressed on the

predicted values to obtain unbiased estimates of the coefficients in (19).

Since everything in the model depends fundamentally on a few exogenous

endowment variables——M, F, Fl, NFAN, D——we know that there is some under-

lying polynomial expression which expresses E as a function of these

variables and approximates the analytical solution to (19). We therefore

use as instruments the terms of a second degree polynomial formed from the

endowment variables. Since these are uncorrelated with the error term,

tye produce consistent estimates.

       The second difficulty involves the overidentification of the param-

eters of (19) caused by the non—linear structure. The two—stage estimation

process above gives consistent estimates of 1/0 and l from the intercept

and first four coefficients, respectively. However, a method analogous to

the Durbin two—stage technique of time series analysis produces estimates

which incorporate the information of the non—linear constraint. Using the

constant from the initial regression as a consistent estimate of —    - , rewrite
(19) as

Additional Results and Implications

         The most important finding is that 0 <    0;   education is a bad! This

does not imply, of course, that education provides no positive utility at

any level, but simply states that the representative individual pushes

consumption of education to the point where he would no longer accept it

at zero cost. I.e., if someone were to offer to cover the cost of schooling

(both tuition and the foregone earnings component) on the condition that

future wages would remain unaltered by schooling, the offer would be

declined. Optimal schooling falls short of the wealth—maximizing level.

         It is also found that               and         are positive and substantial

and that   whites receive a higher return to education than do blacks. Since

                    =            + 1K + 2M + 3D)1K = .82



or            = $102       at the point of means. Similarly,


                       =
                           2O + 1K + 2M + 3D)1M = .80
or            = $307.



Both changes in measured IQ and changes in parental education have large

and similar effects on the returns to education. More can be said on this.

From Table 1, one can calculate the wage elasticity (given education) with

respect to N and K. At the mans, -                 .     .67   while - =      .11.

Although the effect of IQ on wages is similar to that of IQ on education,

parental education seems to be much more important in influencing the

returns to schooling than in affecting wage rates. This seems reasonable.

Ability (especially as KWW measures it) is likely to be a more generally

applicable asset than is parental education. The latter might be expected

to have specific components and one is not surprised that additional

parental education is most useful in teaching children how to benefit from

schooling.
                                     26

       The fact that 0 <   0,   i.e., that education is considered a bad,

implies that the wealth—maximizing level of education, E*, should exceed

the optimal level of education. From (18), one can solve for E* directly.

At the means, a white individual's wealth—maximizing level of education is

16.0 years. The mean level of attained education among whites is 11.9 years.

Individuals tend to quit school after high school even though the wealth—

maximizing stopping point is college graduation because they regard school

attendance as an unpleasant activity. The calculation for blacks reveals

that the mean level of          for blacks is only 70% of the mean            for

whites. This is consistent with other results on black/white returns to

schooling during the late 60's. The mean black's wealth—maximizing level

of education is 15.5 years; he acquires 10.3 years of education so that

both the actual and wealth—maximizing levels of education are lower for

blacks than whites. Although the costs of attending school are lower for

blacks (foregone earnings are lower) this is more than offset by the smaller

returns to schooling that accrue to blacks.

       One can perform the same analysis with respect to differences in

the KWW and M variables. Differentiating (18) with respect to K one

obtains:
                                                                            — 1

                          M = .14.   This result is consistent with the above
            and

discussion. Since parental education affects the returns to schooling by

a much greater amount than it affects wage rates (and the cost of schooling),

it makes sense that individuals with more educated parents should have

higher wealth—maximizing levels of schooling. However, since the effect of

higher ability on returns to schooling is similar to that of parental educa-

tion, while ability plays a much more important role in raising wages, the

negative -- can be reconciled with the positive
        This does not i ply that one should observe a negative correlation

between schooling and IQ. There are two reasons: First, observed IQ is

directly and positively affected by schooling so that it may be the case

that the higher observed IQ individuals actually have lower endowed IQ's.

But this is not necessary. Even if observed IQ were a perfect measure of

endowed IQ, the attained level of education may be higher for higher IQ

individuals even though the wealth—maximizing level is not. In terms of

Figure 1, this could happen if the situation were the one pictured in

Figure 2. Here individual 2 is the high ability worker. Although E*1 >          E,
Ec2 >       because the high ability opportunity set is higher and steeper

than the low ability opportunity set.

        We therefore want to consider the realtionship between the optimal

E and K and M. The difficulties involved in solving (19) explicitly

for E have already been mentioned. However, the implicit function theorem

allows us to describe its behavior without obtaining an explicit solution.

         The optimal level of schooling and endowed ability are negatively

related at the means. Yet, one observes a positive relationship between

measured ability and attained schooling. This suggests that the observation

is to a large extent the result of measurement error which alters ex post

measured ability, but not endowed measured ability. Table 4 reveals that

the average level of KWW is very stable across schooling levels. This

simple correlation of zero between KWW and E lends some support to the

reasonableness of the result.32 Also, it should be remembered that

holds other things as parental education and wealth constant. Since endowed

ability and other background variables are likely to be positively related,

a negative partial but zero simple correlation between endowed ability

and   schooling   is indeed re.asonable.33
                                               30

        In the same way, - can be calculated. At the point of means,

dE =
       .20
                      dE   • M   = .16.   The optimal level of education and parental
             and -
education vary directly. Holding ability and other background variables

constant, more educated parents can be expected to have more educated

children. Neither the simple nor partial relationship is surprising.

        We observe that blacks on average opt for about 1.6 fewer years of

schooling than do whites. It is also the case that the average value of

M is 8.0 for blacks and 10.1 for whites and that the average KWW is

similarly 26.6 and 28.4 respectively. From the above calculations, one

can approximate the amount of additional education that blacks would obtain

if they had the whites' level of M and K. Thus


             —         =             + 4f(l.8) = .42 — .41 = .01
(33)             EB        4j(2.l)
The effect is trivial. The effect of blacks lower KWW almost exactly

offsets that of their lower value of M. Part of the residual is the

result of differences in mean F which is .004 for blacks and .015 for

whites. Most of the difference, however, results from much lower returns

to schooling for blacks than for whites.

         The question was orginally posed in terms of wealth and education,

while discussion up to this point has been cast in terms of endowment

variables and education. The reason is straightforward. The way by which

an individual's wealth varies in this model is through interpersonal

differences in ability or background which alter the expected lifetime

earnings stream. This implies that it is misleading to talk about a pure

wealth effect on education since wealth cannot change without also changing

the cost of education, i.e., without shifting the education production

                                                                                        .
                                  31

function. There exists no conceptual experiment analogous to a pure

increase in wealth when discussing education. When wealth changes, so

must prices.

       The original question can now be answered. "Is the correlation

between education and wealth the result of consumption or production?'t Part

of the answer has already been presented. Individuals do not appear to

attend school for consumption purposes. School attendance appears to be

justified by its ability to affect wealth. The fact that 97% of all

individuals in the sampel had a negative E_E* attests to this.

       Table 4 reveals an important fact. The wealth—maximizing and observed

level of schooling are positively correlated and IE_E*I falls as E increases.

For individuals with E > 18, the mean level of E exceeds E*. These

individuals push education beyond the wealth—maximizing level. This suggests

that at least for individuals who achieve high levels of education, (e.g.,

M.A.'s and Ph.D. 's), schooling is considered a good. Firm conclusions on

this cannot be reached, however, without appropriately segregating the sample.34

      Additional information is obtained by considering the regressions in

Table 5. The results of (34) show that although there is a strong positive

association between E and E*, only 6—1/2% of the total variation in E

is explained by varitiOfl in E*. There is a great deal of residual variation

left to explain. Part of this variance can be explained by consumption while

part is simply "randon error."

       Regressions (35) and (36) verify the consistency of the last few pages

worth of calculations. From (35), one sees that the partial relationship

between K and N and E* are negative and positive, respectively. From

(36), we find that the partial relationships between K and M and E are

also negative and positive, respectively. Blacks have lower levels of

E and E* than do whites. All signs correspond to those predicted in

the analysis of previous pages. These findings again support the claim

that variance in observed E moves in the direction predicted by the

utility maximizing framework set out in this paper. Furthermore, since

K, M and D by themselves can, even in this simple equation, explain 20%

of the variation in E, differences in wealth—maximizing levels of education

across individuals (as formulated in this model) tell only part of the story.

This does not say that the investment motive is unimportant. The findings

of this paper suggest that it is supreme. Virtually all education is

wealth—increasing. We simply find that variations in E* across individuals

do not go far to explain variations in E.

           The robustness of the obtained results was tested by altering

various assumptions made throughout the model. The first variation allowed

KWW to depend on age as well as schooling. The results were virtually

identical to those previously obtained: 1/0 = —22.51,                = .000778,

     =   —.0000080,    2 = —.0000231,    3 = —.0000743,   y =   .1931.   This resulted

in         =   $3816 and E* of 15.7 at the mean.

           Second, the discount rate was changed to .05 from .10.          became

.2001 and l/e         = —25.12.   All other coefficients changed almost propor-

tionately to 1/3 their original values. This resulted in                   $10,526

(higher because of the lower discount rate), but E* increased only to

17.3 years from 16.0. All other qualitative conclusions were the same.

Thus, even with such drastic alteration of the discount rate, the findings

remain intact.

           Third, the hours—in—school equation was assumed to be 2/3 of its

original magnitude, thereby lowering the cost of a year of schooling.
                                  35

Again, all coefficients in (30) change by a scalar,        fell to $2136,

but 1/0 is still negative at —28.62 and E* remains at 16.1. Again,

all previous statements hold.

       Finally, the assumption on direct costs of schooling was changed.

Instead of direct costs being one—half of foregone earnings, they were

assumed to be zero through grade 12. This did not affect the results at

all. All coefficients were very similar, E = $2891 and E* was 16.0

years again for the mean individual.

       One final check on the reasonableness of the results can be made

by examining the predicted wealth from (2). Evaluating all terms at the

means, one obtains that E = $3571 and       =   $57,305.   At the assumed

10% rate of interest this yields a permanent annual income (consumption)

figure of $5730. This seems in line with casual notions of average

permanent income. In addition since    e = $18,557,   schooling triples

the wealth of the representative individual.

       As a final point, it is now useful to consider the welfare effects

of government subsidization of education. One of the primary motivations

of government subsidization seems to be the redistribution of opportunity

if not wealth. If it were the case that education did not enter the

utility function at all, then individuals would necessarily go to their

wealth—maximizing levels. Redistributive arguments for giving education

to the poor instead of assets paying the market rate of interest would

have to rest on differences in the cost of obtaining funds across individ-

uals (ignoring externalities).35 Since education enters the utility

 function negatively, however, the individual stops short of the wealth—

 maximizing level of education. This means that education yields a higher
                                        36


pecuniary return at the margin than do other assets (the difference

being the value of the marginal disutility). By subsidizing education,

the government could induce individuals to move to the wealth—maximizing

level of education. If the only objective were to raise pecuniary wealth

of particular individuals, this method would yield a higher return than

the same amount of transfer expenditure in non—human capital. It is still

true, however, that the utility level of the recipients would be lower

when the transfer is in education (a non—saleable asset) rather than in

bonds.

         The results of the above analysis allow us to calculate the amount

of subsidy necessary to move the mean individual to the wealth—maximizing

level of education. Since '(E*_E) =          4.9   years, the government should

set as an approximation --fr   dX   =   4.9 (since 3E/X varies with X',

this is only an approximation). dX is, like parental transfer, an

education—specific subsidy. From (32),

                               +
                    —
                    xp
                         =—

                                             = .0007




so that dX = $6872 in period zero dollars. Since this occurs at the

average school quitting age of about 18, in age 18 current dollars the

expenditure is [e      8)][6872] = $41,575, a substantial subsidy. The

exact expenditures varies across individuals. Table 4 reveals that IE_E*I

is greater for non—whites than it is whites. The wealth—maximizing scheme

would therefore require that a larger subsidy go to non—white individuals.

                      = —.28
Similary, since                and - = —.23,         the difference between E and

E* decreases with increased ability. The required subsidy would therefore


                                                                                    .
                                  37

be larger for low ability workers. It should be remembered, of course,

that all would be better off with a non—wealth—maximizing transfer of

money of the corresponding amount than with an educational subsidy. Only

if wealth—maximization is an end by itself is the educational subsidy

warranted (again, neglecting externalities) 36


Summary and Conclusions

       The question posed in this paper is an old one: Why attend school?

Does the well—documented relationship between education and income result

because schooling allows individuals to earn higher wages or because high

income individuals purchase more schooling as they purchase more of all

normal goods? The first part of the paper sets out a theoretical framework

which treats education as a joint product, producing (potential) wage

gains and utility, independent of the wealth increment, simultaneously.

If education enters the utility function either positively or negatively,

it is necessarily the case that the optimal level of education will differ

from the wealth—maximizing level. It is thus misleading to ask how much

of educational acquisition is due to consumption. The answer is, "all of

it." The appropriate question is how large is the difference between the

consumption optimum and wealth—maximizing level? This will be zero if

education does not enter the utility function and will be equal to the

attained level if education does not affect wealth.

       The choice of general functional forms for the uitlity and educa-

tional production function allows one to ascertain the relevant magnitudes.

The model, which uses information on parental education and occupation,

number of siblings, race, and endowed (in the absence of schooling) measured
                                     38

IQ, produces estimates of the optimal and wealth—maximizing levels of

education, and   the   market value of education. The way in which these

values are affected by differences in the background variables is also

determined.

       One of the most difficult problems encountered was to obtain a

measure of endowed ability. A method is devised which nets Out the effect

of schooling on measured IQ independent of the simultaneity bias which

results from potential causality between true IQ and the optimal level of

schooling. The solution rests on the use of longitudinal data (the

National Longitudinal Survey on young men is used) which follows individuals

over a portion of their lifetimes.

       The fourth section contains the results of the analysis. The findings

can be summarized:

       1. Most important is the finding that education is a bad, i.e., it

enters negatively into the utility function. Individuals therefore stop

short of the wealth—maximizing level of education by an average of 4.9

years. While high school graduation is the average quitting point, acqui-

sition of an undergraduate degree is still a whorthwhile investment for

the mean individual.

       2. The wealth—maximizing level of education varies inversley with

endowed IQ and directly with parental education. Although increases in

both imply increased returns to a year of schooling, they also imply higher

costs as well as the result of higher foregone earnings. Increases in

endowed IQ effect wages to a larger extent than returns to education while

the opposite is true for parental education. Similary, the wealth—maximizing

level of education is lower for blacks than for whites.


                                                                               .
                                  39

       3. It is also the case that the simple correlation between endowed

(as opposed to ex post measured) IQ and the level of attained schooling

is zero. ThJs suggests that there is no tendency for higher education to

be dominated by the more intelligent. The partial relationship between

IQ and optimal schooling is, in fact, negative. This results from two

factors: First, the cost of schooling is higher to the more able due to

higher foregone earnings. Second, the more able are richer and as such

acquire less of schooling, a normal bad. Parental education is both in a

simple and partial sense, positively associated with attained schooling.

Similarly, the model predicts (as well as observes) that blacks will

acquire less education than whites. This result attains even when correc-

tions are made for differences in parental education and endowed measured

ability. The difference is caused by much lower returns to schooling for

blacks than for whites.

       4. Although the wealth—maximizing level of education and actual

level of education are positively related, variation in the former explains

only 6—1/2% of variation in the latter. Actual levels of education move

with the endowment variables in the way predicted by the analysis. This

suggests that part of the residual is explained by differences in the

consumptive optimum across individuals. It is true, however, that 97% of

the sample stopped short of the wealth—maximizing level.

       5. An educational subsidy of $6872 in present value at birth would

cause the mean individual to acquire the wealth—maximizing level of education.

       The model presented in this paper is empirically complicated and

requires many assumptions before any conclusions are obtained. To the

extent that extrapolation results in rough measures of important variables,
                                   40

the final conclusions must be regarded as less than definitive. On the

other   hand, the tests for robustness revealed that the results were

quite stable even when important assumptions were changed substantially.

Many checks on the reasonableness of the findings have also been provided

and the model performed quite well by these criteria. The assessment of

the finding's credibility, of course, rests with the reader.

1. See Arrow (1972), Stiglitz (1973) and Wolpin (1974) for a more complete
    discussion of this hypothesis.

2. Levhari and Weiss (1974) offer an alternative explanation. They show
    that under conditions of uncertainty with decreasing absolute risk
    aversion, an increase in initial wealth will encourage investment in
    more human capital since the wealthier will buy more risky assets
    (human capital being one).

3. Schultz (1962) describes the benefits to education as divisible into
    three components: an investment component which results in an increase
    in an individual's measured wealth; a present consumption component such
    as the utility currently derived, say, from attending class; and a future
    consumption component which results from the fact that education improves
    one's ability to consume other goods later in life.

4. This amounts to assuming that additional years of schooling produce
    slightly more units of human capital where a unit of human capital
    is defined such that its rental price in current dollars is constant
    for each period of rental. The increase in the number of units of
    human capital is then assumed to exactly offset the decline in the
    value of human capital acquired later in life'which results from a
    shorter payoff period. Note that this assumption does not imply a
    constant "rate of return" since the education production function, f(X),
    allows the costs of producing education to rise with E.

5. This assumes that "education" is the appropriately defined good. Specif i—
    cally, this requires that there are no possibilities of different types
    of education, some of which are more productiie in the market, some of
    which are more productive in the non—market.

6. One is not indifferent between C and B, however, since measured
     wealth (i.e., ability to purchase goods) is the same at each point,
     but the amount of education consumed at C exceeds that of point B.

7. Ishikawa (1973) obtains a similar conclusion.

8.   Some experimentation was done with other utility functions (Cobb—Douglas,
     among others), but all lacked the necessary properties and the results
     obtained were therefore non—sensical.

9. As Rosen (1973) points out, the assumptions of the human capital frame-
    work as applied empirically generally preclude the observation of
    different levels of schooling across individuals.

10. D is entered exponentially since DA would imply E = 0      for
    non—whites.

11. One might also argue that tastes differ across individuals, depending
     upon the values of the endowment variables. For simplicity, neutrality
     of tastes is assumed with respect to endowment variables. That is,
     although it is recognized that higher IQ individuals may derive greater
    absolute utility from both E and X, it is assumed that the ratio
    of marginal utilities (OXC) is independent of K, M and D.

12. The child generally receives some parental transfers even in the
     absence of attending school. It is the amount by which this transfer
     increases when the child attends school which should be thought of as
     school cost financed by the parent.

13. Becker (1967) argues that schooling differences across individuals can
     be caused either by differences in returns to schooling or differences
     in costs. Treating      as variable addresses the former while incor-
     porating parental financing attempts to deal with the latter. Differ-
     ences in borrowing rates are ignored only to the extent that they do
     not operate through parental transfers.

14. The difference between observed E and E* does not accurately reflect
     the amount of educationdue exclusivelY to consumption. The true con-
     sumption component is E — E* where E is the solution to (19) in
     terms of E for each individual. Not all of unexplained variation
     should be called consumption since some of it is the result of error
     in the calculation of E*.

15. Given that these individuals are young, there is a reasonable probabil-
     ity that they will return to school even if not currently attending.
     This may cause E to be mismeasured. Dealing with young individuals
     has the advantage, however, that X, the costs of schooling, can be
     more accurately measured than they can for older individuals whose
     schooling occuiredfurther into the past.

16. Observations are selected for which E > 0. E > 18 is coded as E         18.

17. "Better" is defined in the context of wage functions. It is not clear
     that it will do as well as a measure of the ability to produce educa-
     tion. In the absence of a superior measure, however, it must suffice.

18. If all individuals attended the same number of years of schooling, the
     problem would be less serious since the more able would learn these
     testable skills more readily.

19. Griliches and Mason (1972) are faced with much the same problem and
     this technique is not totally unlike theirs.

20. An alternative measure would be KWW KWW — c1S66 — a2(S66)2.      This

     measure uses the information in the error term and would be superior
     if the error primarily reflected unestimated differences in measured
                                  43


    ability rather than unestimated differences in the effect of schooling
    on measured ability. This measure contains more information on the
    individual, but is also less likely to be free of schooling effects.
    The inclusion of age in the KWW equation changed none of the results.
    This is discussed in more detail in the final sections.

21. Neither CS69)2, F, nor Fl entered significantly into the regression.
    See Lazear (1974) for a discussion of the IS variable.

22. Nor is there any reason to expect that wage growth and average wage
     levels will be correlated if schooling does not affect wages. E.g.,
     the more able may have flatter earnings profiles in the absence of
     schooling than the less able, even though the level of the former's
     wages are higher.

23. This specification is tantamount to the assumption of neutrality. That
     is, the effect of,age, for example, on wage rates istrted here as
     being independent of schooling. If age is a proxy for on—the—job
     training, this says that schooling has no effect on the cost of invest-
     ment in OJT because it increases efficiency in producing this form of
     human capital by the same amount as it increases the costs of producing
     it (the foregone earnings, primarily). Experimentation with functional
     forms revealed the absence of interaction effects so that neutrality
     in this context may not be far from the truth.

24. This problem is not as serious as it appears since the inaccuracies at
     later ages are to a large extent mitigated by the present value cal-
     culation which renders them small relative to the earlier component.

25. See Lazear (1975), p. 11.

26. This calculation appears to have ignored the effect of parental wealth
     on the child's endowed wealth. This is not the case. Fl was allowed
     to affect wage rates directly in (22), but did not enter significantly.
     Fl enters indirectly by altering 1(14W. The direct transfer of funds
     from wealthy parents to their children is taken into account by the
     introduction of F in (15).

27. The fact that only a small portion of the variation in wages is explained
     in (22") is not too disturbing. As long as the individual has no better
     information about the rest of wage variation than we do, it can be
     ignored since he will not take it into account in estimating his own
     endowment.

28. The assumption that direct costs are one—half foregone earnings was
     replaced by the assumption that they are zero through year 12 and
     half of foregone earnings beyond that. The results were not altered.
     This is discussed in more detail in the final section.
            In addition, changing the discount rate to .05 from .10 did not
     qualitatively alter the results.

29. Equation (27) was replaced by H(j) = .66(830 + 70.) and the complete
     analysis was carried out. Again, the results chaned very little
    (as is reported below). The robustness of the findings in light of
     such apparently substantial changes in assumptions is encouraging.

30. The data do not distinguish between a true value of zero and a zero
     value for insufficient information. This prevented the application
     of tobit analysis.

31. A linear probability regression with the same independent variables
     and the dependent variable being a dummy equal to 1 when T > 0
    yielded similar results. The sample was restricted to those currently
    attending school so that the T = 0 was less likely to reflect
    insufficient information. No variable in this regression entered
    significantly and all coefficients (although biased) were very small.

32. Nor is this theresult of a mechanical relationship. It is not true
     that because KWW is constructed by holding schooling constant that
     there must be no relationship between the two. There are two reasons:
     The coefficient on the schooling coefficient in the KWW regression is
     not obtained cross—sectionally. Given the construction of the sample
     for estimation of (21), the correlation between optimal (final)
     schooling and KWW is removed. Thus, taking this effect out says
     nothing about cross—sectional findings on KWW. Second, D, F, and Fl
     enter significantly and are not held constant by Table 4. Even if
     the partial correlation between KW and E were zero, there would be
     no reason for the simple correlation to be zero.

33. This finding which suggests that the truly bright individuals are out
     in the real world earning money rather than ivory—towering their time
     away, is sure to please a large part of the population. Before conceding
     the issue, however, two points should be made. If it is true that
     the more able take the returns to schooling in non—pecuniary ways, then
     the measured returns understate true returns by more for the more able.
     This might lead to the prediction that optimal levels of schooling
     and ability are negatively correlated when the reverse is true. One
     wonders, of course, why it is that the more able should have a relative
     preference for non—pecuniary returns. Higher tax rates on higher
     income is the usual explanation. No additional justifications are
     offered here.

34. An attempt to stratify the sample into low and high education groups
     was only partially successful. Observations were split into these
     obtaining more than twelve years of schooling and those obtaining
     less than twelve years. For the low schooling groups, the following
     results were obtained: y = .1561, 1/0 = — 23.98,    = .000705, l =.0000089,
       = —.0000211,   3 —.0000747. These coefficients are similar to
     those in the text, but yield E = 3508 (as compared to $3571 for the
     group as a whole) and E* = 13.4 (rather than 16.0). This is consistent

                                                                                   .
                                45


    with the group being low—schooled individuals. For the high schooling
    group, only 300 observations were present. This resulted in y = .3961,
       = —.00000276, 2 = —.0000061, 3 = —.0000036. Although the

    coefficients retain the same signs and qualitative implications,
    becomes 7092 and E* a ridiculous 51 years! This is directly attributable
    to the high y and presumably to the insufficient information in the
    few observations.

35. If the government could finance education at 10% while some individuals
     faced 15% borrowing rates then what was wealth—maximizing at the
     private level would fall short of what was wealth—maximizing at the
     social level.

36. Wealth—maximization could be a goal in itself if a country were trying
     to produce maximum output en route to a developed state. In such a
     case, leaving school prior to the wealth—maximizing level is analogous
     to failing to build a machine whose return exeeds cost.
