                                ABSTRACT




     This paper investigates the correlates of union success in NLRB certi-
fication and decertification elections. The analysis includes a wide variety
of bargaining unit, union, industry, and geographic attributes, many of which
have not been considered in previous studies.
     Variables having a statistically significant relation with voting in
certification elections are the size of the unit, employer consent to the
definition of the bargaining unit, the length of campaigns, union organizing
effort, union dues, union wages, non—union wage variance, the industry
unemployment rate and percentage of black workers and the concentration of
jobs among a few employers in a geographic area.
     The same specification was estimated for decertification elections.
Variables having a statistically significant association with voting are unit
size, length of campaign, and the non—union wage variance.
     Examination of the magnitude of the estimated coefficients
                                                               suggests that,
only unit size and union organizing effort might affect outcomes in more than
a small percent of all certification elections. Estimated correlations for
voting in dercertification elections are not accurate enough to allow such a
judgment.
     Finally, comparison of the regression results for certifications and
de—certifications shows that the process determining how workers vote is very
different in the two types of elections.

I. INTRODUCTION

     Certification and decertification elections are a mechanism of union

growth and decline.    Between 1956 and 1976, the number of certification

elections held doubled while the number of decertjfication elections

quintupled. In the same time span, membership loss due to decertification has

quadrupled while the membership gained through certification elections has
been halved)

     The research reported here presents information on two new aspects of the

correlates of union success. First, past research has considered the corre-

lation of union success with geographic. location,2 union characteristics,3 and

industry4 primarily by using dummy variables. While    this   is a useful tech-

nique to see whether or not a correlation exists or simply to control for

these factors, the interpretation of these dummy variables is difficult. To

ascertain what specific aspects of location, unions and industries are

associated with election outcomes, we have included a number of attributes of

each of these categories in the analysis.

     For example, several authors have studied the relation of a southern

location with the outcome of representation elections.5       The South differs

from other areas in many ways: lower levels of unionization, higher incidence

of right—to—work laws, lower industrial concentration, etc. In an attempt to

determine which, if any, of these factors can account for observed differences

in election outcomes between the south and other areas, these and other

geographic characteristics are included in this analysis.

     Second, past research has considered the correlates of either certifica-

tion or decertification elections. But there has been no examination of the

similarities and differences between the two processes. Differences found by

comparing the two types of studies could be due to differences in the
                                                                      2




processes or differences in the specifications estimated. By using the same

regression specification for both types of elections the work presented here

allows a direct comparison of the importance of several factors in determining

the outcome of certification elections to their importance in decertifica—

tions.

     Our presentation proceeds in four parts. The next section develops the

regression specification. The third section describes the data. The fourth

presents our results, and the last is a conclusion summarizing the results and

considering their implications.



II. THE SPECIFICATION

     The dependent variable is a Haldane—Logit transformation of union support

in certification and decertification elections measured at the bargaining unit

level. Aspects of bargaining units, union affiliation, industry, and communi-

ty, which are likely to be related to union support, are identified from the

literature on certification and decertification elections, and the literature

on union organizing.



1. Bargaining Unit

    There are two bargaining unit characteristics identifiable in this data

set which are probably related to union support in certification and decerti—

fication elections. The first, unit size, has repeatedly been demonstrated to

be important. The second, factor, management resistance, has received less

attention.

    The common finding relating size to decertification outcomes is increas-

ing size reduces the probability of a union being decertified.6 The usual

argument given to explain this finding is that large units are more economical
                                                                       3




 to service and more attractive to a union. As a consequence, service for

 union members is good, making them satisfied with and supportive of the union.

 Further, since the unit is large the union expends substantial tesources to

keep the unit.

      If this argument is folled for certification elections, a similar

positive relationship between unit size and union support would be expected.

However, the most couon finding in studies of certification elections is that

unit size is negatively related to the union support.7 Cooke8 provides an

explanation. He argues pro—union groups are able to exert more pressure in

small groups because they are better able to communicate, maintain cohesive-

ness, and apply pressure to force social conformity. This explanation is

consistent with the decertification findings because the mobilized group in a

decertification is attempting to oust the union.

     A third possibility is that differences in technology or management style

between small and large firms (reflected here in unit size) affect election
outcomes.

     Since there are potentially many different factors at work, we have

chosen a polynomial specification which allows the marginal effects of

increasing size to differ between different size firms.

     The second factor associated with bargaining units is management resis-

tance. Two variables which may signal the intensity of management resistance

in certification campaigns are whether or not the election is a consent

election, and the amount of time between when the petition for an election is

filed and when the election is held.

      There are three ways consent elections may reflect less management

resistance in a certification election. First, when the management consents

to the union definition of the bargaining unit they signal employees that they
                                                                       4




 may not intend to fight union efforts. Second, in a consent election the

 bargaining unit requested by the union is not modified.       If a union has
 defined a unit to its ow-n advantage and the company successfully contests it

 the union may loose supporters who are removed by the redefinition or find its

 strength diluted by additionaliorkers.9 Third, the absence of management

 consent may serve as a proxy for the use of other management campaign tactics

 such as meetings, letters, hand bills, and intimidation of union supporters

which have been shown to affect voting)0

      Consent elections are probably not a sign of management resistance in

decertification elections.    First, failure to consent does not signal an

attempt to change the bargaining unit. In addition, while it is almost always

management that fails to consent to certifications, either the union or

management may not consent to decertification elections. Therefore, we have

no expectations concerning the relationship between consent elections and

union support in decertification elections.   -




      Management   resistance may also be reflected in the amount of time,

between the date when the petition for an election is filed and the date the

election is held. Union support is usually at its peak when the petition is

filed. The greater the delay, the more opportunity employers will have to

counter union efforts and hire workers screened for pro—union sympathies.

This again should lead to less union support. Delays may also signal the

use of other anti—union tactics.

     These arguments do not generalize to decertifications. Therefore we have

no expectations concerning the sign of the effect of delays in decertification

elections.

     It should be noted that management resistance in these circumstances may

be   endogenous.    If firms respond to stronger pro—union sentiments by
                                                                      5




 increasing the intensity of anti—union efforts, the measured effects of

management resistance would probably be biased downward. If firms respond by

dropping anti—union efforts the measured effects of management resistance

would probably be biased upward. 12



2. Union

     Empirical results linking particular unions to the outcome of certifica-

tion and decertification elections are mixed. In separate studies: Sandver

found Teamsters win fewer elections than other unions,'3 Cooke found union

support to be lower in certification elections where Teamsters where

involved,14 Anderson et al. found no difference between Teamsters and other

unions in union support in decertification elections,15 and Dickens finds

substantial differences between several unions.'6 One potential reason for

these ambiguous results is the presence of a number of different, and con-

flicting, factors associated with unions which may affect voting.

     The size of a union may be related to its success in certification and

decertification elections for many reasons. A larger union may have more

resources available for fighting representation campaigns and is more attrac-

tive to workers if they feel that a large union has more leverage in nego-

tiations.'7 On the other hand, large unions may be more bureaucratic and less

responsive to membership. Thus, the sign of the union size effect may be

either positive or negative in certification and decertifications.

     In discussing unions' organizing activity, it is useful to distinguish

between its extent and its intensity. Roughly speaking, the extent would be

measured by the number of elections a union engaged in and the intensity by

the amount of effort put into each campaign. All other things held equal, one

would expect that the more intense a union's organizing effort, the more
                                                                       6




 successful it would be in each certification campaign. On the other hand, as

 a union increases the extent of its organizing efforts by attempting to

 organize more units, it is forced to try more marginal units with a lower

probability of success. However, we cannot expect that all other things are

held equal.

     Even if we had good measures of the extent and intensity of union

organizing efforts, we would still face the problem that more intense efforts

may be a response by a union to a more difficult territory. More extensive

organizing may be a response to a larger number of opportunities.

     In addition, while we can measure the extent of organizing activity ——

the number of elections in which a union participates ——       we   can get at
intensity only by a much less direct route.'8 We have used the average size

of the unit a union organizes and the total number of workers involved in all

elections as proxies for intensity.      To interpret these as proxies for
in'éensity one must assume that unions organizing larger units will put more

ffort into each campaign. This would be a reasonable assumption if there are

economies of scale in servicing larger units, but income from a unit is

proportional to its size. This effect will be picked up by unit size, which

is already controlled for, but it may also be reflected in the organizing

strategy of a union. Thus, unions which organize larger units on average may

tend to put more effort into each campaign even when organizing smaller units.

     How the extent and intensity of union organizing efforts will affect

success in decertifications is even less clear.        Organizing skills and

resources may be useful in fighting decertifications. On the other hand, more

extensive and intensive effort may lead to the certification of marginal units

with a greater tendency to decertify. It has also been suggested that unions

face a trade—off between organizing and servicing,'9         Unions devoting
                                                                       7




 considerable effort to organizing may not have the resources to adequately

 service existing units and may loose more decertifications. Thus no attempt

 is made to predict the effect of organizing effort on decertifications.

      The final union attributes we will consider are membership costs and

 benefits. Controlling for otheffactors, the greater the cost of participat-

 ing in the union, the lower should be the union support in an election. The

 greater the benefits from unionization the greater should be union support.

 This study includes a measure of average union dues per member and the average

 dollar value of union benefits2° (health care, pension contribution, recre-

 ational services, etc.) per member.



3. Industry

     The use of dummy variables is again found in the analysis of industry

effects on election outcomes. Rose classified industries into four major

groups and found little difference in certification election outcome between

them.2' Sandver classified industries on the basis of capital intensity and

had inconclusive results studying certification elections.22 In a study of

decertification elections, Anderson, Busman, and O'Reilly found bargaining

units were more likely to vote for the union in the service industry and

against the union in the retail industry.23

     This study considers eight industry attributes potentially affecting the

outcome of representation elections: the level of strike activity, potential

wage gains from unionization, wage levels, potential improvements in wage

equity from unionization, wage dispersion in non—union finns, the percent of

the workforce that is unionized, the percent of the workforce that is black,

and the industry unemployment rate.
                                                                          8




      Strikes are costly to workers so they may view them as something to be

 avoided. Controlling for other factors, on might expect to find less support

 for unions in both certification elections and
                                                  decertificatjon elections in
 industries with more strike activity.

      Industries differ consideràbly both in average wages and in average wage

 differences between union and non—union workers. If
                                                       expected wage gains from
 unionization are related to average industry union/non—union
                                                                differences, then
 union support in both certifications and decertificatjons should be greater in

 industries with larger union/non—union differences.

      Pencavel argues that unionism is a normal good and that desire for

unionization increases with income!4 Thus, not only the difference between

union and non—union wages should matter, but also the overall wage level.

     It has been argued that workers prefer more equitable compensation

systems and unions respond to these desires by lowering the variance of

wages.25 If workers do prefer lower wage variance, they should be more
                                                                       likely
to vote union in industries where unions reduce the wage variance more.

     Two arguments can be found concerning the likely effects of industry

unionization on vote.     The first argument is the saturationist argument.

Ashenfelter and Pencavel26 argue that as unionization increases, further gains

from organizing are more difficult to obtain.     The consequence is a dimin-
ishing return to organizing efforts as more marginal bargaining units are

organized.    Therefore, as unionization increases, union        support should
decrease.    On the other hand, when unionization is low within an industry,

employers strongly resist union organizing.     In fact, employers strive to
prevent the entry of unions anywhere within the industry.       Thus, if union
membership is not extensive within an industry, unions should be less likely

to win representation elections. Taking these two arguments together suggests
                                                                      9




that unionization is related to union support in a U—shaped fashion, with

unions having the greatest probability of success in moderately unionized

industries. On the other hand, if unions organize in each industry up to the

point where marginal costs of obtaining a new member are equal to the marginal

benefits of that new member, no relation if marginal benefits are constant or

perceived as constant with respect to the level of unionization.

     During periods of high unemployment, resistance of employers to unions

increases and the risk to a worker of joining a union increases. In the case

of decertification elections, increasing unemployment may increase employer

resistance to unions and cause dissatisfaction of union members with the union

because of loss of job security.27 Thus, industry unemployment is expected to

be negatively related to union support in certification and decertification

elections.

     Black workers have been found to be more likely to vote union.28 Farber

and Saks suggest that this is because unions impose a formal mechanism for

resolving disputes providing blacks with some protection from discrimina-

tion.29 If this is true the percent of workers who are black in an industry

should be positively related to union support in certification and decerti—

fication elections.



6. Location

    The primary geographic variable researchers have looked at in analyzing

certification and decertification elections is whether or not the bargaining

unit is located in a Southern or Right—to—Work state. Analyzing certification

elections, Rose found a slight tendency for unions to have a greater chance of

success in the South.3° Sandver argued this effect was due to differences in

unit size and election type between Southern and other states.31 In analysis
                                                                       10




 of decertjfjcatjon elections, Krislov found unions in Southern and Midwestern

 states had a greater chance of success than unions elsewhere.32 On the other

 hand, Anderson, Busman, and O'Reilly found location in the South to be an

 unimportant factor in explaining election outcomes.33       Eliwood and Fine
 consider the effects of right—to—work laws on union success in certification

 drives and find that it drops slightly in the years immediately following the

 passage of the law and then increases slightly in later years.34 Cooke finds

 that unions are less successful in certification elections in Southern

 Right—to—Work States.35 The only other geographic factor analyzed is the

 effect of a metropolitan location. Rose finds that unions in non—metropolitan

 areas tended to experience a greater degree of success in certification
              36
 elections.

     This study considers nine attributes of the location of an election:

whether the firm is located in the South or a rural area, strike activity, the

percent of the population which is black, right—to—work laws, community

unionization, community unemployment, community urbanization, and the struc-
ture of local industry.

     It is well known that states with right—to—work laws have a significantly

lower percentage of the work force organized. 37    However, as the evidence

presented above suggests, the relationship between right—to—work laws and

election outcomes is ambiguous. Three arguments can be proposed linking

right—to—work laws to union support in certification and decertification
elections.

     First, while right—to—work laws make it possible for "free—riders" to

reap the benefits of union membership without paying the costs, thus reducing

the incentive to join unions, they might make workers more likely to vote
union.   Right—to—work laws lower the potential cost of voting pro—union
                                                                         11




 because, if the worker does not like the union, he does not have to join. It

 is to the worker's advantage to give the union a chance. Second, the presence

 of right—to—work laws could make unions less likely to expend resources

 organizing marginal units, concentrating instead on units likely to be

organized successfully. Since right—to—work laws are associated with low

unionization, there should be many prime sites to organize. Both of these

factors imply a positive relationship between right—to—work laws and union

success. But, right—to—work laws are usually enacted in states where there is

little community support for unionization. Therefore, the sign of the corre—

lation of right—to—work laws with voting can't be predicted.

     The arguments for the relevance of community unemployment, unionization,

strike activity, and the percent black are similar to the arguments presented

above for industry effects.

     While union organizers have felt urban areas were easier to organize than

rural areas, Rose found unions have slightly more success in rural areas.38

In cities, alternative jobs are easier to find. This decreases the expected

cost of voting for a union in a certification election. On the other hand,

the greater cost of organizing and servicing units in rural areas may lead

unions to attempt to organize only in those firms where they have a high

probability of success. Therefore there is no reason to anticipate a positive

or negative relation.

     Another factor affecting the availability of alternative jobs is local

industry concentration. If most jobs in an area are concentrated among a few

employers, one would expect workers to have fewer opportunities and view

certifying or decertifying a union as a potentially more costly experiment.

Alternatively, workers who don't like a company or a union are less likely to

quit and more likely to try   to   change conditions by voting for certification
                                                                        12




 or decertification. Once again there is no reason to anticipate a positive or

 negative relationship.



 III. DATA SOURCES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE

        The dependent variables arrare constructed for data on union support in

 certification and decertification elections. Union is measured as the pro-

portion of workers voting union in an election.
        National Labor Relation Board election report data covering all cases

closed in the years 1977 to 1979 form the basis of the sample. This data

contains the outcome of the election, the type of election, the three digit

standard industrial classification codes, the location of the election, the

date of the petition for election, the date the election was held, and the

petitioning union. From all cases closed in these years we choose all those

involving only one union for which our dependent and all independent variables

could be constructed. This left a sample of 12,009 certification election and

1,320 decertification elections.

        The bargaining unit characteristics, size of unit, the length of the

campaign, and whether or not the election was a consent election, are con-

structed from the National Labor Relations Board data. The size of the unit is

constructed as the number of eligible voters in the unit in thousands. The log

of the number of months between the petition for election and the date the

election was held is used as a measure of the length of the campaign, and a

dummy   variable   is constructed for whether or not the election was a consent

election.

     Union size (in hundreds of thousands) is measured as the average reported

size in the 1977 and 1979 union directories. Union dues are computed as the

total amount of dues and per capita payments, in hundreds of dollars in the
                                                                       13




 years 1977 through 1979. to every local affiliated with the national union and

 to the national, divided by union membership.39 Similarly, union benefits are

measured as the total value of benefits in hundreds of dollars provided by all

locals affiliated with a national and by the national to members of the union

divided by union membership.4° The extent of union organizing efforts was

measured by the number of elections the union took part in during the period.

Two variables which were included in an attempt to control for the intensity

of organizing efforts are the average size of units a union was organizing and

the total number of workers in all units a union attempted to organize.

Finally, a dummy variable for elections involving Teamsters was included to

see if the union attributes we have considered can explain the relation found

by past authors.

     The industry data is coded at the two and three—digit standard industrial

classification level. Industry percent black, percent unemployed, and mandays

lost per 100 workers are coded at the two digit level.40 The fraction

unionized is coded at the three—digit level.4' A quadratic term for industry

unionization was included to allow for a curvilinear relationship between

industrial unionization and union support.

     Wage levels, and union—non—union differences are accounted for by

including the average union wage and the average non—union wage at the

three—digit standard industrial classification level.    Similarly, union and

non—union wage dispersion is included using the standard deviation of the

union wage and the standard deviation of the non—union wage in each
            42
industry.

     A dummy variable coded 1 for elections in states having a right—to—work

law and 0 otherwise is included. Another dummy variable coded 1 for southern

states is also included.43 Finally, a third dummy, coded I for observations
                                                                        14




outside an SMSA for which no SNSA or county data is available, is included.

SMSA and county variables are coded as zero for these observations.

     SMSA data is the percent of all workers unionized within the SMSA and the

percent unemployed.     A quadratic term is included to allow a curvilinear

relationship between community unionization and union support. Unemployment

rates are matched on an annual basis with election data. Mandays lost per

employee was averaged over the three years to obtain a stable measure of
                        44
propensity to strike.        The remainder of the geographic variables are coded

at the county level. The variables included are job concentration, blacks as a

fraction of population, and urbanization.45

     The means and standard deviations of the variables are reported in table

1.   The two equations were estimated using a modification of the Haldane

Minimum Chi—Squared Logit method proposed by Dickens.46 The method allows for

both individual and firm level error variance components. A description of

the method can be found in the Appendix.



IV. FINDINGS

     The estimated coefficients and their standard errors are presented in

Table 2. The approximate impact of a one unit change in each variable on the

probability of voting union is also reported. There are two things worth

noting about the general nature of these results.         First, although many
variables have statistically significant relations with vote, point estimates

and standard errors tell another story. With the exception of unit size,

organizing effort, in both equations, and union size, and the Teamster dununy

in the de—certification equation, no other variables have large impacts.

Given point estimates, variation of other variables within the range of plus

or minus two standard deviations would be associated with less than a 10%
                                                                          15



 change in the percent of workers voting union.         While such changes could
 affect a large number of elections, none would be decisive in even a majority

 of elections.

        Second, these results make it quite clear that the decertification

 process Is very different from the certification process. Of the 31 pairs of

 coefficients, only 17 have the sane sign. Although all variables which have a

 statistically significant relation to decertificatjon         voting also have
 statistically significant relations to certification voting, the signs are not

 the same in 2 out of 3 cases.

        We now proceed with consideration of the relations in each category.



 1. Bargaining Unit

       The   variable with the largest discernible relation within its     normal
range of     variation is unit size.     Figures 1 and 2 depict the estimated
relation.      Our findings are largely the same   as   those of past authors ——
larger    units are less likely to decertify or certify.        The results for

certification elections are qualitatively similar to Cook's in that the

functional form forces a flattering out of the size effect in larger units.

But, this flattering takes place at a much larger unit size. This may be due

to our use of a more flexible functional form.

       The other two variables measured at the bargaining unit level are

interpreted for certifications as indications of management resistance. Both

are statistically significant with the anticipated sign. Workers taking part

in consent elections are about seven percent more likely to vote for the

union. Every doubling in the length of the campaign leads to about a 3% drop
in   percent voting union.
                                                                        16



      Interestingly, the measured effect of campaign length in decertifications

 is nearly the same as in certifications.    While it is arguable that drawing
 out certification drives is in management's interest, it is hard to see why

 this would be the case for decertifications.
                                                The one hypothesis which seems
 consistent with these findings ii that, whatever the reason for the length of

 the campaign, management's superior access to workers allows them to make

 better use of the time.

      As anticipated, the effects of consent elections in decertifications is

 small and not statistically significant.

      Since both the consent and length of elections variable are not prede-

 termined (we might expect employers to vary their resistance in response to

 charges in the significance of the union threat) both equations were estimated

leaving these variables out. All results with respect to other variables were

qualitatively unaffected.



2. Union

     Two of the variables measured at the union level are statistically
significant in the certifications model.     None are in the decertification
model. In the certification model the relation of union size to voting is not

statistically or practically very significant. The coefficient in decertifi-.

cations is larger but is not measured with as much accuracy.

     One of the three organizing variables
                                             is statistically significant in
certification elections. For every one standard deviation (43,000) increase

in the number of workers eligible to vote in elections involving the union,

the predicted probability of a worker voting union increases by about 9.3%.

The probability of workers voting union drops by more than 12% with each

standard deviation (1130) increase in the number of elections a union engages
                                                                        17




 in. (Although this effect is not significant at the .05 level, it would be at

 a .08 level.) Holding these two variables Constant, average unit size has

 almost no relation to voting.

      Interpreting these relations as causal, the net effect of increasing the

 number of units organized for a union organizing average sized units is

 positive. Taking both effects into account, a union which organizes 1,000

 more average sized units can be expected to have about a % higher
                                                                     probability
 of workers voting union. A union which organized units with less than 50

workers (on average) would have a lower probability of success if it engaged

 in more drives.

     Although the signs on these coefficients are consistent with the "exten-

sive—intensive" interpretation suggested above, there may be other interpre-

tations. For instance, there may be differences in the types of units which

are being organized by different unions. These differences might be reflected

in the size of the units a union organizes.

     The coefficients of these organizing variables in the decertification

model are large., but are not measured accurately.

     Of considerable interest are the results with respect to dues and

benefits. Both are related to voting with the expected signs in both models

and dues are statistically significant in the certifications model.          The

coefficients in decertifications are larger than in certifications, which is

what would be expected if workers gain information on these union attributes

over time. However, the coefficients are quite small. An increase of two

standard deviations in union dues ($124 per year) is related to only slightly

more than a 2% decline in the number of workers voting union in certification

elections and 4% in decertifications.
                                                                          18




      Once these other union effects are controlled for, the Teamster dummy is

no longer statistically significant.         Despite this, one can not say that
Teamster involvement in an election is unimportant.           Rather, one cannot
distinguish the effect of Teamster involvement from the effects of other

attributes of that union ——   particularly   its extensive organizing efforts.



3.   Industry

      Several of the industry level variables have statistically significant

coefficients in the certifications specification.          One is statistically
significant in the decertifications specification.

     With other variables controlled for, strike activity is clearly uncor—

related with voting in certifications and decertifications. A two standard

deviation increase in this variable is associated with less than a 1.5%

increase or decrease in the probability of a worker voting union. Further,

the 95% confidence bounds for these effects are in the range of plus or minus

1.8% for certifications and 4.3% for decertifjcations.

     Two studies using micro data have already suggested the importance of the

union wage effect.47 The coefficients found here for certification elections

are statistically significant but considerably smaller.           There are two
possible explanations for this.     Since both previous studies confound the

effects of within plant relative wages with the expected union wage gain it is

possible that much of the previously measured effect is due to the relative

wage effect.    Alternatively, the average difference between union and
non—union wages in an industry could be much larger than the average expected

wage gain in a union representation election election. This would be true,

if, for example, the firms with the largest potential wage change were

unionized first. By 1979 the expected gain could be considerably less than
                                                                             19




 the average union—non—union difference. This would bias coefficient estimates

 downward.

         Pinally,   it   has bean suggested that unionism i a "nor•nial good" ——   that
 people demand more unionism as their incomes increase. The point estimates

 for    the certification model are uggestive of this hypothesis in that if both
 union    and (non—union wages) are a dollar higher, the probability of workers

 voting union is higher, but the effect is very small and far from
 statistically significant.

        The point estimates of the wage effects in decertifications are small and

 imprecise. They also do not have the expected signs.

        It has been argued that unions lower the dispersion of wages and that

they do this because workers want them to. The results of the certifications

model provides statistical support for the second part of this contention.

Workers in industries where non—union wages have a higher standard deviation

are slightly more likely to vote union. But, the relation in decertifications

is the opposite. Perhaps union attempts to compress wages in industries with

higher variance leads to more strife ——         increasing the probability of union
loss.

        Turning to the coefficients of the level of unionization in the industry,

we find no evidence of any saturation effect. But, given the lack of preci-

sion of the estimates, we cannot rule out a substantial relation ——        particu-
larly in decertification elections.

        As we anticipated, workers in industries with higher unemployment rates

are less likely to vote union in both certifications and decertifications. A

two standard deviation increase in the unemployment rate (2.9%) is associated

with a 1.57. decrease in the probability of a worker voting union in a certi-

fication election and a an almost 3% decrease in a decertification.
                                                                          20



      Finally, we find the expected relation between            percent black and
 probability of voting union in certifications. A two standard deviation

 increase in the percent of an industry's workforce which is black (5.98%) is

 associated with more than a 2% increase in the probability of workers voting

 union. No association can be ve'ttified for decertifications



 4. Location

     Only two location variables are statistically significant in the certi-

fications equation. None are in the decertifications equation.

     Workers are about 1.6% more likely to vote union in certification

elections held in right—to—work states. Workers in industries where a large

fraction of local jobs are concentrated among a few employers are slightly

less likely to vote union in certifications.        A two standard deviation
increase in the concentration measure (.076) is associated with about a 1.3%

decrease in the probability of a worker voting union in a certification.

Strangely, SMSA unemployment is positively related to union success. The only

explanation we can think of is that cities with anti—union atomospheres have

been more prosperous in recent years. The estimates of the coefficients of

other geographic variables are too imprecise for us to say much about them.



V. CONCLUSION

     We have examined the influence of 26 variables on voting in certification

and decertification elections. Many are statistically significantly related

to how workers vote in both certification and decertification elections.

However, only unit size and organizing activity were found to have both a

large and statistically significant relation. The effects of other variables
                                                                      21




were small or imprecisely measured. These results contrast sharply with the

 large effects that have been found when more detailed information was avail-

able on each election and/or the attitudes of workers who took part in the

elections.49 Evidently the overwhelming majority of the variation in union

support is within industries, unions, and geographic locations rather than
between.

     A second finding is that union support in certification elections and in

decertification elections are determined by very different processes. The

differences between the effects of variables in certification and decertjfjca—

tion elections noted in the literature survey are real and not the results of

past authors using different samples or specifications.

     One of the unique aspects of this study is our examination of a number of

"economic variables" not used in previous studies. Most of these variables

are statistically significantly related in the expected manner to voting in

certifications, but the coefficients are small. One interesting finding is

that workers in industries with more non—union wage dispersion among produc-

tion workers are somewhat more likely to vote union than others.           This

provides some support for the view that union wage compression is a response

to worker desires.

     Our two measures of management resistance have a larger measured relation

to voting than most of the other variables considered but still less than
other studies.   Although it could be that by controlling for a number of

previously unstudied variables we have reduced the impact of these variables,

it seems more likely that the variables we have chosen were poor proxies.

Voos,50 who also used length of campaign to measure management resistance

obtains similarly weak results. Seeber and Cooke51 find a very large effect

for consent elections, but they use aggregate data. Our results suggest that
                                                                       22



either their consent election variable is acting as a measure of "climate"

rather   than reflecting the direct effects of fewer consent elections, or that

their time series measure is correlated with some left out variable.

     Statistics, Bulletin 2070, 1980). Strike frequency was obtained from the
     Dept. of Labor, Analysis of Work Stoppages (Washington D.C.: Bureau of
     Labor Statistics, 1977; 1978 and 1979). Mandays lost per employee was
     coded as the average mandays lost for 1977, 1978, 1979 divided by the
     employment in the industry. Mandays lost in each industry was obtained
     from Analysis of Work Stonpages (1977,1978, 1979). Industry Employment
     came from BLS employment data for 1978.

11. The estimates for SMSA unionization and industry unionization were
     obtained from Richard B. Freeman and James L. Medoff, "New Estimates of
     Private Sector Unionism in the United States," Industrial & Labor
     Relations Review, Vol. 32 (January 1979), pp. 143—174.

42. Union and non—union average wages and standard deviations were computed
     using the May 1975 CPS tapes.

43. Right—To—Work states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
     Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota,
    Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and
    Wyoming. Southern states are Alabama, Arkansas, District of Columbia,
    Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Lousiana, Maryland, Oklahoma, South
    Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and
     West Virginia.

44. The unionization data was obtained from Freeman and Medoff, "New Esti-
     mates of Private Sector Unionism in the United States," and the unemploy-
     ment data was obtained from Department of Labor, Geographic Profile of
     Employment and Unemployment, 1978 (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Labor
     Statistics, 1979) and Department of Labor, Geographic Profile of Employ-
    ment and Unemployment, 1979 (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Labor Statis-
     tics1 1980) and strike data was obtained from the Department of Labor,
    Analysis of Work Stoppages (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Labor Statis-
     tics, 1977, 1978, 1979). Mandays lost per employee was coded as the
    average mandays per year for the years 1977, 1978, and 1979 divided by
     the average of employment in 1977 and 1978. Mandays lost was obtained
    from Analysis of Work Stoppages (1977, 1978, 1979) and employment was
    obtained from Bureau of the Census, County Business Patterns, U.S.
    Summary and SMSA (1977; 1978).      Prepared by the Bureau of Census.
    Washington D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.

45. Job concentration was coded using County Business Pattern (1978): File 2
     [machine readable data file] prepared by the Bureau of the Census,
    Washington: The Bureau [producer and distributor]. Job concentration was
                                                                          27

     Index with the value of this index
                                        increasing as concentration increases.
     For construction of this index,

                                    Estimation Technique




       One standard approach to estimating models where the dependent variable

is a proportion is to assume that the expected value for the proportion for

each   observation p. is a logistic function of observed variables       or


(1)                             1

                   pi=
                           1+e

Designating the size of each group i as N. and the actual proportion as

       if we assume that NiPi is a binomially distributed random variable with

expected value p.N. then the S s of (1) can be consistently estimated by

regressing




                    log                   on the X s


and   can be efficiently estimated if the variables are all weighted by an

appropriate approximation to the variance of the random variable




                    vi    log                —   log

This is the method oi Minimum Chi—Squared Logit.
                                                                            p. 2



     There are two problems with this as an approach to the data used here.

First some of the p. s are equal to one or zero so that the standard logit

transformation is undefined.       This problem is remedied by adopting the

alternative transformation proposed by Raldane,




                   L.log
                    1    p.
                         1  ___             /         1
                                                            1
                                                                     =X.S
                                                                        1
                                     2N.                   2N.
                                        1                       1)

The second problem is that both logit transformations assume that all attri—

Lutes of an election unit which determine the probability of a worker voting

union are observed. This is certainly not the case. To solve this problem we

augment the Haldane model by assuming



                  L.   X.B +
                   1    1      1



where y.     is an unobserved i.i.d. error tern. Dickens [19851 shows that

this model can be efficiently estimated using a 2—step procedure.            En the

first step consistent estimates of the          s and the variance of the          are

obtained. Weighted estimation is done in the second step to obtain efficient

estimates.
