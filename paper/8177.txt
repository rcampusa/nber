The Influence of the Financial Revolution on the Nature of Firms.

                                   Raghuram G. Rajan and Luigi Zingales*

Major technological, regulatory, and institutional changes have made finance more widely

available in recent years. The ability of financial institutions to price a variety of exotic

instruments, and to assess and spread risks, has increased. More data on potential borrowers is

now available, and it is also more timely. Improvements in accounting disclosure have resulted in

greater borrower transparency. Deregulation has resulted in greater competition and better prices in

financial markets. Finally, regulatory barriers protecting the turf of different kinds of financial

institutions have come down, resulting in the emergence of new institutional forms.

        These changes amount to a bone fide ‚Äúfinancial revolution‚Äù. In this article, we focus on the

impact the financial revolution has had on the way firms are (or should be) organized and

managed, and on the policy consequences. To do this, we first need to understand what firms are

and what drives their organizational structure.

        A caveat is in order at the outset. Finance is not the only force transforming the nature of

firms in the last two decades -- deregulation and technological change have also played a big role.

These have been explored elsewhere (see, for example, Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales

(2000)), hence our focus.

I. Critical Resource Theory

        Ronald Coase (1937) described the realm of the firm or organization as the set of

transactions that are governed by power or authority. This leaves the realm of the market as one

where transactions are governed by arm‚Äôs length contracts. The fundamental question then is how

does anyone in a firm possess power that differs from ordinary market contracting. Sanford

Grossman and Oliver Hart (1986) suggest that because contracts are incomplete, there will be

bargaining between parties involved in production in situations that are not covered by initial

contracts. In such situations, the owner of unique alienable assets that are critical to production
                                                                                                        2


obtains power because ownership gives her control over the assets. But where does power come

from when the firm uses no unique alienable assets in production?

        Consider, for example, what happened when institutional investors, worried about the

direction the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi was taking, attempted to impose discipline by

curtailing the pay of the charismatic chairman, Maurice Saatchi. Maurice Saatchi left, taking with

him many key executives and some important clients ‚Äì a sizeable portion of the firm. The point of

this example is that power in a human-capital-intensive firm may not lie with the legal owners, and

may come from sources other than alienable assets.

        There is a long tradition in sociology (see, for example, Richard Emerson (1962)) and in

management science (see, for example, Birger Wernerfelt (1984)) that suggests power flows from a

variety of resources in short supply (including not just property, but also strategies, ideas, or skills)

that are valuable to the production process. This literature, however, does not focus on how this

power can, or should, be allocated within a firm. Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales (1998,

2001) follow this literature in suggesting power flows from a variety of critical resources, but ask

the further question of how this power can be allocated, and augmented, when the resource is not

an alienable asset, the property rights to which can be enforced by a court.

        They argue that while, sometimes, a person intrinsically possesses a resource (e.g.,

Maurice Saatchi‚Äôs talent) in which case he has power directly, resources also attach through

specialization. Clients and associates had become used to working with Maurice Saatchi and relied

on his unique talents. They would have been much less productive without him. These induced

complementarities (and the lower complementarities they enjoyed with the rest of Saatchi and

Saatchi) tied them to him, allowing his critical resource to become a means of controlling even

more critical resources (the associates‚Äôtalents and the client relationships).

        Thus, unlike ownership of unique alienable assets, which can be allocated simply by sale,

control over other critical resources has to be built up through a variety of mechanisms such as
                                                                                                        3


internal organization, work rules, and incentive schemes. These then induce complementarities

between a resource and other resources (also see Milgrom and Roberts (1990) and Holmstrom and

Milgrom (1994), for examples). More generally, while ownership legally links an inanimate asset

to a firm, complementarities economically link some person or unit that cannot be owned to the

critical resource at the core of the firm. According to critical resource theory, the organization, i.e.,

the realm of transactions governed by authority rather than prices, consists of the critical resource

and the agents and other critical resources that are tied to it via complementarities. Note that we

use the term ‚Äúorganization‚Äù, because the economic organization may have boundaries that are very

different from the legal entity known as the firm.

        Why is the allocation of power so important? First, the allocation of power affects

incentives. Whenever contracts are incomplete or can be easily renegotiated, power serves as a

credible currency with which an internal party who has to take a self-denying action is assured

future compensation. Second, the allocation of power can determine the range of feasible actions a

party has. The powerful head of the bond-trading group in an investment bank can allocate roles so

that members of the group will work together smoothly, and without overlap. Finally, the allocation

of power today can affect the constellation of power in the future, and thus the future efficiency of

the organization.

II. The Effects of the Financial Revolution

        Let us now use this framework to explore the consequences of the financial revolution.

With capital easy to come by, alienable assets such as plant and equipment have become less

unique, especially to those with specific skills. A group of managers in a division are no longer

beholden to the parent because the latter owns their assets. If need be, they can break away, raise

finance directly in the market, and replicate the assets. From the firm‚Äôs perspective, resources other

than alienable assets have become more critical to its ability to survive competition. From the

owner‚Äôs perspective, these resources ‚Äì people, ideas, strategies ‚Äì are harder to control directly. In
                                                                                                       4


particular, some of the ‚Äúglue‚Äù holding these other resources to the organization in the past was their

dependence on it for financing. With the glue evaporating, how should we expect corporations to

respond?

III. An Application: Growth opportunities.

        Consider, in particular, new project ideas, i.e., growth opportunities. A firm‚Äôs existing

assets generate cash flow, and also provide collateral, with which to finance new projects. New

projects also need the technical expertise of employees. In the past, the complementarity between

inside financial capital and human capital held the firm and its growth together. Owners were

happy to let insiders use the funds generated by existing assets to finance new investments because

this secured them property rights on growth opportunities. Insiders were happy to exercise these

options within the legal framework of the existing firm, because their career and earnings potential

was enhanced and, lacking financing, they could not have done it on their own. This balance of

power is reflected in the traditional view of the corporation (e.g., Gordon Donaldson and Jay

Lorsch, 1983), which assumed cash flow ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù to insiders, in the sense that they could, and

should, use it to grow the organization.

        The corporate governance revolution of the 1980s broke this equilibrium. In order to

invest, insiders had to make a case to shareholders that the investment would be profitable, and a

variety of mechanisms were put in place to compel insiders to repay cash if the case was found

wanting. These changes enhanced the efficiency of investments. At the same time, however, they

helped severe the link between assets in place and growth opportunities. If insiders could now

convince both the corporate bureaucracy and outside shareholders of the merit of new internal

projects, they could probably also convince outside financiers to fund the projects as separate

ventures.

        In other words, the financial revolution has subject internal decisions to greater scrutiny,

while making outside decisions easier. Unless there is a strong complementarity between assets in
                                                                                                      5


place and growth opportunities from a technological point of view, there is no reason why new

opportunities should be undertaken within the legal shell represented by the existing company. The

same developments that led outside owners to gain control over internal cash flows, may have

weakened their ability to appropriate many valuable growth opportunities!

        Of course, there are also legal links, such as patents, between assets in place and

opportunities. But patent laws can be maneuvered around, especially by those who know, such as

former employees. Interestingly, Amar Bhide (2000, p.94) reports that 71% of the firms included

in the Inc 500 (a list of young, fast growing firms) were founded by people who exploited a growth

opportunity created by the previous firm that employed them.

        These developments are not all bad. Employees have more options, and their creative

talents need not be stifled by a corporate bureaucracy, thus resulting in more free enterprise. But

the perceived returns to investment in the past included the value of growth options. The

decoupling of growth options from assets in place reduces private returns. So, paradoxically, as

financing becomes more available and cheap, aggregate investment need not increase.

        Existing corporations, however, are unlikely to sit idly by, watching their opportunities

vanish. They will adopt strategies to secure them. Consider some.

How growth options can be secured: Strategy

        One strategy is to build complementarities between assets in place and growth

opportunities. By requiring employees to market a new product under its umbrella brand name, for

instance, a firm ties the product and accessories that might emerge to its existing family of

products, making it harder for any product group to pull up stakes and leave. Thus, something that

initially has no value, like a brand name (or company culture), becomes a critical resource that

other products (or people) are specialized to, helping a firm retain growth opportunities.

        Another strategy is to create a competitive gap between the loyal core of the firm, and any

employees who might be audacious enough to compete. Rajan and Zingales (2001) assume extreme
                                                                                                         6


increasing returns to scale in marketing, so that a larger firm captures a disproportionate share of

the market. In these circumstances, specialized employees become a critical resource who can help

retain unspecialized employees. Intuitively, specialized employees, who have high switching costs,

can be trusted not to expropriate. These loyal Praetorian guards provide the firm with sufficient

scale to dissuade unspecialized employees from leaving and trying to compete. In other words, the

specialized employees give the organization the capability for growth.

        Of course, a firm can protect its opportunities by maintaining a lead in dimensions other

than its organizational capabilities, for instance, with technology. But technology, by itself, can be

imitated. Therefore, the most enduring leads are based upon a combination of organizational

capabilities and technological leadership. When a firm innovates at a very fast pace, and it has a

large specialized core of employees to implement these innovations, its opportunities will be well

protected. By the time a group of departing employees can fill out the gaps in their organizational

structure and ramp up, the technology they depart with may already have become obsolete.

Interestingly, the fact that successful firms are the ones that hold together better will exacerbate

any inherent tendency of product markets to become winner-take-all.

        That complementarities between assets and growth opportunities help a firm retain control

of the latter may explain why the response of many firms to the financial revolution has been a

greater emphasis on focus. This ensures that the growth opportunities the firm generates are in

areas where it has a comparative advantage so that it has a greater chance of retaining them.

        The opportunities emerging from an activity may not always be a natural extension of it,

and may correspond better to something that is related but not identical. Thus too narrow a focus

can also lead to a loss of opportunities. Perhaps the best way to capture all possible growth

opportunities in an area is to maintain the widest possible competence in that narrow area. This

may suggest why successful firms spend so much time and effort in identifying their ‚Äúmission‚Äù. A

well-defined corporate mission keeps firms on a lookout for emerging technologies, which they can
                                                                                                     7


weave into their platform through mergers at an early stage. The widest platform for a given

mission gives the firm ownership over the greatest range of growth opportunities, and thus

potentially greater value.

Governance

        While owners may attempt to protect their interests through changes in business strategy,

we would also expect changes in the emphasis of governance. When a firm‚Äôs critical resources

were mostly alienable assets, outside financiers could easily control a company by owning these

assets, so long as the legal system granted them sufficient protection of their property rights. When

these rights are protected, as in most developed countries, alienable assets gave outsiders so much

power vis-√†-vis insiders that, absent appropriate incentive schemes, insiders were not properly

rewarded for their effort. This may explain the emphasis on pay-for-performance and on the use of

debt as an incentive device, especially in mature industries with little growth opportunities and a lot

of internal free cash flow (Michael Jensen, 1986).

        The financial revolution has weakened the power of alienable assets. Competition has also

increased in many industries, in part for reasons we have not focussed on. In this situation, the

need to maintain a temporal lead over outsiders, and perhaps more important, stave off potential

competition from insiders, may be sufficient to force managers, even in dominant firms in an

industry, to stay on their toes. Resources and effort are less likely to be underemployed when

product market competition is so fierce. As the fate of Encyclopedia Britannica (which was

eclipsed by new, electronic, encyclopedias such as Encarta) indicates, a period of rapid

technological change is unsparing even of mature firms in hitherto mature industries. As a result,

the problem of appropriability, rather than managerial shirking may now be the more important

problem of governance.

        And this could imply very different methods of governance. While Maurice Saatchi‚Äôs

compensation might have seemed excessive by industry standards, it was not given the power he
                                                                                                       8


had. If the directors had wanted to get a greater share of the surplus the firm generated for

shareholders, they should have been focused much earlier on garnering more power. Instead of

simply overseeing the appointment and compensation of top management as most boards do, they

should have been more involved in the details of management and organizational design ‚Äì for

example, specifying who reported to whom and who saw what clients ‚Äì so as to build

complementarities that tied the firm together. By ceding these functions to management, they also

ceded power vital to preserving their interests. In the future, governance will have to focus more on

the acquisition and allocation of power than simply its exercise.

Surplus-sharing

        It may, however, turn out that it is simply not cost-effective for owners to intrude in such a

manner. If so, they will have to part with some of the organizational surplus that hitherto they

appropriated. One way to formalize the future claims of employees is to offer them an explicit

equity stake. Furthermore, a system of delayed vesting of their equity makes their share of the

surplus contingent on staying, serving as additional glue binding the organization. Moreover,

equity-like instruments may also do more ‚Äì they can act as a coordinating device. Let us explain.

        We have argued that new strategies may have components that make them increasing

returns to scale. In any business with increasing returns to scale, being perceived as a leader can

become self-fulfilling. Interestingly, equity participation can be used as a coordinating device.

Consider a virtual exchange ‚Äì a firm that provides the means for others to trade. Its value is a

function of the number of people trading on it, which, in turn, is determined by the number of

people expected to trade there. Distributing shares of a virtual exchange among actual and

potential customers achieves two objectives. First, it gives customers a payoff contingent on

success, making them co-conspirators in the success of the exchange. Second, it provides a signal

of the expected liquidity of the exchange, because the value of the shares will be a function of the

expected volume of trading.
                                                                                                        9


          A new entrant will find it difficult to lure away customers. His equity will not be so

valuable because people do not expect him to succeed. Thus widely distributed equity keeps the

leader and stake-holders together, but also serves to reinforce expectations as a barrier to entry. Of

course, such expectations induce a layer of fragility to the firm ‚Äì a misstep provides an opportunity

to competitors at the same time that the firm‚Äôs integrity is compromised.

Caveats

          In addition to financing, much else has changed. For example, as physical assets have

become less unique, intellectual property may also have become more important and better

protected over time. This may explain why, for example, consulting firms have grown in size,

because at the heart of their business is a shared, appropriable, database of past work.

          Improvements in information technology have also helped owners and top management

monitor and control large, far-flung businesses more easily. Of course, to take advantage of this,

firms require more formalized management practices so that decisions are made on the basis of

hard, easy-to-monitor, information (see Jeremy Stein (1999)). This could leave niches open for

smaller employee-owned enterprises that are willing to make decisions on the basis of soft

information. These developments may explain, for example, the seemingly surprising co-existence

of both mega-banks and small community banks in the same industry.

          We have also focused on the steps owners and top management will take to regain power.

It may be optimal in some cases for them to relinquish power, and for firms to continually

subdivide as new opportunities arise. New sharing arrangements such as corporate venturing

(where the corporation funds its employees to set up on their own) and incubation (where the

corporation nurtures a venture with the promise that it will be set free) may reflect this.

IV. Conclusion and Policy Implications

          The transformation in the nature of the firm spurred by the financial revolution has broad

policy implications. Consider anti-trust. Anti-trust takes as given that the legal firm is a coherent
                                                                                                    10


whole, competing with other legal firms. But, as a result of the financial revolution, links within the

firm may be much weaker than in the past, and conversely, links between firms, tied together for

instance by complementary technologies, may be stronger. This matters.

        For example, one of the concerns about monopoly is that the monopolist may lose the

incentive to innovate. But when financing is easy and the ownership of growth options is up for

grabs, the fear of employees leaving with crucial technology and appropriating a share of the rents

forces a monopolist to maintain its technological lead. Potential internal competition may be more

of a threat than external competition!

        As another example, horizontal mergers in some industries may not be attempts by firms to

gain some market power over customers, but to regain some power over the employees and key

suppliers they used to have when alienable assets were a bigger source of rents.

        Another implication is that the changing nature of the firms requires changes in what is

disclosed to provide a true and fair picture of a business. Thus far, accounting disclosure has

focused on assets in place (balance sheet) and the cash flow generated (income statement and

statement of cash flow), because these were the main sources of value. But if an important source

of value is the ability to retain human capital, and exploit growth opportunities, changes in the

accounting system are warranted. At a minimum, it should disclose how successful the firm is at

retaining (key) employees. Clever measures to capture the value of these employees as well as the

fraction of generated growth opportunities that are exploited are also called for.
