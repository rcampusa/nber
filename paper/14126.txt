Exchange Rate Regimes and the Extensive Margin of Trade

JEL No. F4

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper finds that currency unions and direct exchange rate pegs raise trade through distinct channels.
Panel data analysis of the period 1973-2000 indicates that currency unions have raised trade predominantly
at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast, direct pegs have worked almost
entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade of existing products. A stochastic general equilibrium
model is developed to understand this result, featuring price stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty.
Because both regimes tend to reliably provide exchange rate stability over the horizon of a year or
so, which is the horizon of price setting, they both lead to lower export prices and greater demand
for exports. But because currency unions historically are more durable over a longer horizon than
pegs, they encourage firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market. The model
predicts that when exchange rate uncertainty is completely and permanently eliminated, all of the
adjustment in trade should occur at the extensive margin.

1.       Introduction

A primary rationale given by many countries adopting regimes of exchange rate stabilization,

be it a peg or a full currency union, is the goal of promoting more international trade. Despite a

long literature failing to show a robust linkage between exchange rate variance and trade, Rose

(2000) stimulated a great deal of interest by finding that the adoption of a currency union

historically has tended to raise bilateral trade by a large amount.1 Subsequent literature

generally has supported the statistical significance, if not the magnitude of this result.2 In

addition, Klein and Shambaugh (2006) find that adopting a direct peg, in which a country fixes

its exchange rate to a particular trading partner, also has a significant effect to raise bilateral

trade.

         This paper studies the effect of exchange rate regimes on bilateral trade by

decomposing trade into its extensive and intensive margins, where the extensive margin is an

increase in the number of firms or products, and the intensive margin is a rise in the value of

trade by existing firms or products. Recent research in trade theory has emphasized this

distinction, as it has implications for the welfare gains of trade and resource allocation. The

empirical section of this paper conducts panel gravity regressions, analogous to those of Rose

(2000) and Klein and Shambaugh (2006), but it considers three distinct independent variables:

bilateral trade flows, the extensive margin of bilateral trade, and the intensive margin. The

extensive and intensive margins are measured using the NBER/UN data base prepared by

Robert Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, which records bilateral trade flows at a 4-digit

disaggregated goods level. This data set covers the years 1962-2000, so it does not include the

recent experience of the European Monetary Union. Consequently the results for currency

unions, like those in Rose (2000), are based on countries that are mainly small or poor, so

implications are not directly applicable to EMU members. The exchange rate regime

classifications used are from Klein and Shambaugh (2007).

        The empirical work first confirms two stylized facts from previous work: both

currency unions and direct pegs raise trade flows, and the effect is somewhat larger for

currency unions than for pegs. Of greater novelty are two additional stylized facts that are

uncovered. Currency unions have a large and statistically significant effect at the extensive

margin, but a small and insignificant effect at the intensive margin. In contrast, direct pegs

exhibit just the opposite pattern: a small and insignificant effect at the extensive margin, but a

significant effect at the intensive margin. Our overall empirical conclusion, then, is that while

currency unions and direct pegs both raise trade flows, they appear to work through distinct

channels. These findings offer some new insight into the role of exchange rate regimes in

facilitating trade, which are useful in discriminating among alternative theories.3

        The theoretical section of this paper develops a potential explanation for these

empirical findings. It builds upon developments in international macroeconomics, in modeling

how exchange rate uncertainty affects the price-setting of firms under price stickiness. But it

also utilizes some recent developments in trade theory, which model firm entry decisions in the

face of fixed costs.4 As a result, this paper is among the very first to model how exchange rate




3
  Related to this work, Baldwin and Di Nino (2006), Bergin and Glick (2007), and Kehoe and Ruhl
(2002) find in studies of the specific case of the euro area that there appears to be a significant effect on
the extensive margin. This study agrees with this point, though for a different set of countries, and it goes
on to find a contrasting result for direct pegs.

  Entry here can be interpreted either as additional firms or additional product lines. We do not explicitly
model multi-product firms, as done in Bernard et al. (2006).


                                                      2
uncertainty affects firm entry decisions under sticky prices.5 The model is a stochastic general

equilibrium monetary model with two symmetric countries. It specifies that prices must be set

before the monetary shocks driving exchange rates are known, and that the entry decision must

be made a period prior to this. Motivated by empirical evidence, we assume that while both

pegs and currency unions are credible in eliminating exchange rate volatility over the horizon

that prices are pre-set, only a currency union is credible for the longer horizon over which entry

decisions must be determined.

        As a result, both regimes lower the riskiness of foreign sales when the firm is setting

price, which results in lower export prices and higher export sales, consistent with our first

empirical fact. However, the existence of a peg when a firm is deciding on entry is not very

informative about the exchange rate behavior in the later period when export sales take place.

As a result, only the currency union encourages more entry relative to a freely floating

exchange rate regime. This is consistent with the last two of our empirical facts above. In fact,

the model predicts that 100 percent of the rise in trade volume when a currency union

eliminates exchange rate uncertainty comes at the extensive margin, with no impact on the

intensive margin. This is somewhat surprising, since one might expect the risk premium in

prices, used by firms to hedge against exchange rate uncertainty in price setting, could also



5
  This project differs from other prominent research in the field. Ghironi and Melitz (2005) show how to
combine recent developments in trade theory with a macroeconomic model. But it focuses on the dynamic
response to real shocks; it did not include money, nominal exchange rates, nor the nominal rigidities
needed to study the real effects of exchange rate regimes. Naknoi (2007) is the first to have a monetary
model with endogenous tradability and nominal stickiness. However, it studies an entirely different issue,
trying to explain the source of exchange rate variability, rather than how exchange rate risk affects entry
decisions. Kumhof, Laxton, and Naknoi (2007) is the first to integrates trade theory and trade frictions
into a monetary model which is usable for policy analysis, doing so in a very rich dynamic setting.
However, this paper again studies a different issue than the present project, as it focuses on how exchange
rate movements induce costly adjustments in trade flows, where the real costs of adjustment impose a
welfare loss; it does not study the issue of special interest here, regarding how exchange rate variability
has level effects on the mean level of trade.


                                                    3
help hedge against the effects of risk on the entry decision. But this is not the case. Finally, the

fact that currency unions induce a larger entry of new varieties interacts with love for variety in

preferences to stimulate more expenditure on exported goods than under a peg, which results in

a larger impact of currency unions on overall trade flows. This is consistent with the second of

our four empirical facts.

        In related work, Baldwin et al. (2005) proposes a model of how a reduction in exchange

rate uncertainty under a currency union stimulates the extensive margin. Our paper differs in

that it models the effect of uncertainty from first principles, tracing how it affects price setting

and entry decisions.6 In addition, our model is able to distinguish between the effects of

reducing exchange rate uncertainty through direct pegs versus currency unions.



2.      Empirical Analysis

The study uses a panel dataset which covers 148 countries’ bilateral exports at an annual

frequency from 1973 to 2000. Our range of counties and the end date of our sample are

determined by the availability of the disaggregated trade data needed for us to measure the

extensive margin. These data come from the NBER-UN World Trade Data set, developed by

Rob Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, documented in Feenstra et al. (2005). This data set computes

annual bilateral trade flows at the four-digit Standard International Trade Classification, by

performing a series of adjustments on UN trade data7. For data on exchange rate regime

classifications, we use the classifications in Klein and Shambaugh (2006, 2007), hereafter


6
  In contrast, Baldwin et al. (2005) introduces exchange rate uncertainty in a more ad hoc manner by
introducing the variance of exchange rates as a term in a firm loss function. Further, he does not study
how uncertainty affects trade and entry by affecting price-setting decisions.
7
  It is noted that the data purchased from the UN for 1984-2000 only had values in excess of $100,000, for
each bilateral flow. To be consistent, the cutoff of exports in this study is set as $100,000, which implies
that goods are considered nontradable if an export value of the category is less than $100,000.


                                                     4
referred to as KS. Although the bilateral trade data starts earlier than 1973 (in 1962), we

follow KS in focusing on the post Bretton Woods period. As they note, the pegs in Bretton

Woods were part of a multilateral system with extensive capital controls, and so are quite

different from more contemporary unilateral pegs. Nonetheless, we will show in supplementary

tables that our results are quite robust to a longer sample range. Geographic data needed for our

regressions come from the data set of Andrew Rose (Rose, 2004).

        The definition of a peg in this data set requires that the bilateral exchange rate stays

within a 2% band at the end of each month the entire year, and direct peg occurs when it can be

identified in addition that one country pegs to a particular base country. In any one year about

50% of the countries in the sample are involved in a peg with some other country. Many of

these are a developing country pegging to an industrialized one. There is a great deal of regime

switching among these countries. Klein and Shambaugh (2007) note that 44% of pegs last for

only one year. Interestingly, there is also a high rate of regime change among floats; 36 percent

of floats spells also last for only one year.

        The definition of a currency union is a strict one, as in Rose (2000), that currencies

trade at a 1 to 1 rate. As noted in KS, the currency unions usually involve countries that are

small or poor. In our sample there are 65 country pairs that show a currency union

relationship.8 These relationships are much more stable than pegs, in that only 9 of the 65

country pairs exhibited a change in regime during the entire 28 year sample.

     Following Hummels and Klenow (2005), the extensive margin is measured in a manner

consistent with consumer price theory by adapting the methodology in Feenstra (1994). The

extensive margin of exports from country j to country m, denoted byEM mj, is defined as

where X mW,i is the export values from the world to country j of product category I, I mj is the set

of observable categories in which country j has positive exports to country m, and X mW is the

aggregate value of world exports to country m. The extensive margin is a weighted count of

country j’s categories relative to all categories exported to country m, where the categories are

weighted by their importance in world’s exports to country m.

     The corresponding intensive margin of exports from country j to country m, denoted by

 IM mj , is defined as
                                                    X mj

where X mj is the total export value from country j to country m. The intensive margin is

measured as j’s export value relative to the weighted categories in which country j exports to

country m. Therefore, multiplying the intensive margin by the extensive margin produces

country j’s share of world exports to country m, denoted by EXSharemj ,

                                                          X mj                                 (3)

     The categories of goods exported might differ across exporters and change over time.

With the same level of share of world exports to country m at time t, the measurement implies

that country j would have a higher extensive margin measure if it exports many different

categories of products to country m, whereas, it would have a higher intensive margin if

country j only export a few categories to country m.




                                                                6
     Separate panel regressions are run by regressing the extensive margin, the intensive

margin, and the exporter’s total share on the exchange rate regime variables, as well as the

standard set of gravity model variables. The benchmark regressions take the form:

        Y jm ,t = β 0 + β1CU jm ,t + β 2 Peg jm ,t + β 3 IdPeg jm ,t + β 4 ex var jm ,t + λ X jm ,t + γ F jm + φ t
        +κ exp + ωimp + ε jm ,t                                                                                      (4)

The model is estimated based on the ordinary least squares with robust standard errors

clustered in export pair level, where j is the exporter and m is the importer. The dependent

variables ( Y jm ,t ) will be either the logarithm of country j’s extensive margin of exports to

country m, the logarithm of country j’s intensive margin, or the logarithm of share of world

exports. Regressors include dummies for the exchange rate regime: CU jm ,t for a currency

union, Peg jm ,t for and direct peg, and IdPeg jm ,t for an indirect peg. The regressor ex var jm ,t is

a measure of volatility of the nominal exchange rate between countries j and m, which is the

standard deviation of the first difference of the logarithm of the monthly exchange rate

between the two countries. Next, X jm ,t is a set of variables that vary over time, which includes

the logarithm of real GDP per capita of exporter j relative to real GDP per capita of all

countries who export to importer m, logarithm of exporter j’s population relative to real GDP

per capita of all countries who export to importer m, a dummy variable indicating whether the

two countries had a free trade agreement at time t, and a dummy variable for pairs currently in

colonial relationship. F jm is a set of variables that do not vary over time, such as the logarithm

of distance between country j and m, a common language dummy, a land border dummy, and a

dummy for pairs ever in colonial relationship. Also included is a time effect, t, to control for

time-specific factors such as global shocks or business cycles.




                                                            7
     To avoid omitting variables that may affect bilateral trade, two vectors of dummy

variables, exp and imp, are included indicating exporter and importer fixed effects. As

Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) proposed, country effects are included as controls for

multilateral resistance. We decided to use separate country fixed effects for each country as

exporter and importer, because in contrast with the related literature on trade flows, our

dependent variable specifies the direction of trade.9

     Initial results are reported in Table 1, covering the sample with country fixed effects from

1973 to 2000. Currency union has a highly statically significant effect to raise both overall

exports and the extensive margin of exports, but an insignificant (small negative) effect at the

intensive margin. In contrast, a direct peg has a significant effect to raise overall trade and the

intensive margin, but the effect at the extensive margin is insignificant. The coefficients for

currency union imply that a currency union would raise the export share by 122% because of a

149% increase in the extensive margin.10 So all of the rise in trade comes at the extensive

margin. A peg can increase export share by 26%, which comes from 25% increase in the

intensive margin of exports. So virtually all of the rise in trade comes at the intensive margin.

In summary, there are four facts observed for this data set. First, both exchange rate regimes

raise bilateral trade, but second, currency unions have a larger effect. Third, currency unions

work at the extensive margin, while fourth, direct pegs work at the intensive margin.




9
  Country-pair fixed effects could be useful if trade resistance is bilateral rather than multilateral in nature.
But we do not implement this in the estimation, as it would eliminate cross-sectional variation in the
panel and leaving only time-series variation. Country pairs that have no regime switch for the entire
sample period do not yield information in the estimate. In the study of the impacts of currency union, we
can even less afford to sacrifice cross-sectional information. There are 65 country pairs ever had a
currency union, but only 9 of them had a regime switch in the sample period.
10
   The export share is 2.22 times higher (122%) because exp(0.796) = 2.22; the extensive margin is 2.49
times higher (149%) because exp(0.913) = 2.49.


                                                       8
       Regarding other coefficients, exchange rate volatility does not have a statistically

significant effect on overall trade, echoing results in other studies. The coefficients on indirect

peg are negative, which is somewhat surprising. The standard gravity variables are generally

significant and of the expected sign.

       Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) note that multilateral resistance could change over

time, indicating that the country fixed effects used in the previous regression are not sufficient

controls. Table 2 reports results when we use country-year fixed effects, where separate

country fixed effects are included for each year in the panel regression. We will follow Klein

and Shambaugh (2006) in using this specification as our benchmark result. Results are very

similar to those reported above, where currency union has a significant effect to raise overall

trade and the extensive margin, and direct pegs have significant effects on overall trade and the

intensive margin. However, the magnitude of currency union impacts are somewhat smaller.

Translating coefficients, a currency union raises the overall trade share by 84%, raises the

extensive margin 84% and raises the intensive margin 0%. A direct peg raises overall trade

share by 25%, the extensive margin by 0%, and the intensive margin by 25%. Again we see

that while both exchange rate regimes raise overall trade, they are entirely distinct in terms of

the margins of trade through which they work.

       Next, consider robustness of results to controlling for endogeneity with instrumental

variables estimation. One might be concerned that exchange rate regimes could respond to an

anticipated change in bilateral trade, rather than bilateral trade responding to a change in the

exchange rate regime. The instrumental variable used here is the same as in Klein and

Shambaugh (2006), the percentage of countries in country j’s region that are directly pegged

with country i for a given pair of country i and j. The instrument predicts whether a country




                                                  9
pegs its currency, and thereby can indirectly affect trade, but it will have no direct impact on

trade, itself. Table 3 shows that results are very similar to those reported above. In particular,

the pattern of significance for currency unions and pegs is unchanged. The magnitude of the

currency union coefficient in Table 3 is very close to that from Table 1, and the direct peg

coefficient is about twice as large as in Table 1.

        Finally, Table 4 shows results for estimating over the date range prior to Bretton

Woods, 1962-2000. Results again are very similar. The only exception being that in the case of

IV estimation, the direct peg loses its significance on the overall export share.



3.      Theoretical Analysis

The purpose of this section is to study theoretically the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on

firms’ decisions to enter export markets. We use a stochastic general equilibrium model of two

symmetric countries with price stickiness and fixed costs of entry into both domestic and

export markets. Uncertainty comes from monetary shocks in both countries, and we assume

balanced trade.11 To permit a closed form solution for the number of firms entering under

uncertainty, the model will abstract from firm heterogeneity; however, the concluding section

will conjecture on heterogeneity’s likely implications for the paper’s results. A key element in

this analysis will be prices that need to be preset before firms observe the shocks determining

exchange rates. Given uncertain valuation of profits from foreign sales, and assuming

preferences where consumption and leisure are substitutes, firms will hedge against risk by

setting higher prices on exported goods. This risk premium in prices has implications similar to


11
  All our results hold also under the alternative assumption of complete asset markets, which replaces the
balanced trade condition with the following risk sharing condition: u ct u ' ct = Et P * t Pt . This implies
                                                                       2    2     2
                                                                                      1
                                                                                          1

that our results are robust to including assets usable for exchange rate hedging.


                                                     10
iceberg trade costs in more standard trade models. Higher export prices will discourage

demand for traded goods and reduce the volume of trade. This effect applies equally to all

exchange rate regimes that lower exchange rate volatility, both currency union and direct peg

alike. To distinguish between these two regimes, we draw on the empirical observation that

about half of new pegs do not survive more than one year, whereas currency unions tend to last

many years. We model the effect this has on entry decisions, by assuming that the fixed cost

must be paid earlier than price setting, when there is still uncertainty about the exchange rate

regime that will prevail when sales take place.

          For the sake of clarity in describing the sequence of events and information sets, we

specify a three period model. The final period (t2) is when production and all sales take place.

This is the period where the shocks are revealed, which determine the equilibrium values of the

exchange rate, wages, and production. In the period previous (t1), firms must choose their

prices for domestic and foreign sales, based upon their expectations for shocks and equilibrium

values the subsequent period. The firms’ decision to enter a market must be made in the period

previous to this (t0), based upon their expectations conditional on information in this period.

We assume that currency unions adopted in period t0 can be expected to continue to exist in

periods t1 and t2. By contrast, we assume that direct pegs adopted in period t0 last through

period t1, but then are expected to fail by the time period t2 begins. Likewise, direct pegs

adopted in period t1 are expected to last to the end of period t2. To permit an analytical

solution, we assume firm expectations assign a zero probability to a direct peg adoption ex-

ante.12


12
  Given that Klein and Shambaugh (2007) show that a new peg has a 44% chance of failing after its first
year, a better assumption would be to model agent expectations for a corresponding probability
distribution of a peg and float in year t2. But this assumption proved intractable for an analytical solution
comparing across regimes.


                                                     11
          While we use a three-period characterization of the model for clarity, an equivalent

characterization (under i.i.d. shocks) that more naturally maps into our empirical study would

be as an infinite horizon of annual observations. Prices are chosen at the beginning of each

year, for sales later that same year, and entry decisions are made one year ahead of time. Pegs

adopted at the beginning of the year are expected to last until the end of the year, but not until

the next year. In this characterization, period t2 corresponds to the end of the year, t1 to the

beginning of the year, and t0 to the end of the previous year.

          In the notation below, the dating convention will be to date variables by the period in

which they are determined.



3.1 Households

     There is a continuum of identical households in each of the two countries, designated

home and foreign, and the population in each country is normalized to one. A representative

household in the home country consumes n H varieties of home goods, and n F varieties of

goods exported from the foreign country. He supplies labor, receives profits from owning an

equal proportion of domestic firms, and holds home money through a cash-in-advance

constraint. The representative household of the Home country maximizes the expectation of

utility

                 U ( Ct2 , lt2 )                                                              (5)

in period 2, where C is aggregate consumption, l is leisure, and where it is assumed that

consumption and leisure are substitutes. Aggregate consumption is defined as a nested CES

aggregator, with a potentially distinct elasticity between home and foreign goods aggregates

( φ ), and among varieties from a given country ( μ ).

love for variety, in that γ -1 represents the marginal utility gain from spreading a given amount

of consumption on a basket that includes one additional good variety in a symmetric

equilibrium.

      Households hold and receive only domestic currency from the government. The cash-in-

advanced constrain is13

                 Pt1 Ct2 = M t2 .                                                                  (8)

The budget constraint of the household in the Home country is presented by

                 Pt1 Ct2 = Wt2 Lt2 + Π t2 = M t2 ,                                                 (9)

where W is the nominal wage rate and Π is the household’s ownership income from the

activity of firms. The first order condition of the consumer’s problem yields the labor supply

relation,

  The government is assumed to impose an identical tax at the end of the period after all transactions are
made. Money will then serve as a unit of account in each country, but does not have any distortionary
effect by itself.

2.2 Firms’ Behavior

         Production technology is assumed to be linear in labor:



                                                                                     14
                yHt2 ( i ) = ALHt2 ,                                                          (15)

where A represents productivity, which is assumed deterministic and homogeneous across

firms. Firms pay an equilibrium wage rate W for each unit of labor. To produce for domestic

sale, firms must also pay a fixed cost, F, in domestic labor units. To export, firms pay an

iceberg cost, τ , as well as committing to pay a fixed cost, F * , which is in units of domestic

labor. Firms must pre-commit to paying both types of fixed costs in period t0. It is assumed that

the fixed cost of entering the domestic market is lower than that of entering the export market

(F<F*), due to the additional costs of language, product standards, legal barriers, and

transactions costs associated with currency conversion.

        Firms must set prices in the currency of the buyer in period t1 for sales in period t2,

before knowing the realization of monetary shocks. Each firm would maximize the expected

market value of total nominal profits from domestic and exported markets. Since households

are the owners of firms, uncertain profits across states are discounted using the marginal utility

of consumption.

        A home firm’s problem is to maximize its expected profits:

3.3 Equilibrium Nominal Exchange Rate Determination

     The equilibrium nominal exchange rate can be derived explicitly, under the assumption of

a fully symmetric structure. Foreign exchange market clearing requires that excess supply of

the two currencies must be zero in equilibrium. Under the assumption of balanced trade, equate

the value of imports to the value of export revenue:

                PFt1 C Ft 2 − st 2 PHt* 1 C Ht
                                            *

Assume full symmetry across countries, so PFt = PHt* and Pt = Pt * . Substituting the demand
                                                        1        1   1   1

                st 2 =                                                                         (25)
                         M t*2

The equilibrium nominal exchange rate is equal to the ratio of money supplies. Clearly, this is

a very simple exchange rate equation, but it captures the relationship between nominal

exchange rate and fundamentals directly.

     In addition, it’s assumed that the Home and Foreign money supplies, M and M * , are both

log-normally distributed, which is defined by

                             log ( M ) = m + ε                                                (26)

where m is a constant and ε is an i.i.d random variable with a normal distribution, N ( 0,σ m2 ) .

This implies,

                                       ⎛          ⎞
                   Et1 ( M t 2 ) = exp ⎜ m + σ m2 ⎟

                                       ⎝    2     ⎠

The distribution of M and M * is jointly symmetric, with a correlation that equals 1 under a

peg and a currency union, and a correlation that equals zero under pure float. This implies that



                                                            17
       *
m = m and σ m2 = σ m*2 = σ 2 , thus the uncertainty of the nominal exchange rate under a pure float

comes from the randomly distributed disturbance in the money supply, σ 2 ,

3.4 Effects of Exchange Rate Regimes on Price Setting

and van Wincoop (2000). Using equations (10) and (25) to substitute for the endogenous wage

           Consider first the case of a floating exchange rate, where the money supplies of the two

countries move independently. Under the assumption of substitutability between consumption

and leisure, it must be that Et ⎡⎣u l t M t ⎤⎦ < Et ⎡⎣u l t M * t ⎤⎦ . Intuitively, a shock raising home

money supply will raise home consumption but not foreign consumption, because the cash in

advance constraint for home money involves only home consumption. Because home

consumption includes both home and foreign goods, this will lower both home and foreign

labor. Given that consumption and leisure are substitutes, the rise in home consumption will

help offset the rise in the marginal utility of leisure when it is due to a home money rise. This is

not true for a rise in foreign money, which lowers home leisure but does not raise home

consumption. As a result, the home marginal utility of leisure has a smaller covariance with

view this is that the rise in wage rate needed to clear the money market is higher for a foreign

money shock than a home money shock, so that the expected costs of production rise more for

a foreign money shock. The higher price represents a risk premium associated with sales

abroad. This, along with the fact that exporters must pay the iceberg trade cost, ensures that

export prices are higher than domestic goods prices. Of course, if we were to assume instead

that consumption and leisure were not substitutes, this result would change. See the appendix

of Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000) for a proof of this point.

        Next consider the case where exchange rates are fixed, which requires that home and

foreign money supplies are perfectly correlated. This condition is true for both direct pegs and

currency unions. Now a rise in money supply (home and foreign together) will always raise

home consumption along with the fall in leisure. So Et ⎡⎣u l t M t ⎤⎦ = Et ⎡⎣u l t M * t ⎤⎦ , and there is no
                                                                                        1       2       2       1       2

risk premium raising export prices over domestic prices; export prices will be higher only due

to iceberg trade costs.

        Given that shocks are i.i.d. and prices are preset, then conditional on knowledge of the

exchange rate regime, prices will not be time-varying. Let us indicate these constant prices

with over-bars, and summarize the results above with the following statement:

                          p H ,CU ( i )       p H , Peg ( i )       p H , float ( i )

3.5 Effects of Exchange Rate Regimes on Number of Firms

We next study the implications of the entry conditions (22) and (23) under alternative

exchange rate regimes. Consider first a currency union. In this case, it is known already in


                                                                          19
period t0 that there will be no exchange rate movements in period t2, so firms expect that prices

set in period t1 will correspond to the result derived above for a fixed exchange rate. Under this

information set, the entry condition (22) then can be written:

                                                                                                                           1

(See the appendix for the derivation.) The subscript CU indicates a currency union, but for

prices we continue to use the subscript fix, because this term will apply to all cases where

exchange rates are fixed, including a direct peg. The exponent depends on the degree of love of

variety, γ , as well as the aggregate elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods,

φ . If we assume no love for variety ( γ = 1 ), then the exponent takes the value of 1 and

                                                                                                                                    μ
disappears. Under the calibration consistent with Dixit-Stiglitz preferences ( γ =                                                      , where μ

is the elasticity of substitution between varieties), this exponent takes the value

( μ − 1) ( μ − φ ) . The corresponding condition for the domestic number of firms is analogous.

It turns out to be very convenient to express the two as a ratio, as several terms common across

the two cancel under symmetry across countries (including some expectations difficult to deal

with, Et ⎡⎣u ct M t ⎤⎦ and Et ⎡⎣u ct Wt ⎤⎦ ) :

This expression can be viewed as the product of two terms, the first being a relative price term,

and the second a relative fixed cost term. The exponent on the price term can take the value of

1 − φ for the case of no love for variety, or the value of ( μ − 1)(1 − φ ) / ( μ − φ ) for the case of

Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, both of which will be negative for values of φ > 1 . In the case of a


                                                                             20
currency union, the price set by firms is the same in both markets, except for the iceberg cost,

so entry in the export market is lower than domestic entry due only to the presence of iceberg

and fixed trade costs.

         Consider next the case of a float. As derived in the appendix,

And taking a ratio to the analogous entry of home firms into the domestic market:

         Finally, we consider the case of a direct peg. Because firms expect a peg adopted in

period t0 to collapse by period t2, the expectation in period t0 for prices in t1 are the same prices

as under a float. Hence the number of firms determined in period t0 will be the same as under a

3.6 Implications for Export Share, and the Extensive and Intensive Margins.

        Finally, we are ready to decompose the effects of exchange rate regimes into extensive

and intensive margins. As this is a two-country model, whereas the data set is from a multi-

country setting, we must work a bit to construct theoretical measures of the trade margins as

close as possible to those in the empirical work. The extensive margin in the empirical section

scales the number of products traded between two countries by the trade in products with all

countries; in our two-country world, we will scale the number of firms traded by the number of

all firms that sell domestically. This scaling, similar in spirit, allows us to use the relative

extensive margin measure derived in the section above due to symmetry:

In keeping with this measure of the extensive margin, we will measure the export share as the

ratio of the value of home exports to the foreign market divided by the value of domestic sales

in the foreign market. Under symmetry:

We know from the discussion of price setting that the second term is greater than unity,

reflecting the fact that under a float export prices are higher than domestic prices due to risk,

while under a currency union this is not true. Lower export prices will raise export revenues

provided demand is elastic. And we know from the discussion of extensive margins that the

first term is greater than unity, provided there is love for variety. So we have two reasons why

trade is higher under a currency union: lower export prices relative to domestic prices, and love

of variety.

            For a direct peg, firm-level price setting is the same as a currency union, while the

number of firms is the same as under a float:

The rise in trade under a currency union is greater than under a direct peg, by a factor

proportional to the rise in the extensive margin, with the proportionality depending on love for

variety.

          Next, decompose the rise in export share into extensive and intensive margins. Using

conditions (33) and (35) with (41):

So the percentage rise in export share from float to currency union is equal to the percentage

rise in the extensive margin. That is, 100% of the rise in trade is attributable to the extensive

margin, and none due to the intensive margin. This result is consistent with our empirical

finding. Nonetheless, it is somewhat surprising. Given that firms hedge against exchange rate

risk in price setting with a risk premium raising prices, one might expect this would also help

hedge against the effects of exchange rate risk on the entry decision. But this is not the case.

          The story is quite different for a direct peg. Given that the extensive margin is

unchanged from a float to a direct peg, by definition, the rise in export share is all due to the

intensive margin. This again corresponds to our empirical finding.



4.        Conclusion

This paper finds that currency unions and direct pegs raise trade volume through distinct




                                                                                24
channels. Panel data analysis of the period 1973-2000 indicates that currency unions have

raised trade largely at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast,

direct pegs have raised trade almost entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade in existing

products. A theoretical model is developed to understand this finding, featuring price

stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty. Because both regimes provide exchange rate

stability over the horizon of price setting, they lead to lower export prices and greater demand

for exports. But because currency unions are more credible at a longer horizon, they encourage

firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market.

       Our model does not rule out the possibility that adopting a currency union could

additionally expand the extensive margin by affecting fixed costs. These could involve

deterministic effects, such as the elimination of currency conversion or other transactions costs,

which would lower the fixed cost F*. In addition, the model could be extended to consider

fixed costs that themselves are affected by exchange rate risk, such as entry into foreign

markets committing to fixed expenditures in foreign labor units in future periods. The fixed

costs term, F*, then becomes stochastic, and its expected value could fall under exchange rate

stabilization, encouraging entry.

       This model abstracted from firm heterogeneity, in order to get a closed form solution

under uncertainty for the number of firms. If firms were heterogeneous in terms of their

productivity levels, this likely would work in the opposite direction of explaining the higher

rise in exports under a currency union compared to a direct peg. Since a currency union implies

a larger extensive margin effect, the new entrants would systematically have lower productivity

than incumbent firms. This would lower the average productivity of market participants and

raise the export price index, which would limit the increase in aggregate trade volume.
