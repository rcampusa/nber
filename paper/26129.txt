Covered Interest Parity Deviations: Macrofinancial Determinants

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper studies how several macrofinancial factors are associated over time with the evolution
of covered interest parity (CIP) deviations in the decade after the Global Financial Crisis.
Changes in a number of risk- and policy-related factors have a significant association with the
evolution of CIP deviations. Key measures of FX market liquidity and intermediaries' risk-taking
capacity are strongly correlated with the cross-currency basis (the deviation from CIP), and the
close relationship between broad U.S. dollar strength and the basis is driven mainly by a common
factor depending on other safe-haven currencies' comovements. Postcrisis monetary policies also
play a role, as demonstrated by the relationship between CIP deviations, central bank balance
sheets, and term premia. Risk-related factors have more explanatory power than monetary policy-
related factors over the entire 2010-2018 period, but they are approximately equally influential
over the period's second half. Further highlighting the role of bank regulation, we offer evidence
that the year-end dynamics of the three- month dollar basis depend on financial regulations
targeting global systemically important financial institutions.

1     Introduction
The principle of covered interest parity (CIP), set out by Keynes (1923) during the floating ex-
change rate period after World War I, is a fundamental building block of international finance.
Absent counterparty risk, CIP is a pure no-arbitrage relationship that equates the premium of a
currency's forward over its spot exchange rate (both rates expressed as the price of foreign cur-
rency) to its nominal interest-rate advantage over foreign currency. CIP is the most fundamental
relationship linking integrated money and foreign exchange markets.
    For several decades until the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), CIP appeared to hold quite closely
­ even as a broad macroeconomic description applying to weekly or even daily data. But as a
growing number of studies document, and as we explore further below, the relationship seems
to have broken down since the onset of the GFC. That CIP deviations emerged in the turbulence
of the GFC is not surprising in view of counterparty fears, and is not unprecedented either. What
has been more puzzling is the continuation of CIP deviations ­ at times larger, at times smaller
­ well after the GFC, and even for virtually riskless transactions (Du, Tepper and Verdelhan,
2018). This phenomenon is important for at least three reasons. First, it may be evidence of
financial-market frictions or unintended policy consequences that potentially entail inefficient
resource allocation. Second, it may imply a change in the way macroeconomic policies (especially
monetary policies) transmit across borders. Third, CIP deviations may elucidate asset pricing in
a world where financial intermediary constraints are stochastic and potentially binding (Du,
Hebert and Huber, 2019) ­ to some degree they capture financial stresses that simultaneously
affect a range of markets.1
    Even before the GFC, CIP seems to have rarely held exactly. Detailed tick-frequency studies
such as Akram, Rime and Sarno (2008) were able to detect small and transient ­ but economically
meaningful ­ departures from CIP. Nonetheless, CIP still provided an excellent guide to the
relationship among forward and spot exchange rates and interest rates at the macro level. As
Akram, Rime and Sarno (2008, p.238) put it, "the lack of predictability of arbitrage and the
fast speed at which arbitrage opportunities are exploited and eliminated imply that a typical
researcher in international macro-finance using data at the daily or lower frequency can safely
assume that CIP holds." This claim is no longer valid.2
    The failure of CIP has several policy implications. A first relates to the global financial cycle,
and specifically, the claim that even small economies can exercise monetary policy independently
of the Federal Reserve's interest rate choice because forward and spot exchange rates will adjust
automatically to insulate the domestic monetary policy setting from the Fed's (Bernanke, 2017).
Unless CIP holds closely, however, this claim is no longer true: domestic actors may be able to
    1 Levich(2017) surveys the history of research on CIP and discusses implications of its breakdown.
    2 McBrady and Schill (2007),  among others, documented how some market actors were able to exploit long-term CIP
deviations to reduce overall borrowing costs even before the GFC. No doubt post-GFC developments have amplified
the frictions that facilitated such arbitrage.

borrow or lend synthetically in domestic currency at a rate that is different from the domestic
central bank rate, but dependent on Fed policy. If so, the failure of CIP raises a second macroeco-
nomic policy question: precisely how are monetary policies transmitted across borders and into
domestic funding conditions? To know the answer, we need to have a good sense of what drives
CIP departures. Finally, the failure of CIP is a prima facie argument for the importance of central
bank swap lines that allow financial-sector institutions more easily to fund in foreign currencies
when necessary (Bahaj and Reis, 2020a,b).
    A growing recent literature tries to rationalize recent CIP deviations. Different authors have
stressed a range of often complementary potential drivers, ranging from regulation-induced or
other arbitrage limits (Ivashina, Scharfstein and Stein, 2015; Du, Tepper and Verdelhan, 2018;
Rime, Schrimpf and Syrstad, 2019; Cenedese, Della Corte and Wang, 2020), to changes in banks'
balance-sheet or risk-taking capacity connected with U.S. dollar appreciation (Avdjiev, Du, Koch
and Shin, 2019), to interest rate differences across currencies and their impact on the FX swap
market (Du, Tepper and Verdelhan, 2018; Borio, Iqbal, McCauley, McGuire and Sushko, 2018;
Bräuning and Ivashina, forthcoming). Rime, Schrimpf and Syrstad (2019) argue that CIP de-
viations are not materially significant for most potential arbitrageurs given their true marginal
dollar funding rates, while those few actors with the lowest dollar funding rates, who are in a
position to engage in covered interest arbitrage, are constrained by regulatory factors.
    This paper documents the evolution of CIP deviations at the "macrofinancial" level referenced
by Akram, Rime and Sarno (2008), using different measures to evaluate the importance over time
of key drivers proposed in the literature. An advantage of this approach is that it can indicate
the factors important enough to have driven macro-level CIP deviations since the GFC, and their
potentially changing roles given a shifting macroeconomic environment ­ comprising (among
other things) the euro area crisis, unconventional monetary policies, and key regulatory changes.
    A useful way to organize the several drivers of CIP deviations that we will examine is to
place them into the three buckets of (i) factors reflecting risk appetite and perceptions, (ii) factors
reflecting monetary policies, and (iii) factors reflecting financial regulations. Of course, some
variables may reflect multiple factors ­ the U.S. dollar's exchange rate being a notable example
­ while regulatory changes affect CIP deviations by amplifying or dampening the influence of
risk and policy factors. One goal of the paper is to make progress in separately identifying these
effects.
    The outline and the main findings of the paper are as follows. Section 2 sets out a methodol-
ogy for investigating correlates of CIP deviations, along with preliminary panel and time-series
results across 10 advanced-economy currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. As in a number of earlier
studies, notably Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2019), we regress the cross-currency LIBOR basis
­ the deviation from CIP ­ on an initial set of potential risk-based and policy drivers. We focus
on the three-month tenor, and to smooth out high-frequency noise in line with our macro focus,
we work with monthly averges of daily data. Like Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2019), we find
that CIP deviations emerge abruptly starting with the GFC and that a higher nominal effective
                                                 4


U.S. dollar exchange rate is strongly associated over 2010-2019 with a more negative basis. Also
in line with their findings and other recent literature on financial-market risk effects, the implied
volatility of S&P options (the VIX, stressed as an indicator of financial tightening in some ear-
lier work on global financial cycles such as Forbes and Warnock (2012), Bruno and Shin (2015a),
and Bruno and Shin (2015b)) is generally not statistically significant in recent data. However,
we do detect important roles for a measure of exchange-market liquidity and for changes in the
short-term U.S. interest rate. Holding the foreign interest rate constant, an increase in the U.S.
short-term rate leads to a less negative dollar basis in the time series dimension, seemingly in
contrast to the longer-term cross-sectional pattern reported and rationalized by Du, Tepper and
Verdelhan (2018), and possibly reflecting broader financial market effects. Time-series regressions
for individual countries also reveal important heterogeneity among currencies, likely related to
the issuing countries' differing domestic financial structures. These deserve further research.
    Section 3 looks more closely at these regularities and investigates some explicit potential risk-
and policy-based based drivers of the basis, some of them most relevant after the GFC. We first
ask if the risk-based measures can displace the measured strong association between the basis
and the U.S. dollar. A measure of limited marginal balance-sheet capacity, the leverage ratio of
U.S. primary dealers, adds significantly to the cost of synthetic dollar funding relative to that of
direct dollar funding, without eliminating an independent role for the U.S. dollar in driving the
basis.
    As noted above, U.S. dollar movements reflect both risk-appetite factors ­ like safe-haven
movements ­ and other factors that affect the exchange rate, notably monetary policy. The
section therefore looks more deeply into the U.S. dollar's role, distinguishing between a strong
dollar's general negative impact on balance sheet capacity and risk-taking, as posited by Avdjiev,
Du, Koch and Shin (2019) ­ which we consider to reflect the risk-taking channel of monetary
policy ­ and the role of broad dollar appreciation as an indication of a more general global risk-
driven flight into safe haven currencies. Alternative methodologies for identifying the safe haven
component of broad dollar swings reveal an important role of safe haven currencies' comovement
in driving the U.S. currency's impact on the basis, and a much more tenuous role of the residual
dollar movement.
    A low interest rate environment and unconventional monetary policies are among the drivers
of global capital flows post-crisis, and thus have the potential to affect deviations from CIP
through portfolio rebalancing, hedged dollar borrowing, and international financial flows. In
Section 3, we also show evidence supporting a relation between central banks' balance sheets and
the dollar basis over the last decade. Moreover, an important metric to evaluate the profitability of
hedged dollar investment ­ the relative term premium across currencies ­ is a significant correlate
of CIP deviations after 2014. This term premium effect may be driven by supply-side factors
and is complementary to the safe-haven dollar effect. Related, when we calculate our baseline
regressions using long-term rather than short-term rates as right-hand side explanators, the signs
on interest rates become consistent with the account in Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018). Along
                                                 5


with the loss of statistical significance of primary dealers' leverage ratio after 2014 and a seeming
weakening in the influence of dollar swings, our findings suggest that the underlying drivers of
post-crisis CIP deviations have varied over time. We present a decomposition of the explanatory
power of risk-based and policy-based factors, and show that risk factors are more important than
monetary policy factors over all of 2010-2018, but equally important over 2014-2018.
    Section 4 extends the findings of Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) on the dynamics of the
dollar basis near regulatory reporting dates ­ findings that they characterized as "smoking gun"
evidence on the role of regulatory constraints on potential arbitrageurs' balance sheets. These
constraints, when they become more binding, magnify the normal effects of basis drivers, and
our event-study methodology gives an idea of the marginal impact of the regulations at times
when they are more binding. We show that the capital surcharge for globally systemically im-
portant banks (GSIBs), introduced on January 1, 2016 and fully implemented by January 1, 2019,
has a notably strong effect in driving three-month dollar bases in the fourth quarter, when U.S.
and euro area regulators evaluate GSIB balance sheets. Finally, as period-ends offer a unique op-
portunity to investigate the role of imbalance in dollar demand and supply in driving deviations
from CIP, we exploit central bank swap lines' role in bridging dollar funding shortfalls (Bahaj
and Reis, 2020a,b). Consistent with the section's earlier analysis, we find that swap drawings and
(negative) basis spikes appear at quarter ends, with relatively bigger effects generally occurring
at year ends in recent data.
    Section 5 briefly considers some potential macro-relevant effects of basis changes. Our results
indicate that changes in the Libor basis are correlated with specific changes in synthetic dollar
borowing costs and with hedged international investment returns. These correlations suggest
that CIP deviations may have material implications for international portfolio positions, overall
financial conditions, and other determinants of macroeconomic transmisson channels and out-
comes.
    Section 6 concludes.


2   The evolution of CIP deviations: A regression approach
As many authors have noted, CIP held fairly well up until the Global Financial Crisis, even
based on indicative LIBOR rates of interest (see Figure 1). The relationship broke down (under-
standably) during the height of the crisis, but (more surprisingly), has not been re-established
afterward, and for many currencies, in particular the euro and the yen, the basis against the U.S.
dollar has generally been negative. This change has given rise to a large literature. Generally,
a negative dollar basis is ascribed to a need by globally active financial institutions to hedge
or fund dollar investments, coupled with limits to even short-term arbitrage that have become
tighter in the inter-crisis years. These limits are in the sprit of Keynes (1923), who wrote that,
"the floating capital normally available, and ready to move from center to center for the purpose
                                                        6


of taking advantage of moderate arbitrage profits between spot and forward exchange, is by no
means unlimited in amount, and is not always adequate to the market's requirements (Keynes,
1923, p.129)."
    For example, a euro area bank that cannot access the cheapest direct dollar funding at rate
r, but needing to repay USD 1, could instead borrow EUR S at an interest rate of r  , where S
is the spot euro price of dollars; buy a dollar in the spot market and repay its debt; and then
buy S(1 + r  ) euros in the forward market for a promise of S(1 + r  )/ F dollars, where F is
the forward euro/dollar rate. Next period the bank will owe USD S(1 + r  )/ F rather than the
USD 1 + r it would have owed had it been able to borrow dollars directly, but it can repeat
the process to obtain the dollars it will then need. If the unavailability of direct dollar credit is a
binding constraint, then we would expect a negative basis, that is, that the cost of synthetic dollar
borowing exceeds that of direct borrowing, or S(1 + r  )/ F > 1 + r.
    Given this demand side effect for forward euros, why is there not a corresponding supply
from those who can borrow dollars cheaply, and thus could engage in CIP arbitrage? The emerg-
ing answer in the literature focuses on limited balance sheet capacity, driven by financial frictions
including regulatory constraints that have intensified in the 2010s. We provide further evidence
on these in this paper.
    Interestingly, experience of the last decade shows that older accounts of the joint determi-
nation of forward and spot exchange rates, once thought to be outdated, may have regained
relevance. Tsiang (1959) (who reported the quotation from Keynes repeated above) presented a
classic analysis that more recent theoretical work, such as Gabaix and Maggiori (2015), echoes.
Tsiang's analysis classified market participants as (1) those needing to hedge trade receipts; (2)
those speculating on exchange rate changes ­ most dramatically, possible parity changes within
the Bretton Woods system, though possibly also movements of the exchange rate within its al-
lowed fluctuation bands; and (3) those arbitraging covered interest differentials. In the modern
world of massive two-way financial flows, trade motives seem swamped by financial motives,
and among those, covered return differentials are likely most important, given the near random
walk behavior of floating exchange rates. These considerations justify the focus on financial
factors in understanding current departures from CIP.3


2.1   Measurement, data and empirical strategy

For a given foreign currency and the U.S. dollar, a deviation from covered interest rate parity
refers to the wedge between two differentials: (i) the difference between the n-period forward
exchange rate and spot exchange rate, which we denote by f t,t+n - st , annualized and with both
exchange rates expressed in units of foreign currency per dollar; and (ii) the difference in the
                                                                                 
nominal interest rates earned by holding the currencies, which we denote by rt   ,t+n - rt,t+n , the

  3 Obstfeld  (1983) developed a model of the dollar-deutschemark exchange rate based on covered interest differen-
tials, with some empirical success.
                                                                  7


n-period annualized interest rate difference between foreign currency (with an asterisk) and U.S.
dollar interest rates. In the absence of financial frictions, an arbitrageur could take advantage of a
deviation from covered interest parity and earn a riskless profit. Alternatively, and equivalently if
there are no frictions, no one would borrow dollars if it were cheaper to borrow foreign currency,
buy dollars with the proceeds, and sell the dollars n periods forward for foreign currency (as
in a foreign exchange swap) to repay the initial foreign-currency loan. In frictionless financial
markets, therefore, the CIP deviation for any horizon n, xt,t+n , also known as n-period cross-
currency basis and shown in equation (1) below, should equal zero:

                                                                    
                                        x t,t + n = r t,t + n - [ r t ,t+n - ( f t,t+n - st )].                                (1)

    The sign of xt,t+n reflects the direction of CIP deviations. We call the deviation "a negative
dollar basis" if xt,t+n < 0, as a negative deviation suggests that direct dollar funding is cheaper
than synthetic dollar funding that works by borrowing foreign currency and swapping it into
dollars.4
    The evolution of the cross-currency dollar basis exhibits clear deviations from CIP after the
2008-09 global financial crisis (GFC). Figure 1 plots the basis computed from indicative interbank
interest rates (henthforth referred to as "Libor basis"). (Here, and throughout our empirical anal-
ysis, we will express the basis in terms of basis points of annualized returns.) Before the GFC,
CIP deviations were very small and fluctuated around zero. This feature is in line with the find-
ings of Akram, Rime and Sarno (2008), as described above.5 Starting with the GFC, however, CIP
broke down as a sizable unexploited cross-currency wedge opened. During the GFC, the dollar
basis reached levels of about -200 basis points, and experienced another dip during the height
of the euro area debt crisis. While most three-month dollar bases had been steadily reverting
to near zero through 2013, they widened again after mid-2014. Most currencies have a negative
dollar basis, implying a cost advantage for direct dollar funding, were it available at a marginal
cost near Libor. "Carry" currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, on the other
hand, display positive bases against the U.S. dollar (that is, xt,t+n > 0). The positive sign indi-
cates that direct U.S. dollar funding is costlier than synthetic funding based on swapping AUD
or NZD borrowings into U.S. currency. Nonetheless, financial institutions in Australia and New
Zealand raise a considerable proportion of wholesale domestic-currency funding from hedged
foreign-currency denominated issuances (principally U.S. dollar, yen, and euro) in light of the
relatively limited sizes of their local domestic-currency funding bases (Arsov, Moran, Shanahan
and Stacey, 2013; Callaghan, 2017).

       see why, note that by (1), xt,t+n < 0 is equivalent to rt,t+n < rt ,t+n + ( st - f t,t+n ) where st - f t,t+n is the cost of
swapping into dollars (which augments the borrowing-cost component captured by the foreign interest rate).

a constant, should generate estimated coefficients of 1 for foreign interest rate, -1 for the U.S.

                                                                               ,t + n -  r t,t + n +  t

may have coefficients  and  different from 1, and a constant term  different from 0. Equiva-
                     
lently, subtracting rt ,t+n - rt,t+n from (1) yields the regression specification

                                                      x t,t + n =  +   r t

in which  may be nonzero and the coefficients  =  - 1 and  =  - 1 potentially are nonzero
as well. To avoid possible unit roots and for consistency with prior literature (Avdjiev, Du, Koch
and Shin, 2019), our preferred specification is (2) in first differences (with the sign of  reversed
to reflect it's a regression equation):

                                                    x t,t + n =  +    r t
                                                                        
                                                                          ,t + n +   r t,t + n + t ,                     (3)

where t =  t . We will sequentially augment the equation with additional regressors to assess
their correlations with changes in the basis.
    The data that we use are changes in monthly averages of Libor bases, interest rates, and
additional potential explanatory variables. By using monthly averages, our regressions aim to
highlight drivers of CIP deviations at a relatively lower frequency, at the same time alleviating

issues related to period-end jumps in the bases.6 Our data covers the period between January
2002 and December 2019. We largely follow Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) to construct our
measure of the Libor basis. Online Appendix A contains more details on data sources.


2.2       Explaining CIP deviations: Interest rates

Table 1 presents an initial panel regression based on the specification in (3).7 The findings cover
three periods, pre-GFC (2002-06), GFC (2007-09), and post-GFC (2010-2019); they examine both
the Libor and Treasury bases; and they include currency fixed effects. The table shows that for
interbank rates of interest, they are economically or statistically insignificant correlates of the
basis, apart from the market disruptions of 2007-09. For Treasury rates, as is evident in the raw
data, there are significant departures from CIP in every period, consistent with the idea that
Treasurys yield an additional liquidity return, as Jiang, Krishnamurthy and Lustig (2019) and
Engel and Wu (2020) argue.
    The individual currency results in Table 2, which look only at the Libor basis, show consider-
able heterogeneity in some periods. For the pre-GFC sample, the results largely mirror those in
the panel regressions of Table 1. The same is largely true for the GFC years, with the exception
of the Japanese yen, where the coefficient on the change in the Japanese interest rate is large and
positive rather than negative. This sign pattern indicates that over time, a rise in the Japanese
interest rate makes the dollar basis more positive in the 2007-09 sample, paradoxically lowering
the incentive for covered interest arbitrage from dollars into yen.
    Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) showed that for the post-GFC period, there is a similar cross-
sectional relationship between long averages of the basis and the interest differential rUSD - ri ,
where i runs over the G10 currencies: Across i, the higher is rUSD - ri , the more negative is the
dollar basis xi . They reason that a lower interest rate ri compared with the rUS will induce more
synthetic dollar funding in currency i and more flows from currency i into hedged long-term
dollar assets. The resulting forward dollar sales, however, create an imbalance for swap dealers
(as also argued by Rime, Schrimpf and Syrstad (2019)). As dealers rebalance order flows, the
forward premium on currency i must rise by even more than the rise in the USD-currency i
interest difference (a decline in f - s). The more negative basis increases the incentive for CIP
arbitrage by institutions that can obtain cheap dollar funding, allowing the associated flow of
forward foreign-currency sales to rebalance the swap market.
    If this cross-sectional pattern held in the time series, then in panel (c) of Table 2 (covering the
post-GFC period), we would expect to see positive coefficients on r  and negative coefficients
on r. For the coefficient on r  , this pattern indeed holds for the Swiss franc, Danish krone,
   6 In Section 4.1, we offer evidence that in recent years, longer-tenor CIP deviations (such as three-month dollar
bases) are affected by year-end spikes, analogous to the quarter-end spikes visible for one-week and one-month
tenors.
   7 For all panel regressions, we report Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors. The estimated standard errors

barely change if we use the fixed-b estimator proposed by Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005).
                                                            10


and Japanese yen, but not clearly for the other currencies. These differences deserve further
exploration. For the change in the USD rate, r, the coefficient is uniformly positive, and in half
the cases statistically and economically significant. This finding ­ that a rise in the dollar interest
rate makes the dollar cross-currency basis less negative ­ contradicts the cross-sectional result
and suggests that changes in dollar interest rates may well have different effects on the basis
than changes in other interest rates, perhaps because they are associated with broader financial-
market effects. For example, if a rise in the dollar interest rate compresses the global demand
for dollar funding, that change could be associated with fewer forward dollar sales by synthetic
dollar borrowers, and thus lower equilibrium purchases of forward dollars by covered interest
arbitrageurs.8

                              Table 1: 3-month dollar basis and interest rates
Note: This table reports the results of simple panel regressions of monthly changes in 3-month dollar basis
(IBOR/treasury) on corresponding interest rates. The panel consists of G10 currencies against US dollar. Samples are
split to before (02-06), during (07-09), and after (10-19) the financial crisis. Monthly averages are used. Driscoll and
Kraay (1998) standard errors are reported:  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.




   8 Table B1 in Online Appendix B shows that, once the benchmark interest rates are replaced by ten-year government
bond yields (keeping the Libor basis as the dependent variable), the coefficients of U.S. interest rates become negative,
and the coefficient becomes statistically significant in the 2014-2019 sample. This switch in sign is consistent with the
results in Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) and could be due to several pssible factors, as suggested to us by Wenxin
Du. For example, long-term rates might better capture the demand of institutional investors su ch as pension funds,
which we discuss further below, or may contain more information about relative monetary stances at or near the
effective lower bound.

2.3   Explaining CIP deviations: The U.S. dollar and other correlates

We next turn to other correlates of the dollar basis.
    Table 3 examines the relationship in a panel regression of the dollar basis on three potential
indicators of stresses in financial markets. We focus on the Libor basis, although we also give
results for the Treasury basis for comparison.
    Writers such as Bruno and Shin (2015b) have noted the role of the U.S. dollar's stength in
foreign exchange markets as an indicator of global financial tightness and in particular, risk-off
sentiment. Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2019) document that a increases in a broad index of
nominal dollar value are associated with more negative dollar bases, and they present evidence
that dollar strength discourages cross-border dollar lending by global banks. Column (3) in
Table 3 strongly reaffirms this result for 2010-2019: the coefficient on the broad dollar index is
economically important and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Notwithstanding this
strong effect of the dollar, the significant positive impact of changes in U.S. interest rates remains
in column (3).
    Bruno and Shin (2015a) and Bruno and Shin (2015b) also posited a link between bank leverage
and the VIX, the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options, which is often taken as an indicator
of risk aversion in financial markets. Table 3 suggests, however, that the role of the VIX is
statistically insignificant, although the estimated coefficients on changes in the VIX are large and
negative, indicating that VIX increase are correlated with a more negative basis. Our finding
of a largely insignificant VIX index is consistent with Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2019), and
echoes recent empirical literature documenting a weaker post-GFC relationship of VIX and cross-
border capital flows (Cerutti, Claessens and Ratnovski, 2017; Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg and
Schiaffi, 2020; Forbes and Warnock, 2020; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020a). The reasons for
this weaker relationship are not yet well understood.9




   9 An alternative measure ­ the 10-year Treasury note volatility futures (TYVIX) ­ also has an insignificant but

      Table 3: Explaining 3-month CIP deviations: Monthly panel regressions with controls
Note: This table reports the results of panel regressions of monthly changes in dollar basis (IBOR/treasury) on
interest rates along with a number of control variables. The panel consists of G10 currencies against US dollar.
Samples are split to before (02-06), during (07-09), and after (10-19) the financial crisis. Monthly averages are used.
Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors are reported:  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.


    The increase in the forward exchange bid-ask spread is an indicator of illiquidity and volatility
in foreign exchange markets (Bessembinder, 1994), typically associated with heightened risk
aversion. Table 3 shows that a rise in bid-ask spreads makes the basis more negative over the post-
GFC period, with an effect that is statistically very significant. We stress again that the change
in the spread is a significant correlate notwithstanding the inclusion of the change in US interest
and the change in the broad dollar index, so in some sense, these different indicators of financial
tightening must capture different effects, which future research could usefully illuminate. For
example, the bid-ask spread directly impacts the return to CIP arbitrage, so it is not surprising
that an increase leads to a more negative basis.
    Table 4, which shows how the effects in Table 3 vary across tenors, underscores the last
interpretation of the bid-ask spread's role. A given change in the spread represents a bigger
effective transaction cost the shorter the tenor of the trade, and consistent with this hypothesis,
Table 4 shows that the spread's correlation with the basis becomes less strongly negative as the
tenor rises.10 This pattern is less pronounced once period-end observations are dropped from the
sample before taking the monthly average of daily observations. The dollar relationship seems
more pronounced at longer tenors, while the VIX remains largely statistically insignificant across
tenors, but its correlation seems most important at the one-week tenor in a sample that omits
  10 TableB2 in the Online Appendix looks at the five-year tenor and likewise finds a significant correlation of the
dollar index and an insignificant correlation of the bid-ask spread with the cross-currency basis.

Note: This table reports panel regressions output of Libor basis on a set of regressors as in the baseline specification of Table 2.
Tenors of forward premia (and thus tenors of regressors) from 1-week to 1-year are considered. Sample period is 2010M1-2019M12.
The last three columns report regressions results on 1-week to 3-month tenor on the sample excluding period-ends. The restricted
sample is obtained by first dropping all observations in February, May, August, November (1-week and 1-month tenor) and
September (3-month tenor) such that forward settlement date are in a different quarter (1-week and 1-month tenor) or year
(3-month tenor) than spot settlement. For one-year tenor, SEK is excluded due to lack of data. For one-week tenor, CAD and NZD
are excluded. Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors are reported:  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.




3     Additional risk and policy drivers
As we have noted, the finding in Section 2.3 ­ that variation in the dollar exchange rate against a
basket of currencies explains changes in the three-month dollar basis ­ is consistent with Avdjiev,
Du, Koch and Shin (2019) (henthforth ADKS), who emphasize the close connection between
dollar strength, cross-border dollar bank lending, and CIP deviations. In this telling, broad
U.S. dollar appreciation reduces intermediaries' risk-taking capacity, limiting funds available for
active CIP arbitrage and making the dollar basis more negative.
     Dollar index movements are highly endogenous to changes in macrofinancial conditions,
however. An emerging literature has identified a number of variables that could explain dollar
fluctuations, at least within the post-GFC period. Shifts in risk sentiment and the associated
"flight to safety" may also contribute to dollar appreciation and tighter dollar funding conditions.
In this section, we build on the insight of ADKS and further investigate the dollar's role by
directly assessing the additional impact of diffferent measures of global risk aversion, leverage
constraints, and relative bond returns. We find that the association of the broad dollar index
with the three-month Libor basis remains important when controlling directly for indicators of
balance-sheet stress and long-term bond returns, but seems to be driven most strongly by a
common factor that depends on safe-haven currencies' comovement.
                                                         15


    Regarding bond returns, unconventional monetary policies after the GFC may have a material
impact on the cross-currency basis, either directly, through a portfolio rebalancing effect on bond
returns, or more indirectly, by affecting the relative strength of currencies. We find evidence that
larger balance sheets of foreign central banks relative to the Fed leads to a more negative basis.
On the other hand, when we look more directly at asset prices, we find that fluctuations in the
term premium differential, an important metric of the attractiveness of currency-hedged long-
term dollar investment, seems to be an important driver of the basis after 2014, complementary
to the effect of the spot dollar exchange rate.


3.1   CIP deviations and post-GFC exchange rate determinants

Several recent studies have shown that macrofinancial fundamentals connected with global risk
appetite can help to explain and predict exchange rates during the post-GFC period. In particular,
Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2019) demonstrate that movement in the broad U.S.
dollar index has been closely related to private U.S. purchases of foreign bonds after the financial
crisis. This correlation, most significant before 2013, is connected with the risk appetite of global
investors, with various indicators of risk appetite exhibiting significant explanatory power for the
dollar.11 These findings suggest that similar risk-preference indicators could help in accounting
for deviations from CIP.
    Table 5 asks if global financial cycle measures that are more tightly focused than the VIX
significantly substitute for ­ or complement ­ the dollar effect on CIP deviations. We concentrate
on two particular variables: (1) the Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020b) (henthforth MR) global
asset-price factor extended by Miranda-Agrippino, Nenova and Rey (2020); and (2) the He, Kelly
and Manela (2017) (henceforth HKM) squared leverage ratio of primary dealers. Both measures
are expressed in units of standard deviations.
    Extracted from a large set of world risky asset prices, the MR factor can explain a sizable
fraction of global asset price comovement. A lower level of the factor reflects lower risk appetite
on the part of global investors. The HKM squared leverage ratio measure is the squared inverse
of U.S. primary dealer sector's aggregate capital ratio. This leverage measure is strongly coun-
tercyclical, is therefore positively correlated with intermediaries' marginal value of wealth, and
is shown by HKM to perform well in pricing a wide range of asset classes.12
  11 There are several other examples in this vein. Greenwood, Hanson, Stein and Sunderam (2020) develop a theory of
term premia and exchange rates and find some empirical support. Jiang, Krishnamurthy and Lustig (2019), Engel and
Wu (2020), and Valchev (2020) argue that bonds have differential convenience yields that are significant in explaining
U.S. dollar movements.
  12 The HKM capital ratio is computed as the ratio of market value of equity to the sum of market value of equity

and the book value of debt. Market value of equity is constructed from equity prices and the measure is thus available
at daily frequency, consistent with our methodology of taking monthly averages of daily observations. We use the
squared leverage ratio measure, which is shown by HKM to reflect time-varying risk premia in intermediary asset
pricing frameworks such as He and Krishnamurthy (2012). Du, Hebert and Huber (2019) use the HKM return on
equity issued by primary dealers to proxy for intermediary wealth returns in their asset pricing framework. In a
                                                       16


    Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2019) demonstrate that regressions of the broad dollar
on the MR factor or on the HKM value-weighted return to a portfolio of New York Fed primary
dealers' holding companies (which is high when the HKM leverage ratio is high) generate com-
paratively high rolling R2 s over the 2007-12 period. While this explanatory power suggests that
both the MR and HKM financial cycle measures are important from a macrofinancial standpoint,
it does not preclude that they influence the basis independently of the dollar. In our application,
we expect the basis to react positively to an increase in the MR factor and negatively if primary
dealers' leverage ratio increases: the former tends to increase during periods of high global risk
appetite, whereas the latter is countercyclical, rising during periods of financial tightening, when
risk bearing capacity is most stretched.
    Table 5 reports findings for individual currencies and the ten-currency panel. Panel (a) shows
that, omitting dollar changes, increases in the MR asset-price factor (indicative of a more ebullient
global financial cycle) make the dollar basis less negative across all currencies, as expected. The
effect is sometimes large and statistically very significant. In panel (b) the a higher HKM squared
leverage ratio makes the basis more negative for eight out of ten currencies, in some cases with
very large effects. In all of these regressions, a higher dollar interest rate is associated with a less
negative basis.




recent paper, Augustin, Chernov, Schmid and Song (2020) estimate a no-arbitrage model of forward premium and
dollar basis determination, and show that both the broad dollar index and the HKM capital ratio can significantly
explain pricing errors implied by the model.

                Table 5: Libor basis and risk measures: Time-series and panel evidence
Note: This table presents time-series and panel regressions results on correlations between 3-month Libor basis and risk measures.
For each currency, Panel A and B report results from time-series regression controlling only for interest rates, risk measures and
forward bid-ask spread. Asset price factor refers to the "global financial cycle" estimates from Miranda-Agrippino, Nenova and
Rey (2020). Data on intermediary leverage ratio (squared) is from data on primary dealer sector's capital ratio (He, Kelly and
Manela, 2017). Both measures are demeaned and rescaled by its standard deviation. In all regressions, daily data are taken monthly
averages before each regression. Samples for all regressions start at 2010M1 (or 2014M1). Samples end at 2019M4 for regressions
involving equity price factors and 2018M11 for regressions including intermediary leverage. Driscoll and Kraay (1998) (panel) and
Newey and West (1994) standard errors are reported.  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.

   Panel (c) looks at these results through the lens of panel regressions. Over the limited 2014-
2018(2019) sample, the roles of the MR and HKM indicators seem both to be attenuated. In
both of these regressions, the dollar is also only marginally significant. The result could reflect
more tranquil market conditions following the euro crisis and domestic brinksmanship over the
U.S. federal debt limit. While broadly consistent with the finding of Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman
and Schreger (2019) that financial-market factors have less explanatory power for the multilateral
dollar exchange rate after 2013 or so, it is puzzling that the risk indicators seem less influential in
a period when several financial regulations on intermediaries had been more fully implemented.
We will encounter this finding again below, and it is possibly related to the relatively lower
variability of the HKM variable over 2014-2019 (see Figure 2).

    Figure 2: Standardized intermediary squared leverage ratio and three-month dollar basis
Note: Figure 2 plots daily standardized level of He, Kelly and Manela (2017) intermediary squared leverage ratio,
against average three-month dollar basis across G-10 currencies.


    Over the entire 2010-2019 sample, however, the HKM variable is quite significant and eco-
nomically important. In column (5), for example, which includes the dollar, a one standard
deviation rise in the squared liquidity ratio is asociated with a fall in the annualized dollar basis
of 14.02 basis points. Keeping both the asset-price factor and the squared leverage ratio in the
regression, the dollar change becomes significant but the MR asset-price factor is not (column 7).
In all specifications, once again, a rise in US interest rates plays an important role in making the
basis less negative. The conclusion is that over the entire 2010-2019 sample, there are a number of
key monetary and financial drivers of the basis complementary with the broad dollar exchange
rate, and some of these directly reflect risk-taking capacity and (in the case of the bid-ask spread)
exchange-market liquidity.13
  13 InOnline Appendix B, we further investigate the relationship between the basis and risk appetite using an alter-
native set of risk measures, including the risk aversion index of Bekaert, Engstrom and Xu (2020), the CDS spread of
                                                         19


3.2   Dollar effects and safe-haven flows

We next seek to understand better the mechanism through which movements in the broad dollar
index connect to the dollar basis. A strong dollar could potentially induce a more negative basis
through two distinct channels. First, as much of the literature posits, a strong dollar reflects
and induces a reduction in intermediaries' risk-taking capacity (e.g., by raising the value of
dollar-denominated balance sheet liabilities). But second, a strong dollar could simply reflect
safe-haven demand stemming from a general drop in risk appetite ­ a development that would
also lead to a more negative basis. Our simple intuition is that risk-off shocks that discourage
CIP arbitrage and promote the flight of cross-border capital to safety should simultaneously put
upward pressure on other safe-haven currencies.
    If global risk-off episodes dominate the basis and these are reflected in a stronger multilateral
dollar, then we would expect that common comovement in the safe haven currencies will have
good explanatory power compared with the residual component of the dollar index, which would
capture other, orthogonal, mechanisms through which a strong dollar could be associated with
financial tightening (for example, a more restrictive U.S. monetary policy).
    We try to measure the safe-haven component of dollar movements in two ways. Our first
measure comes from a simple linear regression of the broad dollar exchange rate on levels of
multilateral effective nominal exchange rates of the Swiss franc and Japanese yen. We regress the
change in the basis on changes in both the residuals and the fitted value from this regression (after
taking monthly averages) ­ the latter reflecting the safe haven component of dollar movements ­
and check if the residuals remain significant. Ranaldo and Soderlind (2010) show that the Swiss
franc and Japanese yen tend to appreciate against the dollar when U.S. stock prices fall, and
when U.S. bond prices and foreign exchange market volatility rise. Thus, these curencies indeed
strengthen in conditions of market stress. Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2019) show
that alongside the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc also have significant loadings on
U.S. purchases of foreign bonds, possibly suggesting that all three currencies load on the same
global risk factor.
    These last findings suggest a second approach to quantifying the safe-haven component of
dollar movements. We use a simple static factor model to extract a single principal component
from these three currencies, and decompose the raw broad dolar index into the common factor
and a residual.
    Figure 3 plots the residuals and the factors generated by this exercise. Perhaps surprisingly,
the estimated residual components of the dollar index are highly correlated with the original
series. The correlation is remarkably high for the regression-based residuals: close to 0.9 (Figure
3a). The correlation is less striking, but still substantial, for the principal-component-based resid-
ual series: close to 0.5 (Figure 3b). The safe haven common factor can explain 45 percent of the
total variation of the effective exchange rates of the three currencies, comoves closely with the
major swap dealers, and different versions of implied stock market volatilities. We report our findings in Table B3.

dollar (Figure 3c), but does not correlate strongly with the VIX index (Figure 3d).
    Table 6 reports the findings based on the regression-based proxies for the safe-haven and
residual components of the dollar. In the panel regressions of panel (a), both the dollar com-
ponents and the VIX are significant over 2010-18 before the squared leverage ratio is included
(column (1)). However, the fitted value of the regression on the franc and the yen has a stronger
estimated effect, despite the high correlation of the residual with the raw exchange rate. Once
leverage is added to the regression, however, the VIX and the residual become much less signif-
icant (column (2)). Over 2014-2018, as above, the leverage ratio becomes insignificant, and the
contrast between the effects of the two dollar components is smaller. In comparison with Table 5,
panel (c), column (5), for example, the effect of the safe-haven component of dollar movements is
much more evident in Table 6, panel (a), column (2) than that of raw dollar movements, whereas
the residual component is not highly significant.
    Panel (b) of Table 6 shows results by currency over 2010-18. For the majority of currencies,
the findings are reasonably consistent with the panel results in panel (a).
    Table 7 replicates Table 6, but uses the principal component methodology to isolate the part of
dollar movements driven by safe safe-haven demand. The findings in the top panel on the whole
echo those of Table 6, with the leverage variable again dominating the VIX and the safe-haven
dollar component having a much lower p-value than the raw dollar in the comparable Table 5
results. The individual-currency results in the lower panel are generally consistent with the panel
regressions, despite some hetrerogeneity across currencies. We note that the insignificance of the
dollar residual is perhaps less surprising than in Table 6, owing to its lower correlation with the
raw dollar than that of the regression-based residual.14
    Taken together, the results of this section so far suggest that the broad dollar's role may
be mainly as an inverse indicator of global risk appetite ­ with appreciations asociated with
greater risk aversion ­ while the squared leverage ratio is a strong indicator of pressure on
intermediaries' risk-taking capacity.




  14 In the Online Appendix, we show in Table B4 that at daily frequency, both the dollar safe-haven factor and
the residual enter the panel regressions with significantly negative coefficients. However, the residual is no longer
significant once we aggregate the data into weekly frequency by taking weekly averages.

                                   Figure 3: Broad dollar index, common factor, and residuals
Note: Figure 3 plots various measures of residualized dollar and safe-haven currency common factor against original
time-series of broad dollar index and VIX. In Figure 3a, the residualized dollar measure (axis on the RHS) is
obtained from regressing broad dollar index on nominal effective exchange rates of Japanese yen and Swiss franc. In
Figure 3b, the residualized dollar measure (axis on the RHS) comes from extracting one common principal
component of broad dollar index and NEER of Japanese yen and Swiss franc. In Figure 3c and 3d, the common
factor is the principal component extracted from the three original effective exchange rate indices.

Table 6: Three-month Libor basis, safe-haven currency comovement and residualized dollar in-
dex
Note: This table reports regressions involving fitted and residualized dollar index, obtained from regressing the broad dollar index
on BIS nominal effective exchange rate indices of Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen. Data on intermediary leverage ratio (squared) is
from data on primary dealer sector's capital ratio (He, Kelly and Manela, 2017), demeaned and rescaled by its standard deviation.
Daily data are taken monthly averages before each regression. Samples for regressions in Panel (a) start at 2010M1 (or 2014M1) and
end at 2018M11. Samples for regressions in Panel (b) start at 2010M1. For panel regressions, Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard
errors are reported. For time-series regressions, autocorrelation-robust standard errors with lag selection according to Newey and
West (1994) are reported.  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.

regressions in Panel (a) start at 2010M1 (or 2014M1) and end at 2018M11. Samples for regressions in Panel (b) start at 2010M1. For
panel regressions, Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors are reported. For time-series regressions, autocorrelation-robust
standard errors with lag selection according to Newey and West (1994) are reported.  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.

3.3    Dollar supply-demand and CIP deviations: Central bank balance sheets and the
       term premium channel

In this section, we study more closely supply-demand forces that underpin the relationship es-
tablished by ADKS between dollar strength, the dollar basis, and cross-border capital flows.
Persistently low global interest rates, asymmetric recovery from the financial crisis, and the un-
conventional monetary policies of advanced-economy central banks may give rise to lending and
borrowing patterns that take advantage of interest-rate differentials across borders. A "low-for-
long" interest rate environment encourages reach-for-yield behavior by domestic financial insti-
tutions in the form of higher overseas investment. For example, Ammer, Tabova and Wroblewski
(2016) find some reallocation toward U.S. and U.K. bond investments by euro-area investors in
response to widening bond yield differentials. Japanese insurers, facing massive domestic mon-
etary easing themselves, have substantially increased their exposure to dollar-denominated port-
folio investment in recent years (Bank of Japan, 2020). Because foreign investors tend to hedge
their FX exposures, the resulting demand pressure for FX hedging would need to be absorbed
through adjustment in the dollar basis.15
    Against this backdrop, we focus on two variables that may offer a perspective distinct from
from the risk-based explanations of the drivers of short-term CIP deviations that we explored
above.
    One is domestic bond purchases by foreign central banks. Central bank balance-sheet op-
erations may affect the dollar basis through a portfolio rebalancing channel. For example, by
removing euro-denominated bonds from circulation, the ECB's quantitative easing operations
may lead to excess demand for future promised euro payments, and thus, appreciation of the
forward euro. If euro area quantitative easing puts upward pressure on asset prices, the associ-
ated reduction in funding cost may attract foreign issuance in euros and higher hedging demand
in dollars, resulting in a more negative dollar basis (Liao, 2020).
    A second variable we will look at is a metric of the relative profitability of hedged invest-
ments in long-term dollar bonds: the relative dollar term premium. Of course, a rise in the
relative dollar term premium could result from ECB purchases of euro area bonds, as in the last
paragraph. Thus, our regressions below, in which we estimate the role of central bank balance
sheets, could be viewed as throwing indirect light on relative term premium effects, which we
will also investigate directly. There is an ambiguity in assessing how a relative term premium
change will affect the basis, however: the outcome can depend on whether the shock moving
the term premium comes from a change in bond supplies ­ as in the previous paragraph ­ or a
change in bond demand ­ for example, a rise in global risk aversion that prompts haven flows
  15 Borio,Iqbal, McCauley, McGuire and Sushko (2018) estimate demand for dollar hedges by computing the gap
between dollar assets and liabilities of international banks, and find this funding gap measure is closely asaociated
with the level of CIP deviations. Liao (2020) associates the movement in long-term CIP deviations with offshore
foreign-currency issuance of international firms. Amador, Bianchi, Bocola and Perri (2020) study exchange rate policies
with a zero lower bound constraint that may inflict carry costs on monetary authorities in the form of CIP deviations.

into dollar assets. It is in the former case (a supply shock) that a rise in the relative dollar term
premium will lead to a more negative dollar basis.
    To illustrate this point, imagine that a rise in the relative supply of dollar bonds outstanding
leads to a rise in the U.S. relative to foreign term premium. A Japanese insurance company
with an overseas portfolio may wish, as a result, to raise its holdings of five-year U.S. Treasury
bond and to hedge this additional dollar exposure by entering into a cross-currency basis swap
with a counterparty. To see why there might be additional demand out of a rising relative term
premium, assuming it holds the added securities to maturity and the swap spread is zero, the
insurance company would receive a fixed long-term rate for the investment, but is exposed to
floating short-term rates by paying the dollar Libor rate and receiving the Japanese yen Libor rate
every three months during the investment.16 Ignoring the yen side for simplicity, the expected
profit from this investment, as a result, is the expected term premium on the five-year Treasury
bond.17 Non-U.S. investors may respond to a lower U.S. term premium driven by Federal Reserve
quantitative easing (Greenwood, Hanson, Stein and Sunderam, 2020; Chari, Dilts Stedman and
Lundblad, 2020) by cutting back their dollar exposures and unwinding currency hedges, which
would reduce the demand for forward foreign currency and reduce downward pressure on the
dollar basis. These developments would also weaken the dollar in the spot market. An alternative
contractionary shock to the outstanding U.S. bond supply would be forward guidance of lower
for longer future U.S. short-term interest rates (see Bundick, Herriford and Smith (2019)), which
can raise expectations of future Fed bond purchases.
    A lower relative U.S. term premium could, however, result from demand-side developments,
such as an exogenous risk-off rise in hedged dollar demand. Such a development would have
different effects on the dollar basis and the spot dollar than an expansion of the Fed's QE. In the
case of a rise in demand for dollar bonds, some of which comes from non-U.S. residents who
hedge in the forward market, the dollar term premium would fall, forward dollar sales might
nonetheless rise ­ leading to a more negative basis ­ and the spot dollar would appreciate.
    In recent years, movements in the Treasury term premium and the dollar exchange rate seem
to be closely associated. Greenwood, Hanson, Stein and Sunderam (2020) show empirically that
a higher foreign term premium relative to the U.S. is associated with U.S. dollar depreciation and
foreign currency appreciation. One implication of their findings is that relative supply changes
in bond markets may dominate the correlation between relative term premia and the basis.18
Because we will additionally control for the safe-haven component of dollar movements in the
regressions that follow, we would expect that a measure of the foreign term premium relative
  16 Baba,Packer and Nagano (2008) provide more details on the working of a cross-currency basis swap.
  17 With CIP deviations, the investment would be more costly as the insurer would pay an additional spread on the
cross-currency basis swap, with the dollar basis being typically negative.
  18 Coeuré (2017) also observe a close comovement between the euro-dollar exchange rate and the relative term

premium. On the relationship of the term premium to capital flows, Chari, Dilts Stedman and Lundblad (2020) show
that a lower term premium on U.S. Treasury bonds during periods of quantitative easing leads to higher U.S. holdings
of emerging market assets, and the opposite occurs during the taper tantrum period.

to the U.S. dollar term premium, because it lowers the relative global demand for long-dated
dollar assets and hence forward hedging purchases of foreign currencies against forward dollars,
would make the dollar basis less negative.
    Term premia are unobservable and estimates of term premia are model-dependent. Following
Hanson and Stein (2015) and Greenwood, Hanson, Stein and Sunderam (2020), we proxy move-
ments in term premia by changes in the nine-year forward yield of one-year bonds, computed
from zero-coupon yield curves. A big advantage of this approach is that we do not have to take
a stand on the exact term-structure model that generates the term premium estimates. Under
the assumption that there is typically little news on expected short rates in the distant future,
innovations in forward rates are largely driven by movements in term premia. In the case of the
United States, the one-year yield (nine years forward) computed by Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright
(2007) is highly correlated with canonical term premium estimates such as Adrian, Crump and
Moench (2013). Moreover, as zero-coupon yield curves are readily available for six out of the ten
currencies that we consider, in addition to U.S. dollar, the sample coverage of our term premium
proxies is satisfactory.
    Table 8's estimates cover the 2010-18 period. Panel (a) includes monthly changes in relative
balance-sheet size for major central banks that engaged in balance-sheet expansion. The relative
balance-sheet size variable is defined as the foreign central bank's total assets, measured in local
currency and normalized by domestic M2 stock, relative to the same variable for the Federal
Reserve's balance sheet.19 Panel (b) adds the change in our measure of the foreign-U.S. relative
term premium, denoted tp - tp. We find that over 2010-18, the relative balance sheet term
performs as expected, and significantly so, with a larger foreign relative balance sheet making
the basis more negative. In contrast, the relative term premium contributes little. The effects of
other variables are largely unchanged.
    In earlier results we found a reduced role for the HKM squared leverage variable post 2014.
This result persists in Table 8, and strong-dollar effects are much reduced (as was also true in
Table 6). However, over 2014-2018, the relative term premium variable is highly significant, and
conforms with the theoretical prediction that a rise in ther relative foreign terms premium makes
the dollar basis less negative. The term premium effect also appears to be important for the Swiss
franc, the euro, and sterling, in addition to the panel of six currencies.20




  19 Results are very close if we do not normalize by M2, as in the study of QE policies by Dedola, Georgiadis, Gräb
and Mehl (2020).
  20 Table B4 in the Online Appendix shows that contrary to Table 9b using monthly averages, term premium effects

are not statistically significant in the period starting in 2014 at the daily or weekly frequencies. At weekly frequency,
the coefficient on the term premium differential is actually positive.

basis and term premia differential, controlling for safe-haven common factors and residuals. Changes in term premia differential
(tp - tp) is proxied by changes in one-year yield (nine year forward) differential between foreign and US. Sample period for both
panels is from 2010M1 to 2018M11. Term premia differential is in unit of percentage points. For panel regressions, Driscoll and

3.4   Taking stock: The relative importance of risk and monetary policy factors

The correlates of CIP deviations that we have studied so far fall roughly into two broad groups,
factors related to risk appetite and monetary policy factors. Section 3.2 provided evidence that
CIP deviations correlate stongly with both U.S. dollar strength, working through a component
shared with other safe-haven currencies, and variables reflecting the limited risk-taking proclivity
of global financiers such as the HKM squared leverage ratio. The explanatory power of this set
of risk-related factors, also including the VIX and forward market liquidity, can be contrasted
with that of variables related to monetary policies, some of which are the focus of Section 3.3.
To compare and summarize the relative strength of both types of factors without delving into
the complications of structural modeling, we use the concept of "Shapley value" to measure the
additional gain from including either set of factors into a regression explaining the dollar basis.
Formally, the Shapley R2 's of policy and risk factors are given by

                                          1 2          1
                                  policy =  R policy + ( R2  - R2risk ),

such that

                                          policy + risk = R2
                                                           all .


Above, R2                                        2
          i , i  { all , policy, risk }, is the R measure obtained from running the regression includ-
ing all factors, the policy-related factors only, and the risk-related factors only, respectively. We
focus on the four major G10 currencies (GBP, CHF, EUR and JPY) for which we could assess
the impact of quantitative easing. In the policy set we also include U.S. and foreign IBOR rates,
the term premium differential, and the residual from projecting the broad U.S. dollar index on
the safe haven common factor, as the dollar's non-safe haven movement may broadly capture
the effect of monetary policy through the "risk-taking channel" (Bruno and Shin, 2015a). Table
10 reports the Shapley values this exercise produces when applied both to the 2010-2018 sample
and the sample that begins in 2014. On the entire post-crisis sample, the risk channel contributes
more to explaining the variation of Libor basis. However, the relative importance of risk-related
variables seems to decline over time, as the Shapley values for both sets of regressors are more
similar in magnitude over 2014-2018.

Note: This table reports Shapley the R2 s obtained from three panel regressions of the three-month Libor basis on
policy- and risk-ralted vaiables explaining deviations from CIP. The sample breakdown is 2010M1-2018M11 and
2014M1-2018M11. The policy channel variables are the central bank balance sheet/M2 ratio, the term premium
differential, US and foreign IBOR rates, and the dollar residual from the safe-haven factor. The risk channel variables
are the dollar safe-haven factor, the log VIX index, the forward bid-ask spread, and the He, Kelly and Manela (2017)
squared intermediary leverage ratio. The regressions are estimated on a four-currency panel (consisteing of CHF,
GBP, EUR, JPY). See the text for the computation formula for Shapley values.


4      Regulations, swaps, and period-end dynamics
Given interest rates, movements in the dollar basis can be understood intuitively as a result of
supply-demand imbalances in the market for dollar swaps. In this section, we focus on period
ends, when such imbalances becomes particularly large, to understand better the role of regu-
latory factors in allowing deviations from CIP. We first extend the analysis of Du, Tepper and
Verdelhan (2018) and show that recent regulatory measures focused on systemically important
banks have exacerbated dollar funding pressure at year ends, as evidenced by a notable spike in
three-month synthetic funding costs. Then, we show that the volume of period-end swap line
draws, potentially reflecting excess dollar funding demand, also tends to rise around period-
ends. We provide estimates of the size of such spikes for both the basis and the swap line usage
using an event-study methodology.


4.1      G-SIB window-dressing and CIP deviations

Implementation of post-GFC regulatory reforms has raised the shadow price of balance-sheet
capacity and thus constrained more tightly the banking sector's ability to conduct balance-sheet
costly CIP arbitrage. As shown by Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018), short-tenor (one-week
and one-month) CIP deviations tend to widen around quarter-ends as banks make financial
reports and disclose leverage ratios. Differences in the reference period used to compute different
regulatory indicators could lead to different levels of balance sheet pressures around period-ends.
In particular for Europe, a quarter-end balance sheet snapshot is used, resulting in European
banks sharply retreating from CIP arbitrage around quarter-ends.21
    The G-SIB surcharge introduced at the start of 2016 may have imposed additional pressure on
swap markets at period ends, raising the relative cost of synthetic dollar funding. The surcharge
is assessed based on previous-year measures of banks' systemic importance, with the notional
    21 See
        also Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) for a summary of regulatory measures that contribute to rising balance
sheet constraints on banks, which can be passed forward to unregulated clients such as hedge funds.
                                                        31


amount of OTC derivates explicitly considered under the "complexity" category of the sytemic
risk indicators.22 Based on year-end balance sheets (according to Correa, Du and Liao (2020) for
the United States and Behn, Mangiante, Parisi and Wedow (2019) for Europe), this regulatory
arrangement motivates window-dressing behaviors aimed at reducing the size of balance sheets
toward year ends to avoid being assessed into a higher bucket of surcharges.23 Berry, Khan
and Rezende (2020) demonstrate that U.S. G-SIBs lower the amount of OTC derivatives during
the fourth quarter of the year, while Behn, Mangiante, Parisi and Wedow (2019) offer similar
evidence for European banks.24
    As the scope of G-SIB regulation reaches beyond short-tenor currency derivatives, we ex-
pect to see the impact of regulation on longer-tenor bases, which are relatively immune to usual
quarter-end dynamics away from the end of the year, as Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) showed.
Using an event-study approach, we demonstrate that the dollar basis at three-month tenor widens
significantly during periods associated with year-end financial reporting. Given the T + 2 set-
tlement convention in forward exchange markets, three-month currency derivatives traded from
late September to late December typically mature (i.e., have value or delivery dates) in the fol-
lowing year, creating a three-month time window in which these instruments stay on financial
intermediaries' year-end balance sheet.25 Thus, we should expect the G-SIB surchage to make
the three-month basis even more negative when trades enter year-end balance sheets during late
September. By the same token, trades done very late in December do not settle until the following
year, and thus do not appear on the year-end balance sheet in the same year that the trade is ex-
ecuted. Thus, banks should be more willing to lend for covered interest arbitrage in the last two
days of December, making dollar bases less negative then. We test these predictions for the panel
of G10 currencies by projecting the daily three-month Libor basis on a set of dummy variables
indicating days before and after the first day and the last day of this time window (and including
currency fixed effects). Figure 5 illustrates the evidence, which supports our hypothesis. For the
sample after 2016, we observe a signficant downward jump of the basis in late September (Figure
5a), and this effect becomes even stronger during the recent two years (Figure 5c), during at least
part of which the G-SIB surcharge has been fully phased in. We also observe a smaller upward
jump on the last two days of December (Figure 5b and 5d), with the effect statistically significant
at 5 percent level for the 2018-2019 sample. In contrast, the corresponding effects for the sample
restricted to 2013 to 2015 are small and insignificant for both the start and the end of the time
  22 See  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2018) and Berry, Khan and Rezende (2020) for more details regard-
ing the institutional background and the G-SIB assessment methodology.
   23 In the U.S., Form FR Y-15 is used to construct systemic risk measures.
   24 Krohn and Sushko (2020) use detailed swap quotes and show that G-SIB banks' dealer arms pull back from

liquidity provision for FX swaps of 1-month tenor. The issue of G-SIB window-dressing has also been discussed in
Borio, Iqbal, McCauley, McGuire and Sushko (2018).
   25 More specifically, similar to Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018) for the case of one-week and one-month forwards,

this time window is defined as trade dates on which the settlement date of a three-month forward contract is within
the current year, and the maturity date is in the following year.

window (Figure 5e and 5f). These findings lend support to the role of the year-end G-SIB score
calculation in driving the window-dressing behavior of G-SIBs via higher charges for funding
interest arbitrage.


4.2       Swap-line use at quarter ends

Recent studies demonstrate that central bank liquidity swaps are capable of easing dollar funding
conditions and reducing deviations from CIP during the money market turmoil in the Great
Financial Crisis (Baba and Packer, 2009). Bahaj and Reis (2020b), using a no-arbitrage argument,
show that swap lines should act as a ceiling on the dollar basis to stabilize synthetic dollar
funding costs and provide empirical support to this theory. From the swap operations disclosure
from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in recent years, two observations emerge:

      · In recent years, the scale of dollar swap usage was small in general before the outbreak
        of the COVID-19 pandemic.26 Among foreign central banks, only the European Central
        Bank and (less frequently) the Bank of Japan sporadically tapped into dollar swap lines
        for short-term dollar. This pattern prevailed until March 2020, when swaps became more
        widely available on more attractive terms, and the demand for swaps exploded for a time
        due to financial-market tensions.

      · Until the COVID-19 crisis, large dollar swap line draws generally coincided with quarter
        ends, when dollar liquidity worsened and CIP deviations, measured by the one-week Libor
        basis, spiked. Figure 4 plots the balance outstanding of the ECB-Fed short-term dollar
        swap line (defined as swap draws of tenor smaller than or equal to three weeks)27 against
        the one-week euro-dollar basis. Not only is there a qualitative pattern of comovement, but
        quantitatively, Figure 4 provides suggestive evidence that higher swap line draws tend to
        be associated with a wider basis, especially at year ends after 2017.28

   As the Fed-ECB swap line is largely inactive during periods away from quarter-ends after
2017 and through early 2020 (possibly due to stigma concerns), period-end swap operations after
2017 can be used as an imperfect proxy for dollar funding strain at quarter ends. Intuitively,
  26 At the peak of the financial system turmoil in the first part of 2020, more than USD 40 billion worth of one-week
dollar swaps were outstanding for the ECB-Fed swap line. While this number is much higher than the usual quarter-
end or year-end swap usage prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the nature of such usage may be different, possibly due to
heightened concern on counterparty risk and the removal of stigma associated with tapping the swap lines.
   27 We add up all swap draws with tenors no greater than three weeks into a pooled measure of "short-term" funding,

as dollar swaps with a two-week or three-week tenor, rather than the conventional one-week tenor, tend to be drawn
at year-ends.
   28 The relationship between swap line draws and the one-week EUR-USD basis seems to break down during the

COVID crisis. While the swap line was actively and heavily utilized, the size of the basis movement was similar
to with previous spikes during year-ends. From a normative perspective, this observation could imply that a more
frequent and flexible swap-line operation schedule may help to alleviate dollar funding stress on a more continuous
basis.

Note: Figure 4 plots the time-series of one-week EUR Libor basis against USD, along with total amount outstanding (in billions
USD) of short-term swap line draws from ECB-Fed swap line. Short-term swap line usage is defined as swap line draws with a
maturity fewer than or equal to 21 days.



at quarter ends, the retreat of usual sources of short-term dollar funding may prompt dollar
borrowing through swap lines, as well as a more negative basis. By jointly scrutinizing the
period-end jump in swap line usage by the ECB and the jump in the one-week EUR dollar basis,
one obtains a further perspective on the impact of regulatory frictions. Furthermore, informed by
the analysis in Section 4.1 and Correa, Du and Liao (2020), comparing the estimates for quarter-
ends and year-ends provides further evidence of G-SIBs' retreat from exploiting CIP differentials.
    We apply a similar event-study approach as in Section 4.1 to weekly averages of 1-week EUR
dollar basis between 2017 and 2019. We project each dependent variables on a set of dummy
variables indicating weeks around both quarter ends and year ends. The period 2017-2019 offers
a clean sample window to conduct the estimate, as there is very little borrowing via swap lines
away from quarter ends, and the prime money market mutual fund reform completed at October
2016 further reduced dollar funding sources for foreign banks.29 Figure 6 reports the response of
dollar swaps outstanding and 1-week EUR Libor basis around quarter and year ends. Reading
from the peak of the estimated coefficients, a 40 basis point widening of deviations from CIP
occurs at quarter ends that are not also year ends, along with a USD 2 billion ECB dollar drawing.
For year ends, the basis spikes by 260 basis points while ECB swaps with the Fed rise by USD
6.5 billion. These estimates indicate that for each USD 1 billion swap drawing during quarter
ends that are not also year ends, 20 basis points are added to the dollar basis on average (i.e.,
260/6.5 - 40/2). Our ballpark estimates of the swaps-basis correlation based on swap line usage
are broadly consistent with Correa, Du and Liao (2020), who use daily supervisory data on
  29 Anderson, Du and Schlusche (2019) provide evidence that following the prime MMF reform, global banks further
cut back on arbitrage positions funded by unsecured borrowing.

U.S. G-SIBs.30 Further analysis of the implications of this correlation would require an explicit
structural model of the swaps market.




  30 U.S.G-SIBs supply USD 10 billion less arbitrage capital during year ends compared with quarter ends (Figure
8 and C.3 in Correa, Du and Liao (2020)) through "reserve fracking" (tapping excess reserves at the Fed), and the
associated additional widening of the intermediation cost of 150 basis points (Figure 7 in Correa, Du and Liao (2020))
leads to a ballpark estimate of around 15 bps per billion dollar additional pressure on the one-week EUR dollar basis
at year-ends.

The bases are projected on a set of dummy variables indicating days around the start and end of the time window in
which a three-month forward's settlement date is of a different year than its maturity date, with the T + 2 settlement
convention. Day 0 in Figures 5a, 5c, and 5e typically refers to two days before the end of September, while Day 0 in
Figures 5b, 5d, and 5f typically refers to two days before the end of December. We compute Driscoll and Kraay

5      Implications for synthetic dollar borrowers and investors
The post-crisis breakdown of covered interest parity directly affects the returns to and costs of
dollar intermediation and investment. As a result, CIP deviations may have important implica-
tions for capital flows across borders as well as for the international transmission of monetary
policies. For those who want to borrow U.S. dollars, the synthetic borrowing cost (via the swap
market) need no longer equal the direct borrowing cost.31 For foreign investors in dollars, cov-
ered returns may vary with respect to domestic-currency returns.
    In this section we switch gears from potential determinants of the basis to examine two
aspects of the correlation of basis changes with changes in macro-relevant variables. We view
these results as mainly suggestive of avenues deserving further research.
    As a first example, consider that non-U.S. financial institutions in Europe and Japan tend to
face a widened dollar basis during periods of financial tightening and higher risk aversion. In
such situations, however, wider CIP deviations appear to add to synthetic dollar funding costs,
further reducing profitability. In columns 1 and 2 of Table 11, we report panel regressions (for
the G10 currencies) of changes in monthly averages of implied synthetic dollar funding cost on
monthly averages of basis changes. The left-hand variable is measured by subtracting the Libor
basis from the 3-month dollar Libor rate. The table shows that a more negative Libor basis is
expected to feed almost one-for-one into a higher synthetic dollar funding cost. The large R2 s
obtained from this exercise further indicate that a considerable fraction of variations in synthetic
dollar borrowing costs can be explained by fluctuations in the cross-currency basis.
    As a second example, notice that for non-U.S. investors in dollar-denominated securities such
as pension funds and insurance companies in Europe and Japan, post-GFC deviations from CIP
may add to the costs of hedging against exchange rate movements. Fully hedging one's entire
dollar portfolio may become less justifiable when CIP deviations widen to increase the cost of
hedging, strengthening the motive to seek better yields by unwinding FX derivatives, substituting
for riskier securities, or scaling back dollar investments altogether. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 11
report time-series coefficients from a regression on the JPY-USD Libor basis of implied yen yields
on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds when currency risk is continously hedged on a three-month basis
(with variables, as above, is in first differences). In line with our previous finding, a fall in the
basis by 100 basis points reduces the hedged return by around 98 basis points in our full post-
GFC sample (i.e., a less negative basis would raise the hedged return, according to the coefficients
in columns 3 and 4).
    Are offshore investors responding to changes in hedged returns that are partly driven by
CIP deviations? Using financial reports from major Japanese insurers, Figure 7 documents the
comovement between dollar hedge ratios and the synthetic yield on the long-term U.S. Treasury
bonds that comprise the bulk of the expanding international portfolio of Japanese non-bank in-
    31 Du
        (2019) link the disconnect of onshore and offshore dollar rates to the "pass-through efficiency" of U.S. monetary
policy after the GFC.

stitutions. As the yield on hedged investment in dollar-denominated government bonds became
less attractive, Japanese insurers reduced its share of hedged dollar investment by more than 15
percentage points from the 2011 level, taking on more currency risk with a higher fraction of
unhedged dollar asset holdings.

Note: Table 11 explores the correlation between synthetic borrowing costs and currency-hedged investment returns
vis-a-vis 3-month Libor basis. Column (1) and (2) reports G10 panel regressions of synthetic borrowing costs,
measured by US Libor rate minus the basis for each currency, on the corresponding basis. Column (3) and (4) reports
time-series regressions of currency-hedged return on the JPYUSD basis. The currency-hedged return is computed by
adding to annualized 10-year US treasury yield a hedging cost component. Assuming continous hedging using
3-month forward, the hedging cost is given by the difference between 3-month US and Japan Libor rates, minus the
3-month JPYUSD Libor basis. All variables are collapsed to monthly averages. Column (1) and (2) report Driscoll
and Kraay (1998) standard errors while column (3) and (4) report autocorrelation-robust standard errors with lag

    Figure 7: Hedged yen return on Treasurys and dollar hedge ratio of major Japanese insurers
Note: The aggregate dollar asset hedge ratio of eight major Japanese insurance companies is computed from
semi-annual disclosures of net positions in currency forwards and swaps. Portfolios from "general accounts" are
used wherever possible. Ten-year JPY-hedged returns, expressed in percentage points and collapsed to semi-annual
averages (consistent with the fiscal year convention), are computed by adding a hedging cost component (dollar
Libor minus yen Libor minus the Libor basis) to the constant-maturity dollar yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury securities.


6     Conclusions
This paper sheds empirical light on the relationships between key macrofinancial variables and
deviations from covered interest parity, with a focus on the decade after the global financial crisis.
We highlight the role played by risk-taking capacity, FX market liquidty, unconventional mone-
tary policy, and financial regulation, but we also provide evidence that some of these variables'
explanatory power is typically heterogeneous across individual currencies and sometimes varies
over time. An in-depth analysis of the contribution of country-specific characteristics, such as
financial structure and exchange rate policy, could be an interesting extension. Equally worth ex-
ploring are the reasons behind the time-series evolution of basis correlations with macrofinancial
variables, which could help us better to identify the persistent underlying forces allowing CIP
deviations.
    The macroeconomic significance of the post-crisis breakdown of CIP, briefly addressed in
Section 5, remains an important topic. Do deviations from CIP have a quantitatively significant
impact on the pattern of cross-border capital flows and the cross-border transmission of U.S.
monetary policy or other countries' monetary policies? What role does the cross-currency basis
play in exchange rate determination? How much does a persistently negative dollar basis add to
the "exorbitant privilege" enjoyed by the U.S. as an international reserve currency issuer? What
are the specific implications for emerging market economies and their corporate borowers? These
topics are of central importance for policy and should be high on the agenda for future research.

A    Data
Construction of the dollar basis Our construction of various components used to compute CIP
deviations is similar to Du, Tepper and Verdelhan (2018). We compute forward premia and the
forward bid-ask spreads using daily London close forward points and spot rates from Bloomberg.
Our daily IBOR rates come from Thomson Reuters/Datastream. Bloomberg series are used as
supplements wherever needed. We convert the discrete-term interest rates to continuously com-
pounded rates, using contract settlement and maturity dates from Bloomberg. We obtain yields
of treasury securities from Thomson Reuters/Datastream. In a few cases (such as Australia), we
follow Du, Lim and Schreger (2018) and use Bloomberg Fair Value (BFV) series. Table A1 lists
the tickers used for our baseline three-month tenor regressions.

Factors contributing to CIP deviations   We collect time series from various sources:


    Effective exchange rates, VIX and liquidity For the U.S. dollar, we use daily data on the
nominal broad dollar index (goods only) published in the Federal Reserve H.10 release. Our last
observation of the goods-only index is for December 31, 2019. We use changes in the absolute
level of the index in our regressions. For the JPY and CHF indices, we use daily releases from
BIS. We download the daily CBOE VIX index from Datastream and log transform the index. We
use the daily closing forward point bid-ask spread to proxy for FX market liquidity conditions.


   Risk measures The global risky asset price factor comes from the January 2020 update of
the Miranda-Agrippino-Rey dataset (Miranda-Agrippino, Nenova and Rey, 2020), covering the
                                                       46


sample until April 2019.32 First differences of log prices are used to extract the global factor, and
the final global factor is obtained by cumulation and standardization. For intermediary leverage,
we use daily measures provided by He, Kelly and Manela (2017) (henthforth HKM), covering
the sample until November 2018. The HKM capital ratios are calculated by aggregating the
market value of equity (share price times shares outstanding) and book value of debt of primary
dealers. We standardize the squared leverage ratio measure by normalizing it by its mean and
standard deviation.33 We use the square of the inverse of HKM's capital ratio measure. In Online
Appendix B, we consider four more risk measures: the CBOE S&P 500 3-month volatility index
(VXV, from FRED), the CBOE S&P 100 30-day volatility index (VXO, from FRED), the swap
dealer CDS spread (the average 5-year Markit CDS spread of major swap dealers), and the BEX
risk aversion measure (a monthly average of the daily risk-aversion index provided by Bekaert,
Engstrom and Xu (2020)).34 .


   Central bank balance sheets and swap line operations Data on central bank balance sheets
come from various sources. For the United States, we use total assets less eliminations from
consolidations from the Federal Reserve's weekly H.4.1 releases. Total assets of the European
Central Bank and Bank of Japan are obtained from FRED. Total assets of the Bank of England
and the Swiss National Bank come from central bank websites. We normalize the balance sheets
measured in local currency by the domestic M2 stock, obtained from CEIC. We log transform
the ratio of normalized balance sheet sizes, multiply by 100, and use the first difference in our
regressions. We obtain weekly swap line operation results from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.35 We consider all swap line draws with a tenor equal to or smaller than three weeks.


    Term premia Following Greenwood, Hanson, Stein and Sunderam (2020), we use distant-
horizon forward rates (one-year rates nine years forward) computed from zero-coupon yield
curves as proxies for term premia on ten-year government bonds. Zero-coupon yield curves are
obtained from national sources. Our sample covers Australia, Canada, the United States, the
United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, and the euro area. For the euro area, we use the yield
curve of triple-A government securities. For the United States, we directly take the one-year
forward rate (SVEN1F09) from the Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2007) dataset, which is highly
correlated with canonical estimates of the term premium such as Adrian, Crump and Moench
(2013). For Japan, there are no available data on the zero-coupon yield curve. As the coupon
yield on Japanese government bonds is low in recent periods, we use the constant-maturity yield
curve published by the Ministry of Finance.

   Currency hedging position We manually obtain currency hedging statistics of major Japanese
insurers from semi-annual earnings reports. Currency hedges are defined as the net outstanding
position in currency swaps and forwards (but not including options).

Table B1: Panel regression of Libor basis with 10-year Treasury rates as benchmark interest rates
Note: This table reports the results of panel regressions of monthly changes in the 3-month Libor basis on changes in
interest rates,the broad dollar, the log VIX, and the forward bid-ask spread. Unlike in Table 1, however, 10-year
treasury yields are used as benchmark interest rates on the right-hand side of the regressions. The panel consists of
G10 currencies against the US dollar. Samples are split into before (02-06), during (07-09), and after (10-19, 14-19) the
global financial crisis. Monthly averages are used. We report Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors:  p < 0.1, 
p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.

              Table B3: Panel regressions: 3-month basis and additional risk measures
Note: This table reports panel regressions of 3-month Libor basis on a set of baseline regressors as well as additional
risk measures and the He, Kelly and Manela (2017) squared intermediary leverage ratio, using samples spanning
2010 (or 2014) to 2018M11. The row "Risk measure" takes one of the four risk measures corresponding to the
column titles. Log VXO refers to the natural logarithm of the CBOE S&P 100 30-day volatility index. Log VXV refers
to the natural logarithm of the CBOE S&P 500 3-month volatility index. The swap dealer CDS spread is the average
5-year Markit CDS spread of major swap dealers, aggregated from the swap dealer registry of the National Futures
Association. BEX risk aversion is the monthly average of the daily risk-aversion index provided by Bekaert,
Engstrom and Xu (2020). We report Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors:  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.
