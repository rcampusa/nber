COVID-19 relief legislation offers a unique setting to study how political representation shapes
the distribution of federal assistance to state and local governments. We provide evidence of a
substantial small-state bias: an additional Senator or Representative per million residents predicts
an additional $670 dollars in aid per capita across the four relief packages. Alignment with
the Democratic party predicts increases in states' allocations through legislation designed after
the January 2021 political transition. This benefit of partisan alignment operates through
the American Rescue Plan Act's sheer size, as well as the formulas through which it
distributed transportation and general relief funds.

I. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn it triggered have led to a wave of federal
legislation containing fiscal assistance for state and local governments. In total, federal aid to state and
local governments spanned four legislative vehicles and summed to almost $1 trillion, which is
unprecedented when compared with previous crises or recessions.2 This aid has been distributed
through a variety of channels and mechanisms, including general aid to states, general aid to local
governments, and aid appropriated for specific functions of state and local government. Further, direct
aid has been shaped by formulas that are designed at the discretion of the US Congress.3 We analyze the
resulting distributions to gain insight into the channels through which political representation influences
the distribution of federal funds.

We find evidence of pervasive small-state bias across each of the legislative vehicles. Adding across the
four main pieces of legislation, we estimate that having an additional Senator or Representative per
million residents predicts an additional $670 dollars in combined state and local aid per capita. While
this analysis relies on cross-sectional variations in representation across states, the evidence is quite
strongly suggestive of a causal role for small states' disproportionate representation. The small-state
bias we estimate is orthogonal to variations in the pandemic's impact on tax revenues, the labor market,
and overall economic output. It is also orthogonal to the baseline size of the state and local public
sector. By way of comparison with estimates in the literature, an advantage of $670 per capita is 12.5
times the magnitude of the annual benefit of a district representative's alignment with the party of the
President in "normal times," as estimated by Berry, Burden and Howell (2010).

Next, we examine the relevance of partisan control by analyzing differences in the distribution of funds
associated with the March 2021 American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) relative to legislation enacted by the
previous congress. We show that arrival of the Democratic trifecta predicts a non-trivial increase in aid
allocated to states whose delegations lean Democratic rather than Republican. A fully Democratic
delegation predicts a $300 per capita increase in federal funds under unified Democratic control of the
federal government relative to the previous year's divided government.

A first contribution of our analysis is thus to add to the extensive body of work on the consequences of
partisan control at the local and state levels (Alt and Lowry, 1994; Poterba, 1994; Ansolabehere et al.,
2002; Reed, 2006; Ferreira and Gyourko, 2009; Bertocchi et al, 2020; Dynes and Holbein, 2020). Papers
in this literature have investigated some of the factors we consider here. Most notably, there is prior
evidence on the role of disproportionate representation (Hauk and Wacziarg, 2007; Knight, 2008) and on
the alignment of a district or state's delegation with the President (Berry, Burden, and Howell, 2010) or
with the majority party (Albouy, 2013). There has also been significant work on presidential efforts to
maximize his number of votes in the electoral college (Wright, 1974) and on efforts to use federal
spending to aid the survival of weak incumbents (Bickers and Stein, 1996). The findings from our



2
  The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), for example, included some $225 billion for three
years of fiscal relief for state and local governments between general relief and funds for specific programs and
projects (Inman, 2010).

  This is not necessarily a given. As Wright (1974) notes in the context of the allocation of resources by the Works
Progress Administration: "In 1939 WPA appropriations were cut back, and Congressional pressure forced the
agency to state its allocative criteria much more explicitly (though it never quite revealed a precise formula)."

                                                          2
analyses of the roles of both small-state bias and alignment with unified partisan control are consistent
with these earlier analyses.

Through additional pieces of analysis, we provide several novel advances to the literature on the
mechanisms through which shifts in political power translate into shifts in the allocation of funds. A
unique aspect of our setting is that we are able to analyze four major pieces of legislation that serve the
same general purpose, namely to shore up the fiscal capacity of state and local governments as they
responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows our analysis to focus on mechanisms other than
variation in legislative priorities, which have been found to be important elsewhere. For example,
Albouy (2013) finds that Republicans have a preference for defense and transportation contracts while
Democrats have a preference for education dollars. Levitt and Snyder (1995) find large differences in
fund disbursements at the end of a period of Democratic control, and highlight that these differences
can be driven by tweaking formulas, by altering legislative priorities, or by a combination of both
mechanisms.

We dig into the mechanisms through which funds can be shifted in the context of legislation targeted at
the same overall priority. We show that choice of allocative formulas plays a major role. Relative to the
CARES Act's population-driven formula for allocating general fiscal relief, the ARPA's unemployment
driven formula skews dollars towards states with either large pandemic-driven increases in
unemployment or with high baseline rates of structural unemployment. These states lean
disproportionately Democratic. In addition, while we find that the Democratic party's trifecta predicts a
substantial shift in transportation funds towards states with heavily Democratic delegations, we find no
such shift in education funds, where aid formulas tend to be linked to pupil counts.

We also find the sheer magnitude of the ARPA's fiscal assistance package to be an important lever.
Gauging the required size of the ARPA's fiscal assistance package requires drawing on analyses of the
pandemic's effects on state and local government finances. The available analyses implied a need for an
additional $100 to $200 billion at most (see e.g. Auerbach et al., 2020; Clemens, Ippolito, and Veuger,
2020; Whitaker, 2020b). Indeed, forecasts for states' summer 2021 budgeting processes revealed
substantial surpluses, including a remarkable $75.7 billion surplus forecast for California (Yamamura,
2021). While the Democratic bias in the share of funds allocated in the ARPA is modest, the choice to
allocate $500 billion rather than $100 to $200 billion accounts for much of the Democratic states' $300
per capita advantage relative to Republican states.

Third, we contribute to the literature on state and local government budgets over the course of the
pandemic. An initial wave of papers in this literature sought to forecast the magnitudes of the revenue
shortfalls faced by various levels of government within the United States (Auerbach et al., 2020;
Clemens and Veuger, 2020a, 2020b; Chernick et al., 2020; Gordon, Dadayan, and Rueben, 2020;
Whitaker, 2020a; 2020b). Additional analyses have considered the pandemic's implications for spending
needs (Gordon and Reber, 2020; Clemens, Ippolito, and Veuger, forthcoming). Analyses have also
explored the effects of initial state and local aid allocations on government employment (Green and
Loualiche, 2020). We offer the first analysis to focus on determinants of federal allocations to state and
local governments across all four major pieces of COVID-response legislation, which were of
unprecedented scope.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data. Section 3 presents our empirical framework
and analysis of small-state bias. Section 4 does the same for the consequences of unified Democratic
control after the 2020 elections. Section 5 concludes.



II. Data

Our analysis is centered on four major pieces of legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic, each of
which directed federal relief to state and local governments. These are the CARES Act, the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), the Response and Relief Act (RRA), and the American Rescue Plan
Act (ARPA). Readers interested in detailed legislative histories can find a summary of key dates in
Appendix Figure A1. For our purposes, the most crucial detail is that the CARES Act, the FFCRA, and the
RRA were passed by the 116th Congress and signed by President Trump, while the ARPA was passed by
the 117th Congress and signed by President Biden. Taken together, these packages constituted a massive
relief effort that provided as much as $6 trillion in income support to households, a mix of loans, grants,
and tax relief to firms and non-profits, additional funding for (public) health efforts, and
intragovernmental grants to subnational governments. This final category includes around $900 billion
in funds for state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as the District of Columbia. We focus
on the first two types of subnational governments here, namely those with full congressional
representation.

We use data from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (2021) to summarize the funds each
bill appropriated to state and local governments. We complete these data with information from several
sources. We obtain information on the distribution of transit funds for the RRA and ARPA from the US
Federal Transit Administration (2021a, 2021b). Data on the allocation of ARPA assistance to non-public
schools come from the US Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (2021). We obtain estimates of
ARPA section 9817 matching increases from Chidambaram and Musumeci (2021). We approximate the
allocation of ARPA section 9819 federal matching funds for uncompensated care using FY2021 estimates
of federal disproportionate share hospital allotments by state from the Medicaid and Chip Payment
Access Commission (2021).4 We then present these data as funds directed to state governments, funds
directed to state and local educational agencies, and funds directed to other local governments.5 The

  Specifically, we use the FY2021 disproportionate share hospital federal allotment estimates, calculated without
FFCRA adjustments, as presented in Table 5A (Medicaid and Chip Payment Access Commission, 2021). Section
9813 of the ARPA allocates $1.2B for crisis mental health matching funds that the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget (2021) classifies as state and local aid. We were unable to find estimates of how these funds will be
allocated.

  The CARES Act contains funds allocated under the Coronavirus State and Local Relief Fund that go to both state
and local governments, funds allocated under the Elementary and Secondary Relief Fund that go to local
governments, funds allocated under the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund and Innovation Grants that
go to states, election funds allocated to states, and transit funds allocated under sections 5307 and 5311 formulas
that go to localities. FFCRA contains Medicaid matching funds that go to states. RRA contains funds allocated under
the Elementary and Secondary Relief Fund that go to local governments, funds allocated under the Governor's
Emergency Education Relief Fund that go to states, transit funds allocated under sections 5307, 5310, and 5311
formulas to localities, and section 133 formula transportation funds to states. ARPA contains funds allocated under
the Coronavirus State and Local Relief Fund that go to both state and local governments, Elementary and
Secondary Relief Fund that go to local governments, funds allocated under the Governor's Emergency Education
Relief Fund that go to states, transit funds allocated to localities using section 5307, 5310, and 5311 formulas as

                                                         4
funds can also be divided across three functional categories, namely transportation funds, education
funds, and general fiscal assistance (defined here to include all other fiscal assistance).

Figure 1 provides an initial look at the distribution of funds across the four pieces of legislation. Dollar
values are expressed on a per capita basis and are divided into general relief funds, transportation
funds, and education funds. Panel A provides an initial look at bias in favor of small states, which benefit
from over-representation in the US Congress. The small state bias emerges primarily through general
relief funds, which were distributed through formulas featuring floor functions. Panel B provides an
initial sense of partisan advantage. In particular, it is apparent that transportation dollars skew towards
Democratic leaning states, that education dollars exhibit very little partisan skew, and that general relief
dollars exhibited a strong partisan skew under the ARPA, but not in the earlier pieces of legislation. The
maps in Figure A2 reinforce both of these initial impressions. They reveal that small states and mid- to
large-sized Democratic-leaning states appear repeatedly in the top quintiles of the bills' aid
distributions, while mid- to large-sized Republican-leaning states appear repeatedly in the bottom
quintiles.

Our analysis focuses on two types of dependent variables. The first type expresses each bill's funding on
a per capita basis. The second type focuses on how each states' share of each bill's funding compares
with its share of the national population. We construct this "proportional share" of funds for each state
in each bill as follows:
                                                                         
                                                                         / 
                                                                            
                                         =                                                              (1)
                                                                         / 
                                                                           


In equation (1),  is the amount of money allocated to state i in bill b, and  is the 2020
population in state i. When     is greater than (less than) 1, a state has
received a disproportionately large (small) share of the funds in bill b.

Our main independent variables relate to the distribution of power at the federal level. We use data
from Lewis (2021) to construct the share of US House and US Senate seats held by each political party in
the 116th Congress and the 117th Congress. We then average the Democratic Party's share of House and
Senate seats in each state to construct the Democrats' congressional share.6 Values for the 116th
Congress map to the CARES Act, FFCRA, and RRA, and values for the 117th Congress map to ARPA. We
use a second political variable that interacts the Democratic party share with a dummy that takes a
value of 1 in the 117th Congress, signifying the switch to unified Democratic Party control of the House,
Senate, and Presidency. Our third political variable measures "small-state bias" using the total number
of US Senate seats and US House seats per 1,000,000 state residents. Smaller states have more
representatives per 1,000,000 people, which reflects their disproportionate share of seats in the Senate
and, to a lesser degree, in the House.




well as capital investment grants, and Medicaid matching increases for uncompensated care (section 9819) and
community based services (section 9817) that go to states.

  We count independent members of congress as Democrats if they caucus with the Democrats. We also count the
two Arizona Senate seats as 50 percent Democratic in the 116th Congress, Georgia's two Senate seats as 100
percent Democratic in the 117th Congress, and CA-25 and NJ-2 as Republican seats in the 116th Congress.

                                                     5
A second set of independent variables describes the economic shocks and fiscal projections that
contributed to estimates of states' fiscal needs as driven by the pandemic. To proxy for state-specific
revenue shocks, we add Whitaker's (2020b) estimates of the realized decline in state and local
government revenues in fiscal year 2020 to the projected revenue loss in fiscal year 2021. For the latter,
we use estimates from Whitaker's "slow" recovery scenario. Note that Whitaker's combined estimate of
state and local government revenue losses, spanning the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, is $312 billion,
which is far less than the $900 billion ultimately allocated by the federal government. To measure the
unemployment shock from the pandemic, we purposefully adopt the ARPA's formula for distributing
general relief, which is a function of the average number of unemployed persons per capita during the
fourth quarter of 2020 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021). Finally, we proxy at a broad level for
declines in economic activity using the percent change in total personal income between the fourth
quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020.

Our final pair of independent variables describe the outlays of state and local governments. We use the
2018 Survey of State and Local Government Finances (US Census Bureau, 2019a) to sum together direct
expenditures of state and local governments. We also use the total acres of federal land by state, as
reported in Vincent et al. (2020), to proxy for federal spending associated with lands under direct
control of the federal government. We report both variables on a per capita basis.

Table 1 presents summary statistics on the full set of variables that are utilized in our analysis. Note, as
can be seen in Figure 1, that not all forms of relief appeared in all four pieces of legislation.
Consequently, some of the fiscal variables we analyze are associated with 150 observations, while
others are associated with 200 observations. Additional details on the definitions of key variables can be
found in Appendix Table A1.



III. Small-State Bias

In this section we commence our empirical analysis by separately analyzing each of the CARES Act, the
FFCRA, the RRA, and the ARPA. Table 2 presents descriptive evidence on the predictors of the
distribution of federal funds, across states, for each of these four legislative vehicles. Specifically, it
presents estimates of the following equation:

          =  + (. . ) + (  . ) +   +  . (2)

In equation (2),   is the total per capita funding to state and local governments in state i
from bill b. . .  is the averaged share of state US representatives and US senators that
are members of the Democratic Party in state i.    is the total number of US
representatives and US senators divided by the population of state i. This variable varies primarily with
the US Congress's relative over-representation of small states, which is particularly strong in the senate.
 is a vector of additional state-level covariates. These include the predicted per capita tax shortfall for
state and local governments as estimated by Whitaker (2020), the average number of unemployed
persons per capita during the fourth quarter of 2020, the percentage change in personal income
between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020, the per capita total direct
expenditures of state and local governments, and the acres of federal lands per capita.  is an error
term. Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity. For our primary estimates, observations are


                                                      6
weighted by state population. Appendix table A2 reveals that we obtain quite similar results when we
weight each observation equally.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 report results for the CARES Act, Columns 3 and 4 report results for the
FFCRA, Columns 5 and 6 report results for the RRA, and Columns 7 and 8 report results for the ARPA.
The most striking finding in Table 2 is the evidence that over-represented states have benefited
disproportionately from federal dollars. Over-represented states have received more federal dollars per
resident than have under-represented states in all four of the COVID-19 fiscal relief packages, though
the estimates are not statistically distinguishable from zero for the RRA. Further, contrasting the sparse
specifications with the specifications that include additional covariates, the estimates are quite similar.
That is, the correlation between over-representation and federal dollars is not driven by spurious
correlation patterns involving states' revenue shocks, economic shocks, the size of their public sector, or
acreage of federal land. Put differently, the small state advantage is more or less orthogonal to a fairly
extensive set of proxies for dimensions of state and local government funding needs. In total, an
additional representative per million residents predicts an additional $670 to $780 per state resident
across the four pieces of legislation. This is the advantage, for example, of Montana's roughly 1 million
residents, who enjoy representation from 2 Senators and 1 representative, relative to Arkansas's
roughly 3 million residents, who enjoy only 2 representatives per million on account of their 2 Senators
and 4 representatives. Note that $670 per capita is quite large in comparison with related effects as
estimated in the literature on distributive politics. For example, it is 12.5 times the magnitude of the
annual benefit of a district's alignment with the party of the President, as estimated by Berry, Burden
and Howell (2010).7 A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that, relative to the status quo, equal
representation would have shifted some $30 billion away from small states across the four legislative
vehicles.8

Appendix Tables A2, A3, A4, and A5 provide evidence on the robustness of this initial finding. Table A2
reveals that the small-state bias is not particularly sensitive to whether or not we weight each
observation according to a state's population. For Table A3, we stack the observations associated with
the four pieces of legislation and demonstrate that our results are insensitive to adding each of the
covariates from our more heavily controlled specifications one at a time. Tables A4 and A5 reveal that
the estimates in Tables 2 and A3 are not driven by the skewness of the representation variable, as a
logged (and thus substantially less skewed) version of this variable has essentially the same degree of
predictive power.

The sparse specifications in Table 2 reveal that federal fiscal assistance has tended to be positively
correlated with the Democratic Party's share of each state's congressional delegation. Further, this
correlation was particularly strong in the ARPA, as Column 7 shows. This set of correlations, however, is

7
  Berry Burden and Howell (2010) write: "To put this advantage in perspective, note that districts receive on
average $575 million each year in high-variation program spending. The estimated 4% reward for the president's
co-partisans, therefore, amounts to about $23 million annually per district, or roughly $40 per capita." Inflation
adjusting Berry, Burden, and Howell's estimates, which are expressed in 2006 dollars, yields an estimate of $53 per
capita, which is just less than 1/12th of our $670 estimate.
8
  To arrive at this number, we first calculate the absolute deviation of each sta te's averaged number of members
of Congress per million residents from the weighted mean across states. We multiply this number by the
coefficient in Column 7 of Appendix Table A3 to arrive at the impact per resident per bill. We then aggregate
across bills and states to estimate a grand total of $29.9 billion.

                                                         7
sensitive to whether we include the more extensive set of covariates in the regression. Among these
other covariates, the strongest and most consistent correlate of federal dollars is the unemployment
variable, which has particularly strong predictive power for dollars allocated through the ARPA. These
correlations are consistent with a targeting of states which had high unemployment rates, which may
have been amplified by the newly increased power of those states' representatives. It is to the role of
the shift in federal power that we turn in the following section.



IV. Partisanship

Our analysis of the relationship between partisan political representation and the distribution of fiscal
assistance across states takes advantage of the sharp change in partisan control that occurred following
the November 2020 election and subsequent Senate runoff elections in Georgia. In these elections, the
Democratic Party secured control of the Senate and the White House, in addition to the House of
Representatives. This change enables us to estimate standard panel specifications that control for all
time-invariant factors that may differ across states. The estimates presented in Table 3 and 4 are of
equations of the following form:

 = (. .   ) + (. . ) +  +  +  .                                                                            (3)
                         
In equation (3),            represents fiscal outcomes in funding category c in state i and bill b. We
analyze two outcomes of interest, namely federal dollars per capita and the "Proportional Share of Bill"
variable described by equation (1).

Table 3 sorts funds according to the type of state or local government that received the funds. The
categories of funds in Table 3 are the total amount across state and local governments (Columns 1 and
5), funds for state governments (Columns 2 and 6), funds for counties and municipalities9 (Columns 3
and 7), and funds for educational agencies (Columns 4 and 8). The dependent variables in Columns 1
through 4 are expressed in dollars per state resident. The dependent variables in Columns 5 through 8
are expressed as the ratio of the state's share of funds in category c relative to its share of the country's
total population. Table 4 follows a similar structure, but with funds allocated according to their
functional categories: general relief funds (Columns 1 and 4), transit funds (Columns 2 and 5), and
education funds (Columns 3 and 6).

The results in Table 3 and 4 provide evidence on a nuanced set of channels through which political
representation can shape the distribution of federal funds. First, the estimate in Column 1 of Table 3
indicates that the ARPA, which was designed under uniform Democratic control of the federal
government, directed more funds towards states with heavily Democratic delegations compared to the
CARES Act, the FFRCA, and the RRA. Relative to states with entirely Republican delegations, residents of
states with entirely Democratic delegations are predicted to receive, on average, over $300 per capita
more through the ARP Act than they would have had control over Congress and the executive branch
not been unified in Democratic hands.10

9
  This category also includes other local governments that are not recipients of funds from state educational
agencies, such as utility districts.
10
   Appendix Table A6 shows that we estimate a moderately smaller differential of just under $200 when we weight
observations equally rather than weighting according to state population.

pandemic relief legislation? The additional funds could be driven by the ARP's sheer magnitude, by the
formulas through which those funds were distributed, or by its allocation across functional categories
and levels of government. We provide evidence on these mechanisms through several pieces of analysis.

In Columns 2 through 4 of Table 3, we divide federal fiscal assistance into funds directed to state
governments, funds directed to local governments within each state, and funds directed to educational
agencies for distribution to school districts, charter schools, and other recipients. We find that the state
and non-educational local components of federal aid drive the overall ARP Act advantage conferred on
states with more heavily Democratic delegations. Funding for educational agencies, in contrast, do not
differ significantly between states with different rates of Democratic representation.

In Columns 5 through 8 of Table 3 we present estimates of equation (3) for which we have replaced the
outcome variable of dollars per capita with a variable that captures the proportionality of each state's
allocation. Specifically, we use the variable described in equation (1), which describes the extent to
which states received a share of each bill's fiscal relief that was either greater or less than its share of
the population. The variable is constructed such that a value of 1 implies that a state's share of a bill's
funds was exactly equal to its share of the national population, while a value of 2 would imply a share
twice its population share.

Column 5 of Table 3 reveals that, on a proportional basis, the distribution of ARPA funds was only
modestly more tilted towards states with Democratic party delegations than were previous bills. In the
aggregate, this indicates that the significant increases in relief funds associated with unified party
control were driven primarily by the magnitude of ARPA relief relative to relief in the earlier bills.
Although the aggregate masks substantial shifts in the distribution of funds within key functional
categories, Democratic states did not receive dramatically larger shares of ARPA funds than they
received from the earlier bills.

Because Democratic states are modestly advantaged by the totality of state and local aid, a larger bill
will mean more dollars for Democratic states than for Republican states. Interpreting the magnitude of
ARPA relief requires drawing on estimates of state and local government needs. By the time the ARPA
had been drafted, essentially all analysts had arrived at the conclusion that only modest additional fiscal
relief was needed (see e.g. Clemens, Ippolito, and Veuger, 2020). Estimates of remaining need would
have implied a relief package similar in magnitude to the state and local relief found in the CARES, RRA,
and FFCRA, and the ARPA's $500 billion in aid exceeded even the largest estimates of remaining need.
These analyses have been borne out by subsequent forecasts for states' budgets in the coming year,
with California's initial forecasts projecting an astonishing $75.7 billion surplus (Yamamura, 2021). The
ARPA's magnitude should, in this sense, be interpreted as a political choice, and one that previous
analyses in the literature on distributive politics would have struggled to detect. Analyses in the
literature do not typically have directly applicable measures, comparable across time and place, of the
amount of need associated with specific legislative priorities.

Columns 6 through 8 of Table 3 reveal that the ARPA's overall distribution masks substantial shifts in the
distribution of funds for educational agencies versus other state and local government entities. The
ARPA's state government relief and, to a lesser extent, the funds distributed to counties and
municipalities, were substantially more skewed towards Democratic states than were funds from the


                                                      9
earlier bills. In contrast, the ARPA's relief for educational agencies was slightly more skewed towards
Republican states than were funds from earlier bills.

Table 4 presents results in which we divide federal relief funds according to their functional purpose
rather than according to the government entity that received them.11 Results in Columns 1 and 4
describe the distribution of general relief funds, while Columns 2 and 5 describe transportation funds
and Columns 3 and 6 describe education funds. Columns 1 through 3 analyze spending expressed in
dollars per state resident while Columns 4 through 6 are expressed in terms of each state's share of
funds relative to its share of the country's population.

Columns 1 and 2 reveal that the shift in the distribution of dollars was driven primarily by general relief
funds. Columns 4 and 5 convey, in contrast, that the proportional distribution of transit dollars was
much more heavily skewed towards Democratic states under the ARPA than were general relief funds.
These results are tied together by the fact that general relief funds account for a much larger share of
overall fiscal assistance than do transportation funds, as shown earlier in Figure 1. In contrast with
general relief and transportation dollars, we find no evidence of a shift in the partisan skew of education
dollars. Indeed, as shown earlier in Figure 1, education dollars were distributed evenly across the states
in each of the legislative vehicles in which they appeared.

What legislative mechanisms drive these shifts in the distribution of funds? An inspection of the
legislation reveals that the differential skew of fiscal relief is driven in large part by formula design. With
respect to general relief funds, the ARPA's unemployment-driven formula steered dollars to states with
high levels of unemployment, which reflect a mix of pre-pandemic and pandemic-driven factors. Among
the nation's most populous states, for example, Democratic-leaning New York and California have had
unemployment rates well above the national average, while Republican leaning Texas has been quite
close to the national average and Florida has been well beneath it. The allocation of transportation
funds is more complicated, as it reflects a combination of formula-driven and discretionary allocations.
The Section 5307 Urbanized Area Apportionment formula, for example, was used to allocate a large
share of CARES Act, RRA, and ARPA transportation dollars. This formula is driven to a significant degree
by estimates of bus mileage and skews quite strongly towards states with Democratic party delegations.
The lack of a partisan skew in education dollars similarly reflects the underlying allocation formulas.
These formulas, principally those of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, place
a heavy weight on headcounts of eligible children, who are typically children from low-income
households.



V. Discussion

An important question in both the political economy and political science literatures is how changes in
the distribution of federal funds are achieved. That is, what are the legislative mechanisms through
which changes in the distribution of funds emerge? As past research has pointed out, key mechanisms
can include agenda-setting power, standard legislative logrolling, and a governing party's ability to
advance agendas with policy priorities that target their constituents' needs and pocketbooks. Our


11
  Appendix Table A7 shows similar results when we weight observations equally rather than weighting according
to state population.

                                                      10
context is of interest in part because it provides an opportunity to assess distributive politics in the
context of multiple, salient pieces of legislation with substantial funds dedicated to the same broad end,
namely stabilization and support for state and local governments.

Our analysis reveals an important role not just for the distribution of funds in specific legislative vehicles,
but also for their size. While the ARPA was only modestly biased toward heavily Democratic states, its
large size relative to the 2020 packages induced larger absolute transfers to those states than did the
previous packages (Tables 3 and 4). This is reminiscent of the mechanism through which the U.S. fiscal
system can be at the same time both more progressive and less redistributive than the systems of other
OECD countries: simply by being smaller (Slavov and Viard, 2016). Analyses of how the budgetary pie is
distributed will typically fail to detect this particular mechanism, namely the size of the expenditure
devoted to specific legislated ends.

Our other main result is more in line with previous work in this area: representation, and in particular
the overrepresentation of small states, matters quite meaningfully for the distribution of federal funds
across states and localities. We find this small-state bias to be of substantial economic significance:
having an additional Senator or Representative per million residents predicts an additional $670 dollars
in aid per capita across the four relief packages combined. This is equivalent to 2% of U.S. income per
capita (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019b). Across all four bills, we estimate that the small-state bias altered the
allocation of around $30 billion in relief funds, which is equivalent to the funding allocated to Pfizer,
Moderna, the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, Regeron, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lily
and Company, Merck, and Novavax for the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19
vaccines and therapeutics.

The impacts of representation on the distribution of funds can be viewed as deviations from the core
purpose of fiscal relief, which is to stabilize state and local budgets in the face of macroeconomic shocks.
In the U.S. context as constituted, automatic stabilizers for the budgets of state and local governments
flow primarily through the Medicaid program and states' Unemployment Insurance programs. Such
mechanisms have the benefit of reducing the need for ad hoc, and potentially politicized, policy making
when negative shock hit. At the same time, the design of automatic stabilizers involves choices that are
less straightforward than their proponents sometimes imply, and that must also be designed through
the political process. Whether automatic or ad hoc stabilizers better target the jurisdictions with
greatest needs depends on the mix of economic and political factors that shape their design, as well as
the nature of the negative shocks we ultimately face.12

pandemic, see Clemens and Veuger (2020b).
