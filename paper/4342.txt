                       FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY:
                          CAUSE AND EFFECT


                                 ABSTRACT

         Romer and Romer (1989, 1990, 1992) identify dates where the Federal
Reserve appears to have shifted its policy towards reducing the rate of
inflation. This paper examines the economic context that drives this decision.
It finds that the Fed appears to weigh the outlook for unemployment as well
as that for inflation in making its decision about disinflation.
         Previous work has not examined the course of inflation over the
disinflations.   This paper finds responses of the inflation rate to the
"disinflations" only in a specification where the effects of the policy are
presumed to be permanent. Moreover, the Voicker disinflation is found to be
the only "disinflation" to reduce inflation permanently. The disinflation after
the 1973 OPEC price increases was effective, but only temporarily. Other
disinflations had negligible impacts on the rate of inflation over all horizons.
       Variables measuring the expected present discounted values of
unemployment and inflation are constructed. These variables are used in a
discrete-choice model to explain the Fed's decision to disinflate. This model
does a fairly good job of explaining the Fed's decisions. Both inflation and
unemployment drive the Fed's decision. For some episodes, notably in the
1970's, inflation is the main variable driving the decision. In the 1969 and
1988 episodes, unemployment matters more.

        The Federal Reserve periodically makes decisions to reduce

the rate of inflation. Romer and Romer (1989, also 1990), in a

recent and influential study, identi1' six dates since World War II

when Federal Reserve policy became explicitly disinflationary.

They have recently added a seventh date (Romer and Romer,

1992).1 They find evidence of the effectiveness of Fed policy

consistent with the predictions of the neo-Keynesian model. The

disinflations are followed by periods of substantial output and

employment loss.

        Romer and Romer, in both their historical and econometric

methodology, treat the changes in Fed policy as exogenous events.

In their examination of the Federal Open Market Committee

[FOMC] minutes, they look explicitly for innovations in Fed policy

concerning the steady-state rate of inflation. They deliberately

avoid an examination of economic conditions in dating the Fed



    'The dates identified in Romer and Romer (1989) are 1947:10,
1955:09, 1968:12, 1974:04, 1978:08, and 1979:10. Romer and
Romer (1992) adds 1988:12. The preliminary research for this
paper was carried out before the Romers identified this latest date.
The estimates in this paper, however, incorporate the new Romer
date.
                                   -2-

 decisions. In their econometric work, they treat these changes in

 Fed policy as observed, exogenous impulses that determine the

 course of real economic activity and inflation. Hence, the impact

of the policy shifts is estimated by ordinary least squares. The

dynamic multipliers implied by these estimates are thus taken as
the impact per se of the policy.

        Romer and Romer's perspective of treating policy variables

as exogenous is part of a long tradition. Most studies of the

effectiveness of monetary policy use time-series indicators of

monetary policy such as growth rates of money stocks or interest

rates as predictors of aggregate economic outcomes. By ignoring

the feedback of the economy to policy, these studies treat policy

changes as random shocks.

        But, of course, decisions by the FOMC to change policy

take place with explicit consideration of economic conditions. A

decision to disinflate is meaningful only if there is a precondition

of existing high inflation, either actual or expected. Therefore,
there must be feedback from the economy to policy-making. Even

if the Fed's actions can be regarded as predetermined, they are
                                 -3-

certainly not strictly exogenous. The FOMC is reacting to the

economy and hoping to affect it.

       The first part of this paper examines the effects of the

Fed's decision to disinflate. That these decisions are followed by

substantial declines in real activity is well documented in the

Romers' papers. Previous work does not, however, examine the

effect on inflation of the disinflationary shifts in policy. Since

disinflation is the Fed's explicit objective, I develop quantitative

estimates of the disinflationary effect of the policy change in order

to study systematically the decision to undertake it.

       The second part of the paper uses what is learned about

the effects of a decision to disinflate to examine its determinants. It

constructs measures of variables driving the Fed's decision to

disinflate. It then develops a discrete-choice model that shows how

these variables explain the Fed's actions.



1.      EFFECTS

        In discussions of cause and effect, cause usually comes

before effect. Yet, at least insofar as the empirical work for this

paper is concerned, the effects of disinflation need to be studied
                                 -4-


first. Presumably, the Fed has an estimate of the impact of its

policy before undertaking it. But in order to model that decision, I

must first construct similar estimates of the costs and benefits of

the decision.

        Surprisingly, the literature has not addressed the very basic

question, what is the consequence for inflation of a decision by the

Fed to disinflate? Empirical work by Romer and Romer

documents the costs of a decision to disinflate. They show

forecasts of production and unemployment responding to these

Federal Reserve Policy shifts. Taken for granted is that the

disinflationary episodes have a favorable impact on inflation. For

the empirical modelling of the decision to disinflate, I need,

however, a quantitative estimate of the benefits as well as the costs.

Therefore, I will examine in some detail the anti-inflation

consequences of the disinflations.



1.1.   Specification of the inflation process

       The variables I consider are inflation measured by the

consumer price index, the civilian unemployment rate, and the
                                -5-


Romer dummies.2 The goal of this section is to develop forecasts

of inflation and unemployment conditional on a policy change.

These forecasts will then be used as an input into the model of

Fed decisions in Section 2.

       Since the aim of this section is to develop forecasts, it relies

on simple time-series models of inflation and unemployment

conditional on their own lags and lags of the Romer dummies.

I present both univariate estimates and bivariate estimates, where

lags of the unemployment rate appear in the inflation equation and

vice versa.

       Figures 1 and 2 present the basic data. The unemployment

rate has a clear and well-known upward trend for most of the



    2The data are quarterly. The monthly Romer dummies are
converted to quarterly as dummies for quarters during which a
Romer date occurs. The inflation rate is measured as the three-
month percent change (log-differences at annual rate) for the
quarter. The unemployment rate is the average for the quarter.
The sample period is from 1953:1 to 1992:4 (see below for
discussion of sample period). The sample period refers to range of
the dependent variables in any equation estimated, so in those
involving lags, the appropriate pre-sample data are used.
                                  -6-


sample. In the econometric work that follows, the unemployment

rate is detrended with a linear trend. The trend arises because of

labor-market phenomena not closely linked to short-run Fed

policy, so abstracting from the trend seems appropriate.

        Specification of the inflation process is more problematic.

As a matter of theory, it is desirable to allow for persistent impacts

of the decision to disinflate on the level of inflation. Only finite

lags of the Romer dates are entered into the equations. Hence, in

an equation that has the level of inflation as the left-hand-side

variable, a policy change will have only temporary, although

possibly very persistent, impacts on the inflation rate. In a

specification where the difference of inflation is the dependent

variable, they will in general have permanent effects, although the
long-run effect could be small.

        Of course, the empirical persistence of the inflation process

must be considered. Previous work has found post-World War II

inflation, in contrast with earlier samples [see Barsky (1987)], to be

very persistent. The persistence of inflation is, however, very

sensitive to the sample period. As we get more and more

observations after the Volcker disinflation, inflation looks more
                                  -7-


mean-reverting. But even more important is how the earlier years

of the post-War period are treated. The period 1947-1952 has

dramatic swings in inflation associated with the post-World War II

and Korean War business cycles and with price controls and their

aftermath. Consequently, estimates in this paper are carried out

over the period beginning in 1953. No claim is made that the

results are robust to inclusion of the 1947-1952 period. Quite the

contrary, the results are very sensitive to inclusion of this period.

Since there are strong a priori grounds for expecting the early

period to be different from the later, including it in the sample

would not shed much light on behavior of the economy during the

bulk of the post-war period.

        Table 1 documents this sensitivity of the inflation process to

the sample period. It reports the regression results of the change

of inflation on seven of its own lags and the lagged level. The

table reports the implied largest autoregressive root of the level of

inflation and its t-statistic for the null that it is unity. Both these

statistics have Dickey-Fuller (1981) distributions. The first three

rows report results starting in 1947. These document the instability

of the inflation process in the early period. For both the 1947-
                                  -8-

1992 and 1947-1979 periods, inflation is estimated to be rapidly

mean-reverting (largest roots of 0.68 or 0.66). But the next rows

show that much of the mean-reversion over the post-war period

arises from the 1947-1952 period. This period had very

unpersistent inflation (root of 0.19). On account of this very

different behavior, together with the Korean War price controls, I

start the sample in 1953.

        In the 1953-1992 period, inflation is just on the boundary

between accepting and rejecting the unit-root hypothesis. The

largest autoregressive root is 0.84; the Dickey-Fuller t-statistic of -

2.97 is marginal at conventional significance levels. The last row

shows that even in the 1953-1992 period, there are important

changes in the persistence of unemployment. In the 1953-1979

period, the root is much closer to unity and the test-statistic is in

the region of non-rejection. Inflation looked very persistent over

this period. Since the Volcker disinflation of the 1980's, it looks

more mean-reverting. As I will argue later in this section, the

Volcker disinflation is a singular event, so it is hard to predict its

lasting consequences for the process of inflation.
                                 -9-

        In light of the sensitivity of the inflation process to

specification and sample period, many of the results of this paper

will be presented for specifications using both the level and

difference of inflation. It is already clear from Table 1 that certain

results, those concerning inflation, will be sensitive to the

specification of its process. But other results, in particular those

relating to unemployment, are not.




1.2.    Results: Effects of Policy Changes

        Let ir1 be the inflation rate and u be the unemployment

rate. The equations to estimate what happens after a Romer date

are specified as follows



         =         + A(L)-1        + A,,,,,(L)u13 + D,1.(L)R11 +
                                                                         (1)

         =         + A(L)/ir       +
                                       A(L)u11 + DU(L)R11 +        €21
                                - 10 -



where Eir is the change of the inflation rate, R is the dummy

variable that is one on a Romer date and zero otherwise, and A(L)

and D(L) are polynomials in the lag operator. The A(L)
polynomials are eighth-order and unrestricted.3 The D(L)

polynomials, which capture the impact of the Romer dates, include

lags one through sixteen and are estimated as fourth-order

polynomially-distributed lags with the far endpoint restricted to

zero.4 When estimated as unrestricted, the lag distributions are

noisier, but have basically the same dynamics.

       The coefficients f3 are constrained to be zero in the

nonstationary specification of inflation and freely estimated when

inflation is allowed to be stationary. Including the lagged level of

inflation.in the equations is equivalent to respeci!'ing the



    3The A(L) polynomial also is such that the current value ir of
the inflation rate is included in the equation for unemployment.
This is merely a normalization to make the error terms
uncorrelated. It is equivalent to using the triangularization popular
in the literature on vector autoregressions.

    4Sixteen lags is long enough so that the endpoint restriction is
not strongly binding.

equations in terms of the level of inflation. This normalization

facilitates comparison of the estimated coefficients across the

specifications of the inflation process.5



1.2.1. Univariate Estimates

        The results for the univariate estimates are presented in

Tables 2 and 3 and Figures 2a and 3a. Consider first the estimates

for unemployment (the same in both tables).6 Unemployment has

the hump-shaped dynamics that is typical of real aggregates. After

a shock to unemployment, it continues in the same direction for

several quarters before slowly reverting to trend. The Romer dates

increase unemployment gradually. Figure 2a shows the

convolution of the Romer dates and the own-lags of

unemployment. Following a Romer date, unemployment gradually



   5To make the nonstationary and stationary models have the
same degrees of freedom, when inflation is allowed to be stationary
by including the lagged level ii-, I include only seven lags in the
polynomials in

   6Recall   that here and throughout that u is the deviation of
unemployment from a linear trend.
                                - 12 -



increases to a peak level of 1.73 in the fifteenth quarter after the

shocks and then slowly reverts to trend. As subsequent figures

show, these dynamics are essentially invariant to the specification

of the inflation rate and to whether a univariate or bivariate system

is estimated. They replicate the findings presented by Romer and
Romer (1989). The tables give the F-statistic for the null

hypothesis that the all of the coefficients of the Romer dates are

zero.7 For unemployment, this hypothesis is rejected at the 0.03

level.

         The constant of the unemployment rate equation has an

interesting interpretation. Since the variable u1 is zero mean, it

would be zero but for the inclusion of the dummies for disinflation.

The estimated coefficient indicates that the Romer dates increase

the average unemployment rate by about one-tenth of one

percentage point.
         Now consider the estimates of the inflation process.




    7Because the lags of the Romer are estimated as a fourth-order
polynomial with a far endpoint constraint, the hypothesis has only
three restrictions.
                                 - 13   -



Even conditioning on the Romer dates, inflation is persistent. The

coefficient of the lagged level of inflation in Table 3 is not

significantly different from zero. Hence, inclusion of the Romer

dummies does not affect the unit-roots tests reported in Table 1.

Inflation is, however, less persistent than a random walk (see the

negative coefficients of the lagged sir). The coefficients of the

lagged Romer dates have similar patterns in Table 2 and Table 3.

Following a Romer date, inflation continues to accelerate for two

quarters and then decelerates. The joint test that the coefficients

Romer dates are all zero rejects for the nonstationary, but not for

the stationary specification.

        The dynamic response of inflation to the Romer dates is

again easiest to see in the .figures. Figure 2a gives the response for

the univariate, inflation-nonstationary model; Figure 3a gives it for

the univariate, inflation-stationary model. Both figures report the

response of the ij of inflation to a Romer date. For the
nonstationary specification in Figure 2a, inflation continues to

accelerate for several quarters. It then decelerates until it levels

off after about four years at a level five percentage points lower

than where it began. This change is economically significant. The
                                - 14 -




standard error of the inflation equation is about 2 percentage

points, so the reduction is 2-1/2 times the innovation's standard

error. But as will be shown in Section 1.2.3, the magnitude of the

change is attributable largely to the Volcker disinflation.

        The pattern for the stationary-inflation model in Figure 3a

is similar, although the magnitudes are not. The maximum

reduction in inflation is only about 3 percentage points, and, of

course, it is temporary. Moreover, recall that the coefficients of

the Romer dates are not significantly different from zero in the

estimates reported in Table 3, so the projected disinflation is not

statistically significant.



1.2.2. Multivariate estimates

        Tables 4 and 5 and Figures 2b and 3b report the results of

estimating the multivariate model where the change in inflation

and the level of unemployment are regressed on their own lags and
                                 - 15 -




lags   of the unemployment rate.8 Both nonstationary- and

stationary-inflation models are again estimated.

         Figures 2b and 3b report the total responses to a Romer

date. That is, for inflation, the changes in lagged unemployment

are taken into account and vice versa. The estimated response of

unemployment and inflation to disinflations are very similar to the

corresponding estimates for the univariate models in the (a) panels

of the figures. The similarity of the univariate and multivariate

estimates of the response of inflation and unemployment to a

disinflation disguises interesting differences that are revealed in the

estimates of the equations reported in the tables. In the

unemployment equation, the coefficients of the Romer dates do

not change much between Tables .2 and 4. Including the lagged

changes in inflation only slightly attenuates the coefficients of the

Romer dates in the unemployment equation in Table 4. They

remain statistically significant, although at the 0.06 rather than 0.03

level.


    8Also, the current change in inflation is included in the
unemployment rate regression to normalize the residuals to be
uncorrelated.
                                 - 16 -



        On the other hand, when lags of unemployment are

included in the equation for the change in inflation in Table 4, the

coefficients of the Romer dates get considerably smaller than those

in the univariate model in Table 2. Moreover, the coefficients of

the Romer dates in the inflation equation in Table 4 are jointly

statistically insignificant (p-value of the F-statistic is 0.51). Hence,

the impact on inflation of the Romer dates in the multivariate

system operates indirectly through the impact of lagged
unemployment rather than directly in the inflation equation. Since

the estimated equations are reduced form, they need to be

interpreted with caution. Yet, the absence of an independent

impact of the Romer dates on inflation does suggest that

disinflations operate through the Phillips curve rather than by

independent shifts in the inflationary regime.

        Including the lagged unemployment rates in the equation

for inflation in the stationary specification has a similar effect

(compare Tables 3 and 5). The coefficients of the Romer dates in

the inflation equation in Table 5 are substantially smaller than

those in Table 3. But they are insignificant in both the univariate
                                - 17 -



and multivariate equations, so the difference in the magnitudes of

the coefficient estimates should not be overinterpreted.



1.2.3. Disinflations Episode-by-Episode

        In the inflation-nonstationary specification, the estimates

reported in this section imply that the disinflations have, on

average, a substantial, permanent effect on the inflation rate.

These come at a cost of high unemployment for a period of years.

But as Feldstein (1979) points out, a permanent gain from lower

inflation could well outweigh the temporary output loss.

        The estimates based on the regressions for the whole

period have important limitations. Specifically, they impose that
the magnitude of the disinflation is the same across episodes.9 It

could well be that certain episodes represented much more

substantial contractions than others. In this subsection, I present

evidence that reveals what success the Fed had in reducing the rate

of inflation following each Romer date.




      am grateful to Saul Hymans and Phil Howrey for stressing
this issue to me.
                               - 18 -




       To examine the impact of the disinflations episodically, I

use the following simple, nonparametric procedure. I estimate a
univariate autoregression of the change of inflation over the entire

sample. The equation includes a constant and eight lags of iir,

but no Romer dummies. Figure 4 shows graphs of the cumulative

forecast error for the      of inflation from the quarter before

each Romer date.1° The solid lines are the forecast errors, the

dashed lines are the one-standard-deviation error bands. For

example, in Figure 4c, inflation is almost 8 percent lower in 1976:1,

eight quarters after the Romer date, than it was forecast to be in

1974:1, the quarter before the decision to disinflate.

        Figure 4 shows that, except for the October 1979 Volcker

disinflation, none of the decisions to disinflate had a permanent

impact on the level of inflation. (Figure 4d credits the August

1978 disinflation with a long-run impact, but the forecast errors do

not turn negative until after the October 1979 date.) Forecast

errors after the September 1955 (Figure 4a) episode were large



    '°Romer and Romer (1989, Figure 3) provide an analogous
figure for the unemployment rate.
                                - 19 -



and positive. After the December 1968 (Figure 4b) episode, the

errors were small--first positive and then negative. In the

disinflation following the first OPEC price increase (Figure 4c),

there were persistent and large negative forecast errors. Over the

two year horizon, there were substantial reductions in the realized

rate of inflation relative to expectation, but these begin to dissipate

in 1976. By early 1978 (note that this date is before the second

OPEC oil price increase), inflation is close to its pre-disinflation

expected value. Hence, if this episode is to be counted as a

success, there must be some offsetting failure subsequent to it.

Moreover, the failure of the OPEC I disinflation to have lasting

benefits cannot be blamed on OPEC II. Any success had

dissipated before the second oil shock.

        Figure 4d tells the story of the August 1978 disinflation. It

totally failed to affect the forecast errors. They remain positive in

the first six quarters. The subsequent reductions in inflation

occurred after the 1979 episode.

        The October 1979 episode is the outstanding success. It

heralded a sustained, large reduction in the rate of inflation. Five

years after it, the rate of inflation was 8.5 percentage points lower
                                - 20 -



than would have been forecast in the quarter before the decision to

disinflate. From Figure 4, it is clear that this data point is virtually

alone in driving the estimates of the long-run effect of the Romer

dummies on inflation presented in the previous subsections.

       Finally, Figure 4f reports the effect of the most recent

episode. After bouncing around for several years, the forecast

error does settle down below zero, but it is well within the one-

standard-deviation band.



1.2.4 Discussion
       The large estimated response of the inflation rate to the

decision to disinflate is driven by the success of the Volcker

disinflation. Following the 1955, 1968, 1978, and 1988 decisions,

forecast errors for inflation were positive or mixed. The 1974

episode was a temporary success, but inflation reasserted itself

even before the second round of OPEC price increases. Perhaps it

should not be surprising that the Volcker episode looks uniquely

successful. Figure la shows how inflation continued to rise after

each disinflation, even if there was a temporary retreat. Moreover,
                                - 21 -




had the previous episodes been successful, the conditions that

fostered the Volcker change in policy would not have been present.

       These results do not necessarily imply, however, that the

future rate of inflation is not a primary variable of concern in

motivating the Fed to disinflate. The Fed could act in the hope of

having a success along the lines that Volcker did, even if in most

cases these hopes are not realized. This issue of how the Fed

reacts to inflation is addressed in the next section.



2.     CAUSE

       This section attempts to model the decision of the Fed to

disinflate. In it I first calculate measures of the costs and benefits

of the decision to disinflate. The estimates of the previous section

are inputs into these calculations. I then estimate a discrete-choice

model of the decision to disinflate based on these measures of

costs and benefits.

       The structure of the model is as follows. Let R be the

Fed's intolerance of inflation. This is an unobserved, continuous

variable. When it exceeds a threshold (normalized to be zero), the

Fed decides it is worthwhile to subject the economy to a
                                 - 22 -



disinflation. The structure of the econometric specification

parallels that of the discrete-choice literature. The latent

intolerance to inflation is modelled as a linear function of

observables, X:




                           R = x1/3 +                                (2)



When the intolerance exceeds the threshold, the Fed decides to

change policy. That is,



                       R=    1   when R' >   0.                      (3)



In this section, I first consider the variables that determine the

decision to disinflate (Xe). Then I use those variables to estimate

the discrete-choice model.



2.1.   Variables Determining the Decision to Disinflate

       This section of the paper develops variables that are meant

to explain the Fed's decision to disinflate. The obvious candidates
                                - 23 -



are measures relating to unemployment (the cost of disinflation)

and inflation (the potential benefit). In periods of higb inflation,
the Fed should be more likely to be contemplating a disinflation.

In periods of high expected unemployment, the cost of disinflating

is higher, so the Fed is less likely to make the economy suffer from

a disinflation.

        One approach would be to make the determining variables

X simply lags of the unemployment and inflation. But such a

model would be misspecifled on several grounds. First, presumably

what the Fed is contemplating is the impact of its decision on

future economic outcomes. Hence, the variables should be forward

looking, although they should not use future information.

        Second, inflation and unemployment are inertial. The

quarter after a decision to disinflate, they will be about the same as

they were when the decision was made. If the X were based on

the current values of unemployment and inflation, equations 2 and

3 would continue to predict changes in policy even after they had

taken place. To avoid this misspecification, the variables X1 must

ratchet as a consequence of previous decision to disinflate. Again,

this can be accomplished by making them forward looking.
                                 - 24 -



Forecasts of unemployment and inflation can react instantaneously

even if the actual variables are sluggish.

        Several other considerations about the specification of X

are driven by the fact that there are only a few episodes of policy

change. The list of variables must be short. With an

unparsimonious specification and only six disinflations in the

sample, it would be very easy to overfit the model. Moreover,

again because of the small number of episodes, there is little scope

to let the data guide the choice of variables without running the

risk that all fit is spurious.

        With these considerations in mind, I use the following two

measures as determinants of Federal Reserve decisions to

disinflate. They are the expected present discounted value of the

level of inflation and the expected present discounted value of

unemployment.
        These variables capture what one hopes are the central

concerns of the Fed when it contemplates a change in aggregate

policy. They are forward looking but based on current information

and they summarize parsimoniously the current outlook conditional

on whether or not a disinflation has recently occurred. Moreover,
                                 - 25 -




they are highly correlated with other variables that might be

considered as candidates for driving the Fed's decision. In Section

2.2.2, I discuss the robustness of the posited measures to various

changes in the specification.

       These variables are calculated using the estimates

developed in Section 1 of the paper. The relevant variables are

forecast into the indefinite future for each point in the sample.

The summary measures are calculated based on these forecasts. I

then calculate their expected present discounted value using a 2

percent per quarter discount rate. The robustness of the measures

to the discount rate is also considered below.

       Note that the present value of the inflation rate might be a

key determinant of the decision to disinflate despite the limited

effect of the disinflations on inflation in most episodes. The Fed

might react to the inflation rate even if it turns out it does not, in

practice, succeed in changing it.

2.2.      Variables Determining the Decision to Disinflate

2.2.1. Estimates of the Present Discounted Value of Forecasted

          Inflation and Unemployment

          Figure 5 gives the estimated determinants of the decision to

disinflate. The estimates are based on the multivariate system

presented in Table 4•h1 They are normalized by multiplying by

one minus the discount rate so that the units are roughly at annual

rate. In this section of the paper, only estimates based on the

nonstationaly inflation model will be presented. In the next

subsection, I show that the present discounted value of forecast

inflation is not that sensitive to the stationarity versus

nonstationarity of inflation.

          Figure 5a graphs the present discounted value of the

forecasted inflation rate. Its low frequency movements track the

actual inflation rate. The variable does ratchet down after Romer

dates, but there are also fairly large changes not associated with

Romer dates. Recall that the permanent effect of a Romer date is



       11The equation for unemployment does not include the current
change in inflation when it is used in this section.
                                 -27-


only 2-1/2 times the standard deviations of the innovation variance,

so there can be expected to be large swings independent of the

Romer dates.

       The present discounted value of expected unemployment is

given in Figure Sb. It falls steadily until a Romer date is

encountered and then ratchets up once the disinflation occurs.

Unlike inflation, the Romer dates appear to be the predominate

factor in unemployment's business-cycle movements.



2.2.2. Robustness

       As noted above, there is little scope for experimentation

with the variables to be included in the model for estimating the

probability of disinflation. Yet, since there is also little theoretical

guidance as to the precise form of these variables. Therefore, one

should be concerned whether the measures of the variables driving

the Fed's decisions are robust to plausible perturbations of their

specification. In this subsection, I consider how various alternative

measures correlate with the ones used in the probit estimates.
                                 - 28 -



       A plausible alternative measure of the inflation rate would
be the long-run or asymptotic forecast of its level.'2 This measure

is very highly correlated with the one used in the present paper.

Indeed, the correlation is 0.987, so the measures are roughly

interchangeable.
        In Section 1, very different results were obtained for the

stationary versus nonstationary specifications of the inflation rate.

Two factors mitigate against there being much of a difference

between these specifications for calculating present discounted

values. First, the pattern of the change for the first four years is

about the same. Second, discounting makes the differences in the

distant years not matter much. Consequently, the correlation

between the present discounted value of expected inflation for

inflation-stationary and nonstationary is 0.986 for the discount rate

of 0.02 per quarter.'3


    12Earlier drafts of this paper used this measure.

    "This calculation should be taken with a grain of salt, however,
because of the statistical insignificance of the Romer dates in the
stationary specification of inflation. For this reason, I focus on the
inflation nonstationary model.
                                 - 29 -




         Finally, over plausible ranges of discount rates, the

expected present discounted values remain highly coherent. This

paper uses a 0.02 quarterly discount rate in calculating the

expected present discounted value of inflation and unemployment.

Compare these to those calculated with an extremely high discount

rate, say 0.10 per quarter: The correlation of the inflation measure

discounted with 0.02 versus 0.10 is 0.965; for unemployment, it is

0.964.



2.3.     Estimated Probability of Disinflation

         The model in equations 2 and 3 are estimated using a

probit specification of the disturbance. The explanatory variables

are the lagged values of the expected present discounted value of

inflation and unemployment. Model 1 uses just the inflation

variable, model 2 uses just the unemployment variable, model 3

uses both. Expected inflation has the predicted impact on the

decision to disinflate. Higher inflation raises the probability. The

coefficient is strongly statistically significant. Likewise, expected
unemployment also has the predicted impact. Lower

unemployment raises the probability of disinflation, but the
                                  - 30   -



estimate is only marginally statistically significant. Including both

variables does not alter much the magnitude of the estimated

coefficients, indicating that they have an independent impact on
the probability of a disinflation.

        The estimated probit coefficients are difficult to interpret.

Figures 6 through 8 give the implied probability of disinflation

period-by-period for the three models. Except for the first

disinflation, which this specification totally fails to predict, the

probabilities have local peaks around the Romer dates. For the

models including inflation, for just one date, the 1974 disinflation,

does the probability of a disinflation exceed one half. Hence, the

model does not do a good job of pinpointing the particular quarter

when the disinflation will take place. But the probability is high

over adjacent quarters, so the model does attribute a high

probability to a disinflation taking place in the year that they

occur.14



    14Recall that the disinflations are rare. In a sample of 180
quarters, only seven occur. Hence, the unconditional probability of
one occurring in any given quarter is less than 4 percent. The
fitted probabilities should thus be judged against this baseline, not
                                 - 31   -



        Given the low t-statistic of the unemployment variable in

the estimates, it does not do a good job of tracking the decisions.

Yet, Figure 7 illustrates the role it has in explaining disinflation.

The probability slowly increases as unemployment falls prior to a

Romer date. Since unemployment is so persistent, the variable

does little to pinpoint that particular quarter of the disinflation.

Hence, the low t-statistic. Yet, the integral of the probability over

the quarters leading up to the disinflation would indicate the

strong probability of a disinflation sometime during the period of

low unemployment.

        Consider the episodes in turn. As already has been noted,

the 1955 episode is not explained by the model. Neither was

unemployment expected to be particularly low nor was inflation

particularly high.

       The probability of disinflation grew steadily in the later

1960's until the 1969 episode. Comparing Figures 6 and 7, this




a baseline developed for cross-section studies where the number of
zeros and ones in the explanatory variable are of the same order of
magnitude.
                               - 32 -




fitted probability is mainly associated with the unemployment

variable.

       The 1974 decision is the one most sharply predicted by the

model. It combined the maximum expected inflation with fairly

low expected unemployment (see Figure 7).
        The next two best predicted decisions are the pair in the

late 1970's. Inflation is the driving factor. Indeed, once

unemployment is taken into account, the Volcker disinflation in

1979 has a lower fitted probability than when only inflation is

included in the model (compare Figures 6 and 8). Why is the most

successful disinflation not the most likely? It is precisely because

expected unemployment was fairly high in late 1979, partially as a

consequence of the failed disinflation of the previous year.

        Finally, Romer and Romer (1992) have dated a seventh

post-World War II disinflation in late 1988. The model concurs.

It begins to predict a disinflation in 1987 based on the drift

 downward in the unemployment rate beginning in the mid-1980s.
                                 - 33 -



As with the 1969 episode, low unemployment rather than high

inflation is the primary explanatory factor.15

        Figure 9 presents estimates of a model that is intentionally

misspecified. It uses estimates of the expected present discounted

value of inflation and unemployment as explanatory variables in

the probit that are based on a vector autoregression that do not

include the Romer dates as explanatory variables. These results

illustrate the importance of allowing the forcing variables to ratchet

down after a Romer date. Because inflation and unemployment

are persistent, the predictions using these forecasts tend to lag the

events. The misspecified model continues to predict disinflations

well after they have happened.

       But perhaps more importantly, the results in Figure 9

provide some evidence that the results in the previous figures are

not rigged by virtue of including the Romer date dummies as

lagged variables in constructing the explanatory variables for the


   15AS a test of the specification and to further evaluate the new
Romer date, I estimated the probit using data fit only through
1985 and then estimated the probabilities for the 1986-1992 period.
They match quite closely those reported in Figure 8.

probits. The fitted probabilities indeed do rise in the quarters

before the Romer dates with much the same pattern as in Figure 8.

An exception is the 1979 episode, which is better fit by the model

reported in Figure 9. With this model, the cost of the disinflation

is not being affected by the response of forecasted unemployment

to the 1978 episode.



3.      SUMMARY

        This paper examines the Fed's decision to disinflate. It

focusses on the role of pre-existing economic conditions in the

decisions. It finds that these decisions are driven both by the

prevailing unemployment and inflation rates. Even in periods of

high inflation, the Fed will be relatively unwilling to disinflate if the

rate of unemployment is otherwise expected to be high. Similarly,

especially for the 1969 and 1988 episode, low unemployment rather

than high inflation seems to explain the Fed's action.

        In planning this paper, I expected estimating the inflation

process to be merely a side issue. But the analysis of the inflation

process proves very interesting in itself. While on average the

"disinflations" do reduce the rate of inflation subsequently, this
                                - 35 -




average result is driven almost entirely by the 1979 episode. This

leads one to ask, what is the Fed accomplishing by putting the

economy into a recession? Perhaps, it is responding to incipient

inflation that is signalled by low unemployment. These could arise

through nonlinearities in the Phillips curve not captured in simple

specifications. Indeed, perhaps we do not see that region of the

Phillips curve because the Fed never lets unemployment get so low.

In any case, the economics profession's recent view that the Fed

has had great success in reducing the rate of inflation, albeit with a

temporary output loss, is largely colored by the achievement of the

Volcker disinflation. Over the post-World War II period, the

average disinflationary episode has done little to reduce the rate of

inflation despite clear evidence that the changes in policy do cause

unemployment to rise substantially.
