The paper formalizes and tests the hypothesis that greater exposure to big shocks induces stronger
societal responses for adaptation and protection from future big shocks. We find support for this
hypothesis in various strands of the literature and in new empirical tests using cross-country data
on deaths due to COVID-19 and deaths during World War 2. Countries with higher death rates in
the war saw lower death rates in the first wave of the COVID pandemic, though the effect faded
in the pandemic’s second wave. Our tests are robust to a wide range of model specifications and
alternative assumptions.

“Let’s be better prepared next time.” Joseph Stiglitz, December 2020

1.      Introduction

        It is hard to be confident in our responses to rare events for which we have little direct
experience. Big shocks are a case-in-point. By “big shocks” we mean unusual and highly
covariate (negative) shocks, impacting virtually every member of society. Something can be
learnt from observations of big shocks in other places, but direct experience of the shock is likely
to be far more valuable. 2 The misfortune of directly observing one’s own welfare, or that of
friends and family, in the (negatively) shocked state carries important information. This
"visceral" knowledge is not so easily transferable. Past experience with a big shock teaches
people about the gains from investing in adaptation and protection, which brings benefits if a
future big shock is realized. On the other hand, with little or no direct experience of a big shock,
the perceived benefits from such investments will be lower.
        Elements of this argument find support in research on how exposure to war and other
forms of violent conflict affects behavior, collective actions, perceptions of fairness, and
cooperation. Evidence from many countries indicates that people exposed to war violence
increase their social participation and are more likely to take actions benefiting others; see the
review of this literature in Bauer et al. (2016).
        This paper formalizes and tests the hypothesis that countries with past experiences of a
big shock tend to invest more in the institutions—including social capital as well as public health
and social protection infrastructure—needed to cope with another big shock, and thus be less
vulnerable to that shock. Our tests use data for the two biggest shocks of the last 100 years,
namely World War 2 (WW2) and the pandemic of 2020 due to the novel coronavirus.
We assess whether countries with greater exposure to WW2—as reflected in death rates—
experienced different COVID-19 outcomes in the pandemic. Our reasoning is that people in
countries with larger prior human losses from WW2 will expect higher marginal benefits from
social and political efforts that help facilitate greater willingness in the population to behave in
ways that reduce the human toll of the pandemic. Voluntary compliance with various non-
pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) depends on people’s trust in the government and each other,

 Educationalists have emphasized the importance of direct experience to knowledge, separately to formal education;
see, for example, the discussions in Boud et al. (1993).

                                                                                                                2
and the strength of the social fabric more generally. Social capital is not, however, costless to
accumulate and maintain. Success in doing so can be expected to have deep roots in a country’s
history, including its past exposure to big shocks. The direct experience of such shocks provides
important information in forming expectations about the gains from investing in adaptation and
protection from future shocks.
       In testing this theory, we focus on Europe—broadly defined to embrace the Nordic
countries, Russia and Central Asia—though we also test robustness to using an extended set of
countries with global coverage. WW2 impacted virtually every person in the European region,
but in differing degrees. It was a combination of deaths, starvation, displacements, and hardship
never before experienced at such a scale, and not since either. The emotional distress and fear for
one’s own life in WW2 came with fears about the lives of relatives and friends and the future of
the countries people live in. On the physical level, civilians suffered from hunger, cold, and lack
of basic amenities, while tens of millions faced a very real threat to their lives.
       WW2 was not, of course, the only shock prior to the 2020 pandemic, but it is the obvious
prior big shock for our test. This event was more severe than any other wars or pandemics in the
twentieth century. The count of 50-75 million people who perished in WW2 was at least twice as
high as the count in WW1, and much higher than the “Spanish Flu’s” excess deaths in 1918-19
in Europe, estimated at 2.6 million (Ansart et al. 2009). Other pandemics, such as the Asian flu
of 1957-1958 or the flu pandemic of 1968, had even smaller impacts. These later adverse shocks
did not disrupt the normal functioning of the affected societies and were mainly perceived as
episodes of a severe seasonal flu (Jackson 2009).
       And the 2020 pandemic is the obvious recent shock. The pandemic represents a profound
global health and economic crisis, affecting the lives of billions of people. There has clearly been
considerable heterogeneity in the ability of governments and institutions to cope with the
pandemic, and in often puzzling ways. For example, a number of developing countries in East
Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa appear to have done a better job in dealing with the pandemic than
have some of the rich countries of Europe and North America. It has been argued that prior
experience with epidemics has influenced the differing country responses during the 2020
pandemic; see, for example, Mobarak and Mahbub (2020). Yet, despite the exploding research
on COVID-19, there is still no consensus on the theory explaining the heterogeneity across
countries in the impact of the pandemic on health and economic outcomes.

                                                                                                      3
        The efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic have been compared to WW2 by some
world leaders. The response to this global emergency forced some countries to adopt the war-
type contingency measures of increased governmental oversight, rationing, restrictions to
personal freedoms, ramp up production, and redeployment of resources. The memories of the
past wars are part of European shared identity that, in the current crisis, awaken the idea of duty,
personal responsibilities, and call for national cohesion and personal sacrifices for the greater
good.
        We find support for the predictions of our theoretical model in the empirical relationship
between casualties during WW2 and the deaths related to COVID-19. There is a strong negative
correlation between the total human losses during WW2 and the first wave of deaths related to
COVID. Consistently with expectations based on our model, this effect of WW2 deaths faded
over time as the pandemic moved into its second wave.
        The following section outlines our hypothesis on how investments in adaptation and
protection against shocks are influenced by past experiences of big shocks. Section 3 summarizes
some relevant insights from the literature. Section 4 describes the data we have assembled for
testing the hypothesis. The results of our tests are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

2.      Foundations of the hypothesis

        Our hypothesis is that direct experience with big shocks influences the various actions
taken by the people of a country in preparing for and responding to future shocks and thus the
outcomes of those shocks. A country that experiences a big shock has a valuable insight into the
benefits of investing in adaptation and protection against future shocks. The experience of the
shock is a lesson to help assure future preparedness. A country that has not yet experienced a big
shock forms an expectation of welfare in the shocked state that is also influenced past
experience, which makes the country less inclined to invest in adaptation and protection. We
provide a simple formalization of this hypothesis before we take it to the data.
        There is a big covariate shock, 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 , that can occur in a country at any date 𝑡𝑡 = 1, 2, with
the shocked and unshocked values denoted 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 1 and 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 0, respectively. Knowing the
realization of the state of the world at the initial date 𝑡𝑡 = 1, there is a continuous costly action,
denoted 𝜏𝜏, that can be taken by the people and government of a country at 𝑡𝑡 = 1 to reduce the
welfare impact of a future shock should it occur at 𝑡𝑡 = 2. The action can be interpreted as

                                                                                                         4
investment in a set of actions to adapt and protect from shocks. There are multiple political,
economic and social dimensions to this set of actions, but for analytic convenience we collapse
them into a single dimension. The cost of investing in 𝜏𝜏 is, of course, incurred whether or not
there is a shock in 𝑡𝑡 = 2, and a benefit from 𝜏𝜏 is only realized if a big shock happens.
         Social welfare is denoted 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 ). Welfare in the unshocked state, 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 0), is known and
is decreasing and concave in 𝜏𝜏, 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 0) < 0 and 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 0) < 0 (where the 𝜏𝜏 subscripts denote
first and second partial derivatives) 3. By interpretation, if the unshocked state is realized in
period 2 then the country would have been better off ex post not investing in higher 𝜏𝜏.
         Welfare in the shocked state is a random variable with some known distribution. We take
this uncertainty to be a multiplicative (rather than additive) factor, such that the marginal gain
from extra 𝜏𝜏 in the shocked state, 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1), is also a random variable, as is the second derivative
𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1). A country’s past experience, 𝑠𝑠1 , influences the expected marginal gain, 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 ],
from investing in a higher 𝜏𝜏.
         Social welfare, if the shocked state is realized, is strictly increasing in 𝜏𝜏 at any given
realization of the uncertainty, implying that 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 ) > 0. We allow the possibility that
expected welfare in the shocked state is convex in 𝜏𝜏 (𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 ) > 0), which is interpretable
as increasing returns to higher 𝜏𝜏 in the midst of a big shock. However, we assume that expected
welfare across the potential future states is concave in 𝜏𝜏, i.e., 𝑝𝑝. 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),1)|𝑠𝑠1 ) + (1 −
𝑝𝑝). 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖), 0) < 0 for i = 0,1 where 𝑝𝑝 is the probability of a big shock in period 2, with 0 <
𝑝𝑝 < 1. As long as the probability of a big shock is low enough, this overall concavity property
will hold even when there are increasing returns to investing in adaptation and protection in the
shocked state.
         We can now formalize our hypothesis. We make two key assumptions. The first is that
the level of 𝜏𝜏 is chosen to maximize the country’s expected welfare in period 2, conditional on
whether or not a big shock was experienced in period 1. The fact that the expectation is
conditional on the past experience of shocks entails that the chosen action is also conditional on
that history, which we write as 𝜏𝜏 = 𝜏𝜏(𝑠𝑠1 ). Thus, our first main assumption is that:

                  𝜏𝜏(𝑠𝑠1 ) = arg max 𝑝𝑝. 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 ) + (1 − 𝑝𝑝). 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 0) for 𝑠𝑠1 = 0, 1              (1)
                                   (𝜏𝜏)



3
 The latter assumptions can be rationalized by imagining the special case in which u(τ,0) = u ̃(0)-c(τ) where c(τ) is
an increasing convex cost function, although we do not need this separable structure.

                                                                                                                        5
           This formalizes the intuition that the expectation about the welfare gains plays an
important role in how much a country invests in adaptation and protection given the threat of a
future big shock. Experiencing the shock in the first period clearly reveals a lot about 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 1). To
the extent that the knowledge gained is a global public good, it will not matter which countries
are shocked initially. However, it is unlikely that such knowledge only spills over borders in a
perfect way. Seeing others experiencing a big shock may be a partial substitute for the direct
experience, but the latter conveys important extra information about the gains from adaptation
and protection. Residents of the unshocked country can be taken to form their expectation about
the efficacy of action to address future big shocks based on a probability distribution that
combines the external signals about 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1) with its own observed value of 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 0). The
difference in the information sets available to people in countries that have observed a big shock
versus those that have not, yields a systematic difference in expectations about the efficacy of
actions to adapt to, or protect from future big shocks. Thus, the direct experience of a big shock
has a special salience when laying the foundations for responding to possible future shocks.
           This reasoning motivates our second assumption. On the one hand, we allow that a
country that did not experience the initial shock will come to know something about the likely
effectiveness of investing in 𝜏𝜏 held by countries that did experience a shock. On the other hand,
its lack of direct experience entails that the previously unshocked country still attaches some
positive weight (𝑟𝑟 > 0) on its own past experience. Note that we rule out the (seemingly
unlikely) case in which the country’s own history of direct experience with shocks has no
bearing on the matter (𝑟𝑟 = 0). We can write this second assumption as:

                    𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 = 0 ) = 𝑟𝑟. 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),0) + (1 − 𝑟𝑟). 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 1)|𝑠𝑠1 = 1 )       (2)

Given that 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),0) < 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(1),1), it follows that 𝐸𝐸𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(1),1) > 𝐸𝐸𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),0).
           We can now derive the key implications for our empirical investigation. The first-order
conditions for optimal 𝜏𝜏(𝑠𝑠1 ) are that: 4

                    𝑝𝑝. 𝐸𝐸(𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),1)|𝑠𝑠1 = 𝑖𝑖) + (1 − 𝑝𝑝). 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖), 0) = 0 for i = 0,1              (3)




4
    The second-order conditions are satisfied given that expected welfare across shock prospects is concave in 𝜏𝜏.

                                                                                                                     6
Given that 𝑟𝑟 > 0, two solutions for 𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖), one for each of i = 0,1, emerge. Taking the difference
between the realizations of (3) for each of 𝑖𝑖 = 0 and 𝑖𝑖 = 1 we have:

         𝑝𝑝. 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(1),1) − 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),1)] + (1 − 𝑝𝑝). [𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(1),0) − 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),0)] = 0            (4)

Under our second assumption, the first term is positive, so the second term must be negative,
𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(1),0) < 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(0),0), implying that 𝜏𝜏(1) > 𝜏𝜏(0) given that welfare in the unshocked state is
concave in 𝜏𝜏.
         Thus, we predict that countries that experience a big shock will allocate more resources
to adaptation and protection in response to the possibility of a future big shock.
         Three further implications can be noted. First, the investment in adaptation and protection
will also depend on the probability of shocks occurring. (Note that 𝜏𝜏(𝑠𝑠1 ) is also, in general, an
implicit function of 𝑝𝑝.) More precisely, on differentiating (3):
                  𝜕𝜕𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖)              𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),0)−𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),1)
                             =                                                    > 0 for 𝑖𝑖 = 0,1            (5)
                   𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕          𝑝𝑝𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),1)+(1−𝑝𝑝))𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏(𝑖𝑖),0)


The more likely the future shock, the more the country invests in protection from that shock.
         Second, among countries that experience the shock in the second period, those that were
shocked in the first period will be better off ex post, in the sense that 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏(1),1) > 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏(0),1).
(This follows from the fact that 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 1) is increasing in 𝜏𝜏.)
         Third, imagine a series of big shocks. The policy response to the threat of a future shock
characterized by the above model can be interpreted as generating a negative serial dependence
in the impacts of a series of big shocks. Assuming that this times-series process is stationary, one
would expect the effect of experiencing the shock in the first period to fade over time. 5 Countries
that did not adapt and protect in anticipation of the period 2 shock—because they did not have a
direct experience of a big shock in period 1—learn from experiencing a big shock in period 2
and adjust accordingly, in anticipation of a shock in period 3 (or an extended exposure to the
period 2 shock, as in our empirical application later). In terms of our model, one can think of this
as a reduction in the weight 𝑟𝑟 attached to the initial (unshocked) marginal benefit of higher 𝜏𝜏
(equation 3). By the same token, success in avoiding the worst impacts of the shock in period 2
will lower the expected marginal gains from continuing to protect and adapt given the prospect


5
  Our other assumptions so far cannot rule out a non-stationary process, implying that successive big shocks have
larger and larger welfare effects, alternating positively and negatively. That can be considered an empirical question.

                                                                                                                     7
of a shock in period 3. Intuitively, the country will become complacent, leading to greater
impacts of a period 3 shock.
       The following sections point to evidence consistent with these predictions, drawing first
on the literature and then by studying new empirical evidence across countries.

3.     Insights from the literature

       Here we review evidence from two different literatures that can be interpreted as offering
partial support for the hypothesis formalized above, though they are not conclusive. The first is
literature indicating that residents of a place exposed to war violence tend to be more cooperative
and altruistic after the war. The effect also persists over time, regardless of whether the war was
experienced by a person herself or by family members or friends; the impact of exposure seems
even to increase over time. Societies exposed to wars often were able to return to pre-war levels
of institutional qualities and to a high level of trust in a relatively short time. Grosjean (2014)
uses survey data from 35 countries in Europe and Central Asia to investigate the effects of
exposure to WW2 and more recent conflicts among respondents’ parents and grandparents. Her
results show a positive correlation between past war experiences and contemporary participation
in collective actions and community groups. At the same time, war seems to diminish trust in
politics. A study based on a representative sample of adults from 14 European countries
demonstrates that early-life exposure to WW2 increases individual resilience and optimism about
life, leading to a higher probability of survival (Arpino et al. 2019). Bellucci et al. (2020) use the
European Survey on Health, Ageing, and Retirement to show that war-exposed individuals have
higher resilience to shocks and increased perception of uncertainty and uncontrollability of the
environment. Cassar et al. (2013) explore the effects of war-related violence on trust and
cooperation in Tajikistan and found that exposure to war enhanced prosocial behavior. A study
of the effect of violence during Nepal’s civil war found that violence-affected communities had
higher levels of prosocial motivation and public good cooperation (Gilligan et al. 2013).
Similarly, civic participation increases in the districts of Uganda, where battle events took place
(De Luca and Verpoorten 2015). Bellows and Miguel (2009) show that households in Sierra
Leone that experience war violence are more likely to join political and community groups and
more likely to vote. Bauer et al. (2020) review multiple studies pointing in the same direction:
that social cooperation is enhanced by past exposure to war violence.

                                                                                                      8
         The second set of studies pertains to the role of social capital and trust for compliance
with the recommendations for NPIs during the 2020 pandemic. 6 Data on real-time mobile phone
locations in Italy demonstrate a higher decline in personal mobility in areas with higher social
capital (Durante et al., 2020). Similar results are found by Barrios et al. (2020) for a sample of
counties in the US and European countries. In a sample of 84 countries, Elgar et al. (2020) find
that trust in government fosters lower COVID-19 mortality, though they also find that
(controlling for trust in government) stronger social bonds in a country may facilitate the spread
of infection. Based on survey data from China, Wu (2020) finds evidence that, in determining
responses to the pandemic, trust in government is a more important aspect of social capital than
trust in other individuals. Bargain and Aminjonov (2020) found that regions with higher trust
experienced larger reductions in non-essential mobility following the implementation of
containment policies in March 2020. Bartscher et al. (2020) provide evidence from seven
European countries that culture and social capital have a considerable impact on the containment
of COVID-19 and the number of deaths. Similarly, the study by Olsen and Hjorth (2020) of
individual willingness to engage in social distancing in Denmark shows that individuals with
high social and political trust are more likely to comply with social distancing measures. The
overarching message from these studies is that voluntary compliance with NPIs depends on the
local and individual levels of social and political capital. However, we do not know to what
extent the identified behavioral and institutional covariates of NPI can be linked to past
experience with big shocks.
         Both these links are evident in the (widely reported) success of Vietnam in containing the
spread of COVID-19, with fewer deaths per capita than most other countries, despite being a
relatively poor country. The proximate causes of Vietnam’s success against COVID-19 are well
known, namely the mass public health response, led by the government, but embracing an
extensive community-based effort of testing, tracing, and quarantining. What is less widely
appreciated is that there are deeper causative factors at work, embedded in the county’s history
of resistance and war, which helped create the foundation of social solidarity and collective
action that underpinned the COVID response (Nguyen 2020). And the government regularly
reminded its citizens of the war experience in mustering the COVID effort.

       Yet, a further observation of relevance is found in the calls heard during the 2020
pandemic for investing more in the institutions of social organization and scientifically-grounded
policy making that can help protect from future shocks, recognizing that this is not the last
pandemic or other crisis to be faced. The quote from Stiglitz (2020) at the outset of this paper—
explicitly in the context of his observations on the economic and health impacts of the pandemic
in America in 2020—is an example. It can hardly be surprising that these calls have been heard
more in countries such as the U.S. that were hit so hard by COVID-19, clearly reflecting
institutional and governmental failures. Of course, we do not know yet if the lessons will be
carried to practice, and political and social frictions in the learning process can be expected. But
the pressure for anticipatory action is clearly motivated in no small measure by the direct
experience of very high COVID mortality in the U.S. in 2020.

4.     Evidence on World War 2 and the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe

       We test for an effect of exposure to WW2, as measured by the country’s death rate, on
outcomes under the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the potential impact of WW2
experience, we take it that mortality from COVID-19 depends on a country’s demographic
composition, total population, population density, the average level of education in the country,
and the measures of government effectiveness or democracy (Bosancianu et al., 2020). In terms
of our model in Section 2, these variables can be thought of as determinants of the probability of
a big shock occurring.
       We use multiple data sources. Data on COVID-19 come from the European Center for
Disease Prevention and Control (2020). We use COVID-19 related-deaths-per-million of the
population as our main dependent variable. Data on war military casualties is derived from
UCDP/PRIO Battle Death Data (Bethany et al. 2006) and Wikipedia; civilian casualties are
based on multiple sources of mostly country-specific data (Wikipedia 2020). Civilian casualties
in the post-Soviet countries come from Erlikman (2004). We use death as a proportion of the
population as our control variable. The total deaths as a proportion of the population come
directly from the Wikipedia dataset. Military deaths as a proportion of the population are
calculated as a ratio of military (battle) deaths and the population of that country in 1939. Both
total and military deaths for several countries that did not exist during WW2 are imputed based



                                                                                                     10
on the corresponding losses of the “parent” countries. 7 The list of countries with WW2 casualties
and COVID-19 statistics are shown in Table 1.
        Recall from Section 2 that our hypothesis about the response to past big shocks is
conditional on the probability of such shocks occurring (𝑝𝑝), which one would expect to differ
systematically across countries. There may also be differences in the welfare function 𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏, 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 ) at
given values of 𝜏𝜏 and 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 . For example, richer countries will presumably be better positioned to
protect their citizens through the health care system. We will test the predictions of our model
controlling for GDP per capita (in constant 2011 PPP $) drawing on the World Development
Indicators (World Bank 2020). We will also allow for differences in voice and accountability,
using data from the World Governance Indicators (WGI) database produced by the World Bank
(Kaufmann et al. 2010). The indicator ranges from -2.5 (i.e., the lowest level of voice and
accountability) to 2.5 (the highest level of voice and accountability). Data on population density
and the median age of the population come from the DELVE COVID-19 database (Bhoopchand
et al., 2020). We also control whether a country belonged to the axis of powers during WW2, 8
and if the country was a member of the communist bloc. 9 The descriptive statistics for our main
variables and a summary of data sources are shown in Table 2.
        Figure 1 provides a scatterplot of COVID deaths per million people on the total losses in
WW2 as a proportion of the pre-war population. Consistent with our hypothesis, we see that
countries with higher death rates during WW2 tended to have lower COVID-19 mortality rates.
Next, we see if this is robust to adding controls relevant to the probability of experiencing a big
shock, and whether the finding is robust to various changes in the specifications for our test.

5.      Controls and tests for robustness

        Adding controls for other variables likely to influence COVID-19 mortality, we still find
that it is negatively correlated with total losses during WW2. 10 Our most parsimonious


7
  For example, losses for Balkan countries are imputed based on the losses of Yugoslavia.
8
  The “Axis powers” formally took the name after the Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan on 27
September 1940, in Berlin. The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria (Hill 2003).
9
  The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991
under the leadership of the Soviet Union that comprised, among other countries, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union (Kaser 1967).
10
   While a nonlinear relationship is suggested by Figure 1, we chose a more parsimonious linear regression. We did
two tests on functional form. First, we included the squared value of WW2 mortality, but its coefficient was not


                                                                                                               11
specification is in Table 3, which includes five controls. The specification in column (1) uses
total WW2 deaths per capita. At mean points, the elasticity of COVID deaths to WW2 deaths is
about -0.4. We also see that countries with higher GDP per capita have lower death rates from
COVID-19. On the other hand, countries with older and larger populations, and countries with a
higher share of educated people have significantly higher deaths per million from COVID-19.
         Our variable for WW2 deaths includes both civilian and military losses. Some countries
in our sample that suffered military losses (e.g., UK or Italy) had limited military activities on
their territories. Thus, the population of these countries was, to a degree, isolated from the direct
and most severe impact of the war. Mechanically, we can infer non-military deaths by
subtracting recorded military deaths from the total. However, it should be noted that these two
series come from different sources, and measurement errors may increase as a result of this
calculation. While acknowledging this concern, the results in column (2) of Table 3 separate
military deaths from non-military. This suggests that it is non-military losses that account for the
correlation with COVID-19 deaths. Nonetheless, given the measurement concerns, we will focus
on total deaths in our robustness tests.
         Table 4 provides the coefficients on WW2 deaths for various changes in specifications.
Column (1) in Table 4 shows the extended specification of the regression in column (1) of Table
3. Column (2) in Table 4 shows the same specification as column (1) but with controls for
communist regimes and the axis of power. The specification in row (1) adds dummy variables of
whether the communist party was dominant in a country before 1991 and whether a country
belonged to the axis powers. None of these extra variables had a significant effect on COVID-19
death rates, and the coefficient on WW2 deaths changes little. 11 A systematic COVID-19 death
underreporting could alter our results. Such underreporting might be especially pronounced in
several countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Belarus, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
(Turkmenistan reports no deaths from COVID-19 and thus is not included in our sample.) To test
the sensitivity of our results to such underreporting, we triple the officially reported rates for



significantly different from zero. Second, we tested a specification with the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
of deaths per million as a dependent variable, with the same transformation applied to WW2 deaths. This gave
qualitatively similar results.
11
   Estimations of the cumulative COVID-19 infection rates on the same set of covariates produce no significant
results. We also estimated specifications with other governance indicators from WGI dataset: Political Stability and
Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption.
None of these variables show significant coefficients in estimations. These results are available from the authors.

                                                                                                                  12
these countries. The results of that simulation are shown in Table 4 and are consistent with our
main specification.
         Another concern could be related to the endogeneity of losses during WW2 to the death
toll of COVID-19. One could argue that the most altruistic and socially and politically active
people would be more likely to die during the war. A society with high levels of social capital
might suffer disproportional losses. Then the argument that the exposure to war violence
increases social capital, which, in turn, helps to reduce COVID-19 mortality is reversed. The fact
that WW2 ended 75 years before the 2020 pandemic clearly reduces the concerns for such non-
random selection. Nevertheless, to partially address this potential bias, we estimate our model on
a sample of countries that were attacked by removing countries representing the axis powers. 12
The results of this estimation are shown in row (3) of Table 4. The coefficient on the losses
during WW2 is still significant and inversely related to the deaths from COVID-19, although the
power of its significance declines.
         We use the DFBETA influence statistics (Bollen and Jackman 1990) to identify the
influential outliers in our regression. The method measures the difference, scaled by the
estimated standard error of the coefficient, between the regression coefficient when the ith
observation (country) is included and excluded. 13 Figure 2 provides the scatter plot of the values
of DFBETA statistics. Based on these results, Belarus (BRL) and Armenia (ARM) have a strong
influence on the result of our estimations. The estimates of our main specification, excluding
these countries from the sample, are shown in row (4) of Table 4.
         We also conducted a falsification test to see if our results might be driven by
unobservable confounding factors. The idea behind the falsification test is to demonstrate that the
effect does not exist in the context where we expect no effect (see, for example, Rothstein 2010).
We use the deaths from cardiovascular diseases, which predominantly affect the elderly
population, as a placebo outcome. We assume that cardiovascular deaths are not affected by the
levels of social capital and trust in society. Another measure of placebo outcome is deaths from
influenza and pneumonia during the season of 2017/2018. These diseases are similar to COVID-


12
   An emerging literature that studies heroic actions and altruism during the war finds that the majority of heroic acts
happened when the combatants defended their land (vs. being on the attack), e.g., Franco et al (2011). A possible
explanation of this phenomenon could be that it is based on the evolutionary mechanism of protecting of close kin
(Rusch and Stormer 2015).
13
   Our criterion for selecting observations is that: |𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 | > 2/√𝑁𝑁, where N is the sample size.

                                                                                                                     13
19 in terms of contagion risks, but no social distancing and NPI were implemented to stop the
infection despite the fact it killed more than 650,000 people worldwide in 2018 (Paget et al.
2019). We assume that influenza and pneumonia deaths are not associated with social capital and
levels of trust in society that are required to internalize the negative externalities of the
lockdowns. Thus, at least through these channels, the losses during WW2 should have no
influence on contemporary deaths from cardiovascular or influenza and pneumonia diseases.
This is confirmed in Table 4, which gives the coefficients on WW2 losses in rows (5) and (6);
the coefficients are smaller in magnitude and not significantly different from zero.
        Our regressions in Table 3 are based on total deaths per million registered on August 31,
2020. Rows (7) and (8) in Table 4 show that our main results are qualitatively stable when we
use mortality rates on June 30 and July 31, 2020 as dependent variables.
        While the main theater of WW2 was in Europe, many non-European countries
participated in the battles in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region. In the last row of Table 4, we
give the results when we extend our sample to include 28 more countries that participated in
WW2. 14 The results of the estimations on this larger sample of 76 countries are consistent with
the results based on our sample of European countries. The total war losses are negatively and
significantly correlated with the cumulative deaths from COVID-19, although the magnitudes of
these correlations are lower compared to those found for the European sample. This could
probably be explained by attenuation bias due to noisier data on war casualties in countries that
participated in WW2 through other countries. 15

6.      The second wave of COVID-19

        As noted in Section 2, a further implication of our theoretical argument is that a third
shock should see greater effort at addressing the shock, similarly to our argument about the effect
of a first shock. The second wave of COVID-19 provides a test of this prediction.
        Table 5 gives the regressions corresponding to Table 3 but this time for cumulative
COVID deaths in the second wave, defined as the number of new COVID-19 related deaths that


14
   The added countries comprises are Australia, Burundi, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, India,
Iran, Japan, Cambodia South Korea, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Mongolia, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand,
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Singapore, Thailand, United States of America, Vietnam, South Africa.
15
   For example, during WW2, Royal Nepalese Army fought on the Burmese front, and, at the same time, Nepalese
soldiers fought as a part of British army (Cross and Gurung 2002).

                                                                                                                 14
occurred between August 1 and December 1, 2020. We see an attenuated effect (compared to
Table 3) that is no longer significantly different from zero. Note that some deaths in the second
wave arise from infections in the first wave. This is likely to bias upwards (in absolute value) our
estimate of the effects of WW2 deaths on COVID deaths in the second period. Correcting for
this bias would thus further reinforce our conclusion that the effect of WW2 deaths has faded
over time, as the pandemic continued.
       In Figure 3 we provide more detail. The lower solid line plots coefficients on the total
losses during WW2 for cumulative COVID deaths at each month from February to September.
The upper solid line shows the coefficients for the cumulative death counts starting August 1.
The cumulative deaths for the upper line are calculated as cumulative deaths in month t less
cumulative deaths on August 1. The dashed lower line shows the coefficients if we continue the
first time series to December 1. So, we see clearly how the effect of WW2 deaths fades as the
second wave proceeds.
       To help verify this argument, it is of interest to see the effect of WW2 deaths on wave 2
COVID mortality when we control for wave 1 mortality, as given in Table 6. This picks up the
underlying positive serial dependence in COVID mortality arising from the epidemiology. Of
course, wave 1 mortality is likely to be endogenous in the regressions in Table 6, as there are
undoubtedly latent factors influencing COVID deaths in both waves. Nonetheless, we can at
least confirm that the partial correlation between WW2 deaths and wave 2 COVID deaths is
attenuated when this control is added (comparing Tables 2,5, and 6).
       This pattern in the data is consistent with our overall argument, but there is another
insight. Figure 4 provides the transitions in COVID death rates between waves 1 and 2, plotted
against WW2 death rates (similarly to Figure 1). We see the expected decline in COVID death
rates in wave 2 among countries that had low WW2 death rates. At the same time, we see a rise
in death rates among the countries hit harder by WW2. In terms of our model in Section 2, this is
consistent with the idea that countries that were well prepared for the onset of the period 2 shock
(having experienced the period 1 shock) have a tendency to become complacent and not be as
well protected as the period 2 shock continues.




                                                                                                    15
7.     Conclusions

       We have proposed and tested the hypothesis that past experiences of big shocks influence
the success of a society in coping with future big shocks. The mechanism we suggest is that
direct experiences of a shock have a strong influence on societal expectations about the gains
from investing in adaptation and protection, recognizing that this requires social and political
efforts in creating and maintaining social capital.
       We have found support for the hypothesis in various strands of the literatures related to
both wars and pandemics, including that of 2020. We have also found support in new empirical
findings indicating that COVID-19-related mortality is inversely correlated with the losses
countries experienced during World War 2. Consistently with our argument, this effect fades
over time as people learn. Our results are robust to adding controls for other factors influencing
COVID mortality and to different model specifications and assumptions.
