 SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE DETERMINANTS OF FULL AND PARTIAL RETIREMENT:
                      A COMPETING RISKS ANALYSIS


                                     ABSTRACT

Empirical analyses of retirement typically assume a single form of retirement. In
this paper, I consider the determinants of retirement in a competing risks model
which allows for full and partial retirement. Simulation results indicate that the
large increase in Social Security benefits in the early 1970s has had moderate
effects upon retirement, increasing the probability of early full retirement (before
age 65) by less than ,5 percent and reducing the probability of partial retirement
by 1-2 percent.
