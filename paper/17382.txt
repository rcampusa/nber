                                              ABSTRACT

The US Civil War provides researchers a unique opportunity to identify wartime leaders and thus to
test theories of leadership. By observing both leaders and followers during the war and forty years
after it, I establish that the most able became wartime leaders, that leading by example from the front
was an effective strategy in reducing desertion rates, and that leaders later migrated to the larger cities
because this is where their superior skills would have had the highest pay-offs. I find that US cities
were magnets for the most able and provided training opportunities for both leaders and followers:
men might start in a low social status occupation in a city but then move to a higher status occupation.

         They were the leaders of men, these great ones ...

         Carlyle (1840: 3)


       A favorite quotation of the many web sites devoted to leadership is, “Real leaders are ordinary

men with extraodinary determination.” 1 Prior generations celebrated both the superior cognitive

and non-cognitive skills of leaders. Carlyle (1840: 3) wrote of “Great Men.” Galton (1869: 141),

in discussing military leaders, wrote of men “excelling in many particulars,” including energy,

political capacity, charisma, intellect, and will. A heirarchical organization such as the military

or a firm should assign the “real leaders” to the highest ranking positions so that their reach is

stretched over a larger reach of the organization’s activities (Rosen 1992). But, as Galton (1869:

143) recognized, the incentives may not always be there. In times of peace or during short wars,

political patronage may determine military positions. A firm with monopoly power may dissipate

its rents on poor managers. The difficulty facing researchers on leadership is that it is hard to

identify the real leaders – non-cognitive skills are hard to measure and an observed leader may not

necessarily have achieved his position through superior skills.

       This paper uses data on Union Army soldiers to test theories of leadership. It examines the

characteristics of men who were promoted to leadership positions and looks at what made leaders

effective. It examines whether, after the war, leaders are found in the larger cities where their su-

perior decision making skills would have had the highest pay-off. I can thus establish that in the

American past cities were magnets for the skilled as they are today (Gould 2007). Because the

US Civil War was a prolonged war with civilians (largely self-taught) filling the ranks of commis-

sioned and non-commissioned officers, it provides a unique opportunity to identify the real leaders.

Because all records are in the public domain (unlike WWII records) and because I follow men for

40 years, I can determine whether wartime leaders became civilian leaders and where they move

after the war.

   A vast literature examines the traits of who becomes a leader, describes leadership styles, ana-

lyzes what makes leaders effective, and models the matching of leaders and organizations. Traits

that distinguish leaders from others include physical energy, intelligence (including social intelli-

gence) greater than that of the average follower, motivation, self-confidence, and flexibility (House

and Aditya 1997). Although an emphasis on personality characteristics suggests that leadership

is innate, if leaders are judges, experts, and co-ordinators (Hermalin 2007) or simply people who

make right decisions more often (Lazear 2010), leadership can be learned.

   Game theoretic models of leader effectiveness have emphasized that one way to elicit effort

from followers is to lead by example (Hermalin 2007). The density and range of Civil War fireams

made exposure suicidal and the leadership skills of great generals evolved with the technology, no

longer centering on leading charges or needless exposure to the line of fire (Keegan 1987: 164-

234). Nonetheless, Civil War scholars have emphasized the importance of both non-commissioned

and commissioned officers such as colonels or captains motivating troops by showing courage

under flying bullets (McPherson 2007: 145-54 ; Linderman 1987: 44-45). Scholars have pointed

out that US officers’ not sharing the danger in WWII became a cause for resentment (Linderman

1999: 197) and may have reduced the US Army’s tactical proficiency relative to the Wehrmacht

(Muth 2011).

   Models of sorting explain the observed characteristics of leaders and their organizations. In

Lucas’s (1978) model, the largest firms have the best managers because as capital increases wages

rise relative to marginal managerial returns thus inducing marginal managers to become employ-

ees. Rosen (1982) showed that the more talented will sort to top positions in larger firms where

their greater talent filters through the entire firm through the recursive chain of command. Lazear

(2010) emphasizes not firm size but that the better leaders will sort to the highest variance indus-

tries because this is where decision making has the highest payoff. After the US Civil War, decision

making should have had the highest payoff in the larger cities which offered greater diversity in


                                                 2
manufacturing industries (the dominant economic activity) and higher wages (Kim 2006).



1 Officers in the Civil War

Regiments, the basic unit of the Civil War Armies, were formed locally. The volunteer infantry

regiments consisted of ten companies, each containing roughly 100 men, commanded by a cap-

tain and two lieutenants. Each company had four sergeants, one of whom served as company first

sergeant, a sergeant major, a quartermaster sergeant, a commisary sergeant, four corporals, a hos-

pital steward, two musicians, and one wagoneer. The commissioned officers were often volunteer

officers drawn from state militias, men of political significance, or other prominent men in the

community. Sometimes the enlisted men elected their own officers. Generally, state governors

appointed the state governor and the commissioned officers selected the non-commissioned offi-

cers. After the first major battles, state governors began to commission officers from the ranks of

noncommissioned officers who had proved themselves in the field and in battle (Fisher, Jr. 1994:

109). Among Ohio companies, the major predictors of promotion to non-commissioned officer

were a non-farm and non-laborer occupation and literacy (Lee 1999).

   Commissioned and non-commissioned officers performed all five of the leadership activities

defined by Hermalin (2007): they served as judges, experts, co-ordinators, symbols, and shapers of

preferences. Officers had to judge men for absences without leave, crimes, and desertion; they had

to become experts in military tactics (both commissioned and non-commissioned officers would

take lessons nightly studying from various training manuals); they had to ensure that their men

had adequate supplies, they had to file reports, and in the field they had to maintain unit direction

and cadence and see to it that the men fired upon order; the regimental color bearer (a sergeant)

was the rallying point for the men in the regiment (and the regimental flag enabled regimental and

division officers to see where a regiment was in a battle); and, the colonel was supposed to have



                                                 3
“a personal acquaintance with every officer and man” (Sherman 1891: 385). Officer positions

required not just technical skills but also people skills. Samuel Pryce whose longest war service

was as the regimental adjunct wrote, “The details made by the sergeant major, the distribution

of clothing by the Q-M sergeant, and the dispensation of food by the commissary sergeant were

positions requiring the highest skill and tact, to avoid complaints” (Pryce 2008: 32).

   Officers could not expect to enforce their will on their men. Men who elected their own officers

could just as easily dismiss them. Officers who commanded contempt because of their cowardice

or disregard for the welfare of their men resigned their commissions, driven out by their men’s ill

will. When John Beatty, lieutenant colonel of the Third Ohio, began to court martial men who left

camp without leave, he faced “not only the hatred and curses of the soldiers tried and punished

but in some instances the ill will of their fathers, who for years were my neighbors and friends.”

He only aggravated insubordination as men extended their absences, refused to drill, and signed

petitions demanding his resignation (Linderman 1987: 41). He later gained the regiment’s respect

when at Perryville he ordered his men to the ground while he remained standing under “shot, shell,

and canister ... thick as hail” (Linderman 1987: 44-45).

   Officers were paid more than enlisted men and lived in different quarters in the same camp

(Smith 2003). At the start of the war infantry privates and corporals were paid $13 a month,

sergeants $17, first sergeants $20, and lieutenants and captains over $100 (Boatner 1991: 624).

Privates in an army camp were grouped by company. There were separate rows for the non-

comissioned officers, commissioned officers of the companies, and the staff and commander of the

regiment, who were located in front of the baggage train. Officers used their own funds to purchase

food and ate at separate messes from the men. The latrines for officers were behind the baggage

train whereas those for enlisted men were at the opposite end of the camp. Smith (2003) finds

disease death rates of 65.4 per 1000 for enlisted men in New York Regiments compared to 23 per

thousand for their commissioned officers. Lee (1999) finds that in a sample of Ohio companies


                                                 4
four percent of non-commissioned officers died of disease compared to 9 percent of privates.



2 Economic Framework

The military is an internal labor market with few ports of entry and with promotion largely from

within (Rosen 1992). In a strongly heirarchical organization with a chain of command structure, it

is efficient to assign the most able individuals to the highest ranking and most influential positions

in the organization because their reach is stretched over a larger portion of the organization’s activ-

ities. Selection of personnel to the highest ranks is thus more important than selection to the lower

ranks. Because talent is revealed only slowly and because advancement depends on the number

of available positions, the promotion mechanism is an elimination tournament. The reward for

any given rank is the weighted sum of rewards attained at all ranks higher than the current rank,

with weights depending on the conditional probability of surviving to compete at those higher

levels. Because competition is tougher at each step, the earnings structure has to give more than

proportionally greater awards to those who achieve higher rank.

   Both commissioned and non-commissioned officers should have been more skilled than pri-

vates prior to joining the army and the more skilled should achieve higher ranks. Promotion

should depend on the demand for officers which will in turn depend on how much action the

regiment saw. Both officers and non-commissioned officers should have more privileges than en-

listed men. Because these privileges meant different food and separate quarters and because of the

strong relationship between sanitation and disease in the nineteenth century, officers should face a

lower probability of death from disease. Unless monetary compensation was very high they should

also face a lower overall risk of death.

   Officers might lead by example to signal to their followers that victory is achievable or that

the risk of death is not high. Hermalin (2007) shows that in a game theoretic model in which the



                                                  5
leader’s actions reveal the true state of nature to the follower, the harder the leader works the harder

the followers work. If the leader’s actions do not fully reveal the state and their payoff depends on

the efforts of other team members, followers will mimic the leader whereas they would not if they

knew the true state (Komai et al. 2007). With perfect mimicry, the battlefield mortality of officers

and privates will be similar, though going first will increase mortality. The non-commissioned

officers who were regimental flag-bearers should have a higher mortality rate than privates because

they were good targets. Officers’ battlefield mortality could be lower or higher than that of enlisted

men if, on average, men do not follow or officers do not lead by example.

       Leading by example can be efficient (see the review by Hermalin 2007). If it is an effective

strategy then desertion rates (which averaged ten percent for the Union Army) should be lower for

companies where a higher fraction of officers relative to enlisted men were killed controlling for

the death rate.

       How successfully military training can be transferred to the civilian sector remains an open

question. Military training could develop skills such as discipline or leadership. It could also have

provided familiarity with logistics. Descriptions of the strengths of Grant’s leadership and of the

management of the modern firm are similar.2 Although military service on average has a negative

causal effect on earnings (Angrist 1990), Benmelech and Frydman (2009) find that military service

has a causal effect on managerial decisions and firm outcomes. Even if military training has no

effect on later outcomes, if military leaders are the most able they will become the civilian leaders.

       The most able (those who become officers) should sort to where their abilities have the greatest

pay-offs. Thus they will be in larger cities, which may have fostered the division of labor, and

in higher status occupations after the war. Lee (2006) finds that former non-commissioned and
   2
     Grant used the telegraph “to collect intelligence, summon reinforcements, rapidly redispose [their] forces, and
co-ordinate the movement of widely separated formations.” “He valued objective information highly and collected
it from many sources ... Rivers and railroads were the means by which Grant brought his armies to the battlefield,
spies, scouts and telegraph the media through which he informed himself of the enemy’s own movements” (Keegan
1987:210-221). Grant was not able to transfer his skills to the private sector and was a notoriously bad business man.




                                                          6
commissioned officers were more likely to move upward in status to a white collar occupation by

1880 than privates, but did not look at where men migrated. Moving to a large city may have

opened up opportunities even for men who had to start in lower status occupations. If the more

able leaders are also generalists (Lazear 2010), then the officers who had different types of duties

during the war will be more likely to be in larger cities than those who had only type of duty.



3 Econometric Framework

I examine whether officers were more able by looking at the predictors of time in months from

muster until first promotion to commissioned officer, sergeant, and corporal. That is, I estimate a

Weibull hazard model of the form


                                    h(t) = h0 (t) exp(βx (X)                                      (1)


where h0 (t) is the baseline hazard and X is a vector of characteristics including height, personal

property ownership in 1860, literacy in 1860, marital status in 1860, nativity, occupation at enlist-

ment (professional or proprietor, artisan, laborer, and unknown, with farmer as the omitted cate-

gory), dummies for enlistment year, age at muster, volunteer status, the logarithm of population in

city of enlistment, and whether the regiment was in the past under fire, a measure of promotion

possibilities.

    I investigate the survivorship privileges of being an officer by running Weibull hazard models

of months until death from muster


     h(t) = h0 (t) exp(βc (Corporal) + βs (Sergeant) + βo (Commissioned Officer) + βx X) (2)

     h(t) = h0 (t) exp(βso (Sergeant or Commissioned Officer) + βx X)                             (3)




                                                 7
where h0 (t) is the baseline hazard and control variables include height, personal property owner-

ship in 1860, literacy in 1860, marital status in 1860, nativity, occupation at enlistment (profes-

sional or proprietor, artisan, laborer, and unknown, with farmer as the omitted category), dummies

for enlistment year, age at muster, volunteer status, and the logarithm of population in city of en-

listment. Men who desert, become POWs, or are discharged are treated as censored. I examine

both time until death from all causes and time until death from disease and wounds. My regres-

sions for wounds also control for whether or not an officer position was a front-line position (e.g.

a quarter-master was not).

   If the men who become officers are also the healthier men or the men more knowledgeable

in disease prevention, I may overestimate the beneficial effect of being an officer on the risk of

death from disease. I may understate if these men had fewer immunities because they were from

healthier areas. If the men who become officers are the most gung-ho, I will overestimate the

negative effects of being an officer on risk of death in battle. I will understate if men who became

officers were seeking safety. Unfortunately I cannot statistically correct for endogeneity because

predictors of promotion to officer such total casualties also determine death, including death from

disease. Birth year dummies (those born later did not serve a full three year term and thus did not

have as many chances to become officers) were weak instruments.

   I estimate the effectiveness of leading from the front by estimating OLS regressions of the form


                                                  No of officers killed+.01
              Company Desertion Rate = βr (                                 )+
                                                   No of men killed +.01
                                              βd (Company Death Rate in Battle) +

                                              βo (Company Characteristics) + u                   (4)


where each observation is a company, the ratio of commissioned officers to enlisted men killed in

battle is on the regiment level, and company characteristics include the fraction of the company



                                                 8
who were volunteers, the coefficient of variation of age for the company, company occupational

fragmentation, birth place fragmentation, and the mean 1860 percent vote for Lincoln in the county

of enlistment.

   I examine the effects of having been an officer on city of residence in both 1880 and 1900 by

estimating probit equations for each year of the form


             C = βc (Corporal) + βs (Sergeant) + βo Commissioned Officer + βa X                   (5)

             C = βso (Sergeant or Commissioned Officer) + βx X                                    (6)


and ordered probit equations of the form


                     CS = βso (Sergeant or Commissioned Officer) + βx X                           (7)


where C is equal to one if the veteran lived in a city of at least 25,000 people in 1880 or 1900 and

CS is a categorical variable with city size categories of 25,0000 or more, 2500-24,999, and less

than 2500 or unincorporated in 1900. X is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteris-

tics, including height at enlistment, personal property ownership in 1860, literacy in 1860, marital

status in 1860, nativity, occupation at enlistment (professional or proprietor, artisan, laborer, and

unknown, with farmer as the omitted category), dummies for enlistment year, age at muster, vol-

unteer status, dummies for population size in city of enlistment, and dummies for 1880 occupation

in the 1900 specification. If officers are the most able, whether innately or because of what they

have learned on the job, they should move to a larger city.

   I similarly measure the effects of having been an officer on later life socioeconomic outcomes

by estimating probit equations of the form


             S = βc (Corporal) + βs (Sergeant) + βo Commissioned Officer + βa X                   (8)


                                                 9
                S = βso (Sergeant or Commissioned Officer) + βx X                                            (9)


where S is variously an indicator of whether the veteran was a professional or proprietor circa

1900, a home owner in 1900, and a professional or proprietor in 1880.

       I examine the simultaneous choice of city size and occupation by estimating multinomial logit

models for both 1880 and 1900 in which my categories are 1) in a city of 2,500 or more and a

professional or proprietor; 2) in a city of 2,500 and not a professional or proprietor; 3) not in a city

of 2,500 and a professional or proprietor; and, 4) not in city of 2,500 or more and not a professional

or proprietor. That is, I estimate


                 Pr(Category i) = βso (Sergeant or Commissioned Officer) + βx X                            (10)


where X is in an indicator of a vector of pre-enlistment and enlistment demographic and socioeco-

nomic characteristics.



4 Data

My sample is based on the army records of roughly 35,000 white men in 303 volunteer infantry

Union Army regiment.3 These records provide basic socioeconomic and demographic informa-

tion at enlistment and record muster-in and muster-out information, promotions and demotions,

furloughs, AWOLs, desertions, captures, wounds, illnesses, and death. Information on the 1860

population of incorporated place of enlistment was added. Military records were collected for all

enlisted men within one of the randomly chosen companies. The commissioned officers in the

sample are therefore predominately those who rose from the ranks. I added information whether

the regiment was under fire in a specific month from the regimental histories collected as part of
   3
   The data were collected as part of the NIA funded project, Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and
Death (P01AG10120), Robert Fogel, PI. The data are available at http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.

this project.

       After the military records were entered into the database, pension records, including detailed

physical examinations, were collected. The pension records provide information on occupation,

names of family members, and death. The information in the pension records and in the army

records is then used to link recruits to the 1850, 1860, 1900, and 1910 censuses. Linkage to the

1860 census indicates that the sample is representative not just of the Union Army but also of the

northern population of military age in terms of literacy and wealth. I will use information from the

1860 census on personal property ownership, literacy, and marital status and from the 1900 census

on place of residence and occupation. I used the published tables from the 1900 census to obtain

information on population of the incorporated place. I also use the linkage to the 1880 census done

by Costa and Kahn (2007). This linkage only uses information in the military service records. 4 I

added population on city of residence from the published tables of the 1880 census.

       I restrict my analyses to men with complete wartime information on desertion, death, and

discharge, leaving me with 34,941 men. When examining the effects of rank on mortality I restrict

the sample to the 27,545 men with complete date information on all rank changes and who were

not commissioned officers when they joined the company. When I examine men in 1880 and 1900,

I am using 5,464 and 10,756 observations, respectively. 5

       My analysis of the effectiveness of leading from the front uses the 300 companies for whom I

have information on the regimental battlefield mortality rate of officers and enlistment men from

Dyer’s A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion. I calculated company desertion rates, the frac-

tion of the company dead from wounds, the fraction of the company dead of disease, the fraction

of the company who were volunteers, the coefficient of variation of age for the company, company

occupational fragmentation, company birth place fragmentation, and the mean 1860 percent vote
   4
     For a discussion of linkage rates see Costa and Kahn (2007).
   5
     More men are linked to the 1900 census than to the 1880 census because using the pension information leads to a
better match.

for Lincoln in the county of enlistment using individual level data on the 34,941 men.

   Table 1 shows variable means for all 34,941 men (or those linked to the censuses) by highest

rank achieved. The literate, the native-born, professionals or proprietors and artisans, volunteers,

and those who volunteered earlier are more likely to become officers. Those who became com-

missioned officers are less likely to have died during the war but this may simply be because only

those who survived longer were at risk of being commissioned. After the war, officers were more

likely to be professional or proprietors and were living in larger cities.

5.1 Creating Leaders

Table 2 shows that the more able were more likely to become officers, i.e. men who were more lit-

erate and men who were either professionals or proprietors or artisans. The tall were more likely to

become officers, as were the native-born. Size of city of enlistment did not matter. Volunteer status

predicted becoming a corporal but was not a statistically significant predictor of being promoted

to either sergeant or officer. Controlling for year of enlistment and other characteristics of men at

enlistment, having the regiment be under fire in the past was a statistically significant predictor of

promotion. Being under fire in the past month predicted promotion to sergeant and corporal and

being under fire two months ago predicted promotion to commissioned officer, probably because

of the time it took to obtain a commission.

   Promotion to commissioned officer sharply lowered the odds of death relative to a private from

both disease and wounds (see Table 3). Promotion to corporal or sergeant lowered the odds of

death relative to a private from disease but raised the odds of death from wounds. Overall risk of

death relative to a private was lower. The estimated duration dependence parameter for the weibull,

p, was 0.924 (σ̂ 2 =.018) for death from disease and 1.191 (σ̂ 2 =0.045) for death in battle, implying


                                                  12
that men’s risk of death from disease fell with their time in the army (perhaps as they developed

immunities) but that their risk of death from wounds rose.

       For comparison, the final column of Table 3 gives results for all causes of death for a sample

of roughly 6,000 colored troops. These were led by white commissioned officers and by black

corporals and sergeants. Because 90 percent of black wartime deaths were from disease, overall

mortality is effectively disease mortality. The higher the rank the lower the relative risk of death.



5.2 Leader Effectiveness

Although on average commissioned officers did not imperil themselves in battle, when they did, it

was an effective strategy in creating a cohesive fighting unit. At the regiment level, the mean ratio

of officers to enlisted men killed was 0.169 with a standard deviation of 0.333. Company desertion

rates, which averaged 11 percent, were lower for companies in which the regimental battlefield

mortality of commissioned officers relative to enlisted men was higher (see Table 4), controlling

for the fraction of men in the company dying of wounds and of disease. The results persist when

I control for proxies for commitment to the cause such as the strength of the vote for Lincoln in

the county of enlistment or volunteer status and for proxies for cohesiveness such as the coefficient

of variation of age, occupational fragmentation, and birth place fragmentation (see the last two

columns).6 A standard deviation increase in the mean ratio of officers to enlisted men killed would

have lowered desertion rates by 0.014. In contrast, desertion rates would have fallen by 0.008

with a standard deviation increase in the fraction of the company who were volunteers, by 0.012

with a standard deviation decrease in birthplace fragmentation, by 0.033 with a standard deviation

increase in the percent of the county voting for Lincoln, and by 0.044 with a standard deviation

decrease in occupational fragmentation. I find no evidence of non-linearities in the effect of the

ratio of officers to enlisted men killed on desertion rates (results not shown). The ratio of deaths
   6
    See Costa and Kahn (2003) for the effects of company characteristics on desertion rates and details on how the
fragmentation indices were calculated.


                                                       13
from disease of officers relative to enlisted men had no effect on desertion rates (see the second

column of Table 4), either because sick men could not desert or because the connection between

officers’ better food and quarters and their lower risk of death from disease was not well known.



5.3 Are Leaders in Larger Cities?

In 1880 former sergeants and commissioned officers were more likely to be in cities of 25,000

or more relative to privates (see Table 5), controlling for characteristics at enlistment, including

enlistment occupation and size of city of enlistment. A former sergeant was 1.7 times as likely as a

former private to be in a city of 25,000 or more while a former commissioned officer was 2.8 times

as likely. When I look at the combined category of former sergeant or commissioned officer, these

men were twice as likely to be in a city of 25,000 or more. When I control for occupation in 1880,

these men were still 1.9 times as likely to be in a city of 25,000 or more.

   Former sergeants and commissioned officers were not just more likely than former privates to

be in large cities, they were also more likely to be in intermediate size cities. They were twice as

likely as former privates to be in cities of 25,000 or more and 1.2 to 1.7 times as likely to be in

cities of 2,500 to 24,999 (see Table 5).

   Former sergeants and commissioned officers were more likely to have moved across counties

between 1860 and 1880 (results not shown). The fraction of county movers was 0.59 and being a

former sergeant raised the probability of a move relative to a private by 0.055 (σ̂ 2 =0.031). Being

a former commissioned officer raised the probability of a move by 0.102 (σ̂ 2 = 0.052). Conditional

on being a county mover, there was not a statistically significant relationship between distance

moved and wartime rank and the sign of the coefficient on former commissioned officer implies

that former officers were less likely to move long distances. Former sergeants were statistically

significantly more likely to have moved across states but not former commissioned officers. The

results are consistent with a move to large cities rather than with a westward migration.


                                                 14
   Examining size of city of residence and wartime rank in 1900 yields similar but slightly atten-

uated results (see Table 6), controlling for enlistment characteristics and 1880 occupation. Cor-

porals, sergeants, and commissioned officers were more likely to be in a city of 25,000 or more

relative to privates, with stronger effects for commissioned officers. For the combined category of

former sergeant or commissioned officer, these men were 1.3 times as likely to be in city of 25,000

or more relative to privates. They were 1.2 times as likely to be in a city of 2,500 to 24,999.

   Former sergeants and commissioned officers were more likely to be professionals or proprietors

in 1880 and 1900 and former corporals were also more likely to be professionals or proprietors

circa 1900 (see Table 7). Men in the combined category of former sergeant or commissioned

officer were 1.7 to 1.8 times as likely to be professionals or proprietors relative to privates.

   In both 1880 and 1900 having been a sergeant or commissioned officer raised a veteran’s prob-

ability of 1) living in a city of 2,500 or more and being a professional or proprietor; 2) living in

city of 2,500 or more and not being a professional or proprietor; and, 3) not living in city of 2,500

or more and being a professional or proprietor (see Table 8). Relative to the mean probability

of living in a city of 2,500 or more and being a professional or proprietor, having been a former

sergeant or commissioned officer roughly doubled the joint probability of living in a city of 2,500

or more and being a professional or proprietor.

   Cities may have provided training opportunities for the able. (Because of sorting on ability, a

random veteran would not necessarily benefit from being in a city.) Veterans who were in a city

of 2,500 or more in 1880 and were not professionals or proprietors in 1880 were more likely to be

professionals and proprietors in 1900 (see Table 9).

   The movement of officers to large cities did not lead former privates and corporals to follow

them (results not shown). The 298 former sergeants or commissioned officers in cities or boroughs

in 1900 were more likely to be in city of 25,000 or more if there was a fellow officers in that

same city (the derivative of the probit coefficient was 0.366 with a standard error of 0.091), but


                                                  15
the number of former privates or corporals did not predict former sergeants and officers being in a

large city. In contrast, the 1661 former privates or corporals in cities in 1900 were more likely to

be in city of 25,000+ if there was an enlisted man in that city (the derivate on the probit coefficient

was 0.327 with a standard error of 0.039) but not if there was a former sergeant or officer in that

city.



5.4 Leaders as Generalists

There is suggestive evidence sergeants and officers with more than strict military tasks while in the

army were more likely to be in a city of 25,000 or more in 1880 (results not shown), consistent

with Lazear’s (2010) theory of leaders as generalists. I classified different tasks as being a quarter-

master, being on recruiting duty, being a clerk, being a nurse, etc. if veteran was ever in a front-

line position. I do not consider being on guard duty a different type of task nor do I consider a

promotion to be a different type of task. Relative to privates sergeants with only one type of task

had only a 0.014 (σ̂ 2 =0.012) greater probability of being in a large city, but those with more than

one task had a 0.079 (σ̂ 2 =0.034) greater probability. Commissioned officers with only one type of

task had a 0.056 (σ̂ 2 =0.037) greater probability of being in a large city compared to one of 0.156

(σ̂ 2 =0.077) for officers with more than one type of task. However, having more than one type of

task may proxy not for being a generalist but having for the chance to acquire skills that were more

transferable to the private sector (Lee 2006). When I classified the combined category of sergeants

or commissioned officers as having one, two, and three or more tasks, I found suggestive but not

statistically significant evidence of decreasing returns.




                                                  16
6 Conclusion

The Civil War provides researchers a unique opportunity to identify wartime leaders. By observing

both leaders and followers during the war and forty years after it, I established that the most able

became wartime leaders, that leading by example from the front was an effective strategy in reduc-

ing desertion rates, and that leaders later migrated to the larger cities because this is where their

superior skills would have had the highest pay-offs. My findings support theories of leadership

based on personnel economics such as those of Lazear (2010).

   My findings also have implications for the growth of US cities. The literature on internal

migration has emphasized the westward movement, but at the same time that the population was

moving westward the share of the urban population (those living in a city of at least 2500) rose

from 20 to 40 percent between 1860 and 1900. Cities were magnets for the most able (the leaders).

They also provided training opportunities for both leaders and followers: men might start in a low

social status occupation in a city but then move to a higher status occupation.
