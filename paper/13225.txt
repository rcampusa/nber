                                           ABSTRACT

The deferred acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley (1962) has had a profound influence
on market design, both directly, by being adapted into practical matching mechanisms, and, indirectly,
by raising new theoretical questions. Deferred acceptance algorithms are at the basis of a number
of labor market clearinghouses around the world, and have recently been implemented in school choice
systems in Boston and New York City. In addition, the study of markets that have failed in ways that
can be fixed with centralized mechanisms has led to a deeper understanding of some of the tasks a
marketplace needs to accomplish to perform well. In particular, marketplaces work well when they
provide thickness to the market, help it deal with the congestion that thickness can bring, and make
it safe for participants to act effectively on their preferences. Centralized clearinghouses organized
around the deferred acceptance algorithm can have these properties, and this has sometimes allowed
failed markets to be reorganized.

Introduction:

       Matching is one of the important functions of markets. Who gets which jobs,
which school places, who marries whom, these help shape lives and careers.

        Partly for this reason, a substantial literature has grown out of the remarkable
paper "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage" that David Gale and Lloyd
Shapley published in The American Mathematical Monthly in 1962 (henceforth GS). In
that short and almost non-technical paper they proposed a simple model of two-sided
matching, in which men and women (or students and colleges) each had preferences over
individuals to whom they might be matched in the other set. They proposed an algorithm
for finding a "stable" matching that works by having agents on one side of the market
make proposals (offers or applications) to agents on the other, in order of preference.
Those who receive more proposals than they can accept reject their least preferred, but
don't immediately accept those they don't reject; they instead hold them without
commitment, and acceptances are deferred until the end of the algorithm. In the
meantime, agents who have been rejected make new proposals, which lead to new
rejections (including of proposals that were held at an earlier period but are less preferred
than a new proposal), until there are no rejected agents who wish to make further
proposals. At this point all proposals that are being held are finally accepted, to produce a
matching.

         GS used this deferred acceptance algorithm to prove not only that the set of stable
outcomes is nonempty for all preferences of the kind they considered, but that, when
preferences are strict, there always exists, for each side of the market, a stable matching
that is optimal for agents on that side of the market in the surprisingly strong sense that
every agent likes the optimal stable matching for his/her side of the market as well as any
stable matching. They showed in passing that the non-emptiness of the core is related to
the two-sidedness of the market. And, after appropriate caveats about the abstraction of
their model from actual college admissions, they stated in closing that (p14) "It is our
opinion, however, that some of the ideas introduced here might usefully be applied to
certain phases of the admissions problem."

         This opinion has turned out to be well justified. In the last few years, admissions
to high schools in New York City, and to all public schools in Boston, have been
reorganized into clearinghouses that use deferred acceptance algorithms adapted to local
needs, which solve serious problems encountered by the previously used systems. And it
turns out that well before GS, similar ideas had been incorporated, in the early 1950's,
into the successful clearinghouse through which most American doctors still obtain their
first jobs. We now know that deferred acceptance algorithms have been independently
discovered a number of times, in part because they capture a "folk idea" of how markets
operate. In turn, seeing how clearinghouses operate differently from the less centralized
marketplaces they replace has yielded new insights into the tasks that markets have to
perform to work well, whether they are centralized or decentralized. And the design of
clearinghouses, and of rules for decentralized markets, has also raised new theoretical
questions.


                                                                                            1
        This review will be organized as follows. Section 1 reviews the results presented
in GS. Section 2 selectively reviews some subsequent theoretical developments that
helped set the stage for making these results practical tools for analyzing and designing
market mechanisms. Section 3, again selectively, briefly reviews some of the history of
applications of deferred acceptance algorithms in markets, including some new historical
details regarding the medical resident match, that came to light in recent discussions. In
addition to medical labor markets, I'll discuss matching children to public schools. Labor
markets and school choice are the applications that have led most directly to the new
theoretical developments and open questions that I will discuss in Section 4. Section 5
will discuss how these developments relate to insights into the detailed working of
markets, both centralized and decentralized, that have grown from the study of market
failures and how they can be fixed. An Appendix fills in some intellectual history.

The literature that derives from GS has grown a great deal since Marilda Sotomayor and I
attempted a comprehensive survey in Roth and Sotomayor (1990).2 The Science Citation
Index recently showed 436 citations to GS, 345 of them published after 1990.3 The
present review does not attempt even a cursory survey of the whole landscape of new
developments, but rather simply tries to trace a path from the original theory, through
some empirical and practical aspects of subsequent studies and designs of market
clearinghouses, to some new theoretical questions and research directions.

1. The marriage and college-admissions models

GS presented two closely related models of two-sided matching, differing only in
whether the agents on each side each wish to be matched with one other agent of the
opposite sort (the "marriage model"), or whether the matching is many-to-one (the
"college admissions" model).

In the marriage model there are two disjoint sets of agents, M = {m1,..., mn} and W =
{w1,..., wp}, Men and Women, each of whom has complete and transitive preferences
over the individuals on the other side (and the possibility of being unmatched, which we
model as being “matched to yourself”). Preferences can be represented as rank order lists
of the form P(mi) = w3, w2, ... mi , denoting that man mi’s first choice is w3, his second
choice w2 [w3 >mi w2] and so on, until at some point he prefers to remain unmatched (i.e.
matched to himself). If agent k (on either side of the market) prefers to remain single
rather than be matched to agent j, i.e. if k >k j, then j is said to be unacceptable to k, and
in examples preferences will be represented just by the list of acceptable mates. If an
agent is not indifferent between any two acceptable mates, or between being matched to
an acceptable mate and being unmatched, his or her preferences will be called strict.

  Roth and Sotomayor (1990) also includes a more comprehensive account of the intellectual history of
some of the results discussed here.
3
  Further play with the citation index reveals that five authors have cited Gale and Shapley in ten or more
papers: Roth, Sönmez, Sotomayor, Irving, and Balinski, in 78 papers in various combinations and with 35
other coauthors.



                                                                                                              2
An outcome of the game is a matching: μ:M∪W ÆM∪W such that w = μ(m) if and only
if μ(w)=m, and for all m and w either μ(w) is in M or μ(w) = w, and either μ(m) is in W
or μ(m) = m. That is, an outcome matches agents on one side to agents on the other side,
or to themselves, and if w is matched to m, then m is matched to w.

A matching μ is blocked by an individual k if k prefers being single to being matched
with μ(k), i.e. k >k μ(k). A matching μ is blocked by a pair of agents (m,w) if they each
prefer each other to the partner they receive at μ, i.e. w >m μ(m) and m >w μ(w).

A matching μ is stable if it isn't blocked by any individual or pair of agents.

In the marriage model a stable matching is efficient, and the set of (pairwise) stable
matchings equals the core of the game whose rules are that agents from opposite sides of
the market can match if and only if they both agree.

Theorem 1 (GS): A stable matching exists for every marriage market.

GS proved the theorem by presenting and analyzing the following algorithm.

GS Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, with men proposing

0. If some preferences are not strict, arbitrarily break ties (e.g. if some m is indifferent
between wi and wj, order them consecutively in alphabetical order. Different agents may
break ties differently: e.g.. tie-breaking can be random, or decentralized by having each
agent fill out a strict preference list.)

1 a. Each man m proposes to his 1st choice (if he has any acceptable choices).
 b. Each woman rejects any unacceptable proposals and, if more than one acceptable
proposal is received, "holds" the most preferred and rejects all others.

k a. Any man rejected at step k-1 makes a new proposal to its most preferred acceptable
mate who hasn’t yet rejected him. (If no acceptable choices remain, he makes no
proposal.)
 b. Each woman holds her most preferred acceptable offer to date, and rejects the rest.

STOP: when no further proposals are made, and match each woman to the man (if any)
whose proposal she is holding.

Note that the proof of the theorem now follows from the observation that the algorithm
always stops (since no man proposes twice to the same woman) and the matching
produced in this way is itself stable. No man ever proposes to an unacceptable woman,
and no woman ever holds the offer of an unacceptable man, and if some man would
prefer to be matched to a woman other than his assigned mate, he must, according to the




                                                                                          3
algorithm, have already proposed to her, and she has rejected him, meaning she has a
man she strictly prefers, hence they cannot form a blocking pair.4

GS observed that which side of the market proposes in a deferred acceptance algorithm
has consequences.

Theorem 2 (GS): When all men and women have strict preferences, there always exists
an M-optimal stable matching (that every man likes at least as well as any other stable
matching), and a W-optimal stable matching. Furthermore, the matching μM produced by
the deferred acceptance algorithm with men proposing is the M-optimal stable matching.
The W-optimal stable matching is the matching μW produced by the algorithm when the
women propose.

GS proved Theorem 2 by showing that, in the course of the deferred acceptance
algorithm, no man is ever rejected by a woman who could be matched to him at any
stable matching.

They also showed that the two theorems depend on the two-sided nature of the problem,
by considering, in contrast, a one-sided "roommates" problem in which every agent has
preferences over all other agents, and any two agents can be matched together. They
considered an example in which there are four potential roommates {1,...4}, such that 1's
first choice is 2, 2's first choice is 3, and 3's first choice is 1, and 1-3 all rank 4 as their
last choice. Then (regardless of poor 4's preferences), since each of 1,2, and 3 is the first
choice of one of the others, no partition of the four potential roommates into two rooms is
stable, since whoever is matched with 4 will form a blocking pair with the roommate
whose first choice he is.5

GS also formulated a many-to-one "college admissions" model populated by a set of
colleges and a set of students that was identical to the marriage model except that each
college Ci wishes to be matched to qi ≥ 1 students, while each student is interested in
being matched to only 1 college. That is, each student had a preference over colleges,
each college had a preference over individual students, and a matching was a function
that assigned each student to no more than one college, and each college i to no more
than qi students. They observed that essentially the same deferred acceptance algorithm
4
  Sotomayor (1996) provides an equally simple proof of the nonemptiness of the set of stable matchings
that connects stability with a broader notion of stability with respect to unmatched agents.
5
  While I will not discuss it here, a substantial literature has grown around the issues of finding conditions
in which the set of stable matchings is non-empty for the roommates problem, and the performance of
algorithms that can produce them when they exist (for an introduction, see the important contributions of
Irving, 1985; Gusfield and Irving, 1989; Tan, 1991 and Chung, 2000). There were also, over the years, a
number of results that supported the conjecture that Gale and Shapley’s main results could not be
generalized beyond a two-sided structure. (One of the most elegant of these is the proof by Abeledo and
Isaak 1991 that if you model a set of agents as the nodes on a graph, and connect a pair of agents only if
they are eligible to be matched to one another, and if a stable matching exists for any preferences, then the
graph must be bipartite, i.e. it must be possible to divide the set of agents into two disjoint sets such that
agents in one set may only be matched to agents in the other.) However, the surprising generalization of
Ostrovsky (2007), which looks at “supply chains” of agents, that are stable if there are no “blocking
chains,” removes the two-sided restriction in a natural way.


                                                                                                                 4
(with college i proposing at each point to its qi most preferred students who hadn't yet
rejected it in the college-proposing version, or rejecting all but the qi most preferred
applications it had received at any point of the student-proposing version) would produce
a stable matching defined as before. That is, the outcome produced by the algorithm
would not admit any student-college blocking pairs defined precisely as for the marriage
model.

2. Subsequent developments:

GS implicitly raised a number of interesting questions, and other new questions arose as
game theory developed and as the model was adapted and used to explore actual markets
and design new ones.

         2.1 The marriage model

One line of investigation concerns why there are optimal stable matchings for each side
of the market. One fruitful line of answers to this question, which generalizes well
beyond the simple marriage model, is attributed by Knuth (1976) to John Conway. The
essential idea is the following. Suppose everyone has strict preferences and let μ≠ ν be
two stable matchings. Then if we ask each man m to point to whichever mate he prefers
from the two, i.e. to μ(m) or ν(m), then no two men point to the same woman (since a
woman who was pointed to by two different men would prefer one of them, and would
form a blocking pair to one of the matchings with that man, which contradicts the
assumption that they are stable matchings). So there is a new matching that every man
likes at least as well as both μ and ν. Furthermore, this new matching is itself stable.
More generally, let the partial order >M on the set of stable matchings be defined for
matchings μ≠ ν by μ >M ν if, for every man m in M, either μ(m) >m ν(m) or μ(m) = ν(m).
That is, μ >M ν if every man agrees that μ is at least as good as ν.

         Theorem 3 (Lattice Theorem (Conway in Knuth, 1976)6: When preferences are
strict, the set of stable matchings is a lattice with respect to the partial order >M . The
maximum element of the lattice is μM, the stable matching produced by the men-
proposing deferred acceptance algorithm, and its minimum element is μW, the matching
produced by the women-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm.

The Lattice theorem gives insight into other properties of the set of stable matchings,
such as the following result, also generalizable to more complex models. (Compare the
set of men who must be matched at the man-optimal stable matching to those who are
matched at the woman-optimal stable matching, which by the above theorem is the worst
stable matching for every man, and note that the number of matched men and women
must be the same at every stable matching…)



6
 For extensions of the lattice structure to more general matching models, see e.g. Blair (1988), Martinez,
Masso, Neme and Oviedo (2001), Sotomayor (2000, 2007), and Fleiner (2000), who also discusses the
connections to matroids.


                                                                                                             5
       Theorem 4 (McVitie and Wilson 1970): the set of unmatched men and women is
the same at every stable matching.

       Another way to examine the optimal stable matchings is to compare them with
unstable matchings:

         Theorem 5 (Roth, 1982a): The M-optimal stable matching μM is weakly Pareto
optimal for the men in the set of all matchings (and symmetrically, the W-optimal stable
matching for the women). That is, there can be no matching (even an unstable matching)
that all men strictly prefer to the man optimal stable matching.

        The following example (also from Roth 1982a) shows that the theorem can't be
strengthened to strong Pareto optimality, i.e. it may be possible to make some men better
off than at μM without making other men worse off. This example will also be useful
when we discuss the ways in which various results generalize beyond the marriage
model, and when we consider the issues that non-strict preferences raise in applications to
school choice.

       Example 1: Let M = {m1, m2, m3} and W = (w1, w2, and w3} with preferences
given by :
            P(m1) = w2, w1, w3         P(w1) = m1, m2, m3
            P(m2) = w1, w2, w3         P(w2) = m3, m1, m2
            P(m3) = w1, w2, w3         P(w3) = m1, m2, m3

        Then at μM = [(m1,w1); (m2,w3); (m3,w2)], m1 and m3 each receive their
second choice mate (while m2 receives his last choice). But at the (unstable) matching μ
= [(m1,w2); (m2,w3); (m3,w1)], m1 and m3 each receive their first choice, so they are
both strictly better off than at the Man-optimal stable matching μM, and m2 is not worse
off.

       Strategic properties:

A different kind of question, which has proved to be of critical importance in market
design, concerns the strategic properties of a market organized via a clearinghouse. If a
clearinghouse is organized along the lines of the deferred acceptance algorithm, we can
ask whether participants will find it in their interest to provide the private information
about their preferences on which the algorithm depends. Note that the algorithm was
described above as if people take actions in the course of the algorithm, and we can ask
whether those actions would best serve their interests. To put the question another way, is
it possible to design a clearinghouse in which a stable matching is produced from
participants’ stated rank order lists in such a way that it will never be in someone’s
interest to submit a rank order list different from their true preferences? The following
theorems show first that there are limits on what any mechanism that produces stable
matchings can accomplish in this regard, and then shows a sense in which the deferred
acceptance algorithm performs up to those limits. (A “stable matching mechanism” is a



                                                                                         6
function from any stated preferences to a matching that is stable with respect to those
preferences.)

Theorem 6 Impossibility Theorem (Roth, 1982a):
No stable matching mechanism exists for which stating the true preferences is a dominant
strategy for every agent.

Since a stable matching mechanism has to produce a stable matching for every instance
of the marriage model, a proof of the Impossibility Theorem can be based on the simplest
of examples. Consider the case of two men and two women, with preferences P given by
               P(m1) = w1, w2                 P(w1) = m2, m1
               P(m2) = w2, w1                 P(w2) = m1, m2
Then there are only two stable matchings, μM = [(m1,w1); (m2,w2)], and μW = [(m1,w2);
(m2,w1)], and so any stable matching mechanism h must produce one of them when the
stated preferences are P, i.e. h(P) equals μM or μW. Suppose h(P) = μM (the argument is
symmetric if h(P) = μW). Then, if w1 say, were to state that m1 was unacceptable, by
submitting the preference P’(w1) = m2 (and if everyone else submitted the preferences P,
so that the stated preferences are P’ = [P(m1), P(m2), P’(w1), P(w2)]), the resulting
matching would have to be h(P’) = μW since μW is the unique stable matching when
preferences are P’. So w1 would have profited from this mis-statement of her
preferences.

Indeed, anyone who isn’t matched to their mate at his or her optimal stable matching can
potentially manipulate a stable mechanism in this way.

Theorem 7 (Roth and Sotomayor, 1990): When any stable mechanism is applied to a
marriage market in which preferences are strict and there is more than one stable
matching, then at least one agent can profitably misrepresent his or her preferences,
assuming the others tell the truth. (This agent can misrepresent in such a way as to be
matched to his or her most preferred achievable mate under the true preferences at every
stable matching under the mis-stated preferences.)

Indeed, any agent who receives a mate less preferred than his or her optimal stable
matching could profitably manipulate by truncating his or her preference right after that
mate. However it is possible to design the mechanism so that one side of the market can
never do any better than to state their true preferences.

Theorem 8 (Dominant strategy theorem: Dubins and Freedman 1981, Roth 1982)
In the game induced by the man-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm, in which each
player states a preference list, it is a dominant strategy for each man to state his true
preferences.

The original proofs were difficult, but as is not so seldom the case, easier proofs result
from the following more powerful theorem.




                                                                                        7
Theorem 9 (Limits on successful manipulation.) (Demange, Gale, and Sotomayor,
1987). Let P be the true preferences (not necessarily strict) of the agents, and let P’ differ
from P in that some coalition C of men and women mis-state their preferences. Then
there is no matching µ, stable for P’, which is preferred to every stable matching under
the true preferences P by all members of C.

Dubins and Freedman in fact had proved something between Theorems 8 and 9, namely
that no coalition of men could collectively manipulate in such a way as to strictly
improve all of their mates in comparison to μM.

However, when we consider which of these results are robust to the generalizations that
will be necessary for models that can be applied to real economic environments, we find
that, while the possibility of dominant strategy mechanisms for individuals remains, the
hope that such mechanisms can also prevent coalitions from profitably colluding by mis-
stating their preferences vanishes.

To formalize this we will have to consider more general models, with money and/or
many-to-one matching, but a good idea of what will generalize and what will not can be
obtained by reexamining Example 1. The reason that m1 and m3 don’t get their first
choices at μM in Example 1 is because of competition with m2. If m2 were to mis-state
his preferences so that only w3 was acceptable to him, i.e. if he were to state his
preferences as P’(m2) = w3, then, if everyone else stated their preferences as before, the
outcome μ would be the result of the deferred acceptance algorithm. As Theorem 4
implies, this can’t help m2, but in this case it wouldn’t hurt him either, as he was matched
to w3 even at μM, i.e. even when he stated his true preferences. But his mis-statement
helps m1 and m3, who now get their first choices. So, in a model in which there was the
possibility of transferring any money at all between agents, m1 or m3 could give a penny
to m2 from their gains, and the coalition of all the men would benefit.

In a model with many to one matching, e.g. between firms and workers, or colleges and
students, suppose that, in Example 1, m1 and m2 were in fact one agent, m12 with two
positions. Then the example makes clear that if they pursue their true preferences, with a
first choice of being matched to both w1 and w2, then they will end up matched to w2
and w3. But if they instead state their preferences so that they make their first proposals
to w1 and w3, then the firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm will end after the
first step, and agent m12 will be matched to w1 and w3, and will have profited from the
misrepresentation, i.e. in this case even the conclusion of Theorem 3 will not carry over
to a firm that employs many workers. But to make this precise, we have to consider a
model in which firms or colleges such as m12, that wish to match to more than one
worker or student, have preferences over groups and not just individuals.


       2.2 More general models:

       The two main directions in which related models and generalizations of the
marriage model have developed into substantial literatures involve models in which price


                                                                                            8
setting is accomplished simultaneously with matching, and models of many-to-one
matching. The developments I recount here build mostly on models of many-to-one
matching in which prices are not explicit (but rather are reflected in the preferences that
agents may have for jobs, in which e.g. wages are considered as part of the job
description). However, I’ll briefly mention some of the models intended to directly
examine price setting, since they have become important in auction theory and design.

                 Models with money

One of the first questions that arose as economists began to think about matching models
was how to incorporate money into the model, so that it could discuss not only matching,
but also price determination. Shapley and Shubik (1972) took an important first step in
this direction by considering an assignment model in which all preferences are monetary
in nature. In their model, there are two sets of agents each of whom can be matched to an
agent on the other side with the result that a certain monetary value will be produced,
which may be freely reallocated.7 They show that the core of the game is always
nonempty, and that core outcomes do not involve any transfers between agents who are
not matched to one another. The payoffs the players receive in the core (which are the
dual solution to the linear program that finds the matching that maximizes the sum of the
values) can be interpreted as the prices that one side receives from the other in the
market, and are influenced by the general level of prices, so that, as in the marriage
model, there are optimal points in the core for each side of the market, i.e. there is a point
in the core at which all prices are simultaneously as low as possible, and another at which
they are as high as possible.

A different approach was to look at the deferred acceptance algorithm itself as a form of
auction mechanism, in which offers would include a price or wage (in this respect see
particularly Demange, Gale, and Sotomayor 1986). Kelso and Crawford (1982) is the
seminal paper in this regard (see also Crawford and Knoer, 1981). Kelso and Crawford
explored a price adjustment process in which firms bid for workers’ services by offering
progressively higher wages in a firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm. In their
model, firms could employ groups of workers, and so they also had to consider the form
that firms’ preferences over groups of workers could take that would allow the deferred
acceptance algorithm to continue to produce a stable matching. They observed that this
will be the case if workers occur in firms’ preferences as substitutes rather than as
complements, so that a firm that makes a set of offers to a group of workers and has some
of those offers rejected does not wish to withdraw any offers to workers who have not
rejected them. Formally, if a worker w is in a firm f’s most favored choice set at a price
p(f,w), then if some of the other offers in the choice set are rejected (and henceforth
unavailable), worker w at price p(f,w) nonetheless remains in (one of) firm f’s most
preferred choice set among the remaining set of worker-price contracts available. (If not,
then after firm f received a rejection from some worker w’, it might also wish to
withdraw its offer from worker w, who might have rejected another firm in order to hold

 Gary Becker (1981) famously explored related models to illuminate aspects of marriage and household
production. See also Demange and Gale (1985) for a generalization of the assignment model in the spirit of
GS.


                                                                                                         9
firm f’s offer, and so instabilities could result.) Hatfield and Milgrom (2005) present a
masterful synthesis of much of auction and matching theory, extending this line of
inquiry.8

                 Models of many-to-one matching

The college admissions model and its descendents without explicit price formation
remain very useful for focusing on the matching aspects of models. The question that
arose as economists began to think about using these models to study actual markets was
how and to what extent the college admissions model outlined in GS could be extended
to a well defined game involving many-to-one matching. A model of such a game would
of course require the preferences of all the participants to be specified over possible
outcomes, so colleges would need to have preferences defined not just over individual
students, but over sets of students with whom they might be matched. If the model was to
be a strategic game, colleges would also have strategies available that would not be
available in a model of one-to-one matching.

Roth (1985) examined a ‘minimal’ extension of the GS college admissions model that
would preserve the main properties of the marriage model to the extent possible, and
allow strategic issues to be explored. To this end, consider a model consisting of colleges
(that seek to match with multiple students) and students (who seek to match with a single
college). In addition to the definitions given in GS, let a college Ci with quota qi have
preferences over sets of students with the property that, for any set S with |S|< qi, and any
students w and w’, Ci prefers S∪w to S∪w’ if and only if w is preferred to w’ under
college Ci’s preferences over individual students. Responsive preferences defined in this
way are a special case of preferences in which students are substitutes rather than
complements in colleges’ preferences (i.e. there is no student who is only desirable if
some other student is also in the entering class).9 This allows a marriage market to be
constructed from any college admissions market by representing each college Ci by qi
“copies” each having Ci’s preferences over individual students and seeking to be matched

8
   Indeed, for many years there were no good models that unified the parallel results not only for marriage
and assignment models, but for more general auction and matching models. Principal among these were
the dominant strategy results for the deferred acceptance algorithm and for second price auctions, which
also give agents on one side of the market the core outcome most favorable to them. Aside from
solidifying our understanding of the role of substitutes in preferences, Hatfield and Milgrom (2005) use
Tarski’s (1955) theorem (that an increasing function from a lattice to itself has a nonempty set of fixed
points that form a sublattice) to unify these results, and connect them to the Lattice Theorem for the
marriage model. (In this connection see also Adachi, 2003, Echenique and Oviedo 2004, 2006, Fleiner,
2003, and Ostrovsky, 2007, and, for different uses of Tarski’s theorem in matching, Roth and Sotomayor
1988, and Sotomayor 2007.) Another kind of unification between the marriage and assignment models
involves Abeledo and Rothblum’s (1995) observation that the deferred acceptance algorithm is isomorphic
to a dual simplex solution of a linear programming problem. There are still many open questions
concerning when the core will be non-empty for preferences that aren’t for substitutes, but see e.g.
Echenique and Yenmez 2007, and Pycia (2007) for models in which workers care about not only which
firm they are matched to but also who their colleagues are.
9
  Note that there may be many different preferences over groups of students that are responsive to the same
preferences over individuals, since e.g. a college with responsive preferences over pairs of students could
prefer to receive choices 1 and 4 to choices 2 and 3, or vice versa.


                                                                                                        10
with one student (and such that all of Ci’s copies appear consecutively in each student’s
preferences, wherever they originally ranked Ci). Because preferences are responsive,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the stable matchings of the original mant-
to-one market and this related one-to-one marriage market. This allows Theorems 1 and 2
from GS to carry over immediately from the marriage model, and the extra structure of
the derived marriage market even allows some results that concern only stable matchings
to be strengthened.10

However, a correspondence between two sets of stable matchings does not help us draw
conclusions that involve the comparison of a stable matching with an unstable one, and
here we find results that do not generalize from the marriage model. In particular, we can
formalize the re-analysis of Example 1 at the end of section 2.1 with the following formal
results which show that the conclusions of Theorems 5, 8 and 9 above carry over from
the marriage model only for the students, who continue to wish to match to a single
college, and not to the colleges that wish to match to more than one student.

Theorem 10 (Roth, 1985) When the preferences over individuals are strict, the student-
optimal stable matching is weakly Pareto optimal for the students, but the College-
optimal stable matching need not be even weakly Pareto optimal for the colleges.

Theorem 11 (Roth, 1985) No stable matching mechanism exists which makes it a
dominant strategy for all hospitals to state their true preferences, although the student-
proposing deferred acceptance algorithm makes it a dominant strategy for all students to
state their true preferences.

Of course, colleges with multiple seats to fill have more strategic options than just how
they rank individual students, they also need to reveal how many students they wish to
admit. Sönmez (1997) considered the strategic decisions faced by colleges constrained by
some maximum capacity (and who in fact prefer to fill that capacity if they can get the
students they prefer), but who were free to admit fewer students, and proved the
following impossibility result.11

Theorem 12 (Sönmez, 1997) No stable matching mechanism makes it a dominant
strategy for a college to always reveal its capacity.


3. Deferred acceptance algorithms in practice12

The first position taken by American doctors after receiving their M.D. degree is now
called a residency, and it is a job that forms both the backbone of hospitals’ labor force,

10
   We’ll return to how some results for the marriage model can be strengthened when we discuss the Rural
Hospital Theorem. See also Roth and Sotomayor (1989) in this connection.
11
   See Sonmez (1999) for some related results.
12
   The historical discussion of the American market for interns and residents is based on Roth (1984) and
Roth (2003), in which more detailed accounts can be found, and on conversations in 2007 with Elliott
Peranson, prompted by an initial draft of this section.


                                                                                                       11
and a critical part of physicians’ graduate education and career path. From 1900 to 1945,
one avenue that hospitals’ competition for new residents took was to try to hire residents
earlier than other hospitals. This moved the date of appointment earlier, first slowly and
then quickly, until by 1945 it was customary for residents to be hired almost two years
before they would graduate from medical school and begin work. When I studied this in
Roth (1984) it was the first market in which I had seen this kind of “unraveling” of
appointment dates, but today we know that unraveling is a common and costly form of
market failure. (Unraveling, in which offers become not only increasingly early, but also
dispersed in time and of increasingly short duration, has occurred in other medical labor
markets in the U.S., Canada, and Britain, and in numerous other kinds of markets; see
Roth and Xing 1994 for an account of many unraveled markets).13

In 1945, the market for residents received an assist from a third party, the medical
schools, who agreed not to release information about students before a specified date.
This helped control the date of the market, but a new problem emerged: hospitals found
that if some of the first offers they made were rejected, the candidates to whom they
wished to make their next offers had often already accepted other positions. This led to
exploding offers to which candidates had to reply immediately, before they could learn
what other offers might be available, and to a chaotic market that shortened in duration
from year to year, and resulted not only in missed agreements but also in broken ones.
This kind of congestion also has since been seen in other markets, and in the extreme
form it took in the American medical market by the late 1940's, it also constitutes a form
of market failure (cf. Roth and Xing 1997, and Avery, Jolls, Roth, and Posner 2007 for
detailed accounts of congestion in labor markets in psychology and law).

Faced with the costs of a market that was working very badly, the various American
medical associations (of hospitals, students, and schools) agreed to employ a centralized
clearinghouse to coordinate the market. After students had applied to residency programs
and been interviewed, instead of having hospitals make individual offers to which
students had to respond immediately, students and residency programs would instead be
invited to submit rank order lists to indicate their preferences. That is, hospitals
(residency programs) would rank the students they had interviewed, students would rank
the hospitals (residency programs) they had interviewed, and a centralized
clearinghouse—a matching mechanism—would be employed to produce a matching
from the preference lists. Today this centralized clearinghouse is called the National
Resident Matching Program (NRMP).

The original algorithm proposed for the medical clearinghouse (Mullen and Stalnaker,
1952) was an unstable mechanism that also made it risky, in an obvious way, for students
to list their true preferences. It was replaced at the last minute with another algorithm,
adapted from a prior regional clearinghouse called the Boston Pool Plan (see Roth, 2003),

13
  On the costs of such unraveling in some markets for which unusually good data have been available, see
Niederle and Roth (2003) on the market for Gastroenterology Fellows, and Fréchette, Roth, and Unver
(2007) on the market for post-season college football bowls. For some very recent unraveled markets, see
Avery, Fairbanks, and Zeckhauser (2003) on college admissions; and Avery, Jolls, Posner, and Roth (2001)
on appellate court clerks.


                                                                                                     12
and this was the one actually employed starting in 1952, the first year that matches were
decided through the clearinghouse. This change of algorithms was not well documented,
however. Roth (1984) showed that the algorithm adopted in 1952 is equivalent to the
hospital proposing deferred acceptance algorithm, and produces the hospital-optimal
stable matching.14

Deferred acceptance algorithms seem to have been independently invented twice in
connection with the NRMP medical clearinghouse. Elliott Peranson (personal
communication) tells me that when he was first hired to propose a match like the NRMP
match to be used for medical school admissions in 1972, he initially thought, based on
the available literature, that the NRMP used the originally proposed algorithm as
described by Mullen and Stalnaker (1952). He recognized its flaws, and independently
developed a deferred acceptance algorithm.15 After giving a presentation on this subject
to the AAMC, he was invited to help organize the NRMP match, and implemented his
version of a hospital proposing deferred acceptance algorithm.16

Indeed, deferred acceptance algorithms, with some variations, have been independently
developed in quite a few markets over time, in part because, when a clearinghouse is
called for to replace some market failure, deferred acceptance seems to correspond to a
"folk model" of how markets proceed when they work in an orderly fashion.17 See for
example the rules for the telephone market by which clinical psychologists attempted to
fill their positions (Roth and Xing 1997), prior to adopting a centralized clearinghouse in
1999. That market was codified by rules that looked very much like the deferred
acceptance algorithm: employers made offers starting at 9:00am on "selection day", and
candidates were obliged to hold no more than one offer at a time; they were to

14
   Although the internal operation of the algorithm was organized quite differently, Roth (1984) showed
that it is equivalent, in the sense that it always produced the hospital optimal stable matching in terms of the
stated preference lists. (The GS deferred acceptance algorithm produces a stable match from any stated
preferences, the Boston Pool algorithm as adopted in 1952 only does so if preference lists are such that any
student who is listed by some hospital also lists that hospital; consequently it required an initial step in
which submitted preferences were edited if necessary to have this property.)
15
   "The night before we were leaving for Washington to give the seminar I was working through an
example I was going to present, and realized the algorithm wasn't working very well. I called my colleague,
and together over a couple of beers we came up with what turned out to be the deferred acceptance
algorithm. I revised the seminar late that night to say we didn't think NRMP worked properly." (personal
communication, 3/30/07)
16
   In the process of doing so, he also discovered his mistake about the algorithm that was in fact being used.
Peranson writes: "...we went to the NRMP office, I gave them some examples to work through to see if I
was right about how their algorithm didn't work... The next day, we went back to NRMP and, based on
their solutions to the examples, I discovered that they were in fact using a deferred acceptance algorithm.
(At least they claimed that's how it worked - it had been computerized just recently, the computer system
didn't work very well, and I'm not sure anyone knew what the computer programs really did to produce a
matching)."
17
   I include here clearinghouses that are equivalent to deferred acceptance algorithms even if this
equivalence is not always apparent. See e.g. Guillen and Kesten (2007) who discuss study a procedure
used to allocate rooms in an MIT dormitory, which they show is equivalent to a deferred acceptance
algorithm with certain conventions applied to the "preferences" that rooms have for students. That such
procedures are computationally efficient, i.e. the fact that they can be used to quickly compute an
allocation, is of course part of their practical appeal.


                                                                                                            13
immediately call and reject any offer they were holding if they decided to hold a
subsequent offer. Aside from the fact that this was a decentralized market (in which
employers and candidates could make decisions at each part of the process, rather than
submitting a rank order list of preferences to be followed from the outset), it resembled
the deferred acceptance algorithm except for one crucial difference: the process
terminated not when no further offers remained to be made, but rather at 4:00pm, at
which point offers that were not yet accepted would no longer be available. Because this
didn't allow all offers to be made, a great deal of strategic behavior had developed that
complicated the operation of the market, and eventually led to the adoption of a
centralized clearinghouse.18

Over the years, changes in the medical marketplace made a simple deferred acceptance
algorithm less able to accommodate the requirements of the market. These included some
which preserved preferences as substitutes, and some that did not. An example of the first
kind of change is that hospitals sometimes wish to manage the number of residents in
multiple programs who might do similar kinds of work, so that they might want to have
10 residents in program A and 5 in program B, but be sure to have 15 in total, so that if
program B filled only 4 of its 5 positions they would like to fill 11 positions in program
A. Note that the hospital's preferences to hire an 11th person in program A only if it
cannot hire a 5th person in program B treat those people as substitutes, rather than
complements, e.g. those preferences would not cause a hospital to withdraw an offer it
had made when it received a rejection of another offer.

An example of a change in the market that involved preferences that are not substitutes
had to do with the growing number of married couples graduating from American
medical schools and wishing to be matched to jobs in the same vicinity. This hadn't been
a problem when the match was created in the 1950's, when virtually all medical students
were men. But by the 1960's it was enough of a problem that the match had tried to
accommodate couples. In the early 1970's the first attempt to fully automate the matching
of couples permitted two students to identify themselves as a couple, and define
"communities" of hospitals in which they would like to both be matched. However, both
members of the couple continued to submit rank order lists as individuals, and had to
declare one of their members the "leading member," with the preference list of the other
member then being processed in a manner to facilitate matching to the same community.
While this mechanism often matched the members of the couple to positions in the same
city, couples often declined to take these positions, and instead managed to arrange

18
  In the 20 years before our study of that market it had regularly undergone rule changes designed to
address some of the failings of the market. Most notable of these was that the duration of the market had
decreased from a week to a day. This allowed everyone to stay by their phones from beginning to end,
and, by reducing the time it took to reject an offer after receiving a preferable one, it increased the effective
length of the market, basically the number of offers that could be made. But, as we argued in Roth and
Xing (1997), there wasn't enough time for the market to fully clear in a straightforward way, because after a
short time only a very few people were holding two offers at a time, and even very speedy phone calls
didn't allow the deferred acceptance process to reach its natural conclusion; the deadline was always
potentially binding. (For this reason, this was a market in which employers elicited from applicants the
promise that they would accept a job immediately if called on the morning of selection day, and often made
offers to applicants from whom they had received such promises.)


                                                                                                             14
positions they preferred. In Roth (1984) I observed that if couples were modeled as
having preferences over pairs of positions, this could be understood as responding in a
natural way to the instability of the resulting matching.19 I further observed that when
couples had preferences over pairs of positions, the set of stable matchings could be
empty. And, secure in my observer status as an economic theorist (and not yet a market
designer), I concluded by noting, therefore, "that even when couples are allowed to state
their preferences more accurately, the problem of finding a stable outcome may still be
intractable..."20

I therefore felt at least a little dismay when, in 1995, I was invited to direct the redesign
of the medical match, in response to a crisis in confidence that had developed regarding
its ability to continue to serve the medical market, and whether it appropriately served
student interests.21 As a designer, I would no longer have the luxury of simply observing
that some problems are hard: e.g. more than a thousand people go through the match each
year as members of couples, and have to be matched.22 And the empirical evidence was
clear that stability was important to the success of matches. Roth (1990, 1991) had
studied the clearinghouses that had been tried in the various regions of the British
National Health Service, after those markets unraveled in the 1960’s. A Royal
Commission had recommended that clearinghouses be established on the American
model, but since the American medical literature didn’t describe in detail how the
clearinghouse worked, each region of the NHS adopted a different algorithm for turning
rank order lists into matches, and the unstable mechanisms had largely failed and been
abandoned, while the stable mechanisms succeeded and survived.23

Roth and Peranson (1999) reports on the new clearinghouse algorithm that we designed, a
generalized applicant-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm that allows couples to
state preferences over pairs of positions, allows hospitals to specify reversions of
positions, and deals with some other features of the market as well. Unlike the deferred
acceptance algorithm for simpler matching markets, this does not produce a stable
matching on the first pass through agents' preferences. Instead, a list of potential blocking

19
   Couples are of course subject to the iron law of marriage, that you can't be happier than your spouse (at
least not in equilibrium).
20
   Ronn (1990) showed that the problem of finding if a given profile of preferences has a stable matching is
NP hard when couples are present.
21
   In this respect, the fact that the algorithm was a hospital proposing deferred acceptance algorithm became
a point of debate, as did the question of whether students were or should be submitting preferences
strategically. By this time many adaptations to the initial algorithm had already been made, including
allowing couples to state preferences over pairs of positions, so it was no longer a simple hospital-
proposing deferred acceptance algorithm.
22
   I was acutely aware that, of all the results on matching presented in Roth and Sotomayor (1990), the only
ones that directly applied to the medical match were the counterexamples such as those concerning couples
and the possible absence of stable matchings.
23
   Of course, there are other differences between regions of the British health service than how they
organized their medical clearinghouses, so there was also room for controlled experiments in the laboratory
on the effects of stable and unstable clearinghouses; see Kagel and Roth (2002). And some of the
differences between British and U.S. markets raised interesting theoretical questions as well, see e.g. Roth
(1991) and Irving (1998) on various consequences of the fact that graduating British doctors until recently
needed two positions.


                                                                                                          15
pairs is accumulated (e.g. every time one member of a couple is displaced from a position
and causes the other member of the couple to be withdrawn from a position), and the
algorithm attempts to satisfy these pairs one at a time, using a class of algorithms
explored in Roth and Vande Vate (1990). But, to be clear about the relationship to the
deferred acceptance algorithm in GS, this is a generalization in the sense that if all
hospitals and applicants submitted simple preferences (without couples, reversions of
positions, etc.) the algorithm would produce the applicant optimal stable matching. The
new algorithm has been used by the NRMP since 1998, and has subsequently been
adopted by over three dozen labor market clearinghouses (see Table 1).24 The empirical
evidence that has developed in use is that the set of stable matchings is very seldom
empty but is often very small, and in the next section we’ll discuss some of the new
theoretical questions these results raise.

An interesting historical note is that the use of deferred acceptance algorithms has been
explicitly recognized as part of a pro-competitive market mechanism in American law.
This came about because in 2002, over a dozen law firms representing three former
medical residents brought an antitrust suit challenging the use of the matching system for
medical residents. The theory of the suit was that the matching system was a conspiracy
to hold down wages for residents and fellows, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.25
Niederle and Roth (2003) observed that, empirically, the wages of medical specialties
with and without centralized matching in fact do not differ. An interesting, game
theoretic aspect of the suit itself was that it was a double class action suit, that sought not
only to represent the class of all former medical residents, but sought to sue a class of
defendants that included all hospitals that employ residents, including several dozen
named defendants. This had the effect of making the legal defense costs very high, as
lawyers for the many defendants had to coordinate with one another in each of the many

24
   The establishment of a clearinghouse interacts with the extent of a market. Thus in Table 1, almost all
entry level medical residencies, in almost all specialties, are handled simultaneously by the NRMP
clearinghouse, and we can therefore consider that to be a single market, even though very few if any
applicants will be in the market for, say, both psychiatry and surgery positions. On the other hand, the
various subspecialties of Internal Medicine are separate markets, partly due to the different elective training
that residents must take to prepare for them, but partly now because they have separate matches. Following
our work in helping to re-establish a Gastroenterology match (Niederle and Roth, 2004, 2005, Niederle,
Proctor and Roth, 2006), Muriel Niederle and I are now discussing with Orthopedic Surgery fellowship
directors the possibility of establishing a comprehensive match, and this involves assessing the extent to
which e.g. Sports Medicine and Spine Surgery do or could constitute separate markets, or parts of a single
market for orthopedic surgery fellowships.
25
   Bulow and Levin (2006) sketch a simple model of one-to-one matching in which a centralized
clearinghouse, by enforcing impersonal wages (i.e. the same wage for any successful applicant) could cause
downward pressure on wages (see also Kamecke 1998). Subsequent analysis suggests more skepticism
about any downward wage effects in actual markets. See, for example, Kojima (forthcoming) which shows
that the Bulow-Levin results don’t follow in a model in which hospitals can employ more than one worker,
and Niederle (forthcoming) who shows that the results don’t follow in a model that includes reversions.
(Niederle shows how, in a model with reversions, like those in the NRMP, the difference between hospital
and applicant proposing deferred acceptance algorithms may be different than in a simple matching market,
e.g. in some circumstances both the hospital and student-proposing versions of the algorithm could produce
the hospital optimal stable matching even when it is different from the student optimal stable matching.)
Crawford (forthcoming) considers how the deferred acceptance algorithm of Kelso and Crawford (1982)
could be adapted to adjust personal wages in a centralized clearinghouse.


                                                                                                           16
preliminary motions and hearings expected to stretch over years. Thus the strategy of the
plaintiffs seemed aimed at trying to force a financial settlement before the otherwise
lengthy process reached trial. However the same strategy that made legal defense costly
made it possible for the defendants to seek legislative relief from the suit, since virtually
every senator and congressman has a hospital in his district. The struggle thus shifted to
the Congress, and Public Law 108-218 (2004) notes that the medical match is a pro-
competitive market mechanism, not a conspiracy in restraint of trade.26

A different area of application developed during this period, involving the use of
clearinghouses based on deferred acceptance algorithms for assigning children to schools.
The clearinghouses designed for New York City high schools and for Boston Public
Schools at all levels are described in Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak, and Roth (2005, 2007) and

    The law states in part: “Congress makes the following findings: For over 50 years, most United States
medical school seniors and the large majority of graduate medical education programs (popularly known as
`residency programs') have chosen to use a matching program to match medical students with residency
programs to which they have applied. These matching programs have been an integral part of an
educational system that has produced the finest physicians and medical researchers in the world.
          “Before such matching programs were instituted, medical students often felt pressure, at an
unreasonably early stage of their medical education, to seek admission to, and accept offers from, residency
programs. As a result, medical students often made binding commitments before they were in a position to
make an informed decision about a medical specialty or a residency program and before residency
programs could make an informed assessment of students' qualifications. This situation was inefficient,
chaotic, and unfair and it often led to placements that did not serve the interests of either medical students
or residency programs.
          “The original matching program, now operated by the independent non-profit National Resident
Matching Program and popularly known as `the Match', was developed and implemented more than 50
years ago in response to widespread student complaints about the prior process. This Program includes on
its board of directors individuals nominated by medical student organizations as well as by major medical
education and hospital associations.
          “The Match uses a computerized mathematical algorithm, as students had recommended, to
analyze the preferences of students and residency programs and match students with their highest
preferences from among the available positions in residency programs that listed them. Students thus obtain
a residency position in the most highly ranked program on their list that has ranked them sufficiently high
among its preferences. Each year, about 85 percent of participating United States medical students secure a
place in one of their top 3 residency program choices.
          “Antitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof,
have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long-standing process. The costs
of defending such litigation would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and
medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research. In
addition, such costs may lead to abandonment of the matching process, which has effectively served the
interests of medical students, teaching hospitals, and patients for over half a century.
          “… It is the purpose of this section to—confirm that the antitrust laws do not prohibit sponsoring,
conducting, or participating in a graduate medical education residency matching program, or agreeing to do
so; and ensure that those who sponsor, conduct or participate in such matching programs are not subjected
to the burden and expense of defending against litigation that challenges such matching programs under the
antitrust laws.”

Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak, Roth, and Sönmez (2005, 2007). The New York City
clearinghouse has been in operation since 2003 (for students entering high school in
September 2004), and the Boston clearinghouse went into operation in 2005-06 for
students entering school in September 2006. The problems that these designs are intended
to solve are quite different: in New York, the school choice system is a two-sided market
in which the schools are active players, but in Boston the schools are passive, and the
problem is a one-sided market as studied by Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez (2002), who
observed that deferred acceptance algorithms might often be sensible even when stability
per se was not required to stop blocking pairs from forming. In Boston in particular,
where the new clearinghouse is a straightforward student-proposing deferred acceptance
algorithm, the central issue in its adoption was that it would give students and their
families a dominant strategy to state their true preferences. School choice in Boston had
previously been organized through a centralized clearinghouse that was not at all strategy
proof27, and one of the factors in the adoption of the new system was that it would
eliminate the need for students and families to "game the system."

These school choice clearinghouses are the applications that are most in the spirit of the
“college admissions” discussed by GS, but they also raise new theoretical questions. The
one I’ll address in the next section has to do with how indifferences are treated, which is
an important question in a system in which many children may be indistinguishable from
the point of view of a given school, but in which ties must somehow be broken because
there are insufficient places at particular schools to accommodate all children in the same
indifference class.

4. New theory, open questions and research directions

In this section, I'll attempt to briefly and fairly informally describe some of the new
theoretical questions that arose in the course of analyzing and designing these various
clearinghouses.

One question that arose in connection with the resident match concerns rural hospitals.
These often cannot fill all their residency positions, and a disproportionate number of
those they do hire are graduates of foreign medical schools. Since the vast majority of
residency positions are filled through the match, the question was, when a new match
algorithm is being written, can it relieve the plight of these hospitals? Given that the
empirical evidence supported the view that stability is an important component of match
success, the following theorem answers that question in the negative. (Note that the first
part of the theorem is a straightforward generalization of the result of McVitie and
Wilson for the marriage model, but the second part has no parallel when matching is one-
to-one.)

Theorem 13: (Rural Hospital Theorem, Roth 1986): When all preferences over
individuals are strict, and hospitals have responsive preferences, the set of students
employed and positions filled is the same at every stable matching. Furthermore, any

27
  A great deal can be learned by studying flawed existing allocation systems. In this connection see e.g.
Balinski and Sonmez (1999), Ergin and Sonmez (2006), and Pathak and Sonmez (2007).


                                                                                                            18
hospital that has some empty positions at some stable matching is assigned precisely the
same set of students at every stable matching.

As already mentioned, a different kind of problem was caused by the presence of couples,
which might make the set of stable matchings empty. The counterexamples in Roth
(1984) and also in unpublished work by Sotomayor (see the Appendix) each involved
two couples and four hospitals, in which blocking pairs had to be identified for 24
matchings to show that none were stable. Today we can show this much more simply.
Klaus and Klijn (2005) show that, except when all couples have preferences that are
(“weakly”) responsive to their individual preferences (i.e. except in the case of "couples"
who have preferences as if they were single, and don't alter their preferences for their
own jobs depending on where the other member of the couple is employed), examples
that include a given couple can always be constructed with no stable matchings.28

Example 2--market with one couple and no stable matchings (Klaus and Klijn): Let
c=(s1,s2) be a couple, and suppose there is another single student s3, and two hospitals
h1 and h2. Suppose that the acceptable matches for each agent, in order of preference,
are given by

c: (h1,h2)29;     s3: h1, h2,
h1: s1, s3;       h2: s3, s2

Then no individually rational matching μ (i.e. no μ that matches agents only to acceptable
mates) is stable. We consider two cases, depending on whether the couple is matched or
unmatched.

Case 1: μ(c)=(h1,h2). Then s3 is unmatched, and s/he and h2 can block μ, because h2
prefers s3 to μ (h2)=s2.

Case 2: μ (c)=c (unmatched). If μ (s3)=h1, then (c, h1,h2) blocks μ. If μ (s3)=h2 or μ
(s3)=s3 (unmatched), then (s3,h1) blocks μ.

Aldershof and Carducci (1996) further showed by example that, even when the set of
stable matchings is nonempty, when couples are present there need not be a lattice
structure, or optimal stable matchings, nor is the set of unmatched agents the same at
every stable matching. Indeed, there aren't any ready parallels to any of the standard
results for models in which couples are present (with the exception of the various

28
   In keeping with the general informality of this review, I don't include a formal definition of instability
involving couples, who e.g. could participate in blocking pairs together with one or two employers. The
example should nevertheless be clear.
29
   Couple c submits a preference list over pairs of positions, and specifies that only a single pair, h1 for
student s1 and h2 for student s2 is acceptable. Otherwise couple c prefers to remain unmatched. Note that
this preference is not responsive to any individual preferences that has, say, s1 preferring h1 to being
unmatched, since the couple does not prefer the option at which s1 is matched to h1 and s2 is unmatched to
the option of both being unmatched. For a couple, this could make perfect sense, if e.g. h1 and h2 are in a
different city than the couple now resides, and they will move only if they find two good jobs.



                                                                                                          19
impossibility results; the presence of couples certainly doesn't make it easier to construct
strategy-proof stable mechanisms).

However, one of the empirical observations of Roth and Peranson (1998) was that, in the
large medical market studied there, with over 20,000 positions and almost that many
applicants, the standard results seemed to provide a very good approximation. For
example, only about one in 100,000 positions switched from being matched to unmatched
when applicant and employer-proposing variants of the algorithm were compared. In
general, the set of stable matchings seemed to be quite small, and there appeared to be
very few opportunities for profitable manipulation of preferences or capacities, even for
agents who were not on the proposing side. This latter result is surprising, because in a
simple marriage model in which agents on each side have preferences over all the agents
on the other side, the set of stable matchings becomes large as the number of agents
grows (e.g. when preferences are uncorrelated), so that at any stable matching, many
agents are not receiving their optimal stable match, and so could profitably manipulate
their preferences (recall Theorem 7). But in the medical market, most rank order lists
submitted by applicants had no more than fifteen residency programs listed. Roth and
Peranson showed computationally that if, as such a market gets large, the number of
places that a given applicant interviews (and hence the size of his rank order list) does not
grow, then the set of stable matchings becomes small (when preferences are strict).

This observation has sparked some new theory, and raised some conjectures. Immorlica
and Mahdian (2005) showed analytically that in the marriage model with uncorrelated
preferences, the set of people who are matched to different mates at different stable
matchings grows small as the market grows large in this way, and that therefore the
opportunities for profitable manipulation grow small.

Kojima and Pathak (2007) substantially extend this result to the case of many to one
matching, in which opportunities for employers to profitably manipulate can occur even
when there is a unique stable matching, and in which employers can manipulate
capacities as well as preferences. They look at a sequence of markets with randomly
generated preferences (in which employers may have arbitrary responsive preferences),
indexed by the number of employers. They define an infinite sequence of markets of
increasing size n to be regular if the length k of applicants' random preference lists
remains constant30, the capacity of each employer is bounded, the number of applicants
doesn't grow faster than the total capacity of all employers, and each applicant is
acceptable to every employer. They prove the following.

Theorem 14 (Kojima and Pathak, 2007): In the limit, as n goes to infinity in a regular
sequence of random markets, the proportion of employers who might profit from (any
combination of) preference or capacity manipulation goes to zero in the worker proposing
deferred acceptance algorithm.


30
  Students’ preferences are drawn independently from the same distribution. For each student, colleges are
selected from the same probability distribution, one at a time, until k colleges have been picked (for a fixed
k), these are the student's k top choices in the order selected.


                                                                                                           20
A second empirical observation made in the resident match data, and in the other matches
in Table 1, is that, even when couples are present, it is a very rare occurrence for the set
of stable matchings to be empty. In the vast majority of cases a stable matching is
produced.31 This is true even though we have seen that it is easy to produce small
examples in which no stable matching exists. An open question is why this is so. I offer
the following loose conjecture:

Conjecture: In the limit, as n goes to infinity in a regular sequence of random markets in
which the proportion of couples is bounded [or, goes to zero], the probability that the set
of stable matchings is empty goes to zero.

This conjecture is loosely specified in a number of ways, one of which is that I haven’t
specified from what kind of distribution couples’ preferences should be drawn. We
already know from Klaus and Klijn (2005) that if the couples all look too much like
individuals, the set of stable matchings will always be nonempty. I would imagine that a
simple way to start would be to consider a world in which there are multiple locations,
with couples having some nontrivial tradeoff between personal preferences for positions,
and the desire to be in the same location as their spouse.

Note that this conjecture might seem counterintuitive, given that the set of stable
matchings becomes small as the market becomes large in this way. That is, it might be
thought that in larger markets, with smaller sets of stable matchings, the likelihood that
the set of stable matchings would be empty would be larger. My conjecture, based on
field observations, is the opposite.

        As noted earlier, the question of indifferences arises when considering school
choice. When schools, say, have responsive preferences arising from non-strict
preferences over individuals, stable matchings will still exist, but optimal stable matches
in the strong sense of Theorem 2 will no longer exist. Instead, we'll have to consider the
set of stable matchings that are Pareto optimal for students, i.e. each with the property
that there is no stable matching that gives some students more preferred matches without
giving other students less preferred matchings. The problem is how to break ties to
achieve one of these Pareto optimal matchings, since random or arbitrary tie breaking
may fail to do so (even in the simple case of one-to-one matching). We can see this by
looking back at Example 1, and modifying it so that not all preferences are strict.

        Example 1' (Tie breaking can be inefficient): All preferences are as in Example
1, except for those of w1, and let w1 be indifferent between any of m1, m2, m3.
Suppose, at step 0 of the deferred acceptance algorithm, the ties in w1's preferences are
broken so as to produce the (artificial) strict preference P(w1) = m1, m2, m3. Now the
analysis is the same as in Example 1, and the deferred acceptance algorithm operating on
the artificial strict preferences produces μM = [(m1,w1); (m2,w3); (m3,w2)], at which
m1 and m3 each receive their second choice mate (while m2 receives his last choice). As

31
  The Roth-Peranson algorithm could fail to find a stable matching even when one exists. In the matches in
Table 1, my understanding is that in the last ten years there have been fewer than half a dozen occasions on
which no stable matching was found.


                                                                                                         21
in our original analysis of Example 1, matching μ = [(m1,w2); (m2,w3); (m3,w1)], is
Pareto superior for the men, as m1 and m3 each receive their first choice, so they are both
strictly better off than at μM, and m2 is not worse off. The difference from Example 1 is
that in the present example, since w1 is in fact indifferent between her possible mates, the
matching μ is also stable. The pair (w1, m2) is not a blocking pair for μ, and only
appeared to be in the deferred acceptance algorithm because of the arbitrary ways in
which ties were broken to make w1's preferences look strict.

        So, there are costs to arbitrary or random tie breaking. Kesten (2004), Erdil and
Ergin (2007, 2006) and Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak, and Roth (2007) each explore this from
different angles.32

       Kesten observes that the reason that students are collectively better off at μ than at
μM (in Example 1 as well as 1’)33 can be traced to the operation of the deferred
acceptance algorithm, in which m2’s fruitless attempt to match with w1 harms m1 and
m3 without yielding m2 any benefit. Kesten defines an efficiency adjusted deferred
acceptance mechanism that produces μ in Examples 1 or 1’ by disallowing the blocking
pair (w1, m2) even in Example 1 with strict preferences, under an extended notion of
“reasonable fairness” that generalizes stable matchings. He further observes that there is
no mechanism that is Pareto efficient, reasonably fair, and strategy proof.

        To understand Erdil and Ergin's approach, note that in Example 1', the Pareto
improvement from μM to μ arises from an exchange of positions between m1 and m3.
The key observation is that this exchange doesn't introduce any new blocking pairs, since,
among those who would like to change their positions, m1 and m3 are among the most
preferred candidates of w1 and w2. Since there weren't any blocking pairs to the initial
matching, this kind of exchange can occur without any new blocking pairs being created
by the exchange of positions.

        Formally, Erdil and Ergin define a stable improvement cycle starting from some
stable matching to be a cycle of students who each prefer the school that the next student
in the cycle is matched to, and each of whom is one of the school's most preferred
candidates among the students who prefer that school to their current match. They prove
the following theorem.

Theorem 15 (Erdil and Ergin, 2007): If μ is a stable matching that is Pareto dominated
(from the point of view of students) by another stable matching, then there is a stable
improvement cycle starting from μ .

32
   In the computer science literature there has been a focus on the computational costs of non-strict
preferences, which adds to the computational complexity of some calculations (but not others), see e.g.
Irving (1994) and Irving, Manlove, and Scott (2000). When preferences aren't strict, not all stable
matchings will have the same number of matched people, and Manlove, Irving, Iwama, Miyazaki and
Morita (2002) show that the problem of finding a maximal stable matching is NP hard.
33
   Kesten’s concern is not with tie-breaking per se but with the general question of Pareto efficiency for
students in school choice problems in which schools don’t have preferences that enter into welfare or
strategy considerations.


                                                                                                             22
Erdil and Ergin show that, as a result, there is a computationally efficient algorithm that
produces stable matchings that are Pareto optimal with respect to students. The initial
step of the algorithm is a student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm with arbitrary
tie-breaking of non-strict preferences by schools. The output of this process (i.e. the
student optimal stable matching of the market with artificially strict preferences) is then
improved by finding and satisfying stable improvement cycles, until no more remain.
They observe, however, that this algorithm is not strategy-proof, i.e. unlike the student-
proposing deferred acceptance algorithm, this deferred acceptance plus stable
improvement cycle algorithm doesn't make it a dominant strategy for students to state
their true preferences. They show in fact that no mechanism that always produces a stable
matching that is Pareto optimal for the students can be strategy proof.

Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak and Roth (2007) show that no mechanism (stable or not, and
Pareto optimal or not) that is better for students than the student proposing deferred
acceptance algorithm with tie breaking can be strategy proof. That is, we'll say that one
mechanism dominates another if for every profile of preferences the first mechanism
produces a matching that is at least as good for every student as the matching produced
by the second mechanism, and for some preference profiles the first mechanism produces
a matching that is preferred by some students. Following the design of the New York and
Boston school choice mechanisms, define a tie-breaking rule T to be an ordering of
students that is applied to any school's preferences to produce a strict order of students
within each of the school's indifference classes (that is, when a school is indifferent
between two students, the tie breaking rule determines which is preferred in the school's
artificial strict preferences). Deferred acceptance with tie breaking rule T is then simply
the deferred acceptance algorithm operating on the strict preferences that result when T is
applied to schools' preferences.

Theorem 16 (Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak and Roth, 2007): For any tie-breaking rule T, there
is no mechanism that is strategy proof for every student and that dominates student
proposing deferred acceptance with tie-breaking rule T.

An interesting open problem has to do with the extent to which actual welfare gains could
be achieved using a non-strategy-proof mechanism. Using the preference data submitted
in a recent year by students in the New York City high school choice process,
Abdulkadiroğlu, Pathak and Roth (2007) show that as many as 6,000 students (out of
around (90,000) could be made better off through stable improvement cycles. Of course,
this is an estimate made based on the preferences submitted in the current school choice
mechanism, based on a student proposing deferred acceptance mechanism with tie
breaking. The efficiency losses are only identifiable because the submitted preferences
can be taken as a reasonable approximation of true preferences, since they were elicited
from an algorithm that is strategy proof for the large majority of students (recall that the
NYC implementation is only approximately a deferred acceptance algorithm). Nothing
is now known about what kinds of preferences might be submitted (e.g. at equilibrium) of
an algorithm that attempted to achieve the potential efficiency gains.




                                                                                         23
 In turn, there would be costs to losing strategy-proofness. A strategy proof mechanism
allows school officials to give simple advice to families about how to participate in the
matching system. And it yields valuable preference data. (In New York City, schools
revealed to be unpopular through the preference data have been closed.)

So an interesting theoretical area with important practical implications will be to explore
the equilibrium, incentive, and efficiency properties of mechanisms that seek to achieve
efficiency gains over deferred acceptance algorithms, in matching markets in which
indifferences are important. The properties of such mechanisms will be interesting both
in general, and over limited domains of preferences on which results might differ. (For
example, in the Boston schools preference data, there seems to be virtually no scope for
student welfare gains in comparison to the student optimal stable matching.)

Note that Theorem 16 doesn't say that there aren't any strategy proof mechanisms that are
Pareto optimal for students (it only says that any such mechanism cannot always be better
for students than deferred acceptance with tie breaking). Indeed, in the design of the
Boston school choice system, in which stability of the final matching was not of primary
importance (as it was in NYC), we considered another mechanism, based on the top
trading cycles mechanism, attributed to David Gale in Shapley and Scarf (1974). That
mechanism is strategy proof for students (Roth, 1982), and can be generalized in a way
that potentially also would have made sense for Boston schools (Abdulkadiroğlu and
Sönmez, 1999, 2003). But that is a story for another occasion.34

5. Matching and Market Design:

Although I have focused in this review on the deferred acceptance algorithm, I will end
by briefly indicating some of the larger questions in economics that are illuminated by
studying the kinds of markets in which deferred acceptance clearinghouses are used. A
lot has been learned (and much more remains to be learned) about the detailed game
theoretic microstructure of markets by trying to answer these questions. Why have
clearinghouses based on the deferred acceptance algorithm (as well as other kinds of
clearinghouses) been of use in markets? What are the kinds of market failure for which
such a clearinghouse is a solution? To put it another way, what do we learn about
markets, and about clearinghouses organized around deferred acceptance algorithms,
from the markets that have employed such clearinghouses?


34
  The top trading cycles (TTC) algorithm forms the basis of a new appeals process in the NYC high school
choice system. It also served as an initial conceptual basis for the algorithm organizing the New England
Program for Kidney Exchange (Roth, Sonmez, Unver 2004, 2005), although various considerations have
since led in other directions (see e.g. Roth, Sönmez, Unver 2007, and Abraham, Blum, and Sandholm
2007). It's possible that the roommate problem, or some related formulation might come to be of
importance in kidney exchange (see e.g. Cechlarova, Fleiner, and Manlove [2005]). Like the deferred
acceptance algorithm, TTC has also been the source of elegant theory (cf. Abdulkadiroglu and Sönmez
1998 and Sönmez and Unver, 2005), which connects it to the broader subject of general allocation
mechanisms for indivisible goods (see e.g. Ergin 2002, Ehlers and Klaus 2006, Kesten 2006, Papai 2000).
The behavior of TTC with respect to tie-breaking when preferences are not strict is surprisingly different
from that of deferred acceptance: Pathak (2007) shows that it is insensitive to how ties are broken.


                                                                                                       24
Muriel Niederle and I have gotten an unusually clear view of this by studying the market
for Gastroenterology fellows, and helping gastroenterologists reorganize it.35 Like the
market for medical residents before it, this is a market with a complex history, which in
recent years experienced periods of
     unraveling of appointment dates so that offers were being made at early and
        dispersed time;
     congestion in the making of offers, so that employers found that there was
        insufficient time to make all offers they would like in a timely way. (By the time a
        candidate had rejected an offer, the next choice candidate may already have
        accepted an offer elsewhere.)
     lots of strategic play in terms of the scheduling of interviews and offers, as it
        became unsafe for participants to act straightforwardly on their preferences.

 To summarize, like a number of other markets, the gastroenterology fellows market
experienced problems in maintaining a thick market, dealing with congestion when the
market is thick, and in general making it strategically simple to participate in the market.

These problems, together or separately, are often the reasons that markets adopt a
clearinghouse. By making offers through an algorithm, congestion problems can be
solved, as algorithms operate very fast. Furthermore, using a deferred acceptance
algorithm makes it safe for the proposing side of the market to make offers according to
their preferences only, and, if the market is large, this is true for both sides of the market.
Therefore if there is sufficient participation in the centralized clearinghouse, the market is
thick, uncongested, and safe even for nonstrategic participants.

Of course, even markets that are working inefficiently may be at an equilibrium that
makes it difficult to move them to another, better equilibrium. In the case of the
gastroenterology market, it had become customary for fellowship programs to hire
internal medicine residents up to two years before they would begin employment, and
there was interest in establishing a clearinghouse that would operate only one year before
employment would begin. But even though most fellowship programs were eager to
make this transition, there was widespread concern that it would be disadvantageous to
do so if other, competing fellowship programs continued to hire earlier than the
clearinghouse. To make it safe for programs to wait a year and participate in the match,
the four gastroenterology professional organizations eventually adopted a resolution,
proposed in Niederle, Proctor and Roth (2006), that allowed applicants who had accepted
offers before the match to later change their mind and decline them if they wanted to
participate in the match. This changed the equilibrium in the decentralized market, and
allowed participants to confidently plan to participate in the first run of the clearinghouse
in June of 2006, for fellows who would begin one year later.

35
  The market for gastroenterology fellows was organized through a centralized fellowship match, the
Medical Specialties Matching Program (MSMP organized by the NRMP) from 1986 to the mid nineties.
The arrangement fell apart (see McKinney, Niederle and Roth, 2005 for an investigation into the causes of
this collapse), and for the next decade the market operated in a decentralized way. It re-established a match
in 2006, see Niederle and Roth (2007).



                                                                                                          25
As this illustrates, while much of market design has so far concentrated on market
failures that can be fixed with centralized clearinghouses of one sort or another (see e.g.
Milgrom 2004 in this connection, and Roth 2002), there is often a decentralized market or
potential market in the background that must also be understood. One promising area of
research will be to better understand how the problems of providing thickness, dealing
with congestion, and making markets safe are dealt with in decentralized markets.36


6. Conclusion:

Gale and Shapley (1962) initiated and advanced what has grown into not only a
substantial academic literature on matching models and mechanisms, but also an
emerging empirical literature on market failure and market organization, and a growing
“economic engineering” practice of market design.37

Appendix. Some lost and found intellectual history: the Gale-Peranson correspondence

When I began to circulate the material that eventually became Roth (1982a, 1984), David
Gale told me that in the 1970’s he had corresponded with someone at the medical match,
but had not kept any copies of his correspondence. He subsequently told me that Marilda
Sotomayor had developed an example like mine showing that the set of stable matchings
could be empty when couples were present. However when I asked her about this she told
me that this example too had been lost, and in Roth and Sotomayor (1990) we referenced
her example as “unpublished.”

It turns out that Elliott Peranson had retained copies of correspondence that he shared
with me as I prepared this review. It includes, among other things, Gale’s 1975 letter of
inquiry, Peranson’s reply about the version of the deferred acceptance algorithm he had
developed in 1972 (recall the history in section 3) which by then already included the
“leading member” couples algorithm, and, in a 1983 letter, the lost Sotomayor example.
With permission of all concerned (Gale, Peranson, and Sotomayor) I present that
correspondence in this Appendix, as a recovered part of the intellectual history of
matching and market design, in honor of David Gale’s 85th birthday.
