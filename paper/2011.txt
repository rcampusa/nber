                  Export Supply and Import Demand Functions:

                         A Production Theory Approach




                                   ABSTRACT




     In this paper we theoretically and empirically model import demand and

export supply behavior of firms for the U.S. economy from 1967-1982. A

producer theoretic approach based on duality theory is used to derive

econometric systems of producer supply and demand functions that are

consistent with profit maximizing behavior. This syste. is then empirically

l.plemented and the resulting estimates used to construct a full set of supply

and demand elasticities characterizing import demand and export supply

functions as well as domestic output supply and labor demand. These

elasticities are in turn used to derive devaluation elasticities and some

estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate that would cause the U.S.

trade surplus to reach zero.

I. Introduction



     In this paper, we utilize a producer theory approach to the generation of

export supply and import demand functions for the U.S. economy for the period

1967 to 1982. Our approach uses an economy wide GNP function1 or restricted

profit function with exports appearing as outputs and imports appearing as

inputs. This approach to modeling trade functions using an integrated

production theory framework was implemented by Kohli [19781 for the Canadian

economy.2

    Traditional general equilibrium models of trading economies assume that

internationally traded goods can enter the consumer sector directly and hence

traditional empirical approaches to the estimation of import demand and export

supply functions inevitably involve modeling the household sector. However,

in Kohlis approach, imports are regarded as intermediate inputs into the

production sector and exports are regarded as separate nondomestic outputs

produced by the private production sector as a whole.3 Treating imported

goods as intermediate goods seems reasonable since:   (i) many imports are

intermediates and (ii) even imported goods that are delivered to the household

sector generally have domestic transportation, wholesaling and retailing

inputs added to them. The advantage of the Kohli approach over the

traditional approach is that we need only model the private production sector

of the economy and we can ignore the difficult problems involved in modeling

the consumer sector.

    Duality theory may be used to derive econometrically convenient systems

of producer supply and demand functions that are consistent with profit

maximizing behavior.4 However, often the estimated profit functions do not
                                        2




satisfy the appropriate theoretical curvature conditions. Thus in this study,

we shall use an adaptation to the profit function context of a functional form

due to Diewert and Wales [1985]. This functional form allows one to impse the

correct curvature conditions in a global manner without destroying the

flexibility of the functional form.

     A brief outline of the paper follows. In Section 2, we outline the

production theory approach to the generation of systems of export supply and

import demand functions. In Section 3, we introduce our functional form for

the profit function and we explain how the correct curvature conditions can be

imposed. Empirical results are also presented in this section. In Section 4,

we table various elasticities based on our estimated profit function. In

Section 5, we derive some devaluation elasticities and some estimates of the

equilibrium real exchange rate by year that would drive the U.S. merchandise

trade surplus or deficit to zero for the years 1967 to 1982. For example, for

the year 1982, we estimate that a devaluation of 28% would be required to

eliminate the U.S. balance of trade deficit for that year. Section 6

concludes and our data are described and tabled in a data Appendix.

     Our model of producer behavior is based on short run competitive profit

maximization, holding capital fixed in each period. Thus we do not model the

capital accumulation process.      Moreover, we assume that producers regard wage

rates as fixed and can hire any amount of labor at the going wage rate. Due

to the existence of substantial amounts of unemployment during the period, we

feel that this assumption is •ore realistic than the polar case where labor

input into the private production sector is held fixed and the wage rate

becomes an endogenous variable. In subsequent work, we plan to consider

alternative treatments of labor.

2. A Prod   uction The O!1 Ap2r oa ch t oEortp2l_yandIportDemandFunctions


      We assume that domestic and international demand and supply decisions are

made by profit maximizing firms operating under perfect competition in all

commodity and factor markets. The firms face vectors of domestic and

international prices and a vector of domestic primary factor stocks and make

decisions about domestic and international input demand and production. The

technology is assumed to be represented by a production possibilities set,

from which a profit function can be derived.

      Specifically, let the production possibilities set for the private sector

of a country in period t be a set St{(x,y,Kt)} where x=(x1                   xN) is an N

dimensional vector of domestic net outputs (if x<O, then good n is an input),

y(y1,. .   .,yj)   is an M dimensional vector of net exports (if Ym<O, then good in

is an imported good that is being utilized by the private sector) and

KtEKt1,.. .,Ktj) is a nonnegative J dimensional vector of capital stocks

utilized by the private sector in period t. Let ptpt1               pt) be the

positive vector of domestic prices faced by domestic producers in period t and

let wt=(wt1... ,wtM) be the positive vector of international prices that

producers face in period t. Then we can define the country's net revenue or

restricted profit function (see Gorman [1968], McFadden [1966], or Diewert

[1974fl by:


(1)
                    t t t t
                    r (p ,w ,K )   flax         t      t           t
                                              (p .x + w .y : (x,y,K )
                                                                         t
                                                                        cS    )
                                          y

      From I1otelling's Lemma, the economy's observed net output vector x =

(xtj...,xtj)       and observed net export vector (yt1,...yt) are equal to the

vectors of derivatives of the restricted profit function with respect to the

components of Pt and wt, respectively (if the derivatives exist); i.e.,
                                            4




(2)             xt = Vu   tttt
                            (p   ,w ,K )   and


                  t       t t ,wt,Kt)             for
(3)              ' =        (p                          t=1   T,


where V is the vector differential operator. Thus Vflt(pt,wtKt) is the

vector of first order derivatives of n with respect to the components of p.

Note that these net output and input vectors are explicitly based on short run

decisions since they are conditional on fixed stock levels of certain inputs.

The extent of fixity —- and thus the flexibility of the country to act in the

short run —-   will   depend on how many stocks are held fixed (e.g., recognizing

only the fixity of capital plant and equipment, or including also labor stocks

to characterize labor hoarding, or assuming a given domestic output level

which generates the negative of a cost function).

      Assuming that only capital stocks are fixed, the system of equations (2)

represents the economy's short run domestic output supply and labor (and

possibly other domestic variable input) demand functions while the system of

equations (3) contains the economy's short run export supply and import demand

functions. If we assume a functional form for fl, and append errors to (2)

and (3), then the unknown parameters which characterize flt (and therefore the

production possibilities set St by duality theory) may be econometrically

estimated from (2) and (3), given a time series of observations on xt, yt, Pt,

wt, and Kt.



3.    The_Normalized_Quadratic Prof it Function


       The approach explained in     the previous section for modeling export supply

and   import demand functions has been implemented by Kohli [1978] for Canada
using   the translog functional form. However, a problem with the translog
                                                5



functional form is that the estimated profit function frequently fails to

satisfy the appropriate theoretical curvative conditions. A procedure due to

Jorgenson and Fraumeni [19811 (see also Jorgenson [19841) may be used to

impose the appropriate curvature conditions, but Diewert and Wales [1985] have

shown that this procedure destroys the flexibility of the translog functional

form. We therefore will implement the model described in section 2 by using a

special case of the Biquadratic Restricted Profit Function defined by Diewert

[1985;89]. For the case of only one capital good and a constant returns to

scale technology, this profit function in period t, flt(p,w,K) say, is defined

as follows:


(4)        n
               t        t
                   (p,w,K

                            )IK   [p
                                       TT

                                                   ,w Jbt


                                  +
                                                         T              TT
                                       (1/2)[p2,...,PN;w     IB[p2....,pN;w II    /p1

where Kt>O denotes the quantity of capital utilized during year t, t is a

scalar indicator of technical progress In time period t, p                   [p1,p2,...,pIT
and w    [w1          g.]T are N and M dimensional (column) vectors of domestic and

international prices respectively, a                [al,...,aN+M]T and b         [b1        bN+MIT

are Ni-K dimensional column vectors of unknown parameters and B                        [b1] is an

N-l-i-M by N-li-K symmetric matrix of unknown parameters.

      Note that the right hand side of (4) defines a unit profit function: it

defines the maximum amount of net revenue that the economy can produce, given

one unit of capital and given that all producers face the domestic prices p

and the international prices w. Note that our definition of flt has imposed a

constant returns to scale property on the technology: if we change the

capital input by the scalar )..>O, then the economy's net revenue will change by

the same proportional factor X; i.e., flt(p,w,Xkt) =               Xflt(p,w,Kt).        The function

becomes more complex, of course, if more fixed inputs are considered.

     The profit function defined by (4) is a straightforward adaptation of the

Generalized McFadden cost function defined in Diewert and Wales L1985].

Adapting their proofs, it can be shown that the Ut defined by (4) is a

flexible functional form for a constant returns to scale technology. It can

be seen the n also is linearly homogeneous in prices, although it will be

convex in prices if and only if the symmetric matrix B is positive

semidefinite.

     For our empirical work, we utilize the data for the U.S. economy for the

period 1967-1982 which was developed by Morrison and Diewert [19851. We have

two domestic goods (i.e., N=2): x1 is the quantity of domestic sales and x2

is (minus) labor input.5 We have three classes of internationally traded

goods: Yi is (minus) the quantity of import demand excluding petroleum

products, Y2 is (minus) petroleum imports, and Y3 is exports. The data are

more fully described in the data Appendix.

     From (2) and (3), differentiating fl with respect to the prices

p1,p2,w1,w2,w3 yields:   (I) the domestic supply function, (ii) (minus) the

labor demand function, (iii) (minus) the nonpetroleum import demand function,

(iv) (minus) the petroleum import demand function and (v) the export supply

function for the U.S. economy in period t. We divided these net supply

functions by the capital utilized in the period (this made the assumption of

homoskedastic errors more plausible) and appended the stochastic disturbance

ut1 to equation i in period t. The resulting system of estimating equations

is given by

                                                                                   +                         +              +
                                                                                           b34w2/p1              b44w3/p1       u5

       There are five a1, five bi and ten b1 parameters that must be estimated

given that the cross equation symmetry constraints on the b1 in equations

(5)—(9) have been imposed. To estimate this system, we first assume that the

error vectors jtE[ut11.. 11t5jT are independently distributed with a

multivariate normal distribution with zero means and covariance matrix 0. We

then were able to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates for a,b and B using

the iterative Zeliner SYSTEM command in version 5 of SHAZAM (see White [1978))

because the system is linear. RESTRICT statements were used to impose the

cross equation symmetry restrictions. The algorithm took 65 iterations to

converge. The log of the likelihood function after one iteration was 210.25

and after 65 iterations was 260.04. The equation R-squares between the

observed and predicted values were: .24,.80,.45,. 25, and .93. These R—

squares are relatively low because of our division of the quantities on the
                                        8



left hand side of (5)-(9) by capital to eliminate trends due to the growth in

the economy. Our parameter estimates may be found in Table 1 below.

     Unfortunately, this unconstrained specification resulted in a violation

of the required curvature properties for the technology. Testing for this

violation requires verifying that the matrix of second order partial

derivatives of II with respect to prices, V2zzrt(zt,Kt) is positive

semidefinite. Since the price by definition is positive and the functional

form is basically a quadratic, the convexity conditions are satisfied globally

if and if the estimated B matrix is positive semidefinite, which can be

determined by checking whether the elgenvalues are all positive. For our

estimated unconstrained model, one of these elgenvalues turned out to be

negative.

     Since the estimated B matrix did not satisfy the required properties we

imposed positive semi-definiteness on B by a reparametrization due to Wiley,

Schmidt and Bramble [1973] and discussed and extended in Diewert [1985] and

Diewert and Wales [1985]. The process requires replacing the components of B

by the corresponding elements of a 4 by 4 lower triangular matrix C, where


10) B=CCT;     C    [c..];    i,j =   1,2,3,4;    c13O for j>i


Due to the symmetry restrictions imposed on the b3 parameters, this

reparameterization does not change the total number of parameters to be

estimated. However the equations become substantially more complicated since

the b1 parameters, which enter linearly in (5)—(9) given the restrictions on

the model, must be replaced by


11) b.. =          c.kc.k    for i,j=1,. .   ,'
                                      9



     Using equations (10) or (11), the b1j's appearing in (5)-(9) were

replaced by these functions of the Cjj'S. and the resulting parameters ai,bj,

and C were estimated with the nonlinear regression command in SHAZAM using the

Davisdon=Fletcher—Powell algorithm which required 345 iterations to converge.

At the final stage, the log of the likelihood function was 257.8 and the

equation by equation k—squares between the observed and predicted values were:

.23, .79, .37, .25 and .91. Thus the likelihood decreased negligibly going

from the B unconstrained case to the B constrained case and there was little

loss of fit.

     Once estimates for the elements of the C matrix have been found,

estimates for the elements of the B matrix can be obtained using matrix

equation (10), or, equivalently, equations (11). These estimates for the b13

parameters along with the corresponding estimates for the a1 and bjts are

reported in the last column of Table 1. Standard errors are not reported

since standard asymptotic theory is unfortunately not applicable when

parameters are subject to inequality constraints.6 As the reader can see from

Table 1, in most cases the constrained parameter estimates are of the same

sign and order of magnitude as the corresponding unconstrained case.

     In the following sections, we use only the constrained estimates in order

to form a system of U.S. net domestic supply functions by differentiating our

estimated profit function with respect to domestic prices (recall (2)) and a

system of U.S. net export supply functions by differentiating with respect to

international prices (recall (3)).
                                        10




4. Trade Elasticities



    We differentiate nt(pt1,pt2,wt1,wt2,wt3,Kt) with respect to p1 and P2 to

obtain a domestic supply function xt1        flt/pj and (minus) a labor demand

function x2 t/p2. Similarly, differentiation of fl with respect to

w2, and w3 yields ytj =    t/w1 =    (minus) a nonpetroleum import demand

function, yt2   flt/w2 = (minus> a petroleum products import demand function

and yt3 t/q3 = an         export supply function.

     It is of some interest to consider the various supply and demand

elasticities with respect to prices.7 In Table 2 below, we list the domestic

supply elasticities Ex1p =     (pt1/xt1)(xt1/p1),    i=1,2, and Ex1w3 =

(wtj/xt1).(xt1/w),      j=1,2,3 for alternate years. In tables 3—6 we list the

price elasticities for the labor demand, nonpetroleum import demand, petroleum

import demand and export supply functions, respectively.

     From Table 2, it can be seen that in 1982, a 1% increase in the domestic

price level or the price of nonpetroleum imports would increase domestic

supply (holding capital and other prices fixed) by about .8% and .01%

respectively while a 1% increase in the wage rate, the price of exports or the

price of petroleum imports would decrease domestic supply by about .7%, .1%

and .1% respectively. It is interesting to note that the one sign change

appearing over time in these tables is for petroleum imports; until 1973 a 1%

increase in the price of petroleum imports corresponded to an increase in

domestic supply and later it caused a decrease in supply. This has important

implications about the impact of the OPEC price shocks on domestic production.

     In the cost function context, two inputs are Hicks [1946] -Allen

[1938;5041 substitutes (complements) if the cross partial derivative of the

cost function with respect to the prices of the two goods is positive
                                      11




(nonpositive). In the profit function case, we define two distinct goods to

be substitutes (complements) if the cross partial derivative of the profit

function with respect to the two prices is gative (nonnegative). Hicks

[1946;311-312] shows that in the two input case, the two inputs must be

substitutes while in the three input case, at least two pairs of inputs must

be substitutes. Hicks [1946;321] and Diewert [l974;143—1451 show more

generally that in the case of only two variable goods, the two goods must be

substitutes while in the three variable good case, at least two pairs of goods

must be substitutes. Since the elasticities in Table 2 are second order

derivatives of the profit function with respect to Pi and one of the other

prices times the other price divided by xt1, it can be seen that domestic

sales and exports are substitutes, which we might expect. Domestic sales and

labor are substitutes while sales with either of the two types of imports are

complementary pairs of goods.

     From Table 3, it can be seen that in 1982, a 1% increase in the domestic

price level, the price of imports or the price of petroleum imports would

increase the demand for labor by about 1.1%, .1%, and .02% respectively, while

a 1% increase in the wage rate or in the price of exports would decrease labor

demand by about 1.2% and .1% respectively. It appears that labor is quite

highly substitutable with domestic sales, and slightly substitutable with both

nonpetroleun and petroleum imports. Labor is complementary with exports. The

relatively large own price elasticity of demand for labor means that there

would appear to be a rather high wage—unemployment tradeoff; i.e., moderation

in wage demands would lead to relatively large employment Increases.

Conversely, the small elasticity with respect to petroleum imports implies

that there is very little tradeoff between use of energy and labor in

production.
                                      12




     Turning to Table 4, in 1982 a 1% increase in the wage rate or the price

of petroleum imports would increase the demand for nonpetroleum imports by

about 1% and .09* respectively, while a 1% increase in the domestic price

level, the price of nonpetroleum imports or the price of exports would

decrease the demand for nonpetroleum imports by about .2%, .7%, and .2%. Note

that the own price elasticity of demand for nonpetroleum imports was close to

-1 for much of the period.   It can be seen that nonpetroleum imports are

substitutable with labor (as might be expected) and petroleum imports, and are

complementary with domestic sales and exports. Note that the substitutability

with labor is particularly strong.

     From Table 5, in 1982 a 1% increase in the wage rate or in the price of

nonpetroleum imports would increase the demand for petroleum imports by about

.3% and .2% respectively, while a 1% increase in the domestic price level, the

price of petroleum imports or the price of exports would decrease the demand

for petroleum imports by about .25%, .6%, and .1% respectively. It can be

seen that petroleum imports are substitutable with labor and nonpetroleum

imports, and are complementary with domestic sales and exports. Note that

although all elasticities are small, the complementarity with sales is

relatively strong in the first part of the sample, decreases, and then rises

again approximately to its initial value, whereas the substitutability with

labor is larger at the beginning of the period (Ey2p2    .414 in 1967) and

diminishes consistently over time (Ey2p2   .965 in 1982). Conversely, the own

elasticity begins very small (Ey2w2 = — .182 in 1967) and increases over time,

with a noticeable jump post 1973 and a peak in 1980 of — .894 about the time of

the second OPEC shock.

     Finally, turning to Table 6, we see that in 1982 a 1% increase in the

wage rate, in the price of nonpetroleum imports, in the price of petroleum
                                            13




imports or in the price of exports would increase the supply of exports by

about .8%, .2%, .07%, and .3% respectively while a 1% increase in the price of

domestic sales (holding other prices and capital input constant as usual)

would decrease the supply of exports by about 1.4%. Thus exports are strongly

substitutable with domestic sales, are quite strongly complementary with labor

and are weakly complementary with the two classes of imports. The own price

elasticity of export supply stayed fairly constant between .32 and .375 over

the sample period.

       Although these elasticities are interesting in their own right, it may be

even more important to consider their combined implications for questions that

we may ask about international trade. One very interesting question which may

be posed, for example, is how large a change in the real exchange rate would

be required to create a zero trade surplus. We turn now to an illustration of

this application of the above elasticities.



5. Devaluation_and the Balance of Trade



       Let e be an exchange rate and define the balance of trade function In

period t, Bt(e), as the value of exports minus the value of imports expressed

in world prices.8 Since net export supply functions can be obtained by

differentiating the profit function with respect to the international prices

Wj   (recall    (3), Hotellings Lemma), we may define Bt(e) as follows:

                t        3   t t     t   t t t t t
(12)           8 (e) E   E.1 w.n   (ep1,ep2,w1,w2,w3,K )/w.


Since e is a hypothetical real exchange rate which expresses the price of

nontraded U.S. domestic goods relative to internally traded goods, a decline

in e implies a devaluation of the U.S. dollar.9 If we define it by (4) using
                                               14




our constrained parameter estimates, it can be seen that Bt(l) corresponds to

the estimated trade balance for the U.S. for the year t; Bt(1)>O (<0)

indicates that the estimated trade balance is a surplus (deficit). The Bt(1)

are tabled in Table 7 below.

       Differentiate (12) with respect to e and evaluate the resulting

derivatives at e=1:


            Bt(l) =
(13)
                      E1 w1E1 Pt 2nt(ptwtKt)/wP
where yt(p,w,K) is the jth net export supply function for the U.S. economy.

Since Bt(1)0 in our sample, we can convert Bt(1) into an elasticity by

multiplying it by 1/Bt(1):


(14)         Bt(l)/Bt(l) =
                             E.1 wy1            (pt/yt)(yt(ptwtKt)/p)/Bt(l)


                         =
                              3     2      t        t
                             ti....1 =1   s.Ey.p.


where S3 =   j   wtyt)/Bt(l) for j=1,2,3. Note that 33=1

is the period t price elasticity of
                                                                   53   = 1 and Ey3pt1

                                                with respect to Pj (see Tables 4, 5,

and 6 for a partial listing for these elasticities). Equations (12) and (14)

enable us to compute Bt'.

       A linear approximation to Bt(e) is:


(15)        Bt(e)   Bt(l) + Bt(l)(e_l)

From (15), it can be seen that a one cent appreciation in the real exchange

rate in period t will change the balance of trade net surplus by approximately

•0l8t'(1) billions of dollars (all quantities are measured in billions of 1972

dollars and all prices are set equal to 1 in 1972). These numbers are tabled

in Table 7. It can be seen that these trade_balance impacts are all negative

as we might expect;1° a devaluation of domestic as compared to traded goods
                                      15




always improves the U.S. balance of trade. Note that the effectiveness of a

hypothetical devaluation improves over the sample period 11: a one cent

devaluation in the late sixties would tend to improve the trade balance by

only .5 billion dollars while the same devaluation in 1981 would improve the

balance by about 4 billion dollars.

     If we take the right hand side of (15) and set it equal to zero, we may

solve for an approximate qilibrium reaL exchang rate that would induce a

zero trade surplus in each year. The resulting series et may also be found in

Table 7. Note that e1982 = .72, so that an approximate 28% devaluation would

be required to eliminate the estimated 1982 trade deficit. However, in

addition to the crudeness of the approximation (15), the reader should note

that our model assumes that domestic prices are "sticky" in the short run so

that the relative price of output and labor remain unchanged. In the long

run, domestic demand conditions may alter these prices and hence our

equilibrium exchange rate may be only a short run equilibrium. In addition,

moving to an analysis of long run adjustment is much more complex because the

dynamics of investment and different capital vintages should be incorporated

in order to model lags associated with real world devaluations.

     Note, finally, that the model of real exchange rate devaluation or

appreciation developed here can be adapted to yield a producer oriented theory

of purchasing power parities12: an equilibrium PPP price vector for a country

in period t could be defined to be the price vector etpt where the scalar

exchange rate et) solves the following equation:

       t    t tt t t
(16) w •V fl(e p ,w ,K ) = T


where w is the vector of international prices that all countries face,

is the country's net export vector and T denotes the long run equilibrium
                                       16




level of "transfers" (i.e., remittances abroad, net tourist expenditures

abroad, net international debt service,'3 etc.) that the production sector of

the country should make in period t.   If labor were treated as a fixed good so

that it appears in the "capital" vector Kt, and there were only one domestic

good, then the scalar etpt would be the country's equilibrium PPP. This

formulation is useful because it shows that a country's equilibrium PPP will

not generally be unity even if technology sets are identical across countries.

The equilibrium PPP depends on:   (i) the country's long run level of net

transfers T, (ii) the country's technological capabilities (i.e., the

production set St or its dual nt), (iii) the world price vector w, and (iv)

the country's endowments of labor skills, capital stocks and natural resources

that are embodied in the vector Kt. Changes in any of these variables will

generally change the country's equilibrium PPP.



6. Conclusion

    We have shown how a consistent framework for simultaneously modeling a

country's domestic supply, labor demand, import demand and export supply

functions can be obtained using producer theory. We followed in the footsteps

of Kohli [1978] and others, except that we adapted to the profit function

context some of the recent work by Diewert and Wales [1985] on flexible

functional forms that satisfy curvature conditions globally. Use of the

producer—oriented framework to model export supply and import demand functions

is much simpler than traditional general equilibrium approaches since we do

not have to model the consumer side of the model and the associated

aggregation over consumers problem. However, consideration of only one

"building block" of the full general equilibrium model, as with any applied

production theory analysis, requires partial equilibrium assumptions such as
                                         17




exogeneity of domestic prices rather than allowing these prices to be affected

by changes in international prices. Our partial equilibrium framework

requires assumptions about conditional distributions which may not be true and

thus our estimates may be subject to some simultaneous equations bias.

     Additional problems and deficiencies arise from the simplifications

incorporated in our model including:     (i) a high level of aggregation, (ii)

the assumption of constant returns to scale, (iii) the assumption of price

taking behavior (in particular, possible induced changes in foreign prices are

ignored and possible monopolistic behavior is assumed away), (iv) the neglect

of natural resource stocks, (v) the use of the assumption of homogeneous

capital across time periods (in particular, we have not allowed for possible

adjustment costs involved in installing new capital equipment), and (vi)

avoidance of consideration of the various taxes, tariffs, subsidies and quotas

that impact the allocation of resources within the private production sector

of the U.S. economy. We have shown, however, that we can effectively deal

with many interesting issues within the framework of this simple model.

Although it is possible to extend the analysis to include, say, imperfect

competition and nonconstant returns to scale, these extensions cause

additional aggregation and computation problems that, at least for a first

attempt, are best avoided. Finally, it would be useful to push our data base

forward through 1985, so that we could attempt to model the very recent

experience of the U.S. economy.14      These extensions and developments will be

the focus of future research.

7. Data_Appendix



     The data required to calculate our indexes include price and quantity

information on national output, capital and labor inputs, exports and imports.

We have developed the output, import and export data for 1968-82 from the

National Income and Product Accounts (U.S. Department of Commerce

[1981],[19821,[1983fl, and have used real capital stock data constructed by

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. Department of Labor [19831) and real

labor data updated from Jorgenson and Fraumeni [19811, since these series

closely approximate our theoretically ideal indexes.

     More specifically, we have calculated the value of output (ptyyt) as

gross domestic business product including tenant occupied housing output,

property taxes, and Federal subsidies to businesses, but excluding Federal,

State and Local indirect taxes and owner occupied housing. The corresponding

price index (Pt.1), was computed by cumulating the Business Gross Domestic

Product Chain Price index.

     The value of merchandise exports and imports were determined by adding

the durable and nondurable export and import values, respectively, reported in

the National Accounts. Tariff revenues were added to the value of imports.

For 1967-82, value and price data for nine different types of exports and ten

types of imports were available, which were used to compute chain price

indexes.   An aggregate export price index     was calculated as a translog

(or Divisia in SHAZAM terminology) price index in the nine types of exports

and the corresponding quantity series Xt was determined implicitly. Translog

or Tornqvist indexes are defined in Diewert [19781. An aggregate nonpetroleum

import price index PtM was calculated as a translog or divisia price index in

the nine types of nonpetroleum imports and the corresponding quantity series
                                        19




Mt was determined implicitly. The price index pt0 and the value series for

petroleum imports were taken directly from the National Accounts and the

corresponding quantity series O was determined by division.

      Using the values of imports and exports, ptt pt00t and PtXXt, tax

adjusted gross domestic private business sales to domestic purchasers, or

absorption, was calculated as PlSt =    ptyt - pt)(t + pt#t + pt0t      The

corresponding price (pts) determined by cumulating the gross domestic

purchases chain price index from the National Accounts, and the constant

dollar quantity St was calculated by division.

      For our labor quantity series Lt, we used the series constructed by

0. Jorgenson and B. Fraumeni, whieh is conveniently tabled by the U.S.

Department of Labor [1983;77]. Our total private labor compensation series,

ptLLt, was taken from the same publication. The price of labor, PtL, was

determined by division.15]

      For our capital services quantity series Kt we used the private business

sector (excluding government enterprises) constant dollar capital serivces

input tabled by the U.S. Department of Labor [1983;77]. In order to ensure

that the value of privately produced outputs equals the value of privately

utilized inputs, we determined the price of capital services PtK residually,

i.e., K (Ptyyt —     PtLLt)/Kt.
      Changing now to the notation used in the main text of our paper, we set

xESt,    pEPt5 ;       _Lt, pt2   PtL   ; yt1   _Mt, w1 PtM ; yt2    _0t,

w'2     pt0; yt3   Xt, w3         The price series are tabled below in Table 8
while the quantity series are tabled in Table 9.

      Finally, we calculated a translog price index using P1 w1, w2, w3 as

prices and xtj, yt1, yt2, yt3 as the corresponding quantity weights. Call the

resulting price and net output series PAt and QAt. We calculated a translog
                                     20



quantity index using Kt and Lt as quantities and PtK and ptL as the

corresponding price weights. Call the resulting input quantity and price

series QBt and PBt. We took t to be QAt/QBt, a translog productivity index.

For a theoretical justification of this index, see Theorem 1 in Diewert and

Morrison [1986]. The series t may be found in Table 9 below.

in their unpublished Ph.D. theses; see Denny [1972] and Burgess [1974].

30f course, some of these export goods could be highly or even perfectly
substitutable with the corresponding domestic outputs.

5This series was taken from Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981].

6See Gourieroux, Holly and Monfort [1982]. Replacing B by CCt is equivalent
to estimating B subject to the usual determinantal inequality conditions for
positive semidefiniteness. One of these inequalities turns out to be binding
in our case and this Is what leads to a failure in the usual asymptotic
theory.

7All supply and demand elasticities with respect to the capital input are
unity and this is due to our maintained hypothesis of constant returns to
scale. We assumed a constant returns to scale technology in order to avoid
conceptual problems that can occur when aggregating over producers.

8We ignore tariffs, subsidies and quotas in what follows.

9See Dornbusch [1980] for further discussion of the real exchange rate
concept.

101f there were only one domestic variable good, it can be shown using the
properties of profit functions that Bt'(l) must be nonpositive; see Diewert
[1974;145].

-This reflects the fact that the trade elasticities tabled in the previous
section tend to become larger in magnitude over the sample period.

2See Dornbusch [1985] for a nice exposition of purchasing power parity
theories.

13Net capital movements abroad should be excluded.

14The main obstacle to accomplishing this task is the unavailability of a
sensible measure for U.S. real labor input into the private production sector.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics [1983] for historical reasons uses unweighted
manhours as its official measure of labor input. The conceptually more
desirable wage rate weighted series developed by Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981]
which we utilized is only available through 1982.

providing updated series.
