                                        ABSTRACT

The FinTech sector has begun to grow rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa. I document far greater
adoption of social media, digital currency, ride sharing, and other FinTech applications in
countries with a common law legal heritage compared to those with a civil law system,
suggesting that legal origin plays a critical role in setting the stage for growth through
entrepreneurship in the developing world. The electrical, telecom, and Internet infrastructure
required for FinTech has been built out more extensively in common law countries. Financial
inclusion outcomes are also better in emerging markets that have a common law heritage.

                    FinTech in Sub-Saharan Africa:
          What Has Worked Well, and What Hasn’t




1.      Introduction

        In 2017 M-Pesa marked its tenth anniversary as a mobile money transfer

service in developing countries. Launched in 2007 in Kenya by Safaricom, an

affiliate of Vodafone, M-Pesa in its first decade spread to ten countries in Africa and

Eastern Europe, growing to process more than 6 billion transactions a year for a

customer base of 30 million people. The service today carries more than half of the

GDP of Kenya.

        The success of M-Pesa has become a touchstone for the potential of FinTech

to improve financial inclusion and raise living standards in sub-Saharan Africa and

elsewhere in the developing world. Yet in many ways M-Pesa appears to be an

anomaly, a fact not lost on previous authors.1 Other start-ups, including those in the

payments space, have struggled to establish themselves in Africa, South America, and

other emerging markets. M-Pesa appears to have been successful because it operates

a low-tech FinTech service, meeting the needs of customers who have basic mobile

phones that can send text messages but not relying on more advanced smartphones.

When the service was replicated in the more advanced economy of South Africa, it

story as an outlier.”



                                                 1
was famously unsuccessful due to the existence of a much more advanced banking

network that was already meeting the needs of most consumers.2

           In this essay I survey the growth of FinTech applications in consumer finance

applications such as payments, digital currency, social media, and micro credit.

Growth rates of services in these areas have accelerated, but they are building off a

very low base, and the overall FinTech sector in sub-Saharan Africa remains small.

Earlier this year a research service released a report heralding 2017 as a record year in

funding for African technology startups, with 151 ventures raising just under US$0.2

billion, a 51 percent increase over 2016. The report identified 45 of these ventures as

FinTech enterprises.3 I the same period, a separate source indicated that vastly greater

amounts were invested in FinTech in the United States (US$15.2 billion), Europe

(US$7.4 billion) and Asia (US$3.9 billion).4 Figure 1, reproduced from a report by

the U.S. International Trade Administration (2016), shows that Africa claimed only a

tiny slice of the worldwide FinTech investment from 2010-2014.

           The largest impediment to more rapid FinTech growth appears to be the

electrical and communications infrastructure in many developing countries, which

have only limited, unreliable access to broadband Internet connections and

smartphone handsets. Building out this type of infrastructure, under the sponsorship

of governments, NGOs, or private industry, may represent the best way to accelerate

the spread of FinTech applications and realize their full potential for boosting

economic growth and financial inclusion. As Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2018) write,

“mobile phones and the Internet can drive financial inclusion only if they are

underpinned by the necessary infrastructure. Physical infrastructure – such as reliable

electricity and mobile networks – is key. People will be less inclined to use digital

payments if network outages or other technical problems undermine their

dependability.” Put simply, FinTech faces a supply problem rather than a demand

problem in many emerging economies.

       The scale of the problem seems apparent from looking at Figure 2, which

depicts the worldwide distribution of nodes on the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain.

Nodes relay traffic on the Bitcoin network and include the miners who compete and

receive rewards for writing new records to the blockchain every ten minutes. While

many proponents of Bitcoin have cited its promise for promoting financial inclusion

through cross-border remittances and peer-to-peer payments, the service’s

overwhelming concentration in developed economies is strikingly evident from the

figure. Bitcoin nodes are concentrated in the United States, Western Europe, and to a

lesser extent, the richer countries of the Far East, with very little presence in Africa,

South America, or the Middle East. One of the most obvious explanations for the

paucity of nodes in the developing world is the lack of an information technology

infrastructure, beginning with a reliable electrical grid, which can support them at a

reasonable cost.

       I use the Law and Finance framework introduced by LaPorta et al. (LLSV)

(1997) to examine countries’ FinTech infrastructure and outcomes in financial

inclusion and FinTech applications. These authors attribute financial market growth

and liquidity to the legal system in place in each nation, and they note that most

countries today use derivatives of either the English common law or French civil law

systems. In Africa, the large majority of countries belong to one of these two legal

families, as imperial conquest of different parts of the continent by different European



                                             3
nations led to creation of colonial-era legal rules that by and large remain in place

today. In a series of papers, LLSV (1997, 1998, 2000) show that common law

countries tend to extend better protection to equity and debt investors, and that these

countries achieve better financial market outcomes in terms of the cost of capital, the

creation of new enterprises, and the liquidity of secondary markets, among other

results.

           The striking pattern that emerges in my data shows that the FinTech sector is

far more vibrant in common law countries than civil law countries in sub-Saharan

Africa. I find that financial inclusion outcomes are superior in common law

countries, as are the extent to which electrical, telecom and Internet service has been

built out in their economies. Common law countries have more use of social media

and digital currency, and are more likely to host the Uber ride-sharing service (which

relies on smartphones) and more likely to have crowdfunding platforms for

microfinance. Interpreting causation with these data is extremely difficult, since

common law countries also tend to have higher incomes, and the legal systems of

nations are likely associated with other outcomes in critical areas such as education.

Nevertheless, the successful extension of the LLSV framework into the FinTech space

represents a new insight in entrepreneurial finance; most law and finance research up

to now has focused on capital markets in the mature, wealthy economies of the world.

           The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II surveys the

FinTech sector in sub-Saharan Africa. Section III examines different African

countries’ outcomes in the areas of FinTech and financial inclusion through the LLSV

Law and Finance framework. Section IV discusses implications of the analysis and

connects them to emerging regulatory trends around the world in the FinTech sector.




                                              4
Section V concludes the paper with some suggestions for extending the analysis to

include additional types of variables.



II.         Survey of FinTech sectors in Africa

       A.      Payments

            The payments industry is the indisputable flagship sector of FinTech in sub-

Saharan Africa, a region where historically more than 90 percent of the economy has

been cash-based.5

            Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2018), in the 2017 edition of the triennial Global

Findex Report, provide abundant evidence of the spread of digital payments in

developing economies. The report states that in 2017, 44 percent of adults in

developing economies had made digital payments during the past year, up from 32

percent in the previous survey three years earlier. Only a minority had used mobile

phones or the Internet for this purpose, however, with the majority still reliant on

debit cards. Sub-Saharan Africa follows a different pattern, the report notes, with 21

percent of adults having a mobile money account, by far the most of any region in the

world. In Kenya, an astonishing 73 percent of the population use mobile money, and

the fraction exceeds 50 percent in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Figure 3 shows the growth

of mobile payments in Africa in the recent 2014-2017 period. The report notes rapid

growth of the technology in other developing nations such as Haiti and Bangladesh.

            Mobile payments services such as M-Pesa have been most successful in

economies with fragile institutional structures, including weak banking systems. Lee

and Teoh (2015) attribute the success of M-Pesa and similar services such as AliPay

in China to the “LASIC” principles: these services have low profit margins (L), they

                                                    5
are asset light (A), and their design is scalable (S), innovative (I), and compliance

friendly (C).

        M-Pesa was launched in 2007 by Vodafone, the U.K.-based telecom giant, in

partnership with Safaricom in Kenya and Vodacom in Tanzania. The service has

expanded to ten countries over the course of its first decade, including one in Eastern

Europe (Romania) and one Pacific island nation (Fiji). Value is conveyed between

phone numbers using text messages and PINs, and it can be redeemed at a large

network that exceeds 40,000 agents in Kenya alone (Burus, 2016). Famously, M-Pesa

has failed to catch on in South Africa, which observers attribute to the relative

strength of that county’s banking system and the growth of more advanced

smartphone technology, both of which make local customers less interested in using

the low-tech M-Pesa service. Buckley and Webster (2018) conclude that “M-Pesa

leverages existing infrastructure to deliver the simplicity and accessibility required of

FinTech offerings in developing countries”



   B.      Crowdfunded micro-finance

        The Financial Stability Board (2017) provides a meta-analysis of recent survey

research into micro-credit and other peer-to-peer lending markets. Data indicate that

this market is growing rapidly worldwide, but that three countries – the U.S., China,

and the United Kingdom – account for the large majority of total activity. African

countries do not have a meaningful presence in the international totals, although

separate survey evidence indicates the presence of vibrant online micro-credit markets

in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, and the Republic of South Africa. The

Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (2016) provides detail about segments of




                                            6
the micro-credit markets in Africa and indicates growth rates of 89% in 2014 and 59%

in 2015.



       C.      Cryptocurrency

            Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 led to a wave of innovation in digital

currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), the issuance and trading of cryptographic

assets has become almost synonymous with the worldwide FinTech movement.

Many of these assets are hosted on decentralized blockchain platforms that operate

throughout the world, and entrepreneurs have found ICOs to be a quick, unregulated

method for raising abundant new capital.

            The crypto movement has largely bypassed sub-Saharan Africa to this point.

As shown by Figure 2, almost none of the worldwide Bitcoin nodes operates in Africa

(the actual fraction is below 0.3%, nearly all of them in the Republic of South Africa),

and data indicate that virtually no Bitcoin ATMs are installed on the continent.6 Few

African countries have taken any position on the controversial questions about the

legality of digital currency and ICOs under local tax, securities, and anti-money

laundering regulations. There is a nascent ICO movement in Africa. For example, a

token called SureRemit, which funded a low-cost remittance service based in Nigeria,

raised US$7 million in February 2018 and saw its market value triple by April.7

            A severe local spike in the price of bitcoin in Zimbabwe during the period of

the military takeover in November 2017 strongly suggested that the limited

cryptocurrency market in Africa results from an infrastructure-related supply problem

rather than a demand problem. In a climate of political uncertainty in Zimbabwe, and

without a bona fide sovereign currency circulating in the economy, the price of

                                                     7
bitcoins rose to a local premium of 80% or more above the levels on worldwide

markets, with very large bid-ask spreads observed on Golix, the country’s lone

cryptocurrency exchange. This price disparity resembled similar episodes in

Venezuela and Cyprus in which political turmoil caused a flight to cryptocurrency as

a financial safe haven. The local price premiums were symptomatic of the inability of

Zimbabweans to access trading markets in other nations, with capital controls and a

lack of Internet connectivity both playing a role.



    D.      Remittances

         Choi, Park and Park (2017) discuss the costs of cross-border remittances and

the potential for cryptocurrency platforms such as Ripple to reduce those costs. Data

from the World Bank quoted by this source puts the transaction costs of remittances to

sub-Saharan Africa at just under 10%, the highest in the world. Anti money-

laundering compliance requirements represent a large contributing factor to these

costs.



    E.      Blockchain-based identity and verification

         A number of entrepreneurs and NGOs, including the United Nations, have

promoted decentralized blockchain systems as potential platforms for a variety of

political and economic applications, including registration of real estate, monitoring

of voting in elections, and biometric identification systems. Often the goal of these

programs is to remove data from control of governments and politicians, to defeat the

manipulation of election results, the cancellation of passports and other identity

credentials, or the reassignment of property titles when political regimes change.

Typically these initiatives are targeted at regions of the world with histories of



                                            8
instability and armed political conflict, such as South America, the Middle East, and

especially sub-Saharan Africa.

            While actively discussed in conferences by academics and foundations,

modest pilot implementations of these systems have only begun to appear in the real

world. Some of these initiatives, such as tokenized real estate blockchain platforms in

countries like Rwanda and Ghana, take the form of private startups whose

connections to the government’s official land records are at best tenuous. One

Kenyan entrepreneur laconically observed that “We expect some frictions with the

authorities because they do not really accept the functionality” of his company’s

platform.8 Nevertheless, a milestone of sorts occurred in March 2018 when a Swiss-

based blockchain voting platform was given limited observer status to help verify the

accuracy of voting in the first round of a presidential election in Sierra Leone.9



       F.      Central bank digital currency

            The most far-reaching proposed FinTech applications involve central banks

adopting blockchain technology and transitioning to sovereign virtual currencies.

Rather than carrying bills and banknotes, participants in the economy would transact

using mobile payment systems, not unlike the large numbers of Kenyans who use M-

Pesa or Chinese who rely on AliPay. Central bank digital currency would have vast

implications for macroeconomic stability and has the potential to improve tax

collection, compliance, and other administrative functions of government. Tunisia

and Senegal have been among the earliest adopters of this technology but have done

                                                     9
so in small form and have continued the circulation of their traditional physical

currency.



III.   FinTech success factors

       I study outcomes in the areas of financial inclusion, telecommunications

infrastructure, and the introduction and uptake of FinTech services. I study these

variables at the country level, using widely recognized sources such as the World

Bank’s Global Findex Database and the periodic reports of the Cambridge Center for

Alternative Finance. Further detail that complements this analysis is available from a

recent International Monetary Fund manuscript by Maino et al. (2018)

       FinTech innovation will improve financial inclusion only if it meets the needs

of broad numbers of poor and working class citizens, whose day-to-day finances are

often characterized by volatility, complexity, and improvisation (McCaffrey & Schiff,

2017). To be successful, FinTech applications must operate on a reliable electrical

grid that permits large numbers of people to connect via mobile phones or the

Internet, and the products must be designed with simplicity and low cost. As Ozili

(2018) writes, “the goal of financial services made available via digital platforms is to

contribute to poverty reduction and to contribute to the financial inclusion objectives

of developing economies.” The author notes, however, the improperly designed

FinTech systems can worsen problems of financial inequality if the services are costly

or difficult for the entire population to understand or access.

       Table 1 presents country-level averages for three common measures of

financial inclusion: whether an adult has a financial account with a bank or mobile

company, whether they have saved money in the past year, and whether the individual

owns an electronic debit card. I tabulate these averages for 35 countries in sub-



                                            10
Saharan Africa, excluding a handful that are governed by religious law and a number

of the smallest countries that are not always covered by research surveys. There are

20 countries in my sample that use civil law, and 15 countries that follow a common

law heritage. Figure 4 shows these countries on a map of the continent, and the

similarities between the footprint of common law countries and the growth of mobile

payments in various nations, shown earlier in Figure 3, seems unmistakable.

       The common law, which generally evolves through caselaw and precedent,

has its origins in 12th century England. Legal proceedings occur in an adversarial

format, and case-based precedents provide predictability and serve as important

guidance to agents in business transactions. Private plaintiffs often have a right to

initiate litigation again the government or against private businesses. Civil law, in

contrast, tends to arise from legislation and academic treatises, and it represents the

byproduct of knowledge rather than experience. The right to initiate litigation is often

reserved to government prosecutors in civil law countries, and legal proceedings do

not occur in the same type of adversarial framework that exists in common law

litigation. Ancient Roman law provides the foundation of modern civil law, and

many of the codes adopted around the world today, including those in sub-Saharan

Africa, are derived from the French Napoleonic Code that was promulgated

approximately two centuries ago. See LaPorta et al. (1997, 1999, 2000), and

references therein, for a more complete discussion.

       Data tabulated in Figure 1 show that most common law countries in sub-

Saharn Africa have average levels of financial inclusion far ahead of most civil law

counties. Taking an equal-weighted average across countries, we see an enormous

gap in financial account ownership in favor of the common law countries (54% vs.

32%), an even more striking gap in electronic debit card ownership (27% vs. 8%), and



                                           11
a higher propensity to accumulate savings (57% vs. 46%). All of these differences are

statistically significant.

        As I stress repeatedly below, inferring causation with these data is quite

difficult. Common law countries tend to have higher income levels than civil law

counties, and it is easy to jump to the conclusion that differences in financial inclusion

are simply an artifact of higher incomes. But income levels themselves are no doubt

affected by the legal regime in the economy. We lack a good statistical framework

for sorting out the direction of causation in these and other relationships, since they

tend to be determined simultaneously in the market.

        In Table 2, I investigate the electrical, Internet and mobile phone infrastructure

for each country, as well as the nature of the government bureaucracy for

entrepreneurs, using the latest available data (generally 2016 or 2017) for each

variable. As a measure of bureaucracy, I use World Bank data about the number of

days required to start a new business, which encompasses the time necessary to pay

fees and obtain licenses and permits from the relevant government ministries.

        Reflecting the higher levels of financial inclusion in common law countries,

Table 2 shows greater Internet and mobile phone network penetration in these

countries as well. The average across countries of Internet availability is 38.5% in the

15 common law countries and much lower at 21.8% in the 20 civil law countries.10

For mobile phone penetration, the averages are 94.9% vs. 75.0%. Both differences

are statistically significant. Note that many countries have mobile phone penetration

in excess of 100%, because it is not unusual for people to own more than one phone.

The penetration of the electrical grid is also higher on average in common law



10
  Mobile Internet (e.g. broadband data) penetration in Africa is 20% to 25% (Lim, Lakhoua and
Mazzawi, 2016,), while it is near 100% in most of the developed world.



                                                12
countries, although the difference in means between common law and civil countries

is not statistically significant at conventional levels, with a p-value of 0.15.

         Even though the technological infrastructure for FinTech entrepreneurs seems

clearly better in common law compared to civil law countries, Table 2 shows that

bureaucracy and regulation for entrepreneurs is more time consuming for the common

law countries, implying that the regulatory climate is less favorable for FinTech

startups in common law compared to civil law countries.11 While this result may

seem surprising in light of the other data in the paper, it may indicate that the common

law governments make the commitment to monitor and regulate FinTech providers at

a baseline level that is necessary for the industry to win the confidence of customers.

The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (2016) writes, “The lack of bespoke

regulatory regimes and specific alternative finance policy developments is affecting

alternative finance industry growth in both Africa and the Middle East. The greatest

perceived risk by the industry in Africa and the Middle East region is ‘fraud.’”

         In Table 3, I present country means for the adoption of four types of FinTech

services. Facebook penetration is the fraction of the population with accounts on the

social media platform, the average for common law countries, 16.0%, is nearly double

the average for civil law countries, 8.5%, with the different being statistically

significant. Social media networks like Facebook are important FinTech services in

their own right, but they also create important side effects by providing referrals of

friends to new platforms and services. A robust social media climate may therefore

be viewed as part of the infrastructure for other FinTech Services.



11
   The U.S. ITA (2016) cites the onerous regulation imposed on the worldwide banking sector in the
aftermath of the 2009 Global Financial Crisis as an indirect factor in the emergence of FinTech startups
as unregulated competitors with far lower compliance burdens.




                                                  13
        Table 3 also shows a measure of cryptographic currency adoption, the

cumulative (since 2008) downloads of Bitcoin client software per capita in each

country. Although there are numerous ways to acquire and transfer digital currency,

perhaps the simplest and most straightforward is to install the Bitcoin client software

on one’s own personal computer. The data indicate vast differences between common

law and civil law countries. Many of the civil law countries appear to have had close

to zero contact with Bitcoin, and the country average for common law countries is

more than eight times higher than the average for civil law countries.

        The other variables studied in Table 3 are an indicator for whether the Uber

ride-sharing service exists in at least one city within a particular country, and whether

a crowdfunding micro-finance platform located in each country is used as a data

source by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (2016) in its survey of Africa

and the Middle East. Again, a profound difference exists in the adoption of these two

services by common law and civil law countries. With just one exception in each

case, all of the Uber service and all of the crowdfunding platforms exist only in

common law countries.

        Regression analysis in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7 analyzes the adoption of Bitcoin,

Facebook, Uber and crowdfunding platforms, respectively, on a cross-country basis

using an ordinary least squares framework (the Uber analysis is a linear probability

model). In each table, the dependent variable is regressed against an intercept and an

indicator for common law legal heritage in the first column. In the second column,

control variables are added to reflect the penetration of the electrical grid, the Internet,

and the efficiency of government bureaucracy, as measured by the number of days

required to organize a new business. In the right column of each table, additional

control variables reflect whether each country falls into the lower-middle or upper-



                                            14
middle income range according to The World Bank (for the upper-middle income

countries, both income variables are set equal to one). Variables are generally

measured as of 2017 as described more fully in the tables.

        I find a consistent pattern of results across the four tables. In each case, a

univariate regression of the FinTech dependent variable against the common law

indicator yields a positive and statistically significant estimate, in line with the

country-level sample means shown in Table 3. Adding regression controls

dramatically improves the fit of each model but generally does not change the

estimate for the common law indicator variable very much, as it stays positive in

every model and usually remains statistically significant. Among the additional

control variables, the most important appear to be the penetration of the electrical grid

in each country, which usually exhibits a positive and statistically significant estimate

with the dependent variables, and also the indicator for upper-middle income status,

which generally coincides with higher FinTech adoption although oddly the opposite

seems true for ride-sharing.

        Inferring causation from these estimates is extremely difficult, since

considerable multicollinearity exists among the explanatory variables, and the

common law indicator probably influences aspects of the country’s infrastructure as

well as its income levels. A proper test would involve either the random assignment

of countries to different legal regimes, which is unlikely ever to occur, or finding a

suitable instrumental variable associated with a common law legal heritage while not

having any predictive association with the various business and economic outcomes

studied in the regressions.



        IV.     Regulatory implications



                                            15
       The data in Table 3 show an overwhelming disparity in the take-up of FinTech

services in common law compared to civil law countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and

this conclusion is reinforced by the regression analysis in Tables 4 through 7. All of

the tables suggest that a common law legal infrastructure can play a significant role in

promoting growth. This is consistent with the views in Burns (2016) about the trend

over time for developing nations to stress bottom-up, market driven economic

development as an alternative to top-down, state ownership driven strategies.

Providing the legal conditions for well-functioning markets, which seems to be the

signal achievement of common law systems, is a necessary condition for bottom-up

development strategies to work effectively.

       We know relatively less about the optimal type of regulation to promote

FinTech business, and how that regulation might interact with the legal system

already in place. To a large extent, sub-Saharan African countries have taken a

hands-off regulatory posture toward FinTech.

       In general, FinTech regulation touches three broad areas: tax collection,

consumer protection, and financial stability. A fourth area would be compliance with

anti-money laundering regulations, which would be a special problem for developing

nations, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, that receive remittances or

crowdfunding donation streams from abroad over FinTech platforms. Regulating

FinTech organizations has been a problem in all countries, even those with the most

highly developed institutions, because in many cases the technology is designed to

bypass existing regulatory frameworks. Public blockchains, for example, can exist

mostly in virtual space with no physical connection to those countries where their

users reside, and any regulator seeking to impose sanctions or collect taxes might




                                           16
have no direct method for doing so other than voluntary compliance by the blockchain

promoters.

   In addition to the general problems I identify above, Didenko (2018) lists four

motivations for FinTech regulation that arise due to the nature and impact of the

technology:

      Threats posed by new technology to market incumbents

      Expanded access to financial services by unsophisticated customers

      Rapid growth of new platforms

      Disintermediation or anonymization of service providers that formerly

       provided market oversight

       He notes that FinTech is generally popular in Africa due to the extension of

basic financial services into many markets that banks have found unprofitable to

enter, as well as the lack of any visible FinTech disasters up to now.

       Around the world, most regulators have chosen to adjust existing frameworks

to accommodate cryptographic assets rather than write entirely new rules and

regulations. However, a wait-and-see approach is attractive to many regulators given

the incomplete information available about new technologies (Didenko, 2018).

       Governments implementing new regulatory schemes often make use of a

provisional “sandbox” form. Regulatory sandboxes, which have proved especially

popular in Asia, provide safe harbors for innovators to launch new products and enjoy

temporary regulatory exemptions. The usual condition for participating in the

sandbox is that a business must stay small. Once it reaches a critical mass, a more

formal regulatory scheme will be invoked.

       The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2017) provides a reasonably

comprehensive survey of regulation in a number of East African countries with a



                                           17
focus on the crowdfunding sector. Among other recommendations, the report notes

that voluntary codes of conduct and self-regulating industry associations offer

attractive alternatives to formal government oversight and regulation. These types of

opt-in, private regulatory schemes allow the promoters to signal to the market that

they are committed to transparency and have viable business plans, and under certain

conditions they may create more credibility than traditional government regulation.

       Finally, access to a suitable infrastructure, especially in the form of a national

electrical grid, appears to represent a necessary condition for progress in the FinTech

area. One cannot use smartphones, digital currency, or social media services without

access to reliable electricity. The determinants of the growth of African electricity

systems is the subject of a large development literature that beyond the scope of this

paper. As an example of a recent policy paper, Blimpo, McRae and Steinbuks (2018)

argues that low electrification rates on the continent may arise as a byproduct of low

tariff rates that discourage utilities from making capital investments.



V.     Conclusions

       This paper studies the success factors for FinTech in sub-Saharan Africa. The

payments sector, and in particular Safaricom’s M-Pesa, have come to dominate public

consciousness about the potential for FinTech to promote financial inclusion and raise

living standards in a part of the world that is under-served by the traditional banking

system. However, the striking success of M-Pesa in Kenya appears to be an outlier,

as FinTech firms have been slow to penetrate other sectors and other countries, and

have only recently entered a period of rapid growth building off a small base.

       FinTech platforms can only succeed where an infrastructure of electric power,

telecommunications, and Internet providers are available to support them. These



                                           18
industries vary widely in scope and quality in sub-Saharan Africa. One clear pattern

in the data is that the infrastructure required for FinTech has been built out much

more extensively in countries with a common law legal system, compared to those

with a civil law system. The common law countries typically provide more investor

protection and achieve lower costs of capital and greater liquidity for investors, and

this seems to have supported the growth of FinTech platforms in those nations. The

results are broadly consistent with a 115-country study by Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt and

Levine (2003) that pre-dates the FinTech movement by more than 15 years and

concludes that the greater flexibility of common law systems provides an advantage in

fostering economic development.

       Best practices in regulation for FinTech companies in the developing world

remain largely unknown, partly because of the immaturity of regional political

institutions, and partly because of the novelty of the technology, which has posed

challenges for regulators even in very advanced economies. Regulatory sandboxes

that offer safe harbors have been the preferred approach of many governments, while

various forms of private self-regulation have begun to play an important role as well.
