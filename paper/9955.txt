                                            ABSTRACT

To assess the consequences of advance medical directives -- which explicitly specify a patient's

preferences for one or more specific types of medical treatment in the event of a loss of competence

n we analyze the medical care of elderly Medicare beneficiaries who died between 1985-1995. We
compare the care of patients from states that adopted laws enhancing incentives for compliance with

advance directives and laws requiring the appointment of a health care surrogate in the absence of

an advance directive to the care of patients from states that did not. We report three key findings.

First, laws enhancing incentives for compliance significantly reduce the probability of dying in an

acute care hospital. Second, laws requiring the appointment of a surrogate significantly increase the

probability of receiving acute care in the last month of life, but decrease the probability of receiving

nonacute care. Third, neither type of law leads to any savings in medical expenditures.

Introduction

       The consequences of advance medical directives – which explicitly specify a patient’s

preferences for one or more specific types of medical treatment in the event of a loss of

competence, generally at the end of life (EOL) – have been extensively debated by physicians,

philosophers, and social scientists. On one hand, proponents of advance directives argue that

they address two important social problems. First, since substantial health care resources are

consumed at the EOL, advance directives that specify preferences to forgo treatment have the

potential to reduce health care costs. In 1990, the 6.6% of Medicare recipients who died

accounted for 22% of program expenditures, a pattern that has changed little over time (Lubitz

and Riley 1993).

       Second, patient autonomy and well-being may also be enhanced by the use of advance

directives. Although society has reached a consensus that treatment decisions should reflect

patients’ informed preferences (e.g., Teno et al. 1994), this ideal is often not implemented in

practice. Because patients for whom advance directives are relevant are incapacitated and

because the common-law right of patients to refuse treatment is unclear (Redleaf et al. 1979),

physicians traditionally have made such treatment decisions in consultation with the

incapacitated patient’s family members. But because physicians’ and patient-surrogates’

perceptions of patients’ preferences are often inaccurate (Teno et al. 1995; Layde et al. 1995;

Hare et al. 1992), substituted judgment in this context may result in medical treatment decisions

that do not reflect patients’ wishes. This is especially important because treatment at the EOL

may be of questionable value. For example, Altman (2001) reports that many cancer patients

receive chemotherapy at the EOL, even if their type of cancer is known to be unresponsive to the


                                                 3
drugs.

         On the other hand, a substantial body of work has found that advance directives do not

deal effectively with these issues. Advance directives may be infrequently used by patients

(Menikoff et al. 1992), and, when they are, not consistently followed by physicians (Covinsky et

al. 2000). People may believe that their wishes will be carried out even in the absence of an

advance directive. Physicians may believe that advance directives are medically unethical, if the

preference of patients who are near death differ from those patients’ preferences at the time they

executed their advance directive (Byrne and Thompson 2000).

         Yet, virtually all existing research focuses on the effect on an individual’s care of his or

her adoption of an advance directive, despite the fact that the enforceability of and the incentives

for compliance with advance directives are largely determined by statutes that differ from state

to state. In this paper, we explore how these state laws affect care at the EOL. We analyze the

medical treatment received by a 20 percent random sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries

who died between 1985-1995. We compare the care of patients who died in states that adopted

laws enhancing incentives for compliance with advance directives and laws requiring the

appointment of a health care surrogate in the absence of an advance directive to the care of

patients in states that did not. To investigate whether these laws affect patients differently

depending on their cause of death or their educational attainment, we stratify our sample of

Medicare beneficiaries by matching it with information from the US National Center for Health

Statistics Public Use Multiple Cause of Death file.

         This paper proceeds in five sections. Section I discusses previous investigations of the

effects of advance directives. Although this research shows how advance directives affect


                                                   4
treatment given a system of law, it does not investigate how the laws that specify the incentives

for compliance with advance directives affect EOL care. Section I concludes that differences in

states’ legal environments may explain some of the differences in findings in the existing

literature. Section I also concludes that another body of law may affect treatment at the EOL:

state health care surrogate laws, which impose default rules on surrogates’ decision-making even

in the absence of an advance directive. Section II presents our empirical models of how legal,

market, and other factors determine EOL care. Section III describes our data in detail. Section

IV presents our results, and Section V concludes.



I.     The Effects of Advance Directives on Care at the EOL

       Advance directives provide a formal, legal mechanism for a competent person to specify

her preferences for medical treatment in case she becomes unable to make decisions. Federal

and state law govern the extent to which advance directives constrain the decision-making

processes of doctors and hospitals. In 1991, Congress adopted the Patient Self Determination

Act, which requires that institutions inform patients that they can execute a formal advance

directive (Teno et al. 1994). States have passed two types of laws governing treatment of the

incapacitated. The first type of law specifies the conditions under which doctors and hospitals

must follow advance directives and the punishment (if any) that they bear from failing to do so.

The second type of law specifies how treatment decisions are made for incompetent patients in

the absence of an advance directive.

       The existing literature paints an equivocal picture of the consequences of advance

directives. One arm of the literature uses surveys of physicians and patients to assess the effects


                                                 5
of advance directives. Although early work reports that both doctors and patients believe

advance directives affect patient care (e.g., Klutch 1978, Redleaf et al. 1979), subsequent survey

research questions this conclusion. In an analysis of interviews with 126 nursing home residents

and their families, Danis et al. (1991) found that care was consistent with patients’ previously

expressed wishes 75 percent of the time; however, the presence of a written advance directive

did not improve the consistency of care with patients’ wishes. Based on a comparison of

patients’ actual advance directives to their detailed survey responses, Schneiderman et al.

(1992b) suggest that this lack of efficacy may be due to the failure of instructions in standard-

form advance directives to adequately communicate patient wishes to physicians.

       A second arm uses observational data to compare the treatment decisions, health care

expenditures, and health outcomes of severely ill patients who expressed a preference to forgo

treatment to those of patients who did not. Studies using this method employ regression analysis

to adjust for differences in health and socioeconomic characteristics across patients, calculating

the effect of expressed patient preferences on treatments and outcomes, holding other factors

constant. These studies also come to conflicting conclusions, with some work finding that

expressed patient preferences in some forms can reduce treatment intensity (Teno et al. 1995)

and hospital charges (Chambers et al. 1994, Weeks et al. 1994), and other work finding that

advance directives have no impact on either treatments or outcomes, over and above the effect of

more-informally-expressed patient preferences (Teno et al. 1994).

       However, because observational data on health status is notoriously incomplete,

unobserved differences across patients may lead the estimated effects of advance directives to

either overstate or understate the true impact of patient preferences. A third set of studies seeks


                                                 6
to eliminate this potential bias through the use of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in which

patients randomized to a “treatment” group are offered the opportunity to execute an advance

directive and patients randomized to the “control” group are not. Based on an RCT,

Schneiderman et al. (1992a) find that the act of offering patients with a life-threatening illness

the opportunity to execute an advance directive has no statistically significant effect on medical

treatments, health care expenditures, or other psychosocial and health outcomes. Similarly, in

the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences of Outcomes and Risks of Treatment

(SUPPORT), neither providing additional information to patients and health care providers about

prognosis and patient rights (SUPPORT 1995) nor increasing documentation of advance

directives (Teno et al. 1997) reduced the use of intensive medical services near the end of life.

In contrast, also using an RCT, Molloy et al. (2000) report that a comprehensive program to

educate health care providers, patients, and family members about advance directives reduced

health services utilization without affecting satisfaction or mortality.

       Although RCTs estimate treatment effects without the bias to which nonexperimental

studies are prone, they may not provide accurate guidance about the effects of feasible legal

reforms on actual medical practice. For two reasons, RCTs that offer patients the opportunity to

execute a directive could show no effect, even if laws governing advance directives affect

medical practice. First, the RCT might have been conducted in a state with weak or nonexistent

incentives for compliance. Second, laws enhancing incentives for compliance with advance

directives may increase doctors propensity to respect the preferences of patients both with and

without advance directives. Furthermore, there are no RCTs examining how other related laws,

such as those governing health care surrogates’ treatment decisions, interact with the use of


                                                  7
advance directives to affect EOL care.

       The failure of the literature to investigate how state laws affect EOL care is striking,

since existing studies suggest that the incentives provided by laws are an important determinant

of the effectiveness of advance directives. RCTs from states (such as California) that provide

strong incentives compliance with patients’ wishes observe that patients’ preferences about

intensive resuscitation measures were routinely elicited in detail before they lost decisionmaking

capacity, regardless of whether the patient had actually executed an advance directive

(Schneiderman et al. (1992a)). By comparison, North Carolina has a weaker living will law, and

Danis et al. (1991) found that care was consistent with patients’ previously expressed wishes in

only 75 percent of cases.



II.    Empirical Models

       Our modeling strategy and data are similar to those used in Kessler and McClellan

(2002). We model the effects of law changes as differences in time trends across states in the

medical care of elderly Medicare decedents during the eleven-year period 1985-1995. We

measure five medical care outcomes for patients at the EOL: the location of death (in or out of

acute care hospital), whether the patient had an acute care hospital stay in the month before

death, whether the patient had a nonacute care (mainly skilled nursing) stay in the month before

death, the natural logarithm of acute care hospital expenditures in the last month of life

conditional on having an acute care stay, and the natural logarithm of nonacute care expenditures

in the last month of life conditional on having a nonacute care stay. We specify these outcomes

as nonparametric functions of patient demographic characteristics; state-level legal, political, and


                                                 8
health-care market characteristics; and state- and time-fixed-effects.

         While this strategy fundamentally involves differences-in-differences (DD) between

reforming and nonreforming states to identify effects, we modify conventional DD estimation

strategies in several ways. First, as noted above, our models include few restrictive parametric

or distributional assumptions about functional forms. Second, we allow law reforms to have

dynamic effects on treatment decisions. We separately estimate the effect of law reforms for

individuals who died shortly after the adoption of an advance directive law versus long after

adoption of a relevant law.

         We use a panel-data framework with observations on successive cohorts of decedents. In

state s = 1...S during year t = 1...T, our observational units consist of individuals I=1...Nst who

died. Each patient has observable characteristics Xist, including race, gender, and age, which we

describe as a fully-interacted set of binary variables, as well as many unobservable

characteristics that also influence their course of medical treatment. The individual receives

treatment of Rist in the month before death, where R denotes one of the five measures discussed

above.

         We define state laws affecting advance directives and health care surrogacy in effect at

the time of each individual’s death with four categorical variables. We classify each state as

having adopted or not adopted one of two types of laws: laws enhancing physicians’ and

hospitals’ incentives for compliance with advance directives, and laws requiring delegation of

treatment decision-making in the absence of an advance directive. Some laws enhancing

incentives for compliance simply state that advance treatment directives of an approved form are

legally binding; others specify civil and/or criminal penalties for physician disregard of a valid


                                                  9
advance directive; others specify conditions under which a physician can refuse to comply with

an advance directive; others provide a liability waiver for actions arising out of good-faith

compliance with an advance directive. Laws requiring delegation of treatment decisions to a

health care surrogate in the absence of an advance directive generally specify the conditions

under which and the individuals from whom a physician or hospital must seek guidance for

treatment of a dying patient. Table 1 specifies which states require delegation of treatment

decisions (by the end of our study period, all states had adopted laws providing incentives for

compliance with advance directives) and when each state adopted each type of law.

        To distinguish long-term from short-term effects of law reforms, we estimate dynamic

models that separate the effect of reforms soon after and long after their adoption. We define

L1st=1 if state s adopted a law enhancing incentives for compliance with advance directives

between 1986 and 1995, but no more than two years before the patient’s year t death (i.e., in year

t through t-2), L2st=1 if state s adopted such a law in year t-3 or before (three or more years

before the patient’s death), L3st=1 if state s adopted a law requiring delegation of treatment

decision-making to a specified health care surrogate between 1986 and 1995, but no more than

two years before the patient’s death, and L4st=1 if state s adopted a law requiring delegation of

treatment decision-making to a specified health care surrogate between 1986 and 1995 three or

more years before the patient’s death.

        We first estimate linear models of the following form:


                                                                                                            (1)


where 2t is a time fixed-effect, "s is a state fixed-effect, Rist and Xist are defined as above, Wst is a


                                                   10
vector of variables described in Kessler and McClellan (1996) which summarize the legal-

political environment of the state over time,1 Lst = [L1st, ..., L4st] is a 4-dimensional binary vector

describing the existence of law reforms, Mst is a vector of other market environment controls,2

and vist is an error term with E(vist | Xist, Lst, Wst, Mst) = 0.

        Because legal reforms may affect both the level and the growth rate of expenditures, we

estimate different baseline time trends 2t for states adopting in 1985 or earlier each of the four

types of law reforms that we study (since our models include state fixed effects, we can not

estimate the effect of such reforms on the level of utilization). We allow the time trend in

utilization and location of death to vary after versus before January 1, 1990 for decedents from

states adopting laws enhancing incentives for compliance with advance directives in 1985 or

earlier, and for decedents from states adopting health care surrogate laws in 1985 or earlier.

        We also examine the effect of law reforms separately for certain subgroups of patients

that reforms are likely to affect differently. First, we estimate the effect of laws separately for

patients dying from cancer, because the risk of fatality and lack of acuity associated with many

cancers mean that EOL care decisions are explicitly considered by such patients (e.g.,

Steinhauser et al. 2000). Second, we examine the differential impact of laws by patients’ level of

educational attainment. More educated patients may be more likely to have the resources that

enable them to affect their EOL care. But even if they do, laws may have greater or lesser

        Mst includes controls for three binary variables capturing whether the state’s managed

effects for more educated patients, depending on the effectiveness of laws as a substitute for or

complement to patients’ private efforts. Models that interact laws with patients’ education are

of the form:

                                                                                     (2)



where Eist is a vector of two variables denoting the proportion of individuals in patient i’s

demographic cell who graduated from high school or who had missing educational attainment

(omitted group includes patients with less than high school education; see description below of

how Eist is constructed). In these models, we also allow the different baseline time trends 2t for

states adopting reforms in 1985 or earlier to vary by patients’ educational attainment.



III.   Data

       The data used in our study come from three principal sources. First, we use

comprehensive longitudinal Medicare claims data for a 20 percent random sample of the vast

majority of elderly beneficiaries who died in the years 1985-1995 (death dates are based on

death reports validated by the Social Security Administration). We exclude patients in

Medicare HMOs (reliable individual-level treatment information on such individuals was not

available until recently). Data on patient demographic characteristics were obtained from the

Health Care Financing Administration’s HISKEW enrollment files. Measures of both acute and

nonacute hospital expenditures were obtained by adding up all hospital reimbursements

(including copayments and deductibles not paid by Medicare) from insurance claims for all

treatments in the month preceding each patient’s death. These expenditures reflect variation in


                                                 12
actual resource use even under the DRG-based Medicare Prospective Payment System, since the

provision of intensive treatments, very costly stays, transfers, and readmissions for acute care

and nonacute care (“rehabilitation”) all lead to higher hospital expenditures. We use claims data

to identify if patients’ date of death was during a Medicare acute hospital stay.

       Second, we match to this data information on patients’ educational attainment and cause-

of-death from the National Center for Health Statistics Public Use Multiple Cause of Death for

ICD-9 file, which contains information from every death certificate recorded in the U.S.,

including the ICD-9 code(s) denoting underlying cause of death and any other (secondary) cause

of death. The NCHS data also contains information on the decedent’s educational attainment

(for 1986 and later; educational attainment is missing for all decedents for 1985) and

demographic information including age at death, race, sex, year, month and day of death (day of

week only after 1990), and state of birth. We use demographic information from the NCHS data

to construct demographic cells for decedents that describe the distribution of possible actual

causes of death and educational attainment for Medicare beneficiaries that share similar

demographic characteristics, imputing the state of birth from the Medicare identifier. This

enables us to identify the cause of death of 63% of our sample of Medicare decedents. Of the

remaining 37%, we first seek to choose from the set of possible NCHS causes given the

decedent’s demographics that cause that represents the plurality of inpatient expenditures in the

two years prior to death. This enables us to identify the cause of death of an additional 8% of

decedents. Of the remaining 29%, we seek to assign the cause that represents the plurality of

inpatient expenditures in the two years prior to death. This enables us to identify the cause of

death of an additional 24%. The remaining 5% have an unspecified cause. We define Eist as the


                                                13
proportion of individuals in patient i’s demographic cell who had less than high school

education, who graduated from high school, or who had missing educational attainment. In

other work (Shearer et al. 2002), we describe this matching process and our validation of it in

greater detail.

        Third, we match patient data with information on annual managed care enrollment rates

by state from InterStudy Publications, a division of Decision Resources, Inc. Managed care

enrollment excludes patients enrolled in preferred provider organizations (which are effectively a

form of discounted FFS insurance); point-of-service plans that are not subject to state HMO

regulation; and plans that are self-insured by employers, even if they are administered by a

MCO. Enrollment rates were calculated by dividing the number of enrollees (exclusive of

Medicare supplementary enrollees) by the population. We control for managed care enrollment

because it may change over time and affect the treatment decisions of Medicare patients through

spillover effects (e.g., Baker 1999).

        Table 2 describes our random samples of elderly decedents from 1985, 1990 and 1995.

Table 2 demonstrates some of the well-known trends in the medical care for the elderly over this

period. Over the period, patients were increasingly less likely to die in an acute care hospital (or

have an acute care hospital stay in the last month of life), but conditional on an stay, were treated

much more intensively, such that acute care hospital expenditures conditional on a stay for

patients in the last month of life grew in real terms at 2.8 (=1.3501/11 - 1) percent per year.

Because reimbursement given treatment choice for Medicare patients did not increase over this

period (McClellan 1997), these expenditure trends are attributable to increases in intensity of

treatment. Provision of nonacute services through Medicare in the last month of life became


                                                  14
both much more common – more than doubling in frequency from 6.4 percent of decedents in

1985 to fully 15 percent of decedents in 1995 – and more intensive conditional on a nonacute

stay. Table 2 also shows how the laws governing EOL care changed over the study period. In

1985, only 62.6 percent of decedents resided in a state that provided doctors and hospitals with

explicit incentives to comply with advance directives, but by 1995, all states had adopted such a

law. Over this period, states also adopted laws requiring delegation of treatment decision-

making to specified parties in the absence of an advance directive: in 1985, only 23.4 percent of

decedents resided in a state that required delegation, but by 1995, 53.3 percent of decedents were

subject to such a law.



IV.    Results

       Table 3 presents estimates of parameters from equation (1), the effects of laws governing

treatment at the end of life on the location of death and intensity of medical care in the last

month of life. We present standard errors corrected for heteroscedasticity and for within

state/time group correlation in vist . The top panel of the table shows that laws enhancing

incentives for compliance with advance directives lead to statistically significant changes in

patients’ location of death. Decedents from states adopting laws 3 or more years prior to their

death enhancing incentives for compliance are .76 percentage points less likely (significant at the

10 percent level) to die in an acute care hospital. On a 1995 base probability of dying in an acute

setting of 32.8 percent (table 2), this amounts to a 2.3 percent decline. The effect of these laws

on the probability of an acute care hospital stay in the month and year before death is smaller,

consistent with the laws having the greatest impact on patients who are nearest to death. The


                                                 15
second column of the top panel of the table shows that laws enhancing compliance lead to a

(statistically insignificant) .51 percentage point decline in the probability of an acute care

hospital stay in the month before death; estimates not in table 3 show that such laws lead to a

(statistically insignificant) .33 percentage point decline in the probability of an acute care

hospital stay in the year before death. The long-run effect of these laws on the level of acute

care expenditures in the last month of life conditional an acute care stay is positive but

statistically insignificant.

        The bottom panel of table 3 presents estimates of the effect of laws requiring delegation

of treatment decision-making in the absence of an advance directive. Laws requiring delegation

of treatment decision-making lead uniformly to more acute and fewer nonacute hospital services

for decedents. Those who died in a state requiring delegation were 0.76 percentage points more

likely to die in an acute care hospital, for decedents from states adopting such laws 3 or more

years before their death. Laws requiring delegation also lead to increases in both the probability

of an acute care hospital stay at any time in the last month of life and to increases in the

magnitude of acute care expenditures, conditional on a hospital stay. In contrast, laws requiring

delegation led to substantially less frequent nonacute stays -- in the long run, 1.76 percentage

points fewer. Given that 25 percent of all decedents had a nonacute stay in the last year of life in

1995 (table 2), this effect is substantial. Table 3 shows that laws governing treatment at the EOL

-- both those enhancing incentives for compliance with advance directives and those requiring

delegation of treatment decision-making in the absence of an advance directive -- take time to

reach their full effect. In general, the effect of such laws is larger and more precisely estimated

for laws in place at least 3 years prior to the individual’s death.

0.0523*0.748)*1995 average acute care expenditures of $10,115 (table 2)) and long-run

decreases in nonacute care expenditures of $10 (= (.00825 - .0425*0.25)*1995 average nonacute

care expenditures of $4,007 (table 2)), for a net positive effect of $335 per decedent. Laws

requiring delegation of treatment decision-making lead to long-run increases in acute care

expenditures of $494 (=(.00979 +.0522*0.748)*10,115) and long-run decreases in nonacute care

expenditures of $115 (=(-.0176 + .0446*.25)*4,007), for a net positive effect of $379 per

decedent.

       Table 4 presents estimates of parameters from equation (1) obtained only on patients who

died from cancer. First, the table shows that the long-run effect of laws enhancing compliance

with advance directives on the location of death is almost twice as large for cancer decedents as

for the entire population of decedents -- a 1.38 percentage point reduction in the probability of

dying in an acute care hospital as compared to a .76 percentage point reduction (table 3). The

long-run effect of such laws on the probability of receiving nonacute care for cancer decedents is

almost twice as large as well -- a 1.65 percentage point increase as compared to a .83 percentage

point increase. However, the long-run effect of laws requiring delegation on the probability of

dying in an acute care hospital is smaller in magnitude for cancer decedents, and statistically

insignificant.

       These effects lead both types of laws to have smaller (but still positive) net effects on

Medicare expenditures for cancer decedents. Laws enhancing incentives for compliance with


                                                17
advance directives lead to long-run increases in acute care expenditures of $173 ( = (-.0106 +

0.0370*0.748)*1995 average acute care expenditures of $10,115) and in nonacute care

expenditures of $18 (= (.0164 - .0446*0.25)*1995 average nonacute care expenditures of

$4,007), for a net positive effect of $191 per decedent. Laws requiring delegation of treatment

decision-making lead to long-run increases in acute care expenditures of $232 (=(.00297

+.0267*0.748)*10,115) and long-run decreases in nonacute care expenditures of $90 (=(-.0203 -

.0086*.25)*4,007), for a net positive effect of $142 per decedent.

        Table 5 presents estimates of equation (2), and shows that the effect of laws governing

care at the EOL differ by decedents’ level of educational attainment. On one hand, the effects of

laws enhancing compliance with advance directives are greater for less educated patients.

Patients with less than a high-school education from states adopting laws enhancing incentives

are 1.88 percentage points less likely to die in an acute care hospital; this effect is half as large (=

-1.88 + .93) and statistically insignificant for patients with a high school education or greater.

On the other hand, the effects of laws requiring delegation of treatment decision-making in the

absence of an advance directive are greater for more educated patients. Patients with a high-

school education or greater from states adopting laws requiring delegation are .73 percentage

points statistically significantly more likely to die in an acute care hospital than are their

counterparts with less than a high-school education; the negative effect of laws requiring

delegation on the probability of a nonacute stay in the last month of life is statistically

significantly larger for more educated patients as well.



V.      Conclusion


                                                  18
        Can public policy play a constructive role in the management of health care at the EOL?

At least in theory, state law specifies the process by which physicians and hospitals consider the

input of patients (through patients’ written advance directives) and their families or guardians (in

the absence of an applicable advance directive) in treatment decision-making. Proponents of

laws enhancing providers’ incentives for compliance with patients’ advance directives argue that

the formal processes established by such laws improve patient autonomy and save money by

reducing unwanted, unproductive EOL treatments. However, in practice, substantial clinical

evidence suggests that laws may not be the only, or even the most important, determinant of care

in this context. Important concerns over inappropriate limitation of care for dying patients

further contributes to the theoretical ambiguity of the welfare consequences of laws guiding EOL

care.

        Yet, surprisingly little work has sought to evaluate the effects of such laws on patients’

care. In this paper, we assess empirically the consequences of two types of laws – laws

enhancing incentives for compliance with advance directives, and laws requiring the

appointment of a health care surrogate – on care at the EOL. Based on an analysis of Medicare

claims data, matched with Social Security death records, we estimate the effect of variation

across states and over time in these laws on the location of patients’ death and the care received

at the EOL. To investigate whether such laws have different effects on different types of

patients, we match information on cause of death and educational attainment from the National

Center for Health Statistics Public Use Multiple Cause of Death for ICD-9 file.

        We find that the laws that we study have a significant influence on patients’ EOL care.

First, laws enhancing incentives for compliance significantly reduce the probability of dying in


                                                 19
an acute care hospital. However, they do not lead to any net savings in medical expenditures.

Although laws lead to a reduction in expenditures through a reduction in the probability of an

acute care hospital stay, they also lead to a more-than-offsetting increase in expenditures

conditional on an acute care stay. On net, such laws lead to a net average increase in total

hospital expenditures in the last month of life of $335, or about 2.4 percent of the 1995 average

of $14,122. Laws requiring delegation of treatment decisions in the absence of an advance

directive significantly increase the probability of an acute care hospital stay and significantly

decrease the probability of a nonacute care hospital stay in the last month of life. Laws requiring

delegation also have a positive effect on average expenditures in the last month of life, of $379

per decedent.

        Second, we find that laws enhancing incentives for compliance lead to almost twice as

large of a reduction in the probability of dying in an acute care hospital for patients dying from

cancer, consistent the laws having a larger causal effect for patients for whom EOL care

decisions are particularly important. In addition, we find the expenditure-increasing effect of the

laws is smaller for cancer decedents than for the average decedent, largely because the laws have

approximately half as large an effect on the volume of acute care hospital services that cancer

decedents receive.

        Third, we find that the effect of laws governing EOL treatment differ depending on a

patient’s educational attainment. The effects of laws enhancing compliance with advance

directives are greater for less educated patients, but the effects of laws requiring delegation of

treatment decision-making in the absence of an advance directive are greater for more educated

patients.


                                                 20
       These changes in patterns of care are consistent with some of the previous clinical

literature on the effects of advance directives. Advance directives are not simply a device for

the refusal of treatment. Although surveys find that treatment refusals are the most common

preference expressed in an advance directive, they are not the only one: indeed, for some

illnesses, surveyed patients’ preferences were almost evenly split between a directive to supply

and a directive to withhold intensive treatment (Emanuel 1991). Clinical studies have also

suggested that surrogates systematically opt for more intensive treatment than patients prefer.

Layde et al. (1995) find among seriously ill patients favoring resuscitation, only 16 percent of

health care surrogates misconstrued patients’ wishes, but that among patients who did not want

to be resuscitated, 50 percent of surrogates misconstrued patients’ wishes.

       These results highlight several important remaining research questions. In particular,

unless patients receive too little acute and too much nonacute care at the EOL, the results suggest

that laws requiring delegation of treatment decision-making in the absence of an advance

directive do not improve the alignment of EOL treatment with patient preferences -- particularly

for more educated patients. This may be due to the fact that more educated patients have more

educated surrogates, who are better able to convince medical care providers of the patient’s

perceived wishes. Further clinical or experimental investigation of programs to encourage

communication between patients and their surrogates (e.g., Hare 1992), or of alternative health

care surrogacy laws that provide incentives for surrogates to engage in such communication, has

the potential to enhance patient autonomy and conserve health care resources.
