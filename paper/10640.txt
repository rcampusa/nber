This paper explores recent trends in the size of scientific teams and in institutional collaborations.
The data derive from 2.4 million scientific papers written in 110 leading U.S. research universities
over the period 1981-1999. We measure team size by the number of authors on a scientific paper.
Using this measure we find that team size increases by 50 percent over the 19-year period. We
supplement team size with measures of domestic and foreign institutional collaborations, which
capture the geographic dispersion of team workers. The time series evidence suggests that the trend
towards larger and more dispersed teams accelerates at the start of the 1990s. This acceleration
suggests a sudden decline in the cost of collaboration, perhaps due to improvements in
telecommunications. Using a panel of top university departments we find that private universities
and departments whose scientists have earned prestigious awards participate in larger teams, as do
departments that have larger amounts of federal funding. Placement of former graduate students is
a key determinant of institutional collaborations, especially collaborations with firms and foreign
scientific institutions. Finally, the evidence indicates that scientific influence increases with team
size and institutional collaborations. Since increasing team size implies an increase in the division
of labor, these results suggest that scientific productivity increases with the scientific division of
labor.

    I.        Introduction

    Over the past century teams of scientific specialists have largely replaced the independent scientist,

much as corporate R&D laboratories have largely replaced the independent inventor. This trend towards

larger teams is strongly evident in nearly all data on scientific research, including our own1. Advancing

instrumentation and the sheer quantity of what there is to know have pushed it, while improving

communications have pulled it, to its present state of development. Pencil-and-paper research is the lone

exception to the rule, but this forms a dwindling share of science and may at last succumb to the same

forces that have elsewhere led to large-scale research.

    The study of scientific teams is important, first, because it brings to light changes in the research

production function that otherwise would remain hidden. In particular, scientific collaboration might

increase the effectiveness of research, just as specialization increases general productive efficiency2. The

evidence on efficiency is suggestive but not definitive. Collaborative research is more highly cited

(Presser, 1980; Sauer, 1988), suggesting that collaboration does raise quality. But more able researchers

also attract more coworkers (Zuckerman and Merton, 1973) so that separating efficiency from talent in a

cross-section is not easy. Still, the size of scientific teams has increased steadily with time, so that growth

in capital, knowledge, and communications could be responsible for the rising propensity to collaborate

even as talent has remained about the same.

    A second reason why collaboration is important lies in its role as a channel of knowledge flows

between scientists. And since collaborators are increasingly found in different institutions and countries,

the entire subject is relevant to the tendency for knowledge to flow more readily and over greater distances

than ever before.

    In this paper we present findings on the size of scientific teams, institutional collaborations, and the

geographic dispersion of team workers, using a large database that covers most of U.S. academic science

1
  See Zuckerman and Merton (1973), De Solla Price (1986), and Hicks and Katz (1996), for trends in the
size of scientific teams since 1900. Weiner (1994), writing about mid-century, strongly disapproves of the
notion that corporate R&D laboratories might supplant individual researchers and inventors. And yet
Mowery and Rosenberg (1998, Ch. 2) describes exactly this process of replacement.
2
  The form of the research production function is central to the properties of growth models, as a
comparison between Romer (1990) and Jones (1995) reveals. Thus the findings of this paper could prove
indirectly relevant to growth theory.
during the years 1981-1999. Our analysis begins with the description of trends in scientific teams and

collaborations at the level of individual scientific papers, which are observations at the piece-work level.

Afterwards, in the context of a panel of universities and fields observed over time, we examine the

determinants of team size and institutional collaboration, as well as their consequences for research output.

    The descriptive findings include the following. The data confirm that team size has increased by about

50 percent during the last two decades of the 20th century. We also find that the trend towards larger teams

accelerated, rising from a 2.19 percent annual rate of growth in the 1980s to a 2.57 percent rate during the

1990s. This is an acceleration of 17 percent (2.57/2.19 – 1) between the 1980s and the 1990s. We also

study geographic dispersion directly, using a mileage indicator for the top 110 U.S. universities that form

the core of our data. The annual rate of growth in mileage rises from 3.53 percent in the 1980s to 4.45

percent in the 1990s, an acceleration of 29 percent.

    During the same period of time the rate of domestic collaboration more than doubled between U.S.

universities, and between U.S. universities and U.S. firms. Foreign collaborations, while not as common,

increased five-fold. Of all regions, collaboration with Asia increased most rapidly, followed by Europe,

with other regions trailing by a considerable margin. These differences reflect differences in the growth of

scientific research by region of the world. Also, foreign collaboration accelerated between the 1980s and

1990s. The foreign share in institutional collaborations rose annually by 5.11 percent during the 1980s, but

by 7.41 percent during the 1990s. Thus, growth accelerates by 45 percent (7.41/5.11 – 1).

    In additional work we address factors that promote or deter teams and collaborations. This analysis is

carried out using a panel of 12 main sciences in the top 110 U.S. universities. Hence, the observations are

at the level of university-fields over time. Our results include the following: a larger stock of federally

funded R&D, private control of a university, and the number of prestigious awards increase team size.

Collaboration with other U.S. universities is an increasing function of the stock of R&D, private control,

and the number of recent PhDs placed in other top 110 schools. Collaboration with foreign institutions of

science is found to increase with the stock of R&D, private control, the number of prestigious awards, and

with the number of recent PhDs placed in leading research countries. Here the results are more fragile, and

there is evidence that the stock of R&D and private control trade places with the number of prestigious

awards. In addition we examine collaboration with U.S. firms, finding again that R&D and private control



                                                       2
to an extent increase joint scientific research with firms. But in this case, prestigious awards decrease

collaboration with firms, probably because the emphasis of universities earning such awards is on basic

rather than applied research. As with foreign collaboration, placement of recent PhDs with industries

proves to be very powerful in determining collaboration between universities and firms. The greater

importance of PhD placements in the case of foreign and corporate collaborations than in university

collaborations is consistent with the greater scarcity of substitutes for former PhDs in foreign and corporate

environments.

    The empirical work concludes with a study of the role of team size and collaboration in the

determination of research output as measured by papers and citations. The papers and citations are

“fractionated,” in that they consist of estimated proportions that a university and field contribute to both.

We find that papers and especially citations increase with team size, but that the role of shares of

institutional affiliations in the production of papers is less clear. Universities that collaborate more with

foreign institutions, and especially other top 110 schools, produce fewer papers, holding team size constant.

On the other hand collaboration with foreign institutions and other top 110 schools is linked to an increase

in total citations, so that a trade off of fewer papers in return for larger overall scientific influence appears

to be taking place.

    The rest of this paper consists of six sections. Section II reviews the literature and models the

determinants of scientific teams and institutional collaborations. Section III describes the database and

calculations that we have undertaken using it. Section IV presents time series evidence on scientific teams.

Section V compares trends in collaborative behavior across scientific disciplines. Section VI provides

regression evidence on the determinants of team size and institutional collaboration using a panel of

university-fields. Section VII concludes.

    II.       Analytical Framework
    The economics literature on teams is both theoretical and empirical. One line of theoretical work

examines the problem of free-riding and proposes incentive schemes that punish shirking (Holmstrom,

1982; Kandel and Lazear, 1992). Other research examines the relationship between specialization, team

size, and the extent of the market (Becker, 1985; Becker and Murphy, 1992), while still more research

(Rosen, 1982) looks at the role of managerial talent in determining the size of firm and its work force using

an efficient supervision model.

    Recent empirical research on teams in steel mills by Ichniowski, Shaw and Pennushi (1997) finds that

innovative management practices that promote cooperation in teams and offer pay incentives increase

productivity in steel mini-mills over traditional management practices that tend to limit worker

responsibility. Other empirical research examines institutional collaborations in science and technology

(Arora and Gambardella, 1990; Mowery, 1992; Powell, 1996; Stephan and Levin, 2000; Zucker, Darby,

and Armstrong, 2001; Adams, Chiang and Starkey, 2001; Adams, 2002; Adams, Chiang, and Jensen, 2003;

Adams, 2003, forthcoming; and Adams and Marcu, 2004). These papers tend to find that institutional

collaboration is related to the complementarity of skills, often abetted by policy and by the increasing

complexity of scientific problems.

    The present paper concerns small teams of co-workers in scientific research. However, owing to the

location of team members in different scientific institutions, the paper is concerned as well with

institutional collaborations. In our analysis we abstract from free-riding and supervision because the

system of reward for priority in discovery severely punishes shirking by team members and rewards good

work with publication, reputation, and income. Our analysis is inextricably connected, though, with

specialization, the division of labor, and the location of team members, because these factors play large

roles in the empirical analysis and influence the efficiency of scientific research.

    In the following exposition we assume that scientific research yields satisfaction to investigators, but

we suppose that this gain in utility is insufficient for investigators to self-finance their research. We base

this assumption on the rarity of scientific research in societies that lack government or private support for

science. But if self-finance is ruled out, then it follows that the quantity of research is subject to a research

budget constraint that is externally imposed, though the budget is of course responsive to grant-raising

efforts3. In conformity with the empirical work below, and with the perception that skill, specialization,

and the division of labor are inter-related and essential elements in the formation of scientific teams, we

assume that the decision variables are the skill of team workers s , the size of the team n , and distance, or



3
 In the analysis we assume that the research budget R is at a maximum with respect to grant-raising
efforts.


                                                        4
geographic dispersion D 4. Geographic dispersion exceeds zero if and only if the team involves

institutional collaboration so that D is an indicator of such collaboration.

      Research output Q is produced according to a Cobb-Douglas production function of skill and team

size. Therefore,

(1)                Q = As α n β ,

The exponents obey the inequalities 0 < α < 1, 0 < β < 1, α + β < 1 so that production is subject to

decreasing returns to scale. The parameter A represents total factor productivity. It could represent the

university environment and the ability or eminence of faculties that are matched to these environments in

advance of the formation of scientific teams. A also undergoes independent increases as knowledge

expands, because knowledge is a factor of production that is fixed with respect to individual researchers. In

turn A tends to increase skill and team size. Thus, “complexity” of projects can be viewed as an indicator

for knowledge and other sources of total factor productivity of the knowledge production function that give

larger teams an increasing advantage. It has been suggested to us that sociological “norms” of scientific

fields have changed in favor of larger teams. However, another interpretation is that larger and higher-

skilled teams are more efficient as knowledge increases, so that norms are simply a reflection of efficiency

rather than an independent causal factor that increases the division of scientific labor. And besides all the

above, the increasing emphasis by funding agencies on team awards involving large grants and multiple

scientific institutions is consistent with the advantages of larger teams as driven by A in this framework.

         On the cost side we assume that the research budget R must cover wage costs of all team

members, as well as a fixed cost F that depends on dispersion of team workers, representing coordination

costs. Of course, geographic dispersion entails benefits as well as costs. In part the gain derives from the

additional funding that can be secured, as the evidence presented below on international and firm-university

collaboration suggests. This is the productive role of dispersion in the present analysis. The research

budget constraint is:


4
 We abstract from the idea that skill and distance could be inter-related as in s = s (D ), s′ > 0, s′′ < 0 . This
constraint would be relevant if abilities were noticeably scarce within a given distance. The analysis in the
paper could easily be extended to deal with this complicating factor.



                                                         5
(2)                R (D ) = w(s ) n + F (D )

The amount of funding is a concave function of distance, so that

(3)                R′ > 0, R′′ < 0 ,

Thus the returns to dispersion are diminishing. Below we allow for both a shift in funding and also of the

sensitivity of funding to distance or dispersion, which are plausible elements that could alter institutional

collaborations. For example, funding could increase as a result of prior awards. In addition an increase in

the urban density of universities would tend to increase the sensitivity of funding to distance. In (2) the

wage rate w is an increasing and convex function of skill, as in the phenomenon of “superstars” (Rosen,

1981). This yields the following properties of the wage function:

(4)                w′ > 0, w′′ > 0 .

We suppose that the fixed cost F , which represents coordination costs, is an increasing function of

distance D owing to the difficulty of meeting and communicating which this imposes. Therefore, the

properties of the fixed cost function are

(5)                F ′ > 0, F ′′ > 0 .

Thus, coordination costs are an increasing function of distance. As in the case of funding R , changes in

the fixed costs of scientific teams are plausible and realistic features of cross-sectional and time series data.

Fixed costs and their sensitivity to geographic dispersion tend to decline over time with improvements in

telecommunications. F tends to decrease with prior investments in team workers, especially graduate

students, which make working at a distance less costly. This is likely to be a potent factor in both cross-

sectional data, where universities with larger, more highly ranked graduate programs are more prone to

engage in institutional collaborations; and in time series data, due to the growth of graduate programs over

time.

         The problem is one of maximizing output (1) subject to the research budget constraint (2) and their

properties as expressed in (3)-(5), where the control variables are skill s , team size n , and distance D .

The Lagrangian function for this problem is

(6)                L = Asα n β + λ [R(D ) − w(s ) n − F (D )]

First order conditions for (6) are



                                                         6

                   ∂s    s
                   ∂L β Q
                      =       − λw = 0

                      = R − wn − F = 0
                   ∂λ

Optimal amounts of skill and team size are assumed to exceed zero, so that the first two expressions are

equalities. The third expression of (7) is for the moment left as an inequality, to suggest that if funding is

sufficiently unresponsive to dispersion, then D equals zero and institutional collaboration does not occur.

However, consider the case where D > 0 , so that variations in all three of the controls are allowed. The

second order conditions that ensure a maximum for this problem are that the determinants of the bordered

Hessian of the Lagrangian alternate in sign:

                                                    Lss     Lsn       0   L sλ

For exceptionally clear statements of these conditions see Chiang (1974, Section 12.3) or Dixit (1990,

Chapter 7). Using this information and the method of comparative statics we can show that skill s and team

size n tend to increase with productivity A . To see this form the displacement system of (7),

Solving (9) for changes in the control variables and pre-multiplying by the transposed shift vector yields

of funding to distance D , or a decrease in sensitivity of fixed costs F causes an increase in D and in

institutional collaborations. Finally, an exogenous increase in funding R , perhaps due to past awards, will

tend to increase team size and skill. These implications tend to fit rather well the results that we report in

section VI below.

    III. Database of Scientific Papers

    The data set consists of 2.4 million scientific papers that were published during 1981-1999 and have at

least one author from a set of leading U.S. universities. These “top 110” universities account for most of

U.S. academic research. The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia is the source of the

data. All papers belong to a standard set of communications consisting of articles, reviews, notes, and

proceedings. The specific source is ISI’s Current Contents data base5.

      The papers are assigned to fields according to a classification of the journal in which they appear.

This classification system consists of 88 academic fields. In order to link the paper data to the 12 main

sciences in the National Science Foundation (NSF) CASPAR database, we assign each of the 88 fields to

one of the 12 main fields6. The Appendix lists the 110 universities, ranked by their R&D funding in 1998.

Table 1 shows the 12 main NSF sciences and their components made up of the 88 ISI sub-fields.

    As noted in the introduction, we use the data both at the paper level and at the level of university-

fields. At the paper level we compile time trends and cross-sectional patterns by field and year. The data

record date of publication, scientific fields of journals in which the papers appear, institutional affiliation of

authors, address information on city, state, and country; and author names as well as number of authors7.

    It is important for the reader to see that the address information is completely separate from author

information, so that a name cannot be assigned to a location at this time. The address information is

nevertheless useful in its own right. Besides the top 110 universities the addresses identify U.S. and


5
  The journal set consists of approximately 5500 journals that were active in 1999, as well as about 1600
inactive journals that were cited in currently active periodicals.
6
  The 12 fields are: agriculture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences,
economics and business, engineering, mathematics and statistics, medicine, physics, and psychology.
7
  There is no limit at this time on the number of authors in the ISI data. The maximum number in our
sample is 210, while the mean number in the paper-level data is 2.36. Notice that the number of authors
underestimates the number of team members when it excludes contributors, such as research assistants. It is
an overestimate when it includes honorific authors. In short, the number of authors measures the size of
scientific teams with error. This error is unavoidable since we lack any other measure of team size.


                                                        8
foreign institutions consisting of other universities and colleges; governments and government research

institutes; medical centers; corporations; and all other institutions8. We use the addresses to construct

fractions of scientific papers written in one or more of the top 1109.

    We also construct numbers and shares of institutional addresses contributed by different types of

institutions as rough estimates of the location of team workers. Within the U.S. the institutional types

consist of (a) U.S. Government, (b) Other U.S. Universities, (c) U.S. Corporations, (d) U.S. Medical

Centers, and (e) All Other U.S. Institutions. Outside the U.S. the institutional types consist of (a) Foreign

Governments, (b) Foreign Universities, and (c) All Other Foreign Institutions, including by country. As we

have seen, this information allows us to assign fractions of papers to different institutional classes as well

as to provide indicators of the proportional contribution by each class.

    Table 2 reports the distribution of scientific papers by the 12 main science fields. The table includes

the years 1981, 1990, and 1999 and all years, showing which fields gain share and which lose. Among the

life sciences, which dominate the data, biology gains while agriculture loses. Among the physical sciences

astronomy and physics gain share. Perhaps not surprisingly, among the mathematical sciences, computer

science gains share and mathematics and statistics lose share. Engineering increases its share. And finally,

the social and behavioral sciences perceptibly lose share.

    We use paper-level statistics for the descriptive work in sections IV and V, because this retains the

means and standard deviations of the original data. In section VI we carry out regression analysis of the

determinants of team size, domestic and foreign collaboration, and research “output”. For this purpose we

construct a panel at the level of universities, fields and years. The reason is that the panel allows us to

combine the ISI papers and citations data with information on university-field level R&D and

characteristics of doctoral programs. The NSF CASPAR database of universities, a compendium of NSF

surveys, is the source of the data on university R&D. The National Research Council 1993 Survey of

Doctoral Programs (NRC, 1995) includes characteristics of graduate programs, especially counts of Nobel

8
  About 5% of the addresses could not be assigned.
9
  The fractions are ½, ½ in the case of two institutions, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 for three institutions, and so on. The
cumulative distribution of the number of top 110 institutions per paper is as follows, with number of
institutions in parentheses: 79.6% (1 institution), 96.8% (2 institutions or less), 98.3% (3 institutions or
less), and 99.5% (4 institutions or less). Of course, these are extremely crude indicators of contributions
because they do not include time and effort by team members, nor do they differentiate among types of
effort. In short, the institutional address fractions do not measure labor input, even though we use them to
attribute output to scientific institutions.


                                                       9
prizes and other prestigious awards, as well as rankings of quality of PhD programs in 1993. Finally,

microdata from the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) provide us with estimates of the migration of

PhD students to the academic and industrial sectors of the U.S. economy, as well as to other countries10.

     We impose one other constraint on the panel which does not apply to the paper-level data. We consider

only leading departments out of the top 110. All other schools form a remainder cell within each field.

More precisely, we include the top 25 universities in astronomy plus a remainder, the top 50 universities in

agriculture, chemistry, computer science, economics and business, earth sciences, mathematics and

statistics, physics, and psychology, plus one remainder each. And finally we include the top 75 universities

in biology, medicine, and engineering plus remainders for each of these three fields. Summing across

fields, and accounting for the fact that only 48 schools of agriculture formally exist, the panel data consist

of 660 university-fields in any given year. Our purpose in breaking out fewer individual schools in smaller

fields, and more in larger fields, is to avoid large numbers of empty cells for universities in which fields

(and doctoral programs) are small or non-existent11. The result is a panel of 12,540 observations, before

bad or missing data are excluded, that approximates teams and institutional collaborations of 660

university-fields in 12 main sciences over the 19-year period. This panel includes an array of variables that

are likely to drive teams, collaborations, and research output. We describe the major variables in the panel

data and sources of these variables in section VI, where we consider determinants of team size and

collaboration.

     IV. Time Trends in Scientific Collaborations
     Figures 1-10 display time series of scientific research, team size, and institutional collaboration. All

the graphs refer to the years 1981 to 1999. Figure 1 shows trends in the output of U.S. scientific papers.

The upper line is the sum of all papers having at least one author from a top 110 U.S. university. The

middle line consists of U.S. equivalent papers. By this we mean the fraction of U.S. affiliations in all


10
   The migration data used in this paper represents flows of new PhDs with definite plans at the time of
graduation, so that the destinations that we used are projected as within a few months of graduation. The
data are undercounts since one-third of new PhDs do not have definite plans. Moreover, the data represent
even a greater undercount to industry, since many new PhDs go to industry only after completing their
postdoctoral training.
11
   The size of the remainder of the top 110 equals an average “department” along the individual top 25, 50,
or 75 schools in a field, showing that we miss rather little by our aggregation procedure. This finding
reflects the positive skew of academic programs. For more on this issue see Adams and Griliches (1998).


                                                       10
institutional affiliations on each paper, which is then summed over all papers. The lower line consists of

top 110 paper equivalents. This is the fraction of top 110 affiliations in all affiliations summed over papers.

U.S. and top 110 equivalent papers grow more slowly than total papers. Top 110 equivalents decline by

2.5% as of 1999 compared with the 1995 peak. The increasing spread between papers and their U.S.

equivalents reflects the rising contribution of foreign institutions. This could be seen as beneficial: foreign

institutions produce more of the research and transfer more of their knowledge to the U.S. Or it could be

viewed with pessimism: just remaining in the same place after 1995 seems to have required an increase in

the foreign contribution.

     Figure 2 graphs domestic collaboration with other top 110 schools (left scale) and with the top 200

U.S. R&D firms (right scale)12. While the per paper number of schools and firms grow at roughly the same

rate, growth in collaboration with firms is less rapid in the 1980s and more rapid in the 1990s. This

acceleration in university-firm joint research could represent increasing placement of graduate students

with firms rather than schools, it could be a statement about the success of federal programs designed to

promote joint research, or it could signify a slowdown in industrial support for basic research that leads to

increasing reliance on university collaborators. This last point is consistent with the decline in scientific

papers published in industry since 1991. See National Science Foundation, Science and Engineering

Indicators 2004, Volume II, table 5-36.

     Comparative trends in foreign and total collaborations are the subject of figure 3. Trends in foreign

universities and institutions per paper follow the left scale. The right scale indicates the total of all

institutions. Collaborations with foreign universities and institutions grow more rapidly than institutional

collaboration as a whole, which is consistent with figure 113.

     Figure 4 reveals that growth rates in team size (authors per paper) and institutional collaborations are

about the same. Given that foreign collaborations are growing more rapidly than all collaborations,

domestic collaborations must be growing more slowly than team size. Thus, scientific teams are becoming

more internationalized over time.

12
   We define the number of other top 110 schools as the number of top 110 schools minus one, which
represents the “home” institution. In this way we account for conditioning of the data on membership in the
top 110 universities.
13
   Correcting the total for conditioning on a top 110 university, the total institutions series increases from
0.8 to 2.0, or 2.5 times. Foreign schools per paper increase from 0.07 to 0.32, or more than 4.5 times, while
all foreign affiliations increase from 0.1 to 0.46, which is again more than 4.5 times.


                                                        11
     The next two figures examine trends in foreign collaboration by region of the world from 1981 to

199914. Figure 5 reports counts of foreign addresses per paper. The dominant region for collaboration is

Europe, reflecting the size of the scientific sector in Europe. The countries of South and East Asia come in

second by the end of the period, followed by the rest of the Americas. The rest of the world, composed of

Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania, runs a distant fourth.    Figure 6 brings out more clearly the

differences in growth by region. The figure normalizes each of the series in figure 5 by its 1981 value.

Growth is more rapid in Asia and Europe and slower in the Americas and the rest of the world. This reflects

differences in the growth of scientific resources by region.

     Figures 7 and 8 consider interactions between team size and the foreign share. Figure 7 displays time

paths of the foreign share classified by intervals of team size. The foreign share is greater in larger teams.

International cost-sharing of large-scale projects could lie behind this relationship, for example in the

Human Genome project, in large-scale space missions, and so on. Figure 8 brings out comparative growth

more clearly by again normalizing each of the series in figure 7 by its 1981 value. The graph shows that

smaller teams are becoming more internationalized at a faster rate. Since larger teams are more

internationalized in 1981, this implies convergence in the foreign share by team size.

     Figures 9 and 10 reveal comparative trends in the foreign share by science field. Figure 9 reports time

series of the foreign share in which fields are grouped by their initial 1981 share. The three most

international fields are astronomy, mathematics and statistics; and physics. The three fields that are least

international are agriculture, biology, and medicine. The foreign shares of remaining fields (chemistry,

computer science, earth sciences, economics, engineering, and psychology) fall in the middle. Figure 10

brings out comparative growth more clearly by normalizing each of the series in figure 9 by the 1981 value.

The figure shows that the life sciences are becoming internationalized at the most rapid rate. Since these

fields are the least internationalized at the start, this result again suggests a mild form of convergence in the

foreign shares.



14
  In this figure Europe consists of Western and Eastern Europe as well as the European Soviet Socialist
Republics of the former Soviet Union. Asian countries include Japan, India, China, and other countries of
East and South Asia, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Other countries in
the Americas include Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. Africa, the Middle
East, and Oceania includes Israel (Middle East) and Australia and New Zealand (Oceania), and thus
contains the developed countries in each region.


                                                       12
     V.       Findings on Collaborative Behavior By Field of Science
          We turn now to descriptive findings by field of science and time. We display these in a series of

tables given the number of fields which each chart involves. Table 3 reports team size in 1981, 1990, and

1999, as well as growth in team size across the decades of the 1980s and 1990s. In 10 of 12 fields, growth

occurs more rapidly in the 1990s. This pattern dominates the grand average in the bottom row.

Acceleration in the growth of team size is the rule in these data.

          Table 4 uses a direct measure of distance to explore the geographic dispersion of team members.

Owing to data limitations the analysis is restricted to the top 110 U.S. universities. We assume that the

highest ranked university-field on each paper is the “head” institution and calculate mileages to other top

110 institutions on that paper based on latitude and longitude coordinates15. If only one top 110 institution

participates in a paper then the mileage is zero. Therefore, changes in the mileage statistics depend on

changes in the tendency to work with other top 110 schools. The average mileage on a paper is a direct

measure of geographic dispersion within the system of top 110 schools.

          The table reports mean distances in 1981, 1990, and 1999 and it compares growth rates across

decades. Growth in geographic dispersion is quite clear but acceleration in growth is less obvious. Six of

12 fields show evidence of acceleration (agriculture, chemistry, earth sciences, engineering, physics, and

psychology), the growth of one (biology) is constant, and the remaining five (astronomy, computer science,

economics and business, mathematics and statistics, and medicine) reveal mild deceleration. And yet the

overall pattern is one of growth acceleration. Table 3 reveals an expanding geographic scope of

collaboration within the top 110: mean distances double from 78 miles to 159 miles over the period. And

despite some mixed results, overall growth accelerates across the two decades. On average the rate of

growth in mileage increases from 3.5% in the 1980s to 4.5% in the 1990s.

          Table 5 considers domestic institutional collaboration by field. The table is specifically concerned

with collaborations with other top 110 schools and with top 200 R&D firms. The table reports levels of

collaboration of both kinds in 1981 and 1999 and reports growth over the full period. The table reveals

changes in collaboration within academia as well as between academia and industry. Growth in

  The calculation assumes that the earth is a sphere and calculates distance using the geodesic or shortest
distance between two points on that sphere. For more, see Adams and Jaffe (1996) and Adams (2002).


                                                      13
collaboration within the university sector is general, although it is most rapid in agriculture, biology,

chemistry, and psychology. The situation is quite different in the “between” dimension. There

heterogeneity is the norm: it is the life sciences (agriculture, biology, and medicine) and psychology whose

collaboration with firms expands most rapidly. Industry-university collaboration in more established

industrial-scientific fields (chemistry, computer science, engineering, and physics) grows more slowly. Of

course, the level of collaboration is far higher in these fields than in the life and behavioral sciences.

Astronomy and economics are the only fields where university-firm collaboration declines. All these

patterns are of course driven by changes in the population of industrial scientists in the different disciplines.

         Table 5 allows us to compare growth rates in domestic collaboration across sectors and fields. Let

us define a relative increase in the “outward” dimension of a field as an excess in growth of collaboration

with industry over growth in collaboration with universities. Likewise, let us define a relative increase in

the “inward” dimension as taking place when the growth rate with industry is less than the growth rate with

universities. Based on this criterion agriculture, biology, computer science, medicine, and psychology are

becoming more outward disciplines. By the same token astronomy, chemistry, earth science, economics

and business, engineering, mathematics and statistics, and physics are becoming more inward.

         Table 6 concludes the descriptive findings by examining trends in foreign collaboration across the

sciences. The table computes the foreign share in institutional addresses on individual papers in 1981,

1990, and 1999. It also examines growth in the share across the decades of the 1980s and 1990s. For

comparison we include mean foreign and total institutional affiliations in brackets. Almost without

exception growth in the foreign share is more rapid than growth of either of the domestic indicators shown

in table 4. Moreover, growth accelerates in every field. Average growth is 5.11% in the 1980s but 7.41%

in the 1990s, so that the acceleration is 0.45 (7.41/5.11 - 1).

    VI. Regression Findings
    We turn now to the problem of explaining team size, the various dimensions of institutional

collaboration by sector and country, and research “output”. For this purpose, as we have seen, we have

constructed a panel of universities, fields and years, in order to match relevant data from the National

Science Foundation and the National Research Council that are reported at this level, as we have already

explained in section III of this paper. Table 7 contains descriptive statistics from the panel data. The


                                                       14
statistics show that the average university field-year observation has a team size of 4.26 authors per paper,

of which 2.65 are estimated to belong to a university-field16. The average university-field article involves

0.41 other top 110 universities. On average foreign institutions contribute a 5.2 percent share of all

institutional affiliations, while U.S. firms contribute 2.0 percent. The average number of papers is 149, for

which 709 citations are received from other top 110 universities during the first five years including the

year in which the paper is published.

     The average stock of deflated R&D is about 58 million dollars of 1992. This is the eight-year stock

depreciated at a 15% rate and lagged one year. Thus the R&D stock in 1981 is the sum of deflated and

depreciated R&D over the years 1973-1980 and likewise for all other years17. The average stock of R&D

per lagged paper, a measure of resources per unit of “output”, is about a half million dollars of 1992.

Private universities account for 35 percent of the sample, while on average there are 0.23 prestigious

awards per university-field.

     The local university R&D ratio captures the geographic concentration of research in the vicinity of a

university-field, which could be a measure of the ease of institutional collaboration. It is defined as the

ratio of other universities’ R&D within 25 miles to the same R&D within 200 miles. Thus, it denotes the

low cost of nearby collaborators. The ratio of equipment expenditure to R&D over the previous three years

could signify capital-labor substitution, as well as replacement of institutional collaborations.

     Ten percent of graduate students go to a school that ranks in the top 20 percent of the top 110

universities. Eighteen percent go to U.S. firms, and five percent go to 12 countries that are highly active in

scientific research. These variables are pools of graduate students that could drive shares of other top 110

schools, U.S. firms, and foreign institutions in the research of a given university-field. In the empirical

work we lag the different graduate student shares by two years in order to take publication lags into

account.



16
   The average number of authors is greater in the panel data consisting of university-fields than in the
original paper level data, because the university-field observations weight large teams more heavily than do
individual papers.
17
   The choice of an eight-year (and thus incomplete) R&D stock is dictated by the 1973 start date for flows
of R&D in the CASPAR data base, as this interacts with the 1981 start date of the ISI data. The eight-year
stock is thus the longest history that we have. We should say that the CASPAR R&D data, while they
represent a major achievement in data collection on universities, also contain substantial respondent errors.
We have tried to flag these errors and to remove all suspicious observations on R&D from our analysis.


                                                      15
     Table 8 reports regressions that explain the measure of team size, the logarithm of authors per paper.

Since authors per paper are university-field means, the data are continuous and the estimation method is

OLS. All the regressions remove bad or missing data on the R&D stocks. All include dummy variables for

year and field, in which 1981 and chemistry are the omitted categories. The dummies absorb trend and

field effects, which are highly significant and similar to those depicted in the preceding figures.

     Equation 8.1 is a baseline regression that includes the logarithm of the stock of federally funded R&D

in thousands of 1992 dollars and the private university indicator. We find that the stock of federally funded

R&D per paper to an extent increases team size18. This suggests that larger projects entail greater

specialization. Private universities form significantly larger teams. There are several possible explanations

for this result. Private universities may obtain more R&D funding from private foundations and wealthy

donors, which we are not able to measure. Another possible reason for the finding is that better pay, start-

up packages, and working conditions in top private institutions attract more talented faculty (Ehrenberg,

2003; Ehrenberg, Rizzo, and Jakubson, forthcoming). This talent advantage, which is related to salary and

perhaps governance advantages of top private institutions, could pull together a larger pool of coworkers

(Zuckerman and Merton, 1973).

     Equation 8.2 repeats 8.1 but restricts team size to less than 10 workers. The idea behind this restriction

is that university-field R&D is increasingly mismatched with team size as size increases, because an

escalating share of funding is external and is not captured by university-field R&D. Thus, the error in the

R&D stock rises with team size. Consistent with this idea, the coefficient on R&D stock increases slightly

and is more significant in 8.2 than 8.1.

     Equations 8.3 and 8.4 add a battery of variables to 8.1 and 8.2. As a whole these variables reduce the

regression coefficient of the stock of R&D per paper. The battery includes the number of prestigious

awards. Since awards data are missing for agriculture and medicine, 8.3 and 8.4 exclude these two fields.

Awards increase team size, consistent with the notion that funding and talent attract coworkers. The local

R&D ratio, which tries to capture local concentration of potential team members, has a small positive effect

on team size, which is not always significant, perhaps because team workers in the same school substitute

for team workers elsewhere. The equipment intensity of R&D spending in the most recent three years

18
  We divide federally funded R&D by papers lagged two years, in order to avoid division error bias with
the logarithm of authors per paper on the left hand side of the regression.


                                                      16
could signify capital- labor substitution. Consistent with this, its coefficient is negative, but again it is not

always significant. Finally, the indicator of top 20 percent in field slightly decreases team size, possibly

indicating the availability of graduate student assistance within an institution.

       Table 9 consists of Grouped Logit equations. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the relative

share of other top 110 schools in the research of a given university-field. This is the share divided by one

minus the share19. While the relative share seems to be a useful way to get at substitution of research by

other top 110 schools for internal research, it does have one limitation. Observations for which the relative

share equals zero cannot be included in the estimation procedure, because these zero values rule out any

finite value for the regression function. The same point applies to tables 10 and 11, which also use

Grouped Logit.

       All equations in table 9 include year and field dummies, which are highly significant. In equations 9.1

and 9.3 the logarithm of the stock of federally funded R&D per paper significantly increases the share of

other top 110 schools. Private universities collaborate to a larger extent with other top 110 schools, as do

schools where the faculty have earned a larger number of awards. Again we attribute the greater reach of

institutions with more research dollars and more awards to greater resources and talent.

       Equations 9.2 and 9.4 include an array of new variables. The fraction of former PhD students placed in

the top 40 percent of schools in a field is a significant factor in collaboration. Again top 20 percent status

in a field deters collaborations with other top 110 schools, perhaps because of the availability of graduate

assistance within a university-field.

       Table 10 is similar to table 9, except that here the dependent variable is the relative share of foreign

institutions in the research of a university-field. For this reason the PhD placement indicator is the fraction

of PhDs who have located to top research countries. The role of the university-field R&D stock per paper

is not as strong in table 10 as it was before in table 9, perhaps because the availability of foreign R&D in

part drives the collaboration. And yet additional R&D and private control do increase the foreign share in

10.1 and 10.2.

       The foreign placement indicator contributes strongly to foreign collaboration. It is of some interest to

note that the share of equipment expenditures in the recent past significantly discourages foreign

collaboration. This result suggests the role of the funding motive (see section II) for foreign and other

collaborations, especially in equipment-intensive fields such as astronomy and experimental physics, which

are well represented in these data (see figures 9 and 10 and table 6). Foreign collaborations could amortize

fixed costs of expensive equipment across countries in such fields.

    Table 11 repeats the exercise of tables 9 and 10, this time using the logarithm of the relative U.S.

corporate share in the research of a university-field as the dependent variable. While the stock of R&D per

paper has rather weak effects on the corporate share, private control of a university increases U.S. corporate

collaboration at a high level of statistical significance. In contrast university-fields that have earned many

prestigious awards collaborate less with firms. What these results suggest to us is that corporate R&D

support is much sought after by private universities. This is true, except in the case of departments with a

strong basic science focus that tend to win prestigious awards and extensive federal support. Notice that

because firms are the primary supporters of research collaborations with universities, it is their R&D that is

the likely driver of collaboration, not the university-field’s R&D.

    Also in table 11, the fraction of former PhDs placed in industry strongly drives collaboration with

firms, as one would expect. Recent equipment-intensity also appears to substitute for firm collaborations,

again suggesting the role of outside research partners in underwriting equipment expense.

    Tables 8-11 hold constant science field, R&D stock, private control, PhD placements, equipment

intensity of R&D, as well as other variables. For this reason time effects from the regression tables should

lie closer to “pure” effects of technological change on collaboration than trends in the raw data. To show

what these effects look like, figure 11 graphs the regression coefficients from the time dummies in

equations 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, and 11.1, which we previously suppressed in the interest of brevity. A comparison

of the various line graphs confirms what we have already seen—that the foreign share increases more

rapidly than the other indicators, and so on. However, there is an interesting jump in the time series of

relative shares contributed by foreign institutions, U.S. universities, and U.S. firms, which occurs between

1990 and 1991. This jump likely applies to papers written in the late 1980s. Our guess is that the jump

measures the increasing availability of information technology, which enables team workers to collaborate

more cheaply and effectively at a distance. This seems especially reasonable given that there is no clear




                                                      18
jump in team size at this time, so that external coworkers are replacing internal coworkers. We concede

that this point is somewhat speculative and that more work is needed to prove the claim.

         The empirical work concludes with Table 12, which is concerned with the explanation of research

“output” measured by the sum of fractions of papers and citations to those papers by a university-field20.

The estimation method is Ordinary Least Squares. As before, year and field dummies are included

throughout the table. Equations 12.1 to 12.3 use the logarithm of the fractional number of papers as the

dependent variable, while 12.4 to 12.6 use the logarithm of fractional five-year citations. By “fractional” of

course, we mean the sum of the internal paper and citation fractions within a university-field

         In equation 12.1 and the others the coefficient of the logarithm of the lagged stock of R&D is as

expected, positive and highly significant. However, it is also significantly less than 1.0, consistent with the

findings of Adams and Griliches (1998) that suggest diminishing returns to the stock of R&D at the

university-field level. The logarithm of all authors per paper decreases the output of papers in 12.1.

However, this anomalous result merely picks up movement of authorship outside the university-field. The

negative sign is spurious: larger teams involve more institutional collaboration, a smaller number of inside

authors, and thus a smaller number of internal, fractional papers. To see this more clearly notice that when

the fractional number of authors inside a university-field is used instead, as in 12.2, the coefficient on the

logarithm of authors reverses and becomes positive and highly significant. This is precisely the pattern of

sign that one would expect of indicators of the division of labor such as team size.

         Equation 12.3 adds shares of other U.S. universities foreign institutions, and U.S. firms to 12.1.

Shares of outside institutions reduce the fractional number of papers, in part because, as already noted,

authorship moves away from the university-field. Another possibility, which is raised by the citation

results, is that a quantity-quality tradeoff exists in the data. An increase in the foreign share may genuinely

imply that fewer but better papers are written within a university-field.

         If equations 12.1 to 12.3 seem to suggest that collaboration reduces the number of papers for

reasons that are mostly spurious, then 12.4 to 12.6 indicate that institutional collaboration increases citation

and thus total scientific impact. However, the counterpart to the spurious negative effect of all team


20
   Recall that if a university-field contributes half a paper, the fraction assigned is ½; if it contributes a
third, then the fraction is 1/3, and so forth. See fn. 7. For present purposes this fractionation of papers and
citations avoids multiple counting of the papers and citations across universities.


                                                       19
members on papers in 12.1, is the much smaller output elasticity of all authors in 12.4 compared with that

of “inside” authors in 12.5. In 12.6 we see that that institutional collaboration also increases fractional

citations. Overall, the evidence of table 12 suggests that the scientific division of labor increases research

“output” as measured by total influence of a university-field21.

     VII. Discussion and Conclusion
     This paper has presented evidence on patterns of research collaboration in U.S. universities over the

last two decades of the 20th century. The evidence on the size of scientific teams, as measured by authors

per paper, suggests that specialization and the division of labor have increased markedly over this period,

especially during the 1990s. Our findings on collaboration between institutions suggest a similar pattern of

developments, but with some new twists. Collaboration with foreign universities increases more rapidly

over time than team size, while domestic collaboration increases less rapidly. We take this as evidence that

the location of team members is shifting and is becoming more geographically dispersed. However, we

lack complete information on the causal factors directing this dispersion. It seems plausible to say that

domestic collaboration has for a long time been more feasible than international collaboration, and that

only recently have modern communications technologies made international science viable for researchers

on projects of normal size. This interpretation receives support from figures 7 and 8 where it is the smaller

teams that are becoming internationalized at a faster rate. But in addition, an increasing emphasis on large

databases, as in biology and medicine, and on massive instrumentation, as in astronomy and physics, may

have also played important roles in these trends towards greater internationalization.

     The growth of collaboration as observed in this article could be viewed as consistent with the

increasing efficiency of the research enterprise. Collaboration at a distance permits a combination of

complementary capabilities that leads to the execution of more and hopefully better research. In this way it

is likely welfare-improving. However, a more somber interpretation is that lagging public funding of

scientific research compels universities to engage in institutional collaborations, especially with firms and

foreign institutions, as a substitute means of support.




21
   This is not a perfect test. Some citations could involve hidden self-citations to previous collaborations by
the same research team. We cannot address this upward bias with the data that we have, because we cannot
link names and addresses of researchers, including across papers.
