                     HOUSING WEALTH AND AGGREGATE SAVING


                                    ABSTRACT




The recent appreciation in housing value can have large effects on

aggregate saving.    This paper uses a simulation model to show that

aggregate saving will decline substantially if life cycle homeowners

spend down their housing windfalls. Homeowners with a bequest
motive, however, may save   na to assist their        children in buying

the now more expensive housing.       To test whether families spend

their housing capital gains,    I   use housing,   income, and consumption

data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. While a cross-section
time—series regression implies that housing wealth does affect

saving,   a fixed—effects model finds no effect.

I. Introduction

     The price of   a   new single-family dwelling rose in real terms by 23

percent during the 19705.1 Much of this increase was concentrated in the

western United States, where real house prices grew by 57 percent during

a period of 8 years (Hendershott, 1987).

     The standard life-cycle model predicts that homeowners will

increase their consumption by some fraction of their capital gains in

housing.    Case and Shiller (1987) suggest that the total value of

single-family housing in 1985 was about 5.5 trillion dollars, based on

the mean price of $90,800 for an existing house.     If homeowners

consumed, say, 5 percent of their additional wealth (i.e., the increase

in their "permanent income'), then the 23 percent increase in housing

value would have caused aggregate consumption to rise by 51 billion

dollars.2   Holding income constant, this would have caused a 36 percent

decline in personal saving.      Hence the windfall in housing prices could

have been a primary cause in the saving slowdown of the late 1970s and

early l980s.

     One objection to this explanation is that a shift in the relative

price of housing may not affect aggregate consumption.     Any relative

price increase implies that some gain (those selling the good), while

others lose (those buying the good); usually, these effects wash out

across   the economy as a whole.   That is, the positive wealth gain of

homeowners could be exactly offset by the wealth loss of younger

consumers saving for their dream home.

     The exception to this rule is when the house lasts longer than does
                                   2



the homeowner.   If there is a permanent increase in demand for the

                                    can capture some of the future rent
long-lived asset, the current owner

on the asset when it is sold to future generations.      The question of

whether the appreciation in housing prices should affect homeowners'

                                                                life of
consumption and saving therefore hinges on whether the expected

their house and land exceeds their own   planning   horizon.   In life cycle

models, the answer is generally yes; current owners ultimately sell

their house to younger generations.    As with government debt in a life

                                                 additional consumption
cycle model, current homeowners enjoy wealth and

at the expense of future generations (Feldstein, 1977; Chamley and

Wright, 1987).

     As with government debt, the expansionary effect of an increase in

housing prices disappears in models with Barro-style utility functions;

current homeowners internalize those higher future house prices by

bequeathing more to future generations (Calvo, Kotlikoff, and Rodriguez,

1979).   There is a strong similarity between the question of whether

                                                       will spend their
government bonds are net wealth and whether homeowners

newly realized housing wealth.

     This paper first describes the interaction between housing wealth

and nonresidential wealth in an dynamic   overlapping   generations model of

                                  The model numerically simulates the 60

of   housing (Hend.rshott, 1980; Poterba, 1984),   nd   the increased

pressure of population on inelastically supplied housing (Henderson,

1985; Mankiw and Wail, 1989).    When bequests are ruled Out, any housing

price increase causes a substantial short-run decline in aggregate

saving rates as homeowners spend down their windfall gains.

       When the bequest motive is sufficiently strong, housing

appreciation has little or no impact on aggregate saving.      Homeowners

bequeath the housing capital gain to help their children afford the more

expensive housing.   That is, whether housing price increases affect

consumption and saving depends on the strength of the bequest function.

       The second part of this paper uses the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics to test whether shifts in housing value have any affect on the

consumption (and saving) of homeowners.   The empirical evidence is

mixed; in standard consumption functions, house prices are estimated to

have a small but significant impact on consumption.      When corrected for

individual heterogeneity, however, the link between housing prices and

consumption disappears.   Whether this finding supports a Barro-style

model of intergenerational transfers, or whether it is indicative of

constraints against borrowing by the elderly, is not clear.

      Section II develops a computable model of housing demand, life

cycle consumption, and bequests.   Housing prices and supply are

determined endogenously in a perfect foresight model with 55

generations.   Calculations of the transition path in savings, housing

value, and other factors are presented for tax and demographic changes.

Section III describes the data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,

and empirical estimates, while Section IV concludes.



II.     A   Model of Hpusin. Consumtion.        and Saving

        There is   a   growing literature describing the effects of government

policies on saving and welfare in the presence of fixed assets.

Feldstein (1977) used an overlapping generations model to show that a

newly imposed tax on land will reduce its market price by the full

capitalized value of the land tax.           This tax harms current owners of

land,    but benefits future owners (who can buy the land for less).3

Related results have been found in a general equilibrium model of fiscal

policy (Chamley and Wright, 1987), in international trade (Eaton;

1987,1988), and in development (Drazen and Epstein, 1988).           However,

Calvo, Kotlikoff, and Rodriguez (1979) have pointed out that the

assumption of life cycle consumers is essential for these models;

results often disappear in the presence of Barro-style bequest

functions.

        The model presented below solves for housing prices and saving in a

dynamic      partial equilibrium   framework.     Individuals live for a fixed
lifespan      of T years and retire after year R.      They buy a house at age b,

and live there until death; there are no borrowing (or downpayment)

constraints.       While the interest rate and wage rate are assumed fixed,

the asset price of housing capital (and the spot price of housing

services) are determined endogenously.

        The timing of the model is as follows.         Individuals begin the year

with assets A.  which earn the constant net after-tax rate of interest r.
             2.

At   the end of the period, earnings and interest income are received,

rental housing services are purchased, and consumption choices are made.

What remains is passed to the next period either as assets, or as

bequests to the most recently born generation.                               Dropping the time

subscripts for the moment, the utility function is


                         U   —     (1÷b)    il[haaJ        +                                       (1)

where 8         is   the rate of time preference,                h and C are         the flow of

housing services and consumption at age i, and                               a   is the expenditure

share on housing at any age.                    The bequest function depends on the level

of the bequest,                   8, as well as the price per unit of housing asset,

faced by         descendants who are born at the beginning of year T÷l and who

must buy their house at the end of year T+b.                            The bequest function

                                                       —   0),    a traditional bequest function

            > 0) in which the current generation is concerned about the

future price of housing.

          To approximate the fixed costs involved in switching houses, it is

assumed that individuals buy their house at age b, and live there until

death      (h        —
                         h.D,
                                  i > b).   The down   payment       is a proportion        of the

market value of the house, Qbhb.                       Individuals rent property at an age

less than b, and adjust the size of their rental property costlessly

from year to year.4                    The budget constraint is written

the issue of whether rental or owner-occupied housing has enjoyed 'more

favorable tax treatment, and assume that they are perfect substitutes in

production and that each enjoys the same (preferential) tax advantage 0

Suoply of Housing

        To allow for an upward-sloping supply of housing, land is

introduced as a fixed factor in the production of housing units.                               Land

is assumed to grow at an exogenous rate U; in the initial steady state,

land growth     1'   is equal to population growth n.                  When land growth is

slower than population growth, the price of housing will rise gradually

over time.      The housing production function is given by

                                                                                              (6)

       The elasticity of the housing stock with respect to the price

(holding land constant) is 7/(l-7).      Note that a "reasonable" factor

share of land, such as 1-7   — .25,implies     a large housing stock

elasticity of 3.0.    Converting the housing stock elasticity to a housing

investment elasticity (where investment is assumed to be 10 percent of

the stock) yields a measure of 30, which is clearly much larger than


empirically observed investment elasticities.      This may be a consequence

of assuming that the elasticity of substitution is one; empirical

evidence suggests an elasticity between .3 and .7 (Kau and Sirmans,

1981).   To compensate, I assume a lower value of    7   than that implied by

factor share payments.

Government and Becuests

       The government sector collects revenue from individual i at time t

equal to

                       Gj — OPhi +       r*T(AjtQthjt)                 (8)

and r* is the gross rate of return and T the tax on interest income.

The government collects revenue and returns the entire amount
                                                                   C   to

each individual, in each year.    This age- and year-specific lump-sum

rebate therefore avoids any cross-generation transfer of tax revenue, or

accumulation of government capital or debt.

       Bequests and inheritances are normalized so that the bequests given

by individuals at death at the end of year t are equal to (l+n)1T times

the   inheritances received by people born at the beginning of year t+l.

       It is not difficult for iteration methods that                                solve    dynamic

rational—expectations models to veer off far from the equilibrium path

(see Lipton, et al, 1982).                     The method used below uses the condition

that          is equal to the marginal supply cost of new housing capital.

The initial balanced steady state is first calculated for                                    n   —   I',       and all

relative prices are constant over time.                           A permanent change is made,

either in the relative population/land growth rate or the tax regime.

An initial guess of the new vector of yearly prices                                          is made, as

                                                              where each element of                        —

in each year.              A   new vector,                is then calculated which is the

supply price of housing necessary to generate the quantity of housing

          In the numerical calculations that follow, I assume that the net

after tax rate of return is 4 percent, the time preference rate is 2

percent, the population growth rate 2 percent, and the cost of

maintenance 20 percent of          P.   King and Fullerton (1984) calculate an

effective tax rate T       equal    to 37 percent.    While the subsidy to

homeownership varies with ma'rginal (or average) income tax brackets, I

will assume that      9—   0 in the initial equilibrium; the return to

homeownership is simply untaxed.

          Individuals are assumed to live for 55 years, and retire after 45

years.       The earnings path for a white high-school graduate is taken from

Lillard (1983), and all figures are expressed in thousands of dollars.

Houses are purchased in year 30, and the housing preference parameter                 a

is set at .29; this is the ratio of housing expenses to total


expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure Survey in 1980 (Statistical

Abstract, 1987, p. 430).           The production parameter 7    is   assumed to be

.1,   which yields an elasticity of supply for the stock of housing equal

to .11; if, for example, investment is 5 percent of the total stock, the

investment elasticity is 2.2, a measure consistent with the long-run

housing elasticity (Topel and Rosen, 1988).               The production parameter

  was calculated by normalizing P          —    1 in the initial steady state.

                                                                               where

case simulations.         For reasons of stability, the model does not allow

for   a   full Barro-style utility function;         — 0.5 < 1.0.

      There are a number of explanations for the jump in housing prices

during the past two decades.      The first explanation is based on the

interaction of high inflation rates and the taxation of nominal interest

income which led to negative real after tax interest rates during the

late 1970s (Feldstein, 1980;     Summers, 1981).      Poterba (1984) developed a

dynamic model of housing with variable supply, and explained much of the

increase in housing value during the late 1970s as a consequence of the

high effective tax rate on nonresidential investment.          The most obvious

way to replicate the experience of the l970s is to increase r while

holding B constant.     The problem with this experiment is that it

confounds the effect on consumption of an interest rate shift with the

effect of housing price shifts.     Both will lead to a sharp decline in

saving rates.     To hold the interest rate effect constant (so the

interest    rate is fixed), the housing tax differential is increased by 20

percent by shifting from B — 0 to B —       - .20.
      The taxation explanation alone cannot successfully explain the

pattern of housing prices in the l980s (1-iendershott, 1988).        Despite the

substantial fall in inflation rates and marginal tax rates, housing

prices have fallen only slightly, and in some areas have continued to

rise (Case and Shiller, 1987).     A   second explanation focuses on

demographic changes which increased the number of potential renters and

homeowners during the 1970s and early l980s.          Between 1975 and 1985,   the

population expanded by 11 percent, while the number of household

increased by 22 percent.      Standard urban models imply that the price of

                                         (Henderson, 1985). Mankiw and Weil
   (1989) argue that it was the increased
                                           housing demand by baby boomers
   that led to the
                   sharp rise in housing prices
                                                 during the late 1970s. To
  capture general demographic effects in this
                                                model, I assume that the
  growth rate of land V         falls
                               permanently behind the growth rate of
  population n.6 That is, the per capita
                                           supply of land (and, over time,
  housing) declines, and housing prices rise, as
                                                   population growth exceeds
  land growth. The reason
                           why  land growth is reduced rather than
 population growth increased is to hold constant
                                                    the age composition of
 the population.
                   Increasing population growth will increase the

time, the perfectly foreseeable housing price will grow at a constant

rate   ineach       year.    Aggregate saving rates shifts in response to the

housing price changes are shown in Figure 2 for the life cycle model (C)

and the bequest model (D).             Once again, a housing price appreciation

causes current life cycle homeowners to spend down their wealth, thereby

reducing aggregate saving.             However, a housing price appreciation causes

homeowners with a bequest motive to permanently increase their saving to

provide for their childrens' more expensive housing.

       The long run         impact   of housing prices on capital accumulation

depends on the behavior of the consumers who enjoy the windfall housing

profits; do they spend down their capital gains or save them?              To

measure the behavior of this group, I turn            next   to an empirical test of

the impact of house value on consumption and saving.



III.    Ernirical Estimates of Housing Value and Savina

       A   number of time-series studies have estimated that housing wealth

has a positive effect on consumption.              In particular, the coefficients

from Bhatia (1987) and Hendershott and Peek (1987) suggest that the

marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is between 4 and 5

cents.      Krumm    and    Miller (1986) used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

(PSID) to compare the changes in asset income of homeowners with

renters.      While nonhousing saving fell temporarily following a house

purchase, homeowners on average saved more in nonhousirig assets than

renters, holding income constant.             Their evidence is consistent with

individual-specific saving effects; those who save are also more likely
                                    16


to   buy houses.

       The empirical analysis below also uses the PSID to test the effect

of housing windfalls on consumption.     The primary sample was selected in

the following way.    Observations were excluded if (1) there were changes

in the composition of family heads during the years 1973-83; (ii)

families rented or had moved during the period 1976-81; (iii)      there were

missing values for selected variables; (iv) the reported house value was

less than $4000, and (v) if income during any year 1973-81 was equal to

zero or exceeded $99,999.    One-thousand and fifty-six families remained

in the primary sample.

       In the past, researchers have used food consumption in the PSID as

a proxy for total consumption.     It is straightforward, however, to take

advantage of alternative consumption indicators reported in the PSID to

construct a better measure of consumption (Skinner, 1987).    In

particular, the survey reports utility payments, restaurant spending,

food at home, and the number of automobiles.8 These expenditures

correspond to categories in the Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CEX) of

1972-73 and 1982.    The strategy used here is to regress total

consumption in the CEX on these independent variables; the regression

coefficients are then used to weight the corresponding PSID variables to

generate predicted total consumption.    Using the full set of consumption

indicators increases the explanatory power from as little as 26 percent

of total variance (using food consumption alone) to almost 60 percent

with the full set of variables.9

       From the Consumer Expenditure Surveys of 1972-73 and 1982,    the
                                              17



dependent variable, consumption, was constructed to be total consumption

expenditures less automobile and furniture purchases and mortgage

payments, plus an imputed 6 percent return on the house value.'0

       The regression to predict consumption from the 1972-73 Consumer

Expenditure Survey, which used annual data,                is


        C — 1935               + 3.32*Away + 680*Auto +
                     + l.29*Food                                2.97*Utility
              (36)     (59)            (82)         (21)        (37)
R2   — .59;N     — 14499



where t-statistics are in parentheses, Food measures food expenditures

at home, Away measures food away from home, Auto is the number of

automobiles up to a maximum of 2, and utility measures utility payments.

Using similar notation, predicted consumption from the 1982 Consumer

Expenditure Survey (on a quarterly basis but adjusted to annual terms)




       C — 2173 +      l.63*Food    + 3.62*Away +    l9l4*Auto + 2.60*Utility
               (9)      (25)           (38)         (12)         (21)

R2 —   .59;   N — 3431



       Predicted consumption was constructed using both the 1972-73 and

the 1982 survey results, with appropriate adjustments using the CPI.

Average consumption for the sample is presented in the 5th and 6th

columns of Table 1.            All consumption and income variables used in the

PSID regressions are in terms of constant 1981 dollars.

       The    survey   asked for the respondent's subjective value of their

house in each year (presumably consumption decisions are based on the

subjective value of the house).               The average house value is presented in
                                                  18


Table 1.   In nominal terms, housing valuation increased by 76 percent;

when deflated by the CPI, housing prices increased by only 10 percent.

However, the CPI is likely to overstate the true cost of living increase

for homeowners, since it accounts for higher house prices facing

prospective homeowners.              An alternative measure is the GNP deflator;

using this adjustment, house prices rose by 18 percent during 1976-81;

during the period 1976-80, housing prices increased at an average annual

rate of 4.3 percent in real terms.

     As a first exploratory step in measuring the impact of housing

prices on consumption, it is useful simply to regress the individual log

difference in consumption between 1976 and 1981 on the log difference in

income and the log difference in house value.                           Because the sample is

restricted to those who did not move, the change in house value should

correspond to asset revaluation of an existing structure, although the

individual may have added home improvements (or allowed the house to

depreciate).       The regression yielded the following coefficients (with

t-statistics in parentheses);



               a   —   - .059    +    .l33    -        .0l0               R2 — .079
                        (7.6)         (8.1)            (0.6)                             (9)


     That is, the simplest model implies that individuals' consumption

patterns are sensitive to income changes                       ('i)   but not to changes in

housing valuation        (1i).   One potential objection to this regression is

that consumption should respond only to the unpredictible cornponent of

housing price changes.           To separate the unpredictable from the
                                                        19



predictable components of housing price changes, I assume                          that
homeowners forecast future price changes with an AR(2) model.                             Using

1976-78 data yields a predictive equation equal to ln(h) — .654 +


.52lln(h1)        +
                       .423ln(h2) with                 t-statistics of 3.8, 17.8, and 14.4,
                      2
respectively;      R      —       .77.   The predicted change in the housing price

between 1976 and 1981 (calculated using the AR(2) model) is denoted by

h, the unexpected change by h.                        It is interesting to note that the

average value of              was less than zero, suggesting that the house prices

in 1981 may not have been unanticipated.                           A regression similar to

Equation (9) was run with                   h   and      entered separately;



         O   —   -.054        +     .l33        -     .032h   -   .0O3           — .060
                 (5.5)              (8.1)             (1.0)       (0.1)                    (10)


      It seems clear that changes in housing prices, whether expected or

unexpected, do not have a large impact on consumption in these simple

regressions.          One hypothesis would be that the bequest motive just

offsets the life cycle wealth effect, so that saving is left unchanged.

A   test of this "weak bequest" hypothesis is to include a variable                          (1i   x

family   size); if the bequest motive were tronger for families with more

children, one might expect this coefficient to be negative.                           However,

the variable is insignificant.

      The next step is to take advantage of the full data set by forming

a combined cross-section time-series data set.                            From the theoretical

model, it can be shown that the main determination of consumption is

lifetime wealth (or permanent income).                            I attempt to provide an accurate
                                       20


measure of permanent income by including (logged) current income,

current earnings,'1 three years of lagged income, and next year's income.

An accurate measure of lifetime wealth is particularly important in this

equation,      since housing purchases are likely to be highly correlated

with lifetime wealth (some consumption studies in the past have even

used housing value as a proxy for permanent income!).      While the life

cycle model implies that the marginal propensity to consume out of

lifetime wealth is a function of age, interactive terms of income with

age were insignificant, and were therefore excluded.       To adjust for

demographic effects, age, age2, the sex of the household head, and

family size were included in the regression.      Finally, the dependent

variable, log(consumption), is constructed using the 1982 weights,

although the regression results were similar when the 1972 weights were

used.

        A   parsimonious regression is presented in the column labeled (1) in

Table 2.      The impact of a temporary change in (log) income on current

(log)    consumption is 0.06, which is roughly consistent with the

predictions of a life cycle model for a younger individual.      The

predicted change in consumption as a result of a permanent (5 year)

change in income, .22, is less than that predicted by the life cycle

model.      The coefficient on the house value is significant; it   implies
that a      23 percent increase in the market value of housing would increase

consumption by 1.4 percent.

        One disadvantage with the model in Column (1) is that it

potentially confounds two effects.      If interest rates affect both
                                     21



housing prices and consumption directly (through the Euler equation),

the coefficient on housing could confound these two effect.

Furthermore, business cycles could both depress housing prices and

increase consumption (conditional on income), leading to further bias.

To measure the direct impact of interest rate changes, dummy variables

for each year are also included in the column labeled (2).     Conditional

on lagged, current, and future income, consumption rates were higher

during the late l970s, a period of low real after-tax interest rates.

        The pooled cross-section time-series regression coefficients from

column (2) suggest that a rise in real housing prices of 23 percent is

predicted to reduce consumption by 1.4 percent.     Since these figures

apply only to homeowners, the estimate must be adjusted before applying

it to aggegate assumption.     Noting that 64 percent of all housing units

were owner-occupied in 1983,    and that homeowners enjoyed a median family

income double those who rented in 1983 (Statistical Abstract 1987,    p.

712).     Then the adjusted drop in aggregate consumption is predicted to

be   $26 billion in 1985 (or 18 percent of personal saving), assuming that

(a) consumption is proportional to income and (b) renters' consumption

is unaffected by housing prices.     The meaured effects are somewhat less

than those implied by the pure life cycle model.

Correctinz for Heteroseneity among Homeowners

        Heterogeneity may affect these estimates for two reasons.   First,

there may be some selectivity bias from choosing only those who did not

move for the entire period.     If, for example, those individuals with


consumption most responsive to housing wealth are also most likely to
                                     22


"cash   out" their house (by moving to    a   less expensive house in another

region, for example), then restricting the sample to "stayers" will bias

the results.     The standard Heckman method is used to adjust for this

bias; the inverse Mills ratio for "stayers" is calculated from a probit

which explains whether individuals move or       not.'-2   This ratio is then

interacted with the housing wealth variable and entered independently in

the regression on consumption; results are presented in Table 2, Column

(3).    The interactive term is positive implying that the larger the

unobservable component that predicts the family will move,         the higher

the inverse Mills ratio, and hence the smaller the response of

consumption to housing value.     This interactive term alone is not

significant, although the joint test that both the Mills ratio and the

interactive term are zero is rejected at the 0.01 level (F(2,63l7)         —

16.57).
       A   second source of heterogeneity is that some individuals in the

sample may be "spendthrifts" who both consume more relative to income,

and live in larger houses.     Hence including house value on the RHS could

lead to a spurious correlation, since both consumption and housing will

reflect the unobservable heterogeneity.        To correct for this correlation

between the unobservable effect and the independent variables, a fixed

effect model of consumption is estimated.        Individual effects are

removed from the least squares regression by subtracting each variable's

household-specific (arithmetic or logrithmetic) average.            This is

equivalent to including a dummy variable for each family in the

regression.      Because of this, variables which are constant for each
                                            23


family   over time,   such       as sex or the Mills ratio, are excluded from the

regression.      Column    (1)    in Table 3 reports regression results for a

simple   model explaining log consumption as a function of a limited

number   of   variables.     While income and family size remain signficant,

house value does not have a signficant effect on consumption.                 The

second regression reports results for the model including year dummies;

once again there is no evidence that house value has an effect on

consumption.

     What can one conclude from these sets of regressions?              One

interpretation would be that house value has no impact on consumption,

and that regressions from Table 2 (which imply           that house   values

affect consumption) reflect spurious correlation between the two

variables.      However, the fixed effect regressions may not be as

statistically powerful as the non-fixed effect regressions, since the

former are based only on within-family variation, and ignore potentially

useful variation between families.



     IV.      Conclusion

     This paper has suggested that the rise in housing prices during the

past decades can     have an       important impact on long run capital

accumulation.      In particular, if consumers follow life cycle patterns of

consumption, the increased house values is predicted to reduce saving

rates in theoretical models with rational expectations and perfect

foresight.      The saving effects are moderated in the presence of a

bequest motive; individuals concerned about their children facing higher
                                    24



housing   prices leave larger bequests rather than spending their windfall

gains.

    The Panel Study of Income Dynamics was used to assess the impact of

housing values on consumption.   While one set of regressions suggested a

small but significant effect, another set which corrected for individual

differences across families suggested that shifts in house value had no

effect on consumption during the later 1970s.

    What light do these results shed on the theoretical models of

saving behavior?    The latter regressions support Ricardian equivalence;

homeowners do not consume their housing wealth.     But consumers may be

unable to spend down their housing wealth.     While second mortgages are

an increasingly popular method for unlocking housing equity (Manchester

and Poterba, 1987), retirees may face difficulties in meeting mortgage

payments.    There are few reverse annuities that allow elderly homeowners

to spend part of their housing equity (Manchester, 1987).     Another

possibility is that consumers do not view their capital gains as

permanent.    Current homeowners may not wish to risk an over-leveraged

house if prices do ultimately fall.      Finally, homeowners may have grown

accustomed   to an accelerating pattern of housing price increases, so

that the house price changes anticipated for the late 1970s were already

reflected in 1976 (and later) consumption choices.

1  The price of housing is assumed to be the price index for new

single dwelling structures, adjusted by the GNP deflator.
2    Time-series   estimates of the effect of housing inclusive wealth on

consumption    are 4.6 cents (Bhatia, 1987) and 4.0 cents (Hendershott
and Peek, 1987) per dollar.

       Since the land tax is rebated, the tax   inclusive price   of land
for a particular generation falls. Alternatively, the owners of the
land make no profit on the land but they enjoy the proceeds of the
lump sum   rebate.
4The PSID reports that in the total sample, roughly 20 percent of
renters move to a new location each year.       For the sample of
homeowners in 1976/77, only 27 percent moved at any time during the
four year period 1978-81. See loannides (1987) and Henderson and
loannides (1987) for a more general model of housing tenure choice.



    If rental property exceeds non-owner-occupied capital, the limit is
set to one.

6     The model captures a permanent perfectly anticipated change in

housing prices. In Mankiw and Weil (1989), the demographic change is
temporary, but because individuals appear to be myopic, they treat the
change as if it were permanent.

    There are other explanations for the housing price increases.
Case (1987) suggests that a speculative bubble is the only factor that
can explain the sharp jump in Boston housing prices. Hendershott
(1988) favors an explanation in which a slowdown in housing
construction   productivity leads to a secular rise in housing prices.

    One disadvantage with using utility payments is that the real

price of gas and electricity grew by 33 percent during the 1970s.

  Similar regressions are reported in Skinner (1987). In those
regressions, however, house value was used as a consumption indicator,
                                                      32


which    is clearly not appropriate               for this exercise.

'°      It iight appear that the       imputed housing flow will contaminate
this measure        of   total consumption.   However, the instruments used to

predict consumption are independent of changes in housing values, so
the consumption measure will not bias the results.

"The log of earnings was set to zero when earnings were zero.

where M is the probit index as to whether the family moves during
1976-81, Y is log of income, Earn is earnings, Fmsz is family size,
H/Y     is
       the ratio of 1976 housing value to 1976 current income, and                         L
denotes changes over the 5 year period. This sample is expanded to
include those who owned a house during 1976 and 1977, but who may have
moved or sold their house between 1978 and 1981. There were 393
movers and 1072 who stayed.                  See Venti and Wise (1987), loannides

(1987), and Henderson and loannides (1987).
