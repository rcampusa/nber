This paper explores the links between macroeconomic developments, especially monetary policy,
and the exchange rate during the period of Japan’s bubble economy and subsequent stagnation. The
yen experienced epic gyrations over that period, starting with its rapid ascent after the March 1985
Plaza Accord of major industrial countries. Two distinct periods of endaka fukyo, or recession induced
by a strong yen, occurred in the late 1980s and the early 1990s at critical phases of the monetary policy
cycle. My approach emphasizes the interaction of short-term developments driven by monetary factors
(as they affect international real interest rate differentials) and the long-term determinants of the real
exchange rate’s equilibrium path. Chief among those long-run determinants are relative sectoral productivity
levels and the terms of trade, including the price of oil. Since the mid-1990s, the yen’s real exchange
rate has generally followed a depreciating trend and Japan’s comprehensive terms of trade have deteriorated.

Introduction


In the late 1980s, Japan’s economy embarked on a period of rapid escalation in the prices

of shares and real estate. This “bubble economy” was followed by a collapse in asset

values, a reduced pace of real economic growth, banking problems, and deflation. Nearly

two decades after the demise of the bubble economy, the prognosis for Japanese growth

is again bleak amid a turbulent global economic outlook. Japan’s experience carries

lessons for those hoping to understand and contain the 2007-09 financial crisis

originating in the United States housing and financial markets.

       Some observers of Japan blame its monetary policy for failing to react promptly

and aggressively enough, both as asset prices exploded upward in the late 1980s and as

they plummeted afterward. In these accounts, official concerns about the yen’s foreign

exchange rate and the competitiveness of the export sector were significant

considerations for monetary policy. Indeed, the yen has experienced epic gyrations since

the mid-1980s, starting with its rapid ascent after the March 1985 Plaza Accord of major

industrial countries. Two distinct periods of endaka fukyo, or recession induced by a

strong yen, occurred in the late 1980s and the early 1990s at critical phases of the

monetary policy cycle. In general, Japan’s real economic growth rate is rather strongly

negatively correlated with the level of the yen’s real effective exchange rate, as illustrated

in Figure 1. Over 1978-2007, the correlation coefficient between the real exchange rate

and real GDP growth is −0.38.

       Yet the determinants of the yen’s short- and even longer-term movements remain

mysterious in light of the development of Japan’s macro economy. What factors, for

example, can explain the yen’s steady and dramatic appreciation against the dollar over



                                              1
the early 1990s as Japan’s real economy and its financial system deteriorated? In their

prominent study of the Japanese economy through 1997, McKinnon and Ohno (1997, p.

2) go so far as to “treat the course of the yen-dollar exchange rate as a forcing variable for

Japanese monetary policy, rather than assuming that monetary policy independently

determines the exchange rate.” While the U.S.-Japan trade tensions that McKinnon and

Ohno view as the underlying determinant of yen/dollar movements undoubtedly

influenced market expectations, their vision of yen fluctuations that are largely

exogenous with respect to macro policies begs the question of how policymakers were

able to direct market-determined exchange rates toward politically expedient levels.1

        This paper explores the links between macroeconomic developments, especially

monetary policy, and the exchange rate during the period of Japan’s bubble economy and

subsequent stagnation. My approach emphasizes the interaction of short-term

developments driven by monetary factors (as they affect international real interest rate

differentials) and the longer-term determinants of the real exchange rate’s equilibrium

path. While I believe this approach to be fruitful, it raises further questions for future

research as I describe below. Hopefully this exploration will nonetheless throw light on

the general question of how major currency misalignments emerge and recede. The

narrative focuses on how monetary and goods-market factors interacted with the

exchange rate, but there is no doubt that the health of Japan’s financial system was a

critically important growth determinant during this period, in part through its effect on

the monetary transmission mechanism.



1
 As McKinnon and Ohno (1997) express their thesis elsewhere, “The erratically appreciating yen has been
an independent (or exogenous) source of disturbance. And since 1984, at least, it has imposed undue
deflation on the Japanese economy” (p. 199).


                                                   2
        The paper begins by reviewing the broad outlines of Japan’s monetary policy

experience and the yen’s exchange-market behavior since the Plaza agreement of 1985.2

The paper then sets out a simple framework relating real interest differentials to the

exchange rate, and uses it to explore the role of monetary policies.

        In the paper’s second half I focus on the longer-term determination of the real

exchange rate, which informs the exchange rate forecasts underlying international real

interest rate differentials. Specifically, I consider the evolution of the yen’s real exchange

rate with reference to international and intersectoral productivity growth gaps, as posited

by the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) model, and fluctuations in relative international

prices for traded goods, including energy.

        The rationale for carefully analyzing the benchmark is that real appreciations in

accord with the HBS prediction – those driven by relatively high productivity growth in

export and import competing industries – should not entail lower profitability in the

manufacture of tradable Japanese goods. The analysis shows, however, that yen real

exchange rate movements against the United States dollar are not closely related to HBS

factors over any reasonable medium term, and in fact are negatively correlated on a year-

to-year basis. Furthermore, year-to-year real yen depreciations are positively correlated

with gains in competitiveness by Japanese exporters. (There is somewhat more evidence

of a role for HBS factors against some nondollar currencies and on an effective basis). An

important question is the extent to which sharp exchange rate movements have


2
  A complementary study exploring this ground is Hamada and Okada (2007). Hamada and Okada
sometimes verge on language seeming to imply an exogenous yen real exchange rate, which on their p. 17
they compare to “an outside temperature that Japan faced during these 20 years ….” Elsewhere, however,
they clarify their belief the yen exchange rate has reacted in part to domestic macro policies. Like
McKinnon and Ohno they allude to trade conflict (through a theoretical analysis of current account targets),
but place little emphasis on it in their detailed policy narrative.



                                                     3
themselves affected productivity levels in Japanese industry. Terms of trade movements,

in particular fluctuations in global energy prices, are powerful correlates of changes in the

yen’s real exchange rate: declines in the terms of trade tend to coincide with real yen

depreciation.



Overview of Japan’s Monetary Experience



As the United States undertook a program of disinflation and fiscal expansion in the early

1980s, the yen and other world currencies depreciated sharply against the United States

dollar. After averaging below 220 yen per dollar over 1978-81 – that level itself a very

sharp appreciation relative to the average of 288 over 1974-77 – the yen depreciated to

about 250 in 1982, before assuming an average value of around 238 for 1983-85. These

annual averages in exchange rates disguise very high intra-year volatility, however.

Between March 1984 and February 1985, for example, the yen depreciated from 225.40

to 260.24 against the dollar, a move of more than 14 percent (in log points). The dollar’s

renewed strength reinforced trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and

eventually led to the September 1985 Plaza Accord. The U.S. and four major allies – the

United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan – pledged concerted policy intervention to

bring the dollar down.

       The aftermath of the Plaza accord saw a dramatic move in the yen’s dollar

exchange rate, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2 displays the nominal yen/dollar

exchange rate, quoted in yen per dollar but on an inverted scale so that a rise in the series

is a nominal appreciation in the yen. The figure also plots two indexes of the yen’s real




                                              4
exchange rate on a secondary vertical axis, with a rise in the index being a real yen

appreciation. One real exchange rate series is the bilateral rate against the United States

dollar, while the second is a trade-weighted multilateral (effective) index. Both of these

real exchange rates are computed with respect to consumer price indexes, and they move

reasonably closely together most of the time. The real effective CPI rate, in turn, is highly

correlated with the real effective rate based on unit labor costs, shown in Figure 1.

        Having been around 260 yen per dollar in early 1985, the yen price of dollars had

fallen to around 125 by early 1988, an appreciation of roughly 73 percent (in log points)

over only three years. In its latter stages, the yen’s rise was encouraged by somewhat

easier U.S. monetary policy immediately following the October 1987 stock market crash.

Estimates such as those reported by Ahearne and others (2002) suggest that Japan’s GDP

was below potential in 1986 and 1987 as exporters struggled. Very quickly, enyasu had

become endaka.

        Japan’s policy interest rates, having been raised abruptly late in 1985 to support

the Plaza policy, were lowered sharply through 1986 and 1987. (See Figure 3.) From a

high point above 8 percent in late 1985, the overnight call money rate fell to just above 3

percent in the first half of 1987.

        Early in 1986, the prices of equity and land began to rise appreciably more

sharply than in previous years. Although it was not understood at the time, this marked

the start of the great Japanese stock market and real estate bubbles. Figure 4 shows the

trajectories of land prices in six major cities and of the Nikkei stock-price average. All

categories of real estate appreciated, but commercial properties far outpaced industrial

and residential real estate, rising in price by more than 75 percent between 1986 and their




                                              5
1991-92 market peak. In percentage terms, however, the bubble in stock prices was much

more extreme. The Nikkei 225 average rose from about 13,000 at the start of 1986 to

about 39,000 at the end of 1989, when the bubble peaked. With the benefit hindsight, the

steep price increases look wildly unsustainable. Yet the Bank of Japan did not raise

interest rates until the bubble was roughly two and a half years old.

           Many observers, for example, Okina, Shirakawa, and Shiratsuka (2001), Ahearne

and others (2002), Ito and Mishkin (2006), and Hamada and Okada (2007), link the

Japanese authorities’ policy response to the emerging asset bubble to policy dilemmas

embedded in the macro landscape in the late 1980s. With the yen historically strong,

output below potential, and inflation therefore quiescent in 1986-88 during this first

episode of endaka fukyo, there was no appetite to restrict monetary policy in the hope of

moderating asset-price inflation. Such action would have risked further yen appreciation,

and, as McKinnon and Ohno (1997) argue, the wealth effect of the bubble may have

moderated the growth slowdown that otherwise would have occurred. In addition,

concurrent trade tensions with the United States discouraged Japanese authorities from

contractionary macroeconomic actions that foreigners would perceive as increasing

Japan’s current account surplus.3 This seems an odd concern, because generally it is a

weaker currency, not a stronger one, that inflicts beggar-thy-neighbor trade-volume

effects on trade partners. I discuss possible drivers of the yen’s exchange rate below.

           The period was the first of several episodes in which Japan’s macro policies,

perhaps lagging “behind the curve,” contributed to a sequence of destabilizing exchange

rate movements that ultimately worsened the bubble and its aftermath. These episodes

will be discussed in greater detail below. Okina and Shiratsuka (2002, p. 44), suggest that

the monetary stance over 1986-88 might have fueled a “euphoric” expectation of

“protracted low interest rates.”

        Any such expectation was dashed in mid-1989, when the Bank of Japan finally

did embark upon a cycle of sharply higher interest rates (see Figure 3). The Nikkei

continued to rise through the end of 1989, however, and the yen, which had stopped

appreciating in 1988 and then reversed course, depreciated through April 1990. But, with

inflation finally on the rise, the policy interest rate was to continue rising for almost a full

year, eventually reaching a level of about 8.2 percent (again, see Figure 3). As described

by Ito and Mishkin (2006, p. 136), the Japanese government in 1990 began to deploy

regulatory and fiscal weapons to counteract the land bubble. Land prices peaked in 1991

and declined relentlessly thereafter. By the end of 1990 the Nikkei stood at only around

23,000 – a 41 percent decline from the stock bubble’s peak. By the summer of 1992 the

Nikkei stood at around 16,000.

        Real GDP growth, which had proceeded at an average rate of nearly 5.8 percent

per year over 1988-90, slowed to 3.3 percent in 1991, to just under 1 percent I 1992, and

to 0.2 percent in 1993. It collapsed to –2.4 percent in 1994. From its peak of over 8

percent in the spring of 1991, the overnight call rate if interest fell to slightly over 2

percent by the summer of 1994. Throughout this period, however, the yen appreciated

strongly, so the economy was again in the grip of endaka fukyo. As output growth slowed

and then turned negative, core inflationary pressures subsided, as shown in Figure 5

(which does not adjust the Japanese CPI for two substantial increase in consumption




                                               7
tax).4 Events of this period have sparked debate about whether the Bank of Japan lowered

interest rates sufficiently quickly.5 I return to discuss the yen’s seemingly perverse

appreciation, which continued through April 1995, below. Ito and Mishkin (2006, p. 138)

state that the damaging appreciation occurred “with no apparent macrofundamental

reasons ….”

         In the early 1990s Japan’s financial sector came under increasing stress as a result

of nonperforming loans, many extended to the construction and real estate sectors that

were now suffering the effects of plummeting property values. Falling land and equity

prices reduced the collateral available for new loans and tightened liquidity constraints, in

a manner that has become all too familiar in recent years. Bank-sponsored mortgage

lending companies called jusen had helped fuel the land bubble by lending aggressively

to finance real estate development projects. They began to suffer in 1991 and after two

failed rescue plans the government decided to close them in 1995. As far as the banks

themselves were concerned, they too held mortgage loans; but in addition, stocks formed

part of their assets, and a hefty percentage of unrealized capital losses counted against

regulatory capital. To make matters worse, lightly regulated banks continued to extend

credit to basically insolvent borrowers, thereby weakening their own balance sheets

through a process of “evergreening.”

         Over 1992-95 some smaller institutions began to fail. Banking and credit

problems were to escalate over the decade, and became especially acute in the latter

  The tax increases (from 0 to 3 percent and from 3 to 5 percent, respectively) took place on April 1, 1989
and April 1, 1997. The definition of core inflation that I use for Japan, reported by the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communication, excludes the prices of food (other than alcoholic beverages) and energy.

underestimated deflationary forces.”

1990s after the outbreak of the Asian emerging-market financial crisis in the summer of

1997. The Ministry of Finance issued a deposit guarantee in 1995, and subsequently

injected capital into banks in 1998-99 after the failures of three large Japanese banks,

smaller banks, and securities firms starting late in 1997.6

           The travails of the financial industry in Japan proved to be a serious drag on the

economy, especially starting in the late 1990s; conversely, the stagnant economy

impeded financial-sector recovery. Evergreening and government guarantees led to the

survival of “zombie” firms and financial institutions, the continuing presence of which

impeded restructuring and discouraged investment and productivity growth.7

Notwithstanding the difficulties the crippled financial system had in channeling credit to

productive uses, the government did little to force a restructuring of banks’ balance sheets

until late in 2002.

           Buttressed in part by the depreciating yen, output growth recovered somewhat

between the second half of 1995 and the first quarter of 1997. Core inflation continued

slowly to decline (Figure 5). In April 1997 the government implemented two

preannounced but contractionary fiscal moves, an increase in the consumption tax from 3

to 5 percent and the withdrawal of a temporary income tax cut. In the second half of the

year, the Asian emerging-market financial crisis erupted, contributing to a fall in demand

and to the financial instability described earlier.

           The yen appreciated in both nominal and real terms between August 1998 and

December 1999, a development that placed a further drag on the economy (Figure 2). In

1998 real GDP fell by more than 2 percent, and with core inflation slightly negative by

year’s end, even the rate of nominal GDP growth was negative for the year.

           On April 1, 1998, a new Bank of Japan Law came into effect, changing the de

jure institutional balance of power between the central bank and the Ministry of Finance.

The BOJ was given goal as well as instrument independence with respect to inflation; its

official mandate under the new law was to maintain “price stability” – nowhere defined

in the Law – and to share with the government in maintaining financial stability. Among

the political factors underlying the grant of independence were the finance ministry’s

failure effectively to address financial-sector weaknesses and the suspicion that an

independent BOJ might have responded more aggressively to the late 1980s asset

bubble.8

           At the time the BOJ became independent, the overnight call interest rate stood at

around 40 to 50 basis points and core inflation remained slightly positive. In February

1999 after core inflation had become negative, the BOJ policy board, under Governor

Masaru Hayami, lowered the policy interest rate effectively to zero. This action initiated

the Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP). But in spite of the economy’s continuing weakness,

the BOJ policy board, discerning signs of recovery and concerned about negative side-

effects from holding interest rates at zero for too long, ended the ZIRP in August 2000 by

moving to a policy rate of around 25 basis points.9

    See Cargill, Hutchison, and Ito (2000, pp. 91-3).
9
  In March 2000 Governor Hayami gave an influential speech on “Price Stability and Monetary Policy.” In
it he rejected the idea of targeting a substantially positive inflation rate and questioned the contollability of
inflation once it had reached a level as high as 2 to 3 percent per year. For discussion see Kuttner and Posen
(2001, pp. 120-1).


                                                        10
       In retrospect, this move appears to have been ill timed. True, real GDP growth,

which had been roughly zero in 1999, registered about 2.8 percent for all of 2000. The

economy was hardly in robust condition, however, even though the yen’s foreign

exchange value had stabilized after the appreciation of 1998-99. More remarkably, core

inflation (excluding energy as well as food) had been zero or negative, with a growing

deflationary trend, in every single month since September 1998! (See Figure 5.) The BOJ

had earlier pledged to maintain the ZIRP “until deflationary concerns subside” (Ito and

Mishkin 2006, p. 145). By instead lifting interest rates from zero despite ongoing and

even accelerating deflation, the independent BOJ signaled that its discomfort with zero

interest rates exceeded its fear of prolonging deflation. The economy deteriorated in the

final quarter of 2000. Real GDP grew at rates of only 0.16 percent in 2001 and 0.26

percent in 2002 (Figure 1), and in both years the rate of core consumer price deflation

was close to 1 percent.

       On March 19, 2001, the BOJ again lowered the nominal interest rate, effectively

bringing back the ZIRP, and clarified that the ZIRP would be abandoned only after the

rate of CPI inflation, excluding fresh food, was “stably” at a positive value. The zero

interest rate was to be brought about, however, by excess-reserve targeting – a policy of

unconventional, quantitative easing. Originally set at ¥5 trillion (an amount in excess of

the then required reserves of ¥4 trillion), the target for bank current accounts with the

BOJ was raised to ¥15-20 trillion by the final quarter of 2002 (Ito and Mishkin 2006, pp.

146-7). But deflation continued. There is considerable debate about the effectiveness of

the quantitative easing policy. Its success was certainly hampered by the BOJ’s resistance

to such measures prior to March 2001 and by the impression sometimes conveyed by




                                             11
Bank officials, even after the policy’s adoption, that it was unlikely to succeed.

Moreover, the BOJ had signaled a degree of inflation aversion so high as to be

inconsistent with a successful quantitative easing strategy.10 From this perspective, a

change in regime at the BOJ probably was a necessary condition for progress in the battle

against deflation.

         Governor Toshihiko Fukui succeeded Governor Hayami in March 2003; in

addition, two new deputy governors arrived, including Kasumasa Iwata, a supporter of

inflation targeting. The new management increased the extent of quantitative easing

sharply, at the same time clarifying that zero interest would not be abandoned in the

future unless inflation was clearly positive. In October 2003, the BOJ announced that

“necessary” (but not always sufficient) conditions for raising the interest rate from zero

were that core CPI inflation be above zero “over a few months,” and that the Bank be

convinced “that the prospective core CPI will not be expected to register below zero

percent.”11

         These measures may have been helpful in clarifying the intention of monetary

policymakers to indeed keep the policy interest rate at its lower bound until deflation had

been decisively vanquished; that is, the intention not to withdraw monetary stimulus

when the inflation rate was still nonpositive. In addition, some observers place

considerable weight on a Ministry of Finance program of massive dollar purchases over

2003-04, which may have choked off another damaging yen appreciation cycle (see

Hamada and Okada 2007, and the discussion below). Yet a third factor helping the

  For a discussion of the issues, see Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005). It is certainly true that under
quantitative easing, the increase in broad monetary aggregates was not nearly commensurate with the
increase in the monetary base, nor did the additional liquidity lead still-troubled banks to extend much
additional credit.

economy was the government effort led by economy and financial services minister

Heizo Takenaka to curb regulatory forbearance and resolve the bad-loans problem of the

banks. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed Takenaka to head the financial

services ministry in September 2002. Key subsequent events included the pre-emptive

recapitalization and restructuring plan for Resona Bank in the spring of 2003, which

arguably stabilized expectations of lending risk, as well as Takenaka’s insistence on a

timetable for other banks to dispose of nonperforming loans. Over 2004-07, the rate of

real GDP growth was much more stable and averaged around 2.25 percent per year.

           Deflation, measured by a core CPI excluding energy as well as food, decelerated

but did not disappear completely over these years. In March 2006, however, the BOJ

policy board took a major step toward clarifying its operational understanding of “price

stability” – a clarification that, for the first time, specified at positive inflation as possibly

consistent with the BOJ’s goals. The minutes of the March 8-9, 2006 meeting state that

“It was agreed that, by making use of the rate of year-on-year change in the consumer

price index to describe the understanding, an approximate range between zero and two

percent was generally consistent with the distribution of each Board member’s

understanding of medium- to long-term price stability.”12

           Notwithstanding the (at best) ambiguous evidence that deflation had receded, the

BOJ, in July 2006 raised its lending rate to 0.25 percent. This was the end of the ZIRP.

The rate was raised further, to 50 basis points, in March 2007 before being cut again in

2008 as the global financial crisis intensified, The BOJ cited improving economic activity

levels and hinted that it would foster an “accommodative” environment by maintaining

rates at low positive levels for some time. Nonetheless, the move was controversial, with

Prime Minister Koizumi, for one, arguing that the end of deflation was near but not yet

fully achieved. As in previous episodes (see Cargill, Hutchison, and Ito 2000, p. 173),

one motivation for the BOJ’s action seems to have been a desire to underscore its

independence. As one press account put it, “Yesterday's rate rise was the end of a

prolonged bout of shadow boxing between government ministers, who believed a rate

rise would dent the recovery, and the BoJ, which wanted to raise rates to demonstrate its

independence and show it was able to take pre-emptive action.”13

        Even if Japan was truly at the end of its period of stagnation in 2006, its economy

was overtaken by the events of 2007-09. With global financial markets in turmoil and

Governor Fukui’s five-year term coming to a close early in 2008, the Japanese

government and the upper house of the Diet found themselves deadlocked over the

choice of a successor. The parliamentary opposition argued that the government’s initial

nominees would compromise BOJ independence. In March, the two sides agreed to

appoint as governor Maasaki Shirakawa of the BOJ, who had initially been nominated

along with Takatoshi Ito, a vocal proponent of inflation targeting, to be one of two deputy

governors. Ito was a casualty of the political wrangling. Japan’s financial sector, unlike

those in the United States and Europe, was fortunately minimally exposed to subprime

products. But as the word financial crisis intensified, the yen assumed the role of safe-

haven currency, appreciating multilaterally and bilaterally against the dollar. In 2008,

appreciation. These both put renewed downward pressure on the price level.



Real Interest Differentials, Natural Real Rates, and the Real Exchange Rate



The open or uncovered interest rate parity theory of the exchange rate predicts that any

nominal interest differental between currencies must be offset by expected depreciation

of the high-interest currency against the low-interest currency. A corollary, derived by

subtracting the expected inflation difference from both sides of the preceding

relationship, is that expected real interest differentials are offset by expected movements

in real exchange rates. These predictions have received quite limited support from the

empirical record of the modern floating exchange rate era. I will nonetheless rely upon

interest parity as a basic framework for thinking about the link between monetary policy

and the yen. Why could this be a reasonable approach? There are three reasons:



   1. Some framework is essential, and our knowledge of risk premia is rudimentary at

       best. It thus seems prudent to start with the simplest framework, even if it does

       not fit the data exactly, and then, if necessary, add additional conjectural factors

       such as risk premia.



   2. If risk premia or other deviations from interest parity move slowly over time, a

       first-differenced relationship could be useful even if level deviations from interest

       parity are significant.




                                             15
   3. My focus will be on long-horizon interest parity, and the evidence (partial as it is)

       suggests that interest parity may hold more closely for long-term interest rates

       (see, for example, Alexius and Sellin 2002; Chinn 2006).



   Modern discussions of monetary transmission – echoing the classic insights of

Wicksell more than a century ago – stress the link between the real interest rate implied

by the monetary policy stance and the natural, market-clearing real interest rate. The

interest-parity relation suggests, moreover, that relative international discrepancies

between natural and market real interest rates have consequences for real exchange rates.

Thus, the interest-parity relationship, once reinterpreted, is a natural vehicle for linking

the expansiveness or restrictiveness of monetary policy to the exchange rate. This

approach is most likely to be informative when applied to long-term interest-parity,

   If rt is the long-term real rate of interest at home, rt* the long-term real rate abroad,

and qt the real exchange rate (defined as the domestic consumption cost of foreign

consumption), then if q t is the expected long-run real exchange rate as of date t, the

(open) interest-parity condition is

                                        rt − rt* = qt − qt .                              (1)

Observe that in this notation, a rise in q is a real depreciation of the domestic currency. A

rise in rt − rt* , holding q t constant, elicits a real domestic appreciation. The convention I

am following – in which a rise in q is a real depreciation – is opposite to the one typically

used for real exchange rate indexes such as those in Figure 2, which are meant to measure

the real external values of currencies. Notice that for the sake of easier visual




                                              16
interpretation in Figures 2, 6, and 7, I measured even the bilateral dollar-yen real

exchange rate so that an increase is a real yen appreciation, contrary to the convention in

equation (1).

    Let a tilde over a variable denote its “natural” level: the level consistent with market

clearing in a flexible-price world. In particular, q~t denotes the flex-price equilibrium real

exchange rate and, q t denotes the expected long-run “natural” real exchange rate, which

– importantly – coincides with qt . In the flex-price equilibrium the analog of eq. (1)

holds:

                                         rt − rt * = qt − qt .                           (2)

    By subtracting (2) from (1), we obtain a simple relationship that ties the current

deviation of the real exchange rate from its flex-price level to the relative expansiveness

of domestic monetary policy, as represented by deviations of market from natural long-

term real rates of interest:


                                             (          )
                                 qt = q~t + rt* − r~t * − (rt − r~t ).                      (3)

If the domestic real rate of interest rises relative to its natural level, for example, then the

domestic currency will appreciate in real terms relative to its own full-employment level

(everything else equal). For example, a decline in economic growth prospects would

naturally be associated with a fall in the natural long-term real interest rate, r~t , but if

monetary policy is expected to remain restrictive over the medium term, the result could

well be a real currency appreciation and recession.

         Of course, equation (1) by itself also has implications for the real exchange rate.

Rewrite (1) as



                                                 17
                                qt = qt − ( rt − rt* ) .



This relationship implies that if changes in the expected long-run real exchange rate qt

are small and if risk premia changes are excluded, the currency will appreciate in real

terms when the domestic-foreign real interest differential rises. This pattern is most likely

when the main shocks hitting the economy are monetary, for pure monetary shocks do

not alter the long-run real exchange rate. In reality, the implied relation between current

real exchange rates and real interest differentials seems to be rather loose for most

currencies. In the Japanese case, however, I will argue that monetary shocks were

important and do provide some traction for understanding exchange rate movements.

This approach still leaves most of short-term exchange rate movements unexplained, of

course, so it is important to keep in mind that expected real interest rates are measured

with some error (due to the use of inflation-expectations proxies), that variable risk

premia indeed are relevant, and that changes in expectations of long-run real exchange

rates are likely to have occurred at various points. An advantage of formulation (3) is that

it may be more robust than (1) to the presence of risk premia, but on the other hand,

empirical implementation of (3) requires assumptions on the “natural” levels of real

interest rates and exchange rates.

       Figure 6 displays the monthly time series of Japan less United States real interest

differentials and the real yen/dollar exchange rate index, calculated on the basis of CPIs

(with an upward move in the exchange rate index being a real yen appreciation). The real

interest rate is calculated as the 10-year government bond rate less the centered twelve-

month ex post inflation rate.


                                              18
         For the period from June 1980 to July 2008, the correlation coefficient between

the real interest differential and the log real exchange rate is +0.45. Evidently real interest

differentials do not explain everything, but they are surprisingly highly correlated with

real yen/dollar movements, and in the direction that a simplified interest parity theory

would suggest.14 Figure 7 parallels Figure 6 with a comparison of Japanese and German

real interest differentials. There are clearly periods of medium-term comovement

between the Japan-Germany real exchange rate and the corresponding real interest

differential, but in the case shown in Figure 7, the short-term correlation is far below that

in Figure 6, and is in fact negative (–0.11). In both figures there is a real depreciation in

the 2000s beyond what real interest differentials would predict, perhaps reflecting

revisions in expectations of the long-run real exchange rate.



Patterns in Nominal and Yen Real Exchange Rates since 1988



         Figure 2 shows that, as far as the nominal exchange rate is concerned, the yen

depreciated after late 1988 through April 1990, then embarking upon a sharp appreciation

trajectory that would culminate in a nominal rate near 80 yen per dollar in April 1995.

After depreciating again through late 1998, the yen reversed course and appreciated

sharply through end-1999. Since then it has remained in a range of roughly 95 to 130 yen

per dollar.




14
  The bilateral real exchange rate measure and the Japanese CPI inflation measure used in calculating the
real interest rate are adjusted to remove the effects of the consumption tax increases of April 1, 1989 and
April 1, 1997.



                                                     19
       More relevant for assessing the competitiveness of Japan’s exports is the yen’s

real exchange rate, also shown in Figure 2 for the case of consumer-price deflators. The

cycles are similar to those for the nominal exchange rate, but some distinct trends are

now apparent. Most importantly, after the April 1995 peak for the yen, there is a strong

trend of real depreciation, whether the real exchange rate is measured in real effective

terms or bilaterally against the dollar. Between April 1995 and mid-2008, the yen

depreciated in real effective terms (based on the CPI, as a log difference) by 57 percent.

For the bilateral yen/dollar rate, the corresponding real depreciation rate is 60 percent.

       Strikingly, the real depreciation trend is driven entirely by the relatively higher

inflation rates in Japan’s trading partners over a period when Japan at times suffered from

outright deflation. The nominal exchange rate, in contrast, has remained within a

relatively narrow range since around 2000. This unusual pattern – typically observed only

in gold standard and other “hard peg” countries painfully unwinding an overvalued

currency – is itself symptomatic of Japan’s post-bubble stagnation.

       Figure 2 suggests that the yen real exchange rate’s history since 1988 can be

divided into (at least) six periods, characterized by the following given changes in the

extreme month-average nominal exchange rates against the dollar:

   1. December 1988−April 1990: Depreciation (123 ¥/$ −158 ¥/$).

   2. April 1990−April 1995: Appreciation (158 ¥/$ − 84 ¥/$).

   3. April 1995−August 1998: Depreciation (84 ¥/$ −145 ¥/$).

   4. August 1998−December 1999: Appreciation (145 ¥/$ −103¥/$).

   5. December 1999−July 2007: Depreciation (103¥/$ −122 ¥/$).

   6. July 2007−December 2008: Appreciation (122 ¥/$ − 90¥/$).




                                             20
         Our question is how the cycles and trends in real exchange rates are driven by

monetary policy actions as well as by the longer-run evolution of the Japanese economy.

         Period 1. After the protracted appreciation period the followed the Plaza

agreement, the yen appeared to stabilize early in 1988. Japanese authorities welcomed

that development, which boosted the economy. The asset-price boom continued,

however, and inflationary forces, which remained muted after a period of yen strength,

were in fact gathering (Figure 5). Apparently unwilling to risk renewed appreciation,

however, the Japanese authorities did not aggressively raise target interest rates (Figure

3). Inflationary pressures were evident earlier in the United States economy, and the Fed

did respond with a series of interest rate hikes starting in the second half of 1988 (Figure

8).15 The yen started to depreciate late in 1988.

         The Bank of Japan began to raise short-term interest rates in mid-1989 (Figure 3).

Core inflation was significantly higher by the spring of 1990 – by which time the price-

level effects of the April 1989 consumption tax increase are no longer distorting the data

in Figure 5. Yen depreciation continued. Even after the stock market peaked early in

1990 and the yen hit bottom in April 1990, and with Japanese and U.S. long-term real

interest rates close once again (Figure 6), the BOJ continued to tighten short rates.

Around that time Japanese inflation also took a ratchet-step upward.

         Why did the yen depreciate through April 1990 and not begin to appreciate sooner

after Japanese monetary policy began to tighten? One possibility is that falling Japanese

equity prices prompted an international portfolio shift out of yen. It may also be that the

15
  The “Record of Policy Actions of the Federal Open Market Committee,” Meeting of May 17, 1988
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical1988.htm), noted that “consumer and
producer prices have risen more rapidly recently. In addition, labor costs increased substantially in the first
quarter.”



                                                      21
markets had some doubts about the willingness of the BOJ, not a formal inflation

targeter, to do what was necessary to keep inflation down. As the policy interest rate

continued to climb, however, markets became convinced that the BOJ meant to limit

inflation. At this point, Japanese long-term real interest rates had generally been above

U.S. rates for some time (Figure 6).16

        Period 2. With long-term Japanese real interest rates exceeding those of the U.S.

in the spring of 1990, and Japanese short-term rates continuing to rise, the yen began to

appreciate sharply. In the last quarter of 1990 the Japanese long-term nominal interest

rate fell below the overnight rate, which stood at better than 8 percent throughout the first

quarter of 1991. The sharp reversal in interest-rate policy that began in the spring of 1991

moderated the pace of yen appreciation but did not induce depreciation. One reason was

that the U.S. monetary tightening cycle had peaked in the fall of 1990, and U.S. policy

rates were falling rapidly from the end of the year. The Fed’s view was that, despite the

possible inflationary effects of a rise in oil prices, U.S. real activity was slowing.17 By the

final quarter of 1991, the Japanese economy was suffering the coincidence of a

strengthening currency, uncomfortably high inflation, and asset-price collapse. In 1991,

Japan’s real GDP growth slowed whereas the U.S. entered a mild recession. As U.S.

growth recovered in 1992, however, Japan’s slowed further and it remained low in 1993.

In 1994, Japanese growth turned sharply negative (Figure 9).

        Contributing to poor growth performance was a sharp upward movement of the

yen (roughly 25 percent) between mid-1992 and the last quarter 1993. This was the start

  Clarida and Waldman (2008) show that the response of exchange rates to inflation news has been quite
different as between inflation-targeting central banks and non-targeters (such as the BOJ and the Fed).

of a second great episode of endaka fukyo. At this point U.S. inflation had largely

stabilized but Japanese inflation was falling (Figure 5). Inflation expectations may

therefore have played some role in the yen appreciation over 1992-93, but from a macro

perspective the appreciation remains puzzling. It seems likely, however, that U.S.-Japan

trade tensions created expectations that the Japanese authorities would limit potential yen

depreciation. This is the interpretation favored by McKinnon and Ohno (1997). In

January 1992, President George H. W. Bush visited Japan and secured commitments to

specified increases in imports of autos and auto parts from the U.S.18 The election of the

Democratic Clinton administration in November 1992 may well have raised expectations

of a more confrontational U.S. trade stance. Coupled with Japan’s slow growth, U.S.

recovery was leading to an expansion in American imports from Japan, and this,

paradoxically, added to the tense atmosphere regarding trade.

        As Japan’s short-term interest rate fell and the Fed kept short-term rates on hold,

the yen stabilized, but a renewed appreciation episode started in mid-1994, just as the yen

overnight interest rate stopped falling and began to inch upward (Figure 3). Between June

1994 and April 1995, when the yen reached its all-time peak, the yen appreciated by 12.5

percent (log points) in real effective terms and by 18 percent (log points) in real terms

against the dollar. This episode has puzzled observers, as it occurred when the Japanese

economy was already quite weak and about to fall into deflation.

        As of early 1994, however, private and policy forecasts discerned signs of

recovery, and indeed, at that point the long-term yen nominal interest rate began to move

up. Ahearne and others (2002, p. 17) quote the BOJ Quarterly Bulletins for May and

November 1994 as pointing, respectively, to stabilization of the economic growth rate

and to strength in “all categories of spending….” Short-term interest rates remained on

hold, however, and with the fundamentals of the economy in reality deteriorating, it is

possible, as Ahearne and others (2002, p. 18) suggest, that the market real interest rate

rose above the natural rate, prompting the sharp yen appreciation of early 1995. This

result is consistent with the prediction of equation (3). The sharp appreciation itself,

coupled with the Kobe earthquake and falling equity prices, helped snuff out a possible of

economic recovery. Early in 1995, headline CPI inflation, which had risen slightly

toward the end of 1994, dropped to around zero. Core inflation also was low and

declining (Figure 5).

        Period 3. In April 1995, a series of dramatic policy interventions, carried out by

both Japanese and foreign authorities, initiated a new, long-term weakening trend for the

yen. The BOJ discount rate was slashed and the yen overnight interest rate fell

dramatically, reaching a level of about 0.5 percent by the fall of 1995 (Figure 3). As

described by McKinnon and Ohno (1997, pp. 226-8), the U.S. eased mercantile pressures

and Japan, while several countries carried out joint foreign exchange market interventions

to support the dollar in currency markets. The Japanese authorities had purchased dollars

in unilateral official intervention operations on 21 days in March 1995 as the yen

continued to rise. They intervened on eight more days between April 3 and 18,

purchasing about $500 billion for the month.

       Nominal long-term interest rates in Japan fell dramatically as expectations of low

growth and low inflation took hold. As Figure 6 shows, Japan’s long-term real interest

rate fell far below that of the United States. From a level of around 4.2 percent per year in

March 1995, the nominal10-year JGB rate fell to a low of around 0.9 percent in the fall of

1998. The upward spike in domestic financial instability late in 1997, after the outbreak

of the crisis in Asian emerging markets, no doubt contributed to the yen’s rather rapid

depreciation through August 1998.

       Not only did Japanese nominal long-term rates start to rise in the fall of 1998, but

also, accelerating Japanese CPI deflation had started to cause the long-term real Japanese

interest rate to start trending upward. Even before then, U.S. short and real long-term

rates had started to decline in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Eventually those

factors halted the yen’s depreciation and reinforced a new appreciation cycle.

       Period 4. It was in August 1998 that the yen’s next real appreciation cycle began.

During this period, Japan’s real long-term interest rate rose relative to that in the United

States. In Japan the overnight interest rate stood at just under 0.5 percent and would fall

effectively to zero within a year, but in the presence of deflation expectations, yen

appreciation continued. At the point when the zero lower bound was reached late in

February 1999, the BOJ had no further ability to lower the short-term nominal interest

rate. By the end of 1999, Japanese and U.S. real long-term interest rates were again very

close, and the upward trend in the (negative) Japan-U.S. differential had ceased (Figure

6), in part because U.S. headline inflation had moved upward.




                                             25
           Over the entire period from August 1998 to December 1999, the yen appreciated

in real effective terms by 29.8 percent and in real bilateral terms against the dollar by

31.2 percent.

           Period 5. In the subsequent long real depreciation phase, a falling yen price level

reinforced the yen’s nominal depreciation against the dollar. The yen fell sharply in real

terms through the end of 2001 as Japan’s relative real interest rate fell. From August 2000

to March 2001 the BOJ held policy interest rates above zero, as described earlier, having

perceived signs of recovery despite a core inflation rate that remained negative.19 This

move caused a small temporary strengthening of the yen, but economic activity slowed

and deflation accelerated.

           The yen stabilized and even rose (against the dollar) after early 2002 as Japan’s

real interest rate rose toward the U.S. level (Figure 6), but depreciation returned early in

2005 despite a relative Japanese real interest rate that continued to rise for several months

(part of the Greenspan “conundrum” period).

           Hamada and Okada (2007) argue that the yen would have appreciated far more in

2003-04, crippling Japanese recovery, if not for the energetic dollar purchases carried out

by Japan’s Ministry of Finance under Vice Minister Zembei Mizoguchi. Between January

2003 and the end of March 2004, the MOF sold ¥35,256.4 billion for dollars in the

foreign exchange market.20 Ito (2004) discusses the rationale and context for these

interventions in detail and suggests that while they could have had a weakening effect on

the yen of up to 13 percent compared to the counterfactual of no intervention, it is also

possible that their effects were mostly temporary. In any case, the Fed had begun to

tighten U.S. monetary conditions in mid-2004 in the face of mounting inflation pressure

(Figures 5 and 8). From April 2005 Japanese long-term real rates began to fall compared

to the U.S., and yen depreciation accelerated.

        In July 2006, the BOJ definitively ended its zero-interest policy regime, as we

have seen (Figure 3). Even with some signs of Japanese recovery and Japan’s relative

real long-term interest rate rising, yen depreciation continued through July 2007. It could

be that markets perceived unusually high risks in a period of monetary policy transition,

or that market expectations of Japanese long-term growth were again being revised

downward.

        Period 6. Yen behavior during this period is dominated by Japan’s emergence as a

relative safe haven in a period of global financial market crisis. Paradoxically, the

weakness of Japan’s financial system over prior years may have deterred Japanese

institutions from overextending themselves during the 2000s, unlike institutions in

Europe and especially the United States. The yen strengthened sharply starting in the fall

of 2008. At that time, emerging markets and industrial countries came under financial

pressure and the world price of oil plummeted from the unprecedented heights reached

the previous summer. By the end of 2008 the yen was around the ¥90 per dollar level. Of

course, the yen was much weaker in real terms by 2008 than when the yen had reached

that nominal rate in the mid-1990s. Even so, a higher yen, coupled with rapidly shrinking

markets for Japanese exports, threw Japan’s growth sharply into reverse.

Long Run Trends in the Yen: The Role of Productivity Growth



Movements in relative real long-term interest rates offer some insight into short-term

exchange rate dynamics, but it is also likely that perceptions of long-run real exchange

rates changed over the period following the collapse of Japan’s asset bubble. We would

like to understand whether and when such changes in long-term perceptions may have

occurred. A closely related challenge is to explain the observed long-term trends in the

yen’s real exchange rate. I therefore turn to the question of long-term movements in the

yen and their relationship to underlying economic fundamentals. This section focuses on

productivity trends, the next, on trends in international trade.



The Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson Approach

Perhaps the most fundamental benchmark model for thinking about real exchange rates is

the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) model (see Rogoff 1992; Obstfeld 1993; Asea and

Mendoza 1994; Obstfeld and Rogoff 1996, Chapter 4). The model posits economies with

two sectors, tradable and nontradable goods. In essence, the real exchange rate depends

on the international “difference in differences” between the economies’ tradable-sector

and nontradable-sector productivity growth rates. The HBS model provides a key

benchmark, because real appreciations consistent with the model’s predictions are purely

productivity driven and do not entail a decline in the competitiveness of exports.

       To understand the HBS approach, let P be Japan’s consumer price level and P*

that of the United States, with E the price of yen in terms of dollars. Then the real

exchange rate of the yen against the dollar (defined so that an increase is a relative real




                                              28
depreciation of the yen) is q = EP*/P. In this notation, a rise in E (nominal yen

depreciation) or rise in P*/P (fall in Japan’s relative money price level) lowers the price

of consumer goods in Japan compared to the U.S.

       Each country’s consumer price level, in turn, depends on the domestic price

indexes for tradable and nontradable goods, denoted PT and PN for Japan and PT* and PN*

for the United States. In general, as shown by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007, p. 356), a

useful approximation for the change in the log yen real exchange rate is

                                         PN* / PT*           EPT* 
                ∆ log q ≈ (1 − γ )∆ log             + ∆ log       ,                  (4)
                                         PN / PT             PT 

where γ is the share of tradables in the CPI (the same in the two countries). This equation

discloses the two main determinants of the real exchange rate: the international ratio of

relative nontradables prices, and the relative international price of tradables.

       The HBS theory presumes that the law of one price holds for every tradable good

and that consumers in the two countries have identical preferences over the tradable

goods. Thus, EPT* = PT , so that the HBS theory operates entirely through the

determination of the relative price of nontradables in terms of tradables. There is

considerable evidence, however, that relative international tradables prices vary greatly,

at least for some country pairs and over some horizons. Moreover, they tend to covary

positively and strongly with nominal exchange rates, so that nominal yen depreciation,

for example, raises the price level of tradables in Japan relative to tradable price levels

abroad. For Japan, the terms of trade closely mirror the evolution of the exchange rate,

with nominal (and real) yen depreciation generally associated with deterioration in

Japan’s terms of trade – a rise in import price relative to export prices. I temporarily put



                                              29
this evidence aside to focus on the HBS predictions about relative nontraded-goods

prices, predictions that are quite robust as longer-term predictions and are broadly

consistent with data from many countries.

         Over a sufficiently long horizon – one in which goods prices are flexible and

domestic factor markets can adjust to ensure the equality of factor rewards across sectors

of the economy – relative productivity growth is a prime determinant of the first term on

the right-hand side of equation (4). To see this, assume that outputs in the tradable and

nontradable sectors are given by the constant-returns production functions of capital and

labor:

                                       YT = AT F ( KT , LT ) ,
                                       YN = AN G ( K N , LN ) ,


where AT and AN measure total factor productivity (TFP).21 Let µ LT denote labor’s

income share in tradables, µ LN its share in nontradables, and x̂ the proportional rate of

change of variable x. Furthermore, define the relative price of nontradables as p ≡ PN / PT .

Proceed as in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, Section 4.2.1) but allow for the possibility that

both the real (tradable) wage w and the real (tradable) return to capital r can change. Log

differentiation of zero-profit conditions, assuming firm optimization and free domestic

factor mobility, yields:




21
  It would be simple to include nontraded goods as an input to tradables (think of retailing services
required to deliver tradables to final consumers). That change would not alter the main qualitative
predictions concerning relative sectoral TFP and the relative price of nontradables, but it would place a
wedge between different countries’ price indexes for tradable consumption. That additional wedge would,
however, depend mainly on relative nontradables prices.


                                                    30
                         AˆT = µ LT ( wˆ − rˆ ) + rˆ,
                                                                                                      (5)
                         pˆ + Aˆ N = µ LN ( wˆ − rˆ ) + rˆ.

Combining these, one obtains a relationship linking the change in the real exchange rate

to relative TFP growth,

                         pˆ = AˆT − Aˆ N + ( µ LN − µ LT ) ( wˆ − rˆ ) .                               (6)

In general, the change in p depends not only on the sectoral difference in TFP growth, but

also on the evolution of the wage-rental ratio, with a rise in the latter raising p when

nontradables are relatively labor intensive.22 If there are significant movements in relative

factor rewards over time and intersectoral differences in functional income shares, then

the relation between the relative price of tradables and sectoral TFP growth rates may not

be straightforward. Evolution in the relative price of nontradables will depend exclusively

on differential TFP growth only in very special cases, for example, when sectoral factor

shares are the same.

         One way to circumvent the problem is to focus on labor productivity rather than

total factor productivity, as Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (1999) do. That approach

potentially confounds long-term TFP movements with other factors, but it has a number

of countervailing advantages, as Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba show.

         To understand their approach, note that along the economy’s long-run production

possibilities frontier, p equals the ratio of labor’s marginal physical productivity in

22
  One could solve for the endogenous wage-rental ratio in terms of exogenous variables by imposing
further structure on the consumption side and assuming a balanced growth path, as Asea and Mendoza
(1994) do, but at the cost of restricting generality. For my purposes it is not necessary to follow that route.
In the context of a growth model, and assuming a balanced growth path with a constant marginal product of




                                                      31
tradables to its marginal physical productivity in nontradables. Let f ( kT ) ≡ F ( KT / LT ,1)

and g ( k N ) ≡ G ( K N / LN ,1) . Under the tentative assumption that marginal labor products

are proportional to average labor products, one can therefore write


                                 AT  f ( kT ) − f ′ ( kT ) kT  ϕ AT f ( kT )
                          p=                                         =
                                 AN  g ( k N ) − g ′ ( k N ) k N  ψ AN g ( k N )


for suitable constants φ and ψ. Log differentiating this expression, one finds that


                       pˆ = AˆT + (1 − µ LT ) kˆT −  Aˆ N − (1 − µ LN ) kˆN  .
                                                                            


Here, AˆT + (1 − µ LT ) kˆT is the growth rate of (average) labor productivity in tradables (in

contrast to TFP in tradables), whereas Aˆ N + (1 − µ LN ) kˆN is the growth rate of labor

productivity in nontradables. (In general, labor productivity growth rates exceed TFP

growth rates when there is capital deepening over time.)

         The earlier tentative assumption that marginal and average labor products

coincide can hold true only if the last equation is the same as equation (6). Let σ T and σ N

be the elasticities of factor substitution in the traded and nontraded goods sectors. Then

one can express the last equation in terms of factor-price changes as




                                                                                          µ      
capital r, equation (5) would imply that wˆ = AˆT / µ LT . Accordingly, (6) implies pˆ =  LN  AˆT − Aˆ N . This is
                                                                                            µ LT 
the formula in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, Chapter 4) for the case of a constant world real interest rate.


                                                        32
             pˆ = AˆT + (1 − µ LT ) σ T ( wˆ − rˆ ) −  Aˆ N − (1 − µ LN ) σ N ( wˆ − rˆ )  .


This equation is valid – that is, it agrees with equation (6) – when (and only when)

σ T = σ N = 1. Thus, for Cobb-Douglas production functions, the long-run relative price of

nontradables depends exclusively on differential labor-productivity growth in

nontradables and tradables. I will assume that Cobb-Douglas production functions

adequately represent Japanese industry.

         Below I explore the relationship between the preceding labor productivity

differential and the yen’s real exchange rate. One point to notice, however, is that for the

tradable and nontradable sectors, short-term movements in labor productivity and TFP

are very highly positively correlated. The six panels of Figure 10 (a through f) illustrate

this correlation for the tradable and nontradable sectors of Japan, the United States, and

Germany. Productivity growth rate data are from the EU KLEMS database (URL:

http://www.euklems.net/, March 2008), and sectoral value-added productivity figures are

constructed from less aggregated industry figures using a Törnqvist index with value-

added weights.23 As an example, for Japanese tradables the contemporaneous correlation

coefficient between labor productivity and TFP growth rates is 0.95; for Japanese

nontradables the corresponding correlation coefficient is 0.94. Note that, as the HBS

literature suggests, productivity growth in tradables is generally higher than that in



23
  Tradables consist of agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing; mining and quarrying; total
manufacturing; and electricity, gas, and water supply. Nontradables consist of construction; wholesale and
retail trade; hotels and restaurants; transport, storage, and communication; finance, insurance, real estate,
and business services; public administration and defense; compulsory social security; education, health, and
social work; and other community, social, and personal services.

nontradables, with the implication that the relative price of services should rise

secularly.24



Evidence on HBS and Its Component Sub-theories

For much of its postwar history Japan was a poster-child for the HBS theory. In an early

study, Hsieh (1982) derived a one-factor version of the HBS theory and tested it on labor

productivity data for Japan and Germany versus aggregates of major trading partners. For

his study, tradables were defined as manufacturing and nontradables as

nonmanufacturing. The theory received support for both countries, but over a sample

period (1954-1976) containing very few observations from the post-1973 floating

exchange rate era. As I argue below, however, deviations from the HBS model are likely

to be larger and more persistent under floating exchange rates.25

         Marston (1987) offered the first detailed study of Japan based on a substantial

span of data from the floating exchange rate period (1973-1983). Marston found that in

the U.S. over that period, tradables productivity growth exceeded that in nontradables by

13.2 percent. For Japan, he found that the same cumulative differential was 73.2 percent.

Japanese relative nontradables prices rose by 56.9 percent as opposed to only 12.3

percent in the U.S, The yen appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar in real terms.

These results seemed strikingly to confirm the HBS approach.26


24
   Lee and Tang (2007) find that logarithmic levels of TFP and labor productivity need not be highly or
(even positively) correlated for the U.S. and Germany, although they are for Japan. In panel regressions on
an industrial-country sample, they find that labor productivity variables and TFP variables have opposite
effects on real exchange rates.
25
   Hsieh’s findings in support of HBS went against previous negative cross-section work reported by
Officer (1976).
26
   In a related vein, Yoshikawa (1990) claimed an important role for relative labor productivities in
determining the long-run nominal yen/dollar exchange rate over 1973-87. Yoshikawa’s model assumed an
average law-of-one-price relationship for tradables, and allowed for changes in the relative price of energy


                                                     34
        Subsequent research has focused on larger samples of countries. De Gregorio,

Giovannini, and Wolf (1994), using the newly assembled OECD sectoral database for

1970-85, showed a strong relationship between differential sectoral TFP growth and the

growth of relative nontradables prices for a sample of 14 countries including Japan. They

did not look explicitly at real exchange rates. Asea and Mendoza (1994) reached similar

conclusions regarding relative sectoral prices levels within the OECD sample, but found

that TFP differentials were much less useful in understanding even low-frequency

movements in real exchange rates.

        That failure is not surprising in view of equation (4), as a major role in

movements of the real exchange rate, alongside that of relative sectoral prices, is played

by the relative international price of tradables. Under floating exchange rates, the latter

relative price is highly correlated with the nominal exchange rate in the short run, and

hence is much more volatile than either of the relative prices p and p* that enter the first

right-hand term in (4). The volatility in relative international tradables prices, to some

degree, reflects widespread violations of the law of one price; it also reflects terms of

trade changes (given international differences in consumer preferences) as well as the

nontradable content of final “tradable” consumption goods. Engel (1999) argues that even

over longer horizons, variation in the relative international prices of tradables dominates

real exchange rate movements of the United States dollar; this point has implications for

the yen that I will explore later. Were Hsieh’s (1982) tests to be carried out over post-




inputs. Rather than focusing on relative productivity in nontraded and traded sectors, however,
Yoshikawa’s model focuses on the relative importance of labor and energy in producing export goods. I
return to the importance of energy prices below.


                                                   35
1973 data, it seems certain that any measured effects of intersectoral productivity

differentials would be swamped by the influence of nominal exchange rate movements.27

        Many recent studies employ error-correction models to look for cointegrating

relationships among real exchange rates and the other variables that underlie the HBS

model. The basic presumption of these models is that real exchange rates contain unit

roots. While the unit-root hypothesis has proved difficult to reject in the spans of data that

are typically used, the question of mean reversion in real exchange rates in fact remains

quite open, with many researchers believing in some degree of slow mean reversion, a

belief derived in part from the analysis of longer time series samples. Thus, Taylor and

Taylor (2004, p. 154) describe as a “consensus view” the propositions “that short-run

PPP does not hold, that long-run PPP may hold in the sense that there is significant mean

reversion of the real exchange rate, although there may be factors impinging on the

equilibrium exchange rate through time ….” It should be kept in mind that the statistical

tests described next all rely on the hypothesis that real exchange rates and their

determinants are I(1) random variables,

        Retaining a focus on the OECD sectoral data but working in terms of labor

productivity as noted above, Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (1999) looked separately at the

two components of the HBS model: the ability of sectoral productivity differences to

explain the relative price of nontradables in terms of tradables, and the validity of

purchasing power parity (PPP) with respect to indexes of tradables prices. Using 1970-

1993 data, carry out a panel cointegration analysis aimed at ascertaining long-run

dynamic features of the data record. They found that relative sectoral prices and relative


27
   Park and Ogaki (2007) caution, however, against drawing long-run implications from data samples of the
size that Engel uses.


                                                   36
productivities were cointegrated with a coefficient near 1.0.28 However, nominal

exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were not cointegrated with tradables prices relative

to those of the U.S. Interestingly, the hypothesis of PPP for tradables fared much better

when Germany rather than the United States was used as the comparison country. Kakkar

and Ogaki (1999), also using cointegration techniques, explicitly studied long-run

comovements in real exchange rates and relative nontradables prices. Their long data

sample, ranging from as early as 1929 to the late 1980s, contained several spans with

fixed exchange rates. Particularly in floating-rate data, they found mixed support for a

close long-run relationship between relative nontradables prices and real exchange

rates.29 This is consistent, once again, with a large role for nominal exchange rate

movements in driving deviations from PPP for tradable goods. In a panel cointegration

study covering 48 countries, Ricci, Milesi-Ferretti, and Lee (2008), relate real exchange

rates to a range of explanatory variables. They find a statistically significant productivity

effect consistent with the HBS theory, but regard it as relatively small in magnitude.30

        A number of studies focus explicitly on real exchange rates of East Asian

countries. Some authors, such as Chinn (2000, p. 20), argue that “The East Asian

economies are exactly the type for which Balassa posited the relevance of the HBS effect:

economies characterized by rapid growth, presumably due to rapid manufacturing—and

hence traded—sector productivity growth.” Ito, Isard, and Symansky (1999), Drine and

Rault (2003), and Thomas and King (2004), however, all find mixed evidence concerning

the HBS theory. Chinn (2000) himself studies the bilateral real exchange rates of a group


28
   Kakkar (2003) established the same result for a model based on TFP measures.
29
   Similarly mixed evidence is found by DeLoach (1997), who uses CPI/WPI ratios to proxy relative
nontradables prices.
30
   Further analysis and discussion can be found in Lee et al. (2008).

of nine East Asian countries, including Japan and China, against the U.S. dollar. He finds

that for Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines, the real exchange rate is cointegrated with

relative sectoral labor productivities based on a 1970-93 sample. He notes, however, that

real exchange rates display protracted swings away from the levels predicted either by

relative nontradables prices or by relative productivity levels. Kakkar and Yan (2006)

assemble a disaggregated data set of TFPs for Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea. Malaysia,

Singapore, and Thailand, They find that in panel data, real exchange rates appear

cointegrated with relative sectoral productivity differentials, but whereas long-run PPP

for tradables appears reasonable when East Asian currencies are compared to the yen, it

fails when the dollar is the comparison currency. This difference could result from the

closer trading linkages among the East Asian countries, including Japan.31 Choudhri and

Khan (2005) present a panel study of 16 emerging market countries, including some in

East Asia, over 1976-94. They find that bilateral real exchange rates against the dollar are

related to relative nontraded goods prices and that the latter are, in turn, related to relative

labor productivity as the HBS theory suggests, but they do not test directly for a link

between real exchange rates and relative sectoral productivity differences. They also find

a role for the terms of trade in determining real exchange rates. Chen and Rogoff (2003)

document a positive and significant HBS effects in the bilateral real exchange rates of

Australia and New Zealand against the United States.




31
     Kakkar and Yan (2006) combine the equations in (5) by eliminating wˆ − rˆ rather than r̂ . The result is

pˆ =        AT − A N +  LT          rˆ , rather than equation (6). The authors then work with the level form of
       µ LT              µ LT       
this equation under the hypothesis that the real return to capital, r, is an I(0) random variable. Their
methodology obviously obliges them to supply labor-income shares in tradables and nontradables.


                                                          38
        The body of evidence on the HBS theory indicates a definite connection between

international differences in relative sectoral productivity levels and international

differences in the price of nontraded in terms of traded goods. The connection seems

valid whether productivity is measured by output-labor ratios or by TFP. Direct linkages

between productivity variables or relative price variables and real exchange rates is more

tenuous, especially under floating nominal exchange rates, because of large and persistent

deviations from purchasing power parity for tradables; see equation (4). These deviations

may limit the usefulness of the HBS theory for explaining or predicting real exchange

rates over all but the longest horizons. PPP for tradables – and therefore the HBS

connection between relative productivity levels and real exchange rates – may hold more

closely for pairs of countries with relatively extensive mutual trading links.



Sectoral Productivity and the Yen’s Real Exchange Rate

A real yen appreciation caused by high productivity growth in tradables would not

undermine the competitive position of Japanese exporters. The available evidence

indicates, however, that at least in the short run, episodes of sharp yen appreciation have

indeed harmed the fortunes of Japan’s manufacturing exporters, with negative

implications for overall Japanese economic growth (as suggested by Figure 1). Dekle and

Fukao (2008) document how the yen’s 1985-95 appreciation raised average costs levels

in Japanese industries relative to those in the United States.

        A first regularity to examine is the short-run relationship between real exchange

rate movements and changes in the HBS relative productivity variable, which I define in

                                                       (        )
                                                                               (         )
terms of relative labor productivity as YˆT − LˆT − YˆN − LˆN − YˆT* − Lˆ*T − YˆN* − Lˆ*N  . In
                                                                                           



                                                  39
practice, I take Japan as the home country and take the “starred” foreign country to be

either the U.S. or Germany. Figures 11a and 11b, respectively, plot the data, which show

no evidence of short-run positive correlation. Indeed the sample correlation coefficients

are slightly negative, equal to −0.14 for the comparison with the U.S. and to −0.16 for the

comparison with Germany. These short-term comovements are the opposite of what the

HBS theory predicts as a longer-term correlation.

           In the short term, when prices are sticky and factors are immobile between

sectors, real yen appreciation reduces the demand for Japanese exports and puts

downward pressure on exporters’ profit margins. This account is consistent with the

evidence in Dekle and Fukao (2008). The appreciation could result from monetary factors

as discussed earlier, from changed perceptions of the long-run equilibrium real exchange

rate, or from shifting risk premia. Faced with reduced demand, Japanese exporters react

immediately by reducing levels of capacity utilization and working existing labor pool

less intensely. These adjustments, in turn, lower measured productivity, whether

measured as TFP or as labor productivity.

           For the United States, Basu (1996) has made a compelling case that procyclical

rates of factor utilization play the main role in explaining the observed high degree of

procyclical overall productivity.32 His analysis uses data on material inputs effectively to

track firms’ use of capital and labor inputs. It would be interesting to use methods like

Basu’s to more closely isolate the exogenous technological shocks driving observed




32
     See also Basu and Fernald (2001). For a related analysis using Japanese data, see Vecchi (2000).

productivity movements in traded and nontraded sectors. The resulting data would deliver

a sharper test of the HBS theory.

       In Figures 11a and 11b, real exchange rate movements are more volatile than the

contemporaneous movements in international relative productivity ratios. The latter are,

however, still surprisingly large. A yen appreciation lowers demand for tradable goods

and may raise the demand for nontradables. To the extent that slow growth in the export

sector depresses overall demand, however, any resulting rise in the cyclical component of

nontraded-sector productivity may be dampened. In fact, over 1978-2005, the correlation

between changes in Japanese tradable and nontradable productivity is only 0.05,

effectively zero.

       An analysis of longer-term changes in productivity levels and real exchange rates

gives a sense of whether the historical trends are consistent with the HBS theory. For this

purpose, I use the log levels version of equation (4), taking γ = 0.25 and identifying the

relative prices p and p* with the tradables-to-nontradables labor productivity ratios.

Figures 12a and 12b present the data for the comparison of Japan against the U.S. and

Germany, respectively, over the nearly three decades from 1978-2005. Against the U.S.,

over this entire period, Japan experiences a small real depreciation and a small decline in

the HBS relative intersectoral productivity variable. In the interim, however, the swings

away from “Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson” parity are huge and persistent. On this metric,

the yen was about 50 percent “undervalued” during the strong dollar of the Reagan years,

and about 40 percent “overvalued” during the height of the mid-1990s appreciation,

which pushed Japan into protracted deflation. The “overvaluation” of the first endaka

fukyo of the late 1980s is comparatively small and briefer, as is the “overvaluation” that




                                             41
emerges after the Asian crisis (August 1998−December 1999, described as Period 4

above). In all of these episodes, often identified as misalignments, sharp movements in

the yen’s nominal exchange rate were associated with commensurately sharp movements

in relative international tradables prices. As in equation (4), those developments helped to

drive the real exchange rate far from the HBS benchmark. I return to this point in the next

section, which explicitly introduces international trade in different products.

         Figure 12a shows that in many of the subperiods of the 1978-2007 span, the yen’s

evolution vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar is in fact the opposite of what the HBS theory would

imply. I have already observed (in connection with Figures 11a and 11b) that year-to-year

changes in bilateral real exchange rates and the bilateral HBS productivity variable are

slightly negatively correlated. The correlation between log levels in Figure 12a is a much

more dramatic –0.46. Furthermore, the relevant productivity trends seem quite minor in

magnitude compared to the long swings in the exchange rate – for example, over the

1995-2004 subperiod, when the HBS theory does get at least the direction of change in

the real exchange rate right. But the magnitude is way off. Changes in real exchange rates

are more volatile than changes in productivity, yet are quite persistent.33 Lane (2008)

finds that the yen’s multilateral real exchange rate is positively and significantly related

to a multilateral HBS variable, but all in all, there is little evidence that this relationship is

important for the bilateral yen rate against the dollar.




33
  Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap (2008) observe that from the early 1990s to the early 2000s, there was
positive TFP growth in Japanese manufacturing while TFP stagnated in nontraded sectors such as
construction. They attribute this in part to the concentration of “zombie” firms in nontraded sectors. Taken
alone, this pattern would cause a real yen appreciation according to the HBS theory. However, U.S.
productivity developments also played a role. Furthermore, Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap argue that
sectors heavily populated with zombie firms could be characterized by excessive supply and hence lower
prices.


                                                    42
       The bilateral real exchange rate of the yen against Germany puts the HBS theory

in a slightly better light; see Figure 12b. The real exchange rate still fluctuates about the

HBS trend, but the departures are smaller and less persistent than in the yen/dollar case.

Notable examples of “misalignment” – in the narrow sense of a significant departure

from the HBS trend – are the yen’s real depreciation against the deutsche mark at the

time of the second oil shock of the late 1970s, real appreciation in the mid-1990s (less

pronounced than that against the United States), and a substantial real appreciation

around the launch date of the euro in 1999. Notwithstanding the negative correlation in

annual changes shown in Figure 11b, the correlation between log levels is strongly

positive and equal to 0.61, which is suggestive a reasonably strong HBS effect over the

medium term.

       An interesting question is why HBS has a bit more success in explaining swings

of the Japanese currency against Germany than against the United States. Canzoneri,

Cumby, and Diba (1999) likewise found that convergence to PPP for tradables held more

closely when they compared OECD countries to Germany, rather than the U.S. As the

world’s premier exporter, Germany’s integration into global markets exceeds that of the

larger and more insular United States economy. This may explain the greater apparent

coherence between world and German tradables prices, which, in turn, might reduce the

size and persistence of departures from an HBS benchmark. An interesting general

question is whether predictions of the HBS theory holds more closely for economies that

are more open to international trade.

       The figures leave open the possibility that the real exchange rate might appear to

be cointegrated with the HBS relative productivity variable, Lane (2008), who examines




                                              43
the real effective CPI exchange rate in a multivariate context using an effective HBS

variable as a regressor, finds this to be the case. However, Figures 12a and 12b suggest

that HBS factors could have little explanatory power for real exchange rates over

medium-term horizons, and that forecasters would face considerable uncertainty in

predicting when a real exchange rate might converge near to the HBS benchmark.34



Overall Productivity and the Yen’s Real Exchange Rate

        Another regularity worth noting is the relationship between overall productivity

growth measures and the real exchange rate, shown in Figure 13. As argued by Hayashi

and Prescott (2002), Japan’s stagnation has been characterized by a reversal in the earlier

increasing trend of TFP relative to the United States. In addition, overall labor

productivity leveled off in the mid-1990s (again relative to the U.S.).

        The arc of relative productivity is roughly captured by the real exchange rate – in

a manner more consistent with the Kravis-Lipsey effect (price levels are relatively low in

relatively poor countries) than with the HBS effect.35 One channel through which overall

productivity growth could affect the real exchange rate is through the terms of trade. The

strict HBS theory’s apparent assumption that terms of trade movements are unimportant

for the real exchange rate, except insofar as they affect productivity growth, is quite

wrong for Japan, as I document next. No discussion of the real exchange rate is complete

unless one integrates the implications of international trade in heterogeneous goods.




34
  Two important future research issues are to take into account both the endogeneity of the traded versus
nontraded categories, as well as the importance of nontraded distribution services in determing the
consumer price of tradable goods. See also Lee and Tang (2007). Devereux (1999) presents a model in
which endogenous growth of the distribution sector affects the path of the real exchange rate.

Long-Term Trends in the Yen: International Trade.


           The simplest versions of the HBS theory ignore variation in the relative prices of

different tradable goods. There is considerable cross-country evidence, however, that

such variation is an important (if not dominant) source of real exchange rate variation. In

turn, that evidence makes it plausible that factors related to international trade can help

explain the real exchange rate deviations in Figures 12a and 12b.



The Yen’s Real Exchange Rate and the Terms of Trade

           A very basic fact about the yen’s real exchange rate is that its level has an

extremely high positive correlation with Japan’s terms of trade – the ratio of export price

to import prices.

           Figure 14 graphs both the terms of trade and the yen’s real effective exchange rate

based on unit labor costs in Japan and its main trade partners (these are monthly data in

logs). In the figure, the terms of trade measure is constructed as an aggregate export price

index divided by an aggregate import price index (both from IMF, International

Financial Statistics), so that a rise in the terms of trade causes a welfare-enhancing shift

in Japan’s national budget constraint. Evidently, the terms of trade closely mirror both the

trends and cycles in the real exchange rate; the correlation between the two series’ log

levels is 0.75. This measure of the overall terms of trade – despite including volatile

components such as oil prices – generally shows somewhat less volatility than the real

exchange rate. Were the export and import indexes restricted to manufactured products,

the resulting terms of trade measure would be much less variable, as is shown below.


35
     I am grateful to Mick Devereux for discussions on this point.


                                                       45
       An important empirical mechanism behind the high correlation displayed in

Figure 14 is that the terms of trade and the real exchange rate both respond, and in the

same direction, to shocks to the nominal exchange rate. With pervasive labor-cost

stickiness, no segmentation between domestic and export markets, and producer-currency

pricing of exports, both the real exchange rate based on unit labor costs the terms of trade

would both move in proportion to a nominal exchange rate change, whatever its cause.

       Let us provisionally maintain the assumptions that there is no international market

segmentation and no pricing to market in order to gauge their usefulness in explaining

how the terms of trade and the real exchange rate are related in the data. For this purpose,

I focus on bilateral comparisons between Japan and the U.S. or Germany, assuming for

simplicity a Cobb-Douglas form for various price indexes.

       Retaining the earlier notation, I assume that overall CPI P for Japan is given

by P = PTγ PN1−γ . If PX is the price index of Japanese exports and PM the Japanese export

index, then the price index for tradables is PT = PXα PM1−α . Once again, the provisional

assumption behind this definition – one that I will modify later – is that exporters do not

price to market, so that the price of exported goods is the same as that of exportables sold

domestically. The terms of trade are PX / PM . Parallel price indexes characterize foreign

countries.

       The real exchange rate (expressed as the price of the foreign CPI in terms of

Japan’s) is:

This equation shows that the bilateral real exchange rate between Japan and a foreign

competitor is the product of three factors. First is the relative price of Japanese exports in

head-to-head competition with the other exporter, EPX* / PX . A rise in domestic export

prices relative to foreign export prices raises the relative domestic price level for

tradables, reducing q (a real appreciation in the present notation). A second international

trade factor entering the real exchange rate reflects a comparison of the Japanese and

price of nontradable and tradable production, the focus of the HBS model.

         A related calculation shows the role of the terms of trade in determining the

(multilateral) real effective exchange rate, denoted qm. In essence this approach uses the

calculation from Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007), assuming (purely for notational parsimony)

that Japanese exports play a negligible role in the rest of the world’s tradable

consumption, so that PT* = PX* = PM / E. In that case the real effective exchange rate is:


36
  In models such as that of Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007), PM = EPX* and α > 1/ 2, so a rise in import prices
implies real currency depreciation.

This expression shows that, other things equal, a fall in the terms of trade (a rise

that is likely to be large.

        Taking the tradables share in the CPI to be γ = 0.25 in equation (7) and the export

bilateral real exchange rate. In constructing this variable, I use aggregate export and

import price indexes for Japan, the United States, and Germany.

        Figure 15a shows the result for yen/dollar pairing. (The figure graphs all variables

in logs.) The constructed data for the log relative tradables price is positively correlated

with the real exchange rate (the correlation coefficient is 0.40), but the series of

international tradables prices is less volatile than the real exchange rate – as was the

overall terms of trade in comparison to the effective real exchange rate. When the relative

tradables component is added to the HBS component graphed in Figure 12a to form a

composite simulated real exchange rate, the fit is worsened compared to that of the

tradables component alone (consistent with the findings of Engel 1999 for the U.S.).

        The figure illustrates how inaccurate are our temporary assumptions on the

international pricing of tradable goods, which rule out internationally segmented markets



                                                            48
and the resulting pricing to market by imperfectly competitive manufacturing exporters.

Although, at least some of the strong correlation between real exchange rates and terms

of trade is due to nominal exchange rate movements driven by asset-market shocks,

pricing to market tends to make the non-commodity terms of trade smoother than the real

exchange rate in practice; see Atkeson and Burstein (2008) for a recent discussion. When

the yen appreciates in nominal terms against the dollar, Japanese exporters lower the yen

prices of exports relative to domestic sales, whereas U.S. exporters raise the dollar prices

of their exports to partially exploit their enhanced competitiveness. Thus, in terms of

equation (7), when E falls, the ratio PX* / PX . rises, muting (but not reversing) the impact

of the nominal yen appreciation on the head-to-head competitiveness measure EPX* / PX .

Were these pricing-to-market effects absent, the relative tradables price in Figure 15a

would track the real exchange rate much more closely.

       Indeed, the two most glaring deviations in the figure are the endaka fukyo

episodes of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Japanese exporters suffered compressed

profits as they lowered yen export prices in the face of a sharply appreciating currency.

       In the Japan/Germany pairing in Figure 15b, the correlation between the relative

tradables price and the real exchange rate is 0.62, considerably higher than in the U.S.

case. But in addition, the HBS variable now actually improves the composite simulation’s

ability to track the real exchange rate. Pricing to market behavior is still very evident,

however, particularly during the euro’s sharp depreciation in the years immediately

following its introduction. Once one allows for pricing to market, the large deviations

between the real exchange rate and the HBS benchmark appear to be substantially

accounted for (at least in a mechanical sense) by nominal exchange rate movements. One



                                              49
would reach the same conclusion using equation (8) to construct the real effective

exchange rate.

        While these results are illuminating, they do not provide a truly causal account of

the yen’s evolution because the terms of trade and nominal exchange rate, like the real

exchange rate, are endogenous and jointly determined, even at low frequencies. Only

exogenous shocks to the terms of trade can be identified with confidence as causal drivers

of the yen’s long-term evolution.



Oil and the Yen

        The leading candidate for an exogenous cause of the close correlation in Figure

14 is the world price of energy. Over the last three decades, the share of mineral fuels in

total Japanese imports has ranged from 50.6 percent in 1981 to 15.9 percent in 1995 and

27.7 percent in 2007. Japan’s high dependence on energy imports compared to its many

of its trading partners suggests several mechanisms through which world energy prices

could affect the real exchange rate.37

        Figure 16 shows monthly log levels of the yen price of oil in terms of Japan’s PPI

and the effective yen real exchange rate based on normalized unit labor costs. Here the

real exchange rate is plotted on an inverted scale, so that a move upward in the figure is a

real depreciation. The data start in January 1978. The correlation coefficient between the

two series, equal to –0.83, is remarkably high in absolute terms, indicating a strong

tendency for the yen to be relatively weak when the price of oil is relatively high.




37
  Amano and van Norden (1998) contend that oil prices Granger cause real exchange rates but not vice
versa.


                                                  50
Evidently, an exogenous rise in the world price of oil causes a real yen depreciation.38

Observe, however, that the real oil price is several times more variable than the real

exchange rate – indeed, much of the variability in Japan’s comprehensive terms of trade

is due to energy, which currently carries a weight above 0.25 in the overall import price

index published by Japan’s government. 39

         Recently several papers have documented the strong effect of a dominant

commodity export price on the exporter’s real exchange rate.40 From this perspective, the

yen appears to be a “commodity currency” on the import side. Although commodity

terms of trade appear to be an important determinant of real exchange rates in broader

samples of countries (see Ricci, Milesi-Ferretti, and Lee 2008),41 the close link between

the yen and energy prices evident in Figure 16 is especially striking. The main departure

from the dominant pattern appears to be in the period from late 1997 to late 1999. Over

those months, the yen first depreciated sharply under the pressure of low interest rates




38
   Lane (2008) documents an empirical relationship between the real price of oil and the yen real exchange
rate within an error-correction model.

   Rogoff (1992, p. 18) displayed a similarly high correlation for the period 1975-90, as did Amano and van
Norden (1998) for 1973-1993 data. (The latter authors also show a high correlation for the deutsche mark,
and present regression evidence consistent with their graphical findings. They interpret that evidence as
showing that a 10 percent rise in the real oil price causes a 1.7 percent real yen depreciation.) What is
remarkable is that the correlation shown by Rogoff and by Amano and van Norden has held up so well over
many more years and several further cycles in the yen exchange rate. As noted above, the real oil price
measure I use is the yen price of oil divided by the Japanese PPI. That variable is roughly congruent to the
yen real exchange rate multiplied by the real dollar price of oil (in terms of a U.S. price index). One might
worry that because my measure includes the log real yen exchange rate as an additive factor, it is not really
exogenous with respect to the real exchange rate; furthermore, the close correlation in Figure 15 could in
theory be driven mostly by variability in the real exchange rate. These theoretical possibilities are not
significant in practice because the world oil price is so much more variable than the real exchange rate. The
correlation between the real exchange rate and the real dollar price of oil (in terms of the U.S. CPI) is –
0.79, only slightly less in absolute value than the correlation cited in the text. Indeed, Rogoff (1992)
graphed the bilateral real yen/dollar CPI exchange rate against the world price of oil in terms of the U.S.
CPI. His discussion of the relation between the two variables focuses on HBS productivity effects.
40
   See, for example, Chen and Rogoff (2003) and Cashin, Céspedes, and Sahay (2004).
41
   See also Kohli and Natal (2008), who find no significant role for the HBS effect in determining the real
exchange rate of the Swiss franc, but do detect a strong terms-of-trade effect.

and domestic financial turmoil while the price of oil fell in the backwash of the Asian

crisis; afterward both the yen and the price of oil recovered lost ground.

        Figure 17 graphs annual data on the real effective exchange rate (starting in

1975), the overall terms of trade, and an “ex-oil” terms of trade measure adjusted to

remove energy prices.42 The terms of trade less energy are much less variable than the

overall terms of trade, and, as is typical of industrial countries, much less variable than

the real exchange rate (Atkeson and Burstein 2008). Indeed, it is apparent that

fluctuations in energy prices are responsible for most of the variance in Japan’s terms of

trade. The correlation between even the ex-oil terms of trade and the real exchange rate

(in log levels) is high (0.56), but not as high as that between the overall terms of trade and

the real exchange rate (0.77 in annual data). Thus, the oil price is an arguably exogenous

variable with a quantitatively important impact on the real exchange rate.

        While a broad-based deterioration in the terms of trade directly enters the real

exchange rate through the first multiplicative factor on the right-hand side of equation

(8), the same formula cannot be mechanically applied to the case of an energy-price

increase. Taken alone, and absent changes in the prices of other tradable and nontradable

goods, that shock might not have positive impact on the relative foreign price level for

tradables, and therefore it might not result in a rise in qm (an effective yen depreciation).

The root cause of the high correlation shown in Figure 16 is therefore likely to lie in other

factors that transform the real exchange rate over time and move the nominal exchange

rate in the short term.

  Makoto Hosoya at the Price Statistics Section of the Bank of Japan graciously provided disaggregated
historical data underlying the BOJ’s import and export price indexes. The component weights allowed me
to strip out energy prices.

          A primary mechanism through which energy prices could affect the long-run real

exchange rate is through the HBS channel, which modifies the second multiplicative

                                               (P        / PX* )

factor on the right-hand side of equation (8),                       . Let us now write the
                                                  ( PN / PX )
                                                               1−γ

inputs,

                                    YN = AN G ( K N , LN , OT ) ,


and denote the world price of oil in terms of tradable goods by pO. With the simplifying

assumption of a constant rental rate on capital ( rˆ = 0 ), the change in the relative price of

                            µLN ˆ ˆ           µ    µ 
nontradables will be pˆ =       AT − AN + µLN  ON − OT  pˆO. To the extent that tradables are
                            µLT                µLN µLT 

relatively energy intensive and nontradables relatively labor intensive, a rise in the energy

price lowers the relative price of nontradables. If this effect operates asymmetrically

across countries because, for example, Japanese manufacturing is more energy intensive

than manufacturing abroad, a real depreciation of the yen would result. That mechanism

works, however, by lowering manufacturing wages and is likely to play out only over

time (though it might well affect long-term real exchange rate expectations immediately).

In an analysis based on relative labor productivities (rather than TFPs), the effect of

energy prices would work entirely through labor productivity. A rise in energy prices

would lower relative labor productivity in the energy-intensive tradable sector and cause

a real depreciation. The incorporation of energy prices into the standard HBS framework




                                                53
would not alter Figures 12a or 12b at all, although some of the productivity changes

shown would be attributable to changing energy prices.

        The high correlation in Figure 16 plausibly also reflects other mechanisms

operating in the short term. 43 If wages are sticky and labor immobile in the short run

between the economy’s sectors, a rise in energy prices raises production costs and

potentially creates unemployment. In this circumstance, real yen depreciation can

substitute for a reduction in wages, shifting world demand toward Japanese exports and

shifting Japanese demand toward Japanese nontradables. Because an oil shock is a global

shock, however, this mechanism relies on the fact that Japan is more energy-dependent

than most other energy importers.44 Other potential channels for energy prices (or

commodity prices in general) to influence the real exchange rate rely on wealth effects, as

postulated by Ricci, Milesi-Ferretti, and Lee (2008). If market participants view higher

energy prices as permanent, they might also adjust their expectations of long-run capital

intensity and possibly growth downward, with immediate repercussion on the real

exchange rate.45 Through myriad channels, the price of oil has had a decisive influence

on the yen’s real exchange rate over the period of this study, with the yen generally

depreciating when the real price of oil is rising and appreciating when it is falling.




43
   These short-run effects are strengthened if monetary policy systematically responds expansively to
increases in the oil price.
44
   Findlay and Rodríguez (1977) present a short-term Mundell-Fleming type model that can deliver this sort
of result.

   Sachs (1983) explores a growth model with flexible exchange rates and energy inputs.

Secular Deterioration in Japan’s Terms of Trade

       Between 1988 and 2007, Japan’s comprehensive terms of trade declined by more

than 54 percent (in log points). The decline in the ex-energy terms of trade, at only about

18 percent, is much less dramatic; see Figure 17. Much of the latter decline occurred after

1994, and it has arguably contributed to the yen’s real depreciation since then. Any

definitive account of Japan’s terms of trade would require a close analysis of

disaggregated import and export price and quantity data, an undertaking that is beyond

the scope of this paper (but a very worthy area for future research). Here I simply offer a

few observations and conjectures.

       IMPLICATIONS OF SLOWER GROWTH AND REDUCED INNOVATION. Slower growth

and dynamism in Japan’s economy may have resulted in relatively more growth along the

intensive than the extensive margin. Krugman (1989) has emphasized that growth in

exports of new products need not depress the terms of trade, in contrast to growth at the

intensive margin. Thus, a reduced pace of growth and innovation in Japan could

contribute to declining terms of trade.

       An additional implication of slower growth is that imperfectly competitive

Japanese exporters could have experienced declining market power in world markets,

leading to lower export prices. As noted above, pricing-to-market appears to be

widespread in global markets for manufactures, a fact that has inspired theoretical

analyses over more than two decades, ranging from Dornbusch (1987) and Krugman

(1987) to Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Burstein and Jaimovich (2008). In a model of

Bertrand competition among sellers, in which buyers have a constant elasticity of




                                             55
substitution ε among varieties of a good, the markup charged by a monopolistic producer

of a particular variety is given by


                                    price        ε (1 − s )
                                              =               ,
                                 marginal cost ε (1 − s ) − 1


where s is the exporter’s global market share. Between 1993 and 2003, Japan’s share in

world exports of manufactured goods declined from 12.5 to only 7. 5 percent (Gaulier,

Lemoine, and Ünal-Kesenci 2007),46 while Japan’s share in world income likewise

declined. This dynamic would have led to lower markups over time; and with labor costs

and markups both declining, export prices had to fall as well. Intuitively, the pricing

decisions of a larger player have bigger effects on the global price index for the good,

thereby reducing the perceived price elasticity of demand. As the Japanese economy

shrank, Japanese exporters therefore perceived increasingly intense competition abroad.

         CHANGING TRADE PATTERNS AND CHINA’S ROLE. China’s emergence as a leading

exporter no doubt has numerous implications for Japan’s economy. Chinese export

products display a surprisingly large overlap with those of OECD countries (Schott 2006;

Amiti and Freund 2009; Wang and Wei 2009), so it is conceivable that the country’s

rapid export growth has undercut the prices of Japanese exports. Coleman (2007)

develops a global growth model in which such effects drive resource reallocation among

trade partners. He argues that price and production trends in Asian-Pacific countries are

broadly consistent with the model’s predictions.




46
  Interestingly, and possibly relevant to the terms-of-trade trend, Japanese imports as a share of world
imports declined by much less in percentage terms, from 5.1 to 4 percent.


                                                     56
           Japan’s trade patterns have indeed changed radically since the mid-1990s, with a

general reorientation of its import and export trade toward Asia and significant changes

in the composition of its trade. Japan now exports more parts and components and semi-

finished goods relative to capital goods, with much of the flow going to China for

processing, assembly, and re-export. At the same time, Japan’s imports have swung

toward parts and components and capital goods produced in China. These changes have

been driven by a number of factors, including structural changes within Asia, greater

regional integration, and the birth in 1995 of NAFTA, the trade-diverting effects of which

have helped make North America less important in Japan’s trade.47

           The implied terms of trade changes are not obvious a priori. Japanese exporters

may have faced downward price pressure in the course of trade re-orientation, but

China’s goods (including its exports to Japan) are priced quite competitively in world

markets (Schott 2006). In light of the dramatic change in trade patterns, one must be

cautious in interpreting movements in aggregate export or import price indexes, as

emphasized by Weinstein and Broda (2009). One must also question even more strongly

any identification of export prices with consumer prices for tradable goods. Eichengreen,

Rhee, and Tong (2007) conclude that on balance, China’s export growth has had more

important consequences important for low-income Asian countries than for higher-

income Asian countries such as Japan.

           There is another important channel through which China’s torrid growth through

mid-2008 affected Japan’s overall terms of trade: by pushing up global commodity

prices, notably the price of energy.

Conclusion



The recent history of the yen suggests prolonged departures from longer-run trends,

especially with respect to the U.S. dollar. These departures cannot be explained reliably

even after the fact, but they appear to be related to macroeconomic policy actions, both in

Japan and abroad, and to market expectations of future policies.

       In Japan’s economic history after the generation and collapse of the great asset

price bubble, the yen’s strong real appreciation in 1990-95 stands out as a pivotal

episode. From the point of view of the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson theory, prior sectoral

growth trends changed around this time, and it is doubtful that foreign exchange market

participants were able to foresee these structural shifts. Against the United States, relative

tradables productivity growth actually went into decline, whereas against Germany it

leveled off, as Figures 12a and 12b show. To the extent that foreign exchange markets

were mistakenly expecting a return to previous growth trends, the yen’s expected future

real exchange rate could have been artificially high. Short-term monetary developments

may have reinforced the latter stages of this appreciation, and trade tensions with the

United States certainly played a role, as discussed above. In any case, the strong yen

appreciation helped propel the Japanese economy into stagnation and deflation.

       The yen’s trend depreciation since early 1995 is more easily justifiable in terms of

the underlying evolution of sectoral productivity growth and of overall growth in Japan

and its trading partners. Japan’s terms of trade have declined along with the yen’s real

exchange rate, and have contributed to the latter depreciation trend. Real yen depreciation

after 1995 has to some degree bolstered the economy through export promotion, though




                                             58
renewed trade friction with the United States remains a threat. The yen’s sharp

appreciation late in 2008 in the midst of the global financial crisis, coupled with the

collapse of the Asian and American markets for Japanese exports, has once again thrown

Japan into deep recession.
