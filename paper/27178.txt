                                         ABSTRACT

Research on the quantitative impact of interwar protection on trade flows remains scarce, and
much of it has concluded that the impact was surprisingly small. In this paper we ask: Did Indian
interwar protection hurt UK manufacturers, by raising tariffs on manufactured imports? Or did it
favour UK interests, by discriminating against "foreign" (i.e. non- British) producers? We answer
this question by quantifying the impact of trade policy on the value and composition of Indian
imports, using novel disaggregated data on both trade policies and imports for 114 commodity
categories coming from 42 countries. Indian trade elasticities were generally larger than those in
the United Kingdom at the same time. We find that even though Indian protection lowered total
imports, it substantially boosted imports from the UK. Trade policy had a big impact on trade
flows.

1      Introduction
What was the impact of protectionism on trade during the 1930s? Despite their
ferocious reputation, empirical work quantifying the effects of interwar tariffs
and quotas remains scarce. This is surprising since the 1930s saw trade policies
fluctuating violently, offering a promising setting for trade economists wishing
to estimate trade elasticities and the impact of protection. Such work as has
been done has typically found smaller effects than might have been expected.1
To take one prominent example, Irwin (1998) finds that the bulk of the 1929-33
US trade collapse was due more to the GDP collapse of the period than to an
increase in trade frictions. To take another, Eichengreen and Irwin (1995) find
little evidence that imperial and regional trade blocs distorted the geographical
pattern of trade during the 1930s: the countries involved had already traded
disproportionately with each other in the 1920s, prior to the introduction of
discriminatory trade policies.2
     Most empirical work on the subject has focussed on rich countries, and more
particularly on the United Kingdom and United States. But what about the
developing world? As Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016, p. 181) point out, "trade
elasticity estimates may vary by sector, time, and country. This makes careful
empirical work that exploits trade policy variation in order to identify the trade
elasticity/ies more important." Imbs and Mejean (2017) find that sectoral trade
elasticities were typically much higher in developing than in developed countries
around the turn of the twenty-first century. On the other hand, Sequeira (2016)
finds very low trade elasticities in a study of southern Africa. India is a rare
example of a developing nation that adopted protectionist policies during the
1930s: was their impact large or small?
     The question is particularly interesting since there has been sharp disagree-
ment regarding not only only the size, but also the sign, of the impact of Indian
protection during this period. The issue concerns the effects of Indian tariffs
on British manufacturers in general, and on the textile producers of Lancashire
in particular. Did Indian tariffs hurt UK manufacturers as some have claimed?
Did London foolishly allow Indian policy-makers to deprive it of crucial markets
during a very difficult period? Or did supposedly independent Indian policies in
fact help British interests, as Indian nationalists have consistently maintained?
    1 Irwin(2012) provides an excellent survey.
    2 Madsen (2001) and Kitson and Solomou (1990) provide dissenting voices. See also, inter
alia, Estevadeordal, Frantz and Taylor (2003), Gowa and Hicks (2013), and Wolf and Ritschl
(2011).



                                             1
Or, to take a third possibility, were Indian trade policies of little relevance to
outcomes either way?
    While there is an abundant historical literature on the politics of Indian in-
terwar trade policy, there has been much less work on the consequences of that
policy.3 Assertions abound however. For example, Dewey (1978, p. 36) states
that higher Indian tariffs "ejected Lancashire from its largest export market".
Drummond (1972, pp. 123-4) similarly suggests that Indian tariffs, facilitated
by the "British self-denying ordinance" that was the fiscal autonomy convention
(see Section 2), and "helped now and then by the organized boycotts of British
goods and Gandhi's cottage-industry campaigns", helped explain the decline
in Britain's textiles exports to India. Sandberg (1974) argues that tariffs and
boycotts were both important in explaining the decline in Lancashire's exports
to India.4 In sharp contrast, Chaudhuri (1983, p. 869) suggests that Imperial
Preference may have boosted Britain's share of Indian imports, while Rother-
mund (1988, p. 110) argues that the quotas on Japanese cotton exports to India
enabled the British "to recover a great deal of the ground that they had lost
both to Indian and to Japanese competition in previous years".
    The only quantitative study of the impact on trade flows of Indian interwar
protection that we are aware of is Wolcott (1991). She estimates partial equi-
librium import demand curves for British piece goods, British gray goods, and
British bleached goods. Demand depends on real Indian income, the price of
raw cotton, and the price of British textiles relative to other consumer goods.
The price of US cotton and British wages are used as instruments for British
prices. In addition a time trend is added to account for secular trends in the
cotton industry, and level shift terms are introduced in 1920 and 1930. The lat-
ter are taken to represent inter alia the impact of Gandhi's 1920-22 and 1930-31
boycotts. On the basis of her estimates Wolcott concludes that 82% of the de-
cline in the Indian demand for British piece goods was due to the increase in
the tariff from 11 to 25%. Indian protection hurt the British producer.
    In this paper we extend the analysis in several ways. First, we look at the
impact of Indian protection not just on imports of cotton textiles, but on im-
ports more generally. We do so using a newly created dataset giving imports into
British India of 114 consistently-defined commodities from 42 countries over the
15 years 1923-4 to 1937-8.5 Generating these data required typing information

on imports of 202 sub-categories of goods from 63 countries or sub-regions. Sec-
ond, we look at imports not just from the United Kingdom but from the 41 other
countries in our dataset, and we take account of Indian trade policies affecting
those countries also. Using data on trade and trade policy that is disaggregated
by commodity and country is crucial, since as de Bromhead et al. (2019) show
doing so can matter greatly for the estimated impact of protection. Third, when
estimating our trade elasticities we control for the impact of civil disobedience
campaigns on trade flows, allowing for the possibility that these were different
in the short and long run. We also control for a variety of other variables, in-
cluding cartels affecting trade in particular commodities. And fourth, we embed
our econometrically-estimated elasticities in a well-specified general equilibrium
model that allows for substitution between varieties of the same goods coming
from different countries, substitution between different goods, and substitution
between imports in general and domestically produced goods. We find that
Indian protection depressed overall imports (our median estimate is that pro-
tection lowered imports by around 10%), but substantially boosted imports from
the United Kingdom. Our median estimates suggest that total British exports
to India were increased by over 20%, and UK cotton cloth exports to the country
by roughly 50%: these impacts were equivalent to around 2% of aggregate UK
exports, and 10% of UK cotton cloth exports, to all destinations. Contrary to
previous findings that interwar protection did not have a significant quantitative
impact on trade flows, these are big effects.
    We begin with a brief description of Indian trade policy during the period (in-
terested readers may prefer to read the more detailed and self-contained account
in Appendix 1). Section 3 outlines our theoretical framework, and introduces
the key elasticities which matter for our results. Section 4 describes the data
which are used to estimate those elasticities in Section 5. Section 6 derives the
main results of our paper, and Section 7 concludes.


2     Indian trade policy
Indian import tariffs had traditionally been low, reflecting the country's colonial
status and the liberal inclinations of the British imperial power.6 Land, opium,
and salt provided the bulk of the Indian government's revenues in the nineteenth
and ending on March 31.
   6 While we make extensive references to the secondary literature below, an invaluable source

remains the Indian legislation of the period.

century: customs duties only accounted for 10% of government revenue in 1860-
61, and just 5% ten years later (Kumar, 1983, p. 916). On the eve of World War
1 India was still virtually a free-trading country, and such tariffs as were levied
were designed to raise revenue rather than to protect domestic industries.7
    The war was an important turning point. The war effort required revenue,
and Indian tariffs were accordingly increased: customs duties accounted for
20% of Indian government revenue during 1916-20 (Mukherjee, 2001, pp. 731-
2). Nor did conflict end in 1918: war with Afghanistan in 1919 was followed
by a campaign in Waziristan which lasted into the following year. By 1922
the general tariff stood at 15%, with cotton yarn and cotton piece goods being
subject to duties of 5% and 11% respectively (Dewey 1978, pp. 43-4; Mukherjee
2001, p. 732).8 Indian cotton textiles were now enjoying substantial protection,
despite the fact that tariffs were being imposed for revenue reasons (Drummond,
1972, p. 123).
    The war also "produced a landslip in official attitudes to protection" (Dewey,
1978, p. 45). Total war highlighted the desirability of developing Indian heavy
industry, while the belief in laisser faire was shaken. Even more importantly,
perhaps, Indian nationalist demands were strengthened by the country's con-
tribution to the war effort. In August 1917 the Secretary of State for India,
Edwin Montagu, stated that the UK favoured "the progressive realization of
responsible government in India as an integral part of the Empire."
    In 1919, a British Joint Select Committe stated that "Nothing is more likely
to endanger the good relations between India and Great Britain than a belief
that India's fiscal policy is dictated from Whitehall in the interests of the trade
of Great Britain. That such a belief exists at the moment there can be no
doubt...Whatever be the right fiscal policy for India, for the needs of her con-
sumers as well as for her manufacturers, it is quite clear that she should have the
same liberty to consider her interests as Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and South Africa." It thus proposed (and the government subsequently
agreed) that the British government "should as far as possible avoid interfer-
ence on this subject when the Government of India and its Legislature are in
agreement" and that any such intervention "when it does take place, should be
   7 Act XIV of 1899 allowed the government to impose countervailing duties in cases where

other governments were subsidising exports to India. Act VIII of 1902 allowed the government
to impose duties on imported sugar from countries protecting domestic sugar production by
more than a specified amount.
   8 The rate on sugar was increased to 25%, and that on luxury goods to 30%, while tariffs

on a range of iron and steel products were raised from 2½ to 10%.

limited to safeguarding the international obligations of the Empire or any fiscal
arrangements within the Empire to which His Majesty's Government is a party"
(U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1919, p. 11).
    This recommendation, accepted by the British government in 1921, that
Britain acknowledge India's right to "fiscal autonomy" took the form of a "con-
vention" rather than a statute, since the latter would have limited "the ultimate
power of Parliament to control the administration of India" and "the power of
veto which rests in the Crown". Indian historians have pointed out that the
Government of India was supposed to consult the British government before
tabling fiscal policy proposals, and have argued that the British government
de facto retained significant control over Indian trade policy (Mukherjee, 2001,
pp. 734-5). Yet the succeeding two decades saw the gradual development of far
more interventionist trade policies on the sub-continent.
    In 1922 the Indian Fiscal Commission recommended protection for Indian
industries on classic infant industry grounds (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1922
Sess II).9 Protection was to be resorted to "with discrimination", since indis-
criminate protection "would protect industries unsuitable as well as suitable,
and would impose on the consumer a burden in many cases wholly gratuitous"
(p. 49).10 In 1923 the Indian government accepted this recommendation, and
a Tariff Board was set up to implement it, although it was not as independent
of government as had been envisaged in the report. Eleven industries obtained
protection from the Tariff Board before the outbreak of World War 2: cotton,
iron and steeel, sugar, paper, matches, salt, heavy chemicals, plywood and tea-
chests, sericulture, magnesium chloride, and gold thread. Rice and wheat were
also singled out for protection (Tomlinson, 1979, pp. 61-2). In some cases the
tariffs involved were very high.
    The new Tariff Board's first task was to consider the case for protection of
the iron and steel industry. In June 1924 tariffs were introduced ranging from
15 to 25% ad valorem.11 In 1927 protection for the industry was extended for a
further 7 years, and importantly the duties were now "differential", which is to
    9 That is to say, Indian industries concerned would have to possess "natural advantages",

require protection to be able to develop in the first place, and would eventually be competitive
in world markets.
  10 Somewhat confusingly, therefore, the proposed policy was described by contemporaries as

one of "discriminatory protection". Notably, 5 Indian members of the 11-member Commission
argued for an unqualified commitment to protection (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1922 Sess
II, pp. 175-212). Roy (2017) provides a sympathetic account of the policy of discriminatory
protection.
  11 Act XIV. Several specific tariffs were also introduced.

say that they were in many cases lower for goods "of British manufacture". The
argument was that differential protection was required since British steel was
tested according to the British Standard Specification, and was more expensive
to produce and of higher quality than cheaper, "untested", Belgian steel (Wagle,
1981; Roy, 2017).12 This legislation marked a break with the past: previous
attempts to introduce Imperial Preferences of any kind had fallen foul of Indian
nationalist opinion (which objected in this instance also, albeit unsuccessfully).
    Protection for the Indian cotton industry also increased over time in response
to worsening market conditions and concerns about unfair competition (due to
inferior labour conditions) from East Asia.13 In April 1930 duties on British
piece goods were increased to 15% , with duties on foreign piece goods being
raised to 20%. The legislation also specificied a minimum specific tariff of 3½
annas per pound on all imported plain grey piece goods, no matter what the
origin, which was non-discriminatory enough to get the measure passed by an
Indian Legislature hostile to Imperial Preference (Act XVII of 1930). In March
1931 the general tariff was raised to 20%, and the tariff on cotton piece goods
was raised to 20% for British goods, and 25% for non-British goods. On the
30th of September these duties were further raised by a quarter, implying a
general tariff of 25%, and duties for British and non-British piece goods of 25%
and 31¼% respectively.14
    In October 1931 a National Government committed to Imperial Preference
was elected in Britain. An Imperial Economic Conference was held in Ottawa
the following summer, at which an Anglo-Indian trade deal was signed. The
agreement granted continued tariff-free access to the UK market for those Indian
goods that had been temporarily exempted from a general 10% tariff introduced
in February, and maintained or improved preferences on a wide variety of Indian
exports to Britain. In exchange India granted tariff preferences to a large range
of UK exports, and in some cases to exports from British colonies (as opposed to
Dominions). These margins were generally 10% ad valorem, although in some
cases (notably motor cars) the margin was 7½%. The agreement did not, how-
ever, prevent India from raising tariffs in the future, so long as these preference
margins were maintained (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1931-32b; Drummond,
1972, p. 131). Nor did the agreement deal with cotton textiles, since in April
  12 TISCO  was at this stage the only Indian producer capable of making "tested" steel.

we largely draw.

1932 the Indian Tariff Board had been asked to report to the Indian Government
on the subject; Lancashire interests hoped that the outcome would be greater
tariff preference for British textiles in the Indian market.
    In December 1931 Japan quit the gold standard and the yen started to
depreciate. On August 30, 1932 the Indian duty on all non-British cottons was
increased from 31¼ to 50% (the Indo-Japanese trade treaty of 1904, which had
granted most-favoured-nation status to Japan, made it impossible to single out
Japanese goods for special attention).15 The increase was only until March 1933,
but in March the 50% tariffs were extended through October. The following
month India gave Japan six months notice of its intention to denounce the 1904
treaty, which would allow it to discriminate against Japanese imports; later
in the same month the Safeguarding of Industries Act empowered the Indian
Governor General to impose "a duty of customs of such amount as he considers
necessary to safeguard the interests of the industry affected", in cases where
goods were being imported "at such abnormally low prices that the existence
of an industry established in British India is thereby endangered" (Act XIII).
In May 1933 the UK increased the pressure on Japan by giving twelve months
notice of its intention to denounce those portions of the Anglo-Japanese trade
treaty dealing with West Africa and the West Indies (Best, 2002, p. 83). On
the 7th of June the tariff on non-British cotton goods was increased to 75%.
    Japan reacted to the increased tariff on non-British goods, in part by boy-
cotting Indian raw cotton, but also by opening trade negotiations with India
(Drummond, 1972, pp. 132-4; Rothermund, 1988, pp. 109-10; Chatterji, 1992,
pp. 378-80). The outcome was a trade agreement which came into effect on
January 8, 1934. This lowered the Indian duty on foreign piece goods to 50%,
in exchange for quotas on Japanese exports of piece goods to India linked to
Japanese imports of Indian raw cotton (Chatterji, 1992, p. 395).
    In January 1935 the Indian government agreed as a general priciple that
protective tariffs should be lower on UK than on other goods, although in the
following year the Legislative Assembly asked the Indian government to de-
nounce the Ottawa Agreement. There followed a long series of trade negotia-
tions between the British and Indian governments that eventually resulted in a
1939 trade agreement reducing the range of British imports accorded preferen-
  15 Not unreasonably, the Japanese protested against the fact that tariffs on British goods

were not being increased. This was dismissed by the British who took the view that preferences
in India on British goods were not inconsistent with the UK's treaty obligations to Japan,
presumably since British goods were not of "foreign origin" (Chatterji, 1992, p. 378).

tial treatment in India. Chaudhuri's (1983, p. 869) overall assessment is that
"India, even before the Second World War, was coming closer towards the adop-
tion of a much more positive policy of controlling her international economy,
which was to become characteristic of official thinking after Independence".


3    Theoretical framework
As the previous section has made clear, Indian trade policy became increasingly
protectionist, and also more complicated, over the course of the 1920s and 1930s.
Tariffs were increased on a wide range of goods, and they were raised more on
imports from "foreign" countries than on British imports. Higher tariffs lowered
imports, and a partial equilibrium analysis such as Wolcott's will necessarily
conclude that they lowered UK exports to India. But tariffs which discriminated
in favour of UK goods may have induced substitution towards British imports,
potentially giving British exporters a larger share of a shrinking pie. What was
the net effect of these countervailing forces?
    In order to answer this question we need a model of the Indian economy: ide-
ally a general equilibrium model with many goods originating in many countries
being imported, and with corresponding domestic sectors producing these goods
in India. We do indeed have data on Indian imports of many goods from many
countries, which will be described in Section 4, but we lack Indian production
data at the same level of disaggregation. We therefore construct a model similar
in structure to that used by de Bromhead et al. (2019), and which resembles
in many respects the model of Broda and Weinstein (2006), whose notation we
largely use.
    In particular, we consider a representative agent characterized by a nested
CES utility function, represented in Figure 1. At the top level they choose
between the domestically produced good D and an aggregate import good M ,
with the elasticity of substitution between these two goods being denoted by
. At the second level the aggregate import good is a CES composite of 114
different imported goods, with the elasticity of substitution between these being
set equal to  . And at the third level each of the 114 goods is an Armington
aggregate of up to 42 varieties, each coming from a particular source country.
The Armington elasticity of substitution betwen the different national varieties
of good g is denoted by g .
    The supply side is extremely simple and resembles that used by Anderson

and Neary (1996): a single factor of production (which we can think of as GDP)
is transformed into an export good X and a domestically-consumed good D, via
a constant elasticity of transformation production function (with the elasticity
of transformation equal to  ). The export good is sold to provide the foreign
exchange used to buy imports (we assume that trade is balanced).
    When protection increases, the main determinants of the impact on the
total value of imports will be the ease with which the consumer can substitute
towards the domestically produced good, and the ease with which the economy
can meet this additional demand for D. The key elasticities determining the
response of aggregate import values to an increase in protection will thus be 
and  , although all of the elasticities matter to some extent. On the other hand,
the fact that preferences are homothetic implies that  and  are irrelevant to
the share of trade coming from a particular country, such as the UK. The key
elasticities determining that will be the g 's, although  will also matter.
    In order to calibrate the model we need information on benchmark imports of
all goods from all countries in all years, as well as information on the consump-
tion of the domestic good and estimates of the elasticities. The next section
describes the data we use, while Section 5 derives the elasticities.


4     Data
In order to calibrate the model we need four types of information: imports by
commodity and country; trade policy (chiefly tariffs, but also information on
non-tariff barriers to trade) by commodity and country; Indian consumption of
the domestic good D; and the elasticities described in Section 3. In this section
we describe the data sources used to obtain information on the first three of
these items, which are also used to derive the elasticities in Section 5.


4.1    Trade data
The basic problem with historical trade data is that the trade classifications
used by the relevant national authorities are consistent neither across countries
nor over time. However, it is sometimes possible to construct import data that
correspond to SITC categories: doing so requires that the trade categories re-
ported at the time fall entirely within particular SITC categories and that the
available data allow us to capture all imports falling within a given SITC cat-
egory. We collected data on all Indian imports, between 1923-4 and 1937-8,


                                       10
in 35 distinct 3-digit SITC categories.16 These categories were chosen because
of their importance in world trade generally, and also because it was possible
to consistently calculate import values for each.17 In order to accomplish this
we hand collected import data from various volumes of the "Annual Statement
of the Sea-Borne Trade of British India with the British Empire and Foreign
Countries".18 For each year we collected import values for up to 202 individual
product categories from 63 countries/sub-regions. In principle this implied col-
lecting 190,890 datapoints, although product categories tended to change over
time, some vanishing and others appearing, implying that the actual number of
datapoints collected was rather smaller. In addition, many observations were
zero. We were able to aggregate the 202 individual product categories to pro-
duce import data for 114 product categories which are consistently defined over
time.19 It is these 114 categories which can in turn be aggregated up to our
35 SITC 3-digit categories. For example, our good number 261001, "Silk, raw",
was constructed using eight separate items which appear in the trade statistics
between 1923 and 1937, namely "Silk, raw", "Silk. Waste", "Textiles. Silk. Raw
and cocoons", "Textiles. Silk. Waste and noils", "Textiles. Silk. Silk, raw and
cocoons", "Textiles. Silk. Waste products, including duppion", "Textiles. Silk.
Silk, raw and cocoons, Hand reeled" and "Textiles. Silk. Silk, raw and cocoons,
Other Sorts". A complicating factor for this good was the fact that the statis-
tics reported an increasingly detailed disaggregation over time, two items at the
beginning, and four at the end. It is due to such time-varying disaggregation
that we have to aggregate the 202 narrower product categories into a broader
and consistently defined set of 114 product categories. Thankfully, there are
also series which are presented consistently over time, and for which there is
   16 Indian trade statistics were compiled for fiscal years, beginning on April 1 and ending on

March 31. We are using the original Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 1,
based on Statistical Office of the United Nations (1951, 1953).
   17 That is, sub-categories of trade we needed to compute these values fell neatly within our

3-digit SITC categories, rather than spanning two or more categories; and we were able to
capture all of the imports within each 3-digit category.
   18 Prior to financial year 1937-38, the statistics in these volumes referred to the trade not only

of British India proper, but of Burma as well. They thus excluded trade between British India
and Burma. From 1937-38 onwards, the trade statistics of Burma were published separately.
This meant that the Indian statistics included the trade of British India with Burma, and
excluded the direct trade of Burma with other countries. The figures recorded in the 1937-
38 volumes were therefore not comparable with those for the earlier volumes. To make the
figures comparable across volumes, we additionally hand collected trade data from the Annual
Statement of the Sea-Borne Trade and Navigation of Burma for 1937-38. We used these
statistics to net out trade between British India and Burma, and to add trade between Burma
and the rest of the world to the Indian totals.
   19 These 114 categories are the narrowest for which it was possible to generate consistent

data over time.

only one original trade statistics item corresponding to one of our 114 product
categories. Examples of such categories include "Cotton, raw" and "Wool, raw".
   When estimating elasticities we will distinguish between nine broader cat-
egories of goods (see footnote 23 below). Appendix 2 provides full details of
how we aggregated the original published trade statistics to produce our final
dataset, while Appendix 3 lists the 42 partner countries used in our analysis.
   Figure 2 shows that the total value of imports in our sample, and the total
value of imports in the official trade statistics, track each other closely. Our
sample captures between 54% and 67% of all Indian imports. Figure 3 shows
that our sample does a good job of matching the British Empire's share of total
Indian imports.20

Tariff information was obtained from various volumes of the Indian Trade Jour-
nal. The tariff rates for a given year were published in the supplement to the

Trade Journal's final volume of the previous year. We also looked at amend-
ments made to the Indian Tariff Act which were mentioned in the Indian leg-
islation from this period to check for any changes in tariff rates that came into
effect in the middle of the year. To account for these mid-year changes we took a
weighted average of rates in place prior to and after the change with the weights
determined by the month in which the changes took effect.21
    While tariff rates for some product categories mentioned in the Indian Trade
Journal corresponded well with the product categories in the import data, there
were cases where the tariff rates were for either a broader or a narrower product
category relative to the product categories in our import data. For example,
tariff information was given for "Grain and pulse, all sorts, including broken
grains and pulse, but excluding flour" which was broader than the corresponding
import product categories. In this case the rates were applied to all individual
products falling under the Grain and Pulse category, unless there were specific
  21 Our trade policy data are thus for calendar years starting on January 1, while our trade

data are for fiscal years starting on April 1. Since trade policy might be expected to influence
trade flows with a lag we decided to use calendar year tariff data as a base case. In Appendix
5 we show that using fiscal year tariff data makes little difference to our results.

exemptions.
    Alternately, in cases where tariff information was given for narrower product
categories, an unweighted average of the rates was used for the broader import
categories. For example, tariff information was given for "Cotton twist and yarn,
and cotton sewing or darning thread, of counts above 50s" and "Cotton twist
and yarn, and cotton sewing or darning thread, of counts below 50s" which are
narrower than the product category "Textiles. Cotton. Twist and Yarn" in our
import data. In this case the rates used for Cotton, Twist and Yarn are an
unweighted average of the rates of the two categories mentioned above.
    While tariffs were mainly ad valorem, for certain goods there were specific
rates in place and for some goods there was a mix of both specific and ad
valorem rates. Specific rates were expressed in ad valorem terms by dividing
the specific rates by the unit value of imports (import value divided by import
quantity). Information on non-tariff barriers (in particular the quota agreement
with Japan) were obtained from the sources used in Section 2, and are listed
(along with the information we use on boycotts and cartels) in Appendix 4.


4.3    Consumption of the domestic good D
The Net Domestic Product (NDP) of British India (not including Burma) is
taken from Sivasubramonian (2000, pp. 429-30). However, as mentioned in
footnote 18 above, our trade data include imports into Burma. Hlaing (1964,
p. 143) provides NDP data for Burma for the years 1921-22, 1926-27, 1931-32,
1936-37, and 1938-39. This allows us to adjust "Indian" NDP upward so as to
include Burma for these five years, and we compute adjustment factors for the
intervening years via geometric interpolation (the combined total is around 5%
higher than the NDP for British India alone). In order to compute consumption
(and production) of the domestically produced and consumed good D we simply
subtract the total value of imports from NDP. We make one adjustment to the
data: since our import data only cover a (large and representative) sample of
all Indian imports, we scale NDP down so as to match the actual import/NDP
ratio when calibrating our CGE models.


4.4    Other data
In our regressions estimating the i 's we also controlled for exchange rates and
the nominal GDP of trade partners. Nominal exchange rates were calculated
as annual averages of closing daily exchange rates and were taken from Global

                                       14
Financial Data.22 Nominal GDP was taken from Klasing and Milionis (2014),
adjusted for interwar borders using the adjustment coefficients from Broadberry
and Klein (2012).


5      Estimating the elasticities
In this section we describe how we estimate the elasticities embedded in the
model described in Section 3. In order to take account of the fact that they are
estimated imprecisely we perform systematic sensitivity analysis when doing
counterfactual analysis (Hillberry and Hummels, 2013, 1243-4). That is, we
repeatedly draw values for these elasticities from normal distributions, with
means equal to the point estimates of the elasticities, and standard deviations
equal to the standard errors of the coefficients. We are therefore interested in
both the point estimates and standard errors of all elasticity estimates in what
follows.


5.1      Estimating the g 's
In order to estimate the g 's we proceed as in de Bromhead et al. (2019). Our
import data are c.i.f., and valued at world prices inclusive of transport and other
trade costs not related to Indian trade policies. We are not interested in these
costs since we are holding them fixed in our analysis. Following Anderson and
Yotov (2016), and Baier, Kerr and Yotov (2018), we should ideally be estimating


                                                                            n

imports of good g from country c face barrier i in year t, and zero otherwise;
Pgt is the inward multilateral resistance term for good g in India in year t; gct
is the outward multilateral resistance term for good g in country c in year t; and
ugct is the error term. Ideally we should be estimating g separately for each of
our 114 goods g .
    There are four practical problems which we face. The first is that we only
have import data for India, implying that we cannot include all the desired
fixed effects (in particular, those varying by good, country, and year). We
therefore incorporate fixed effects which vary by good and year, dgt . These
control for Mgt , Ygt , and Pgt in equation (1). Intuitively, by controlling for the
total imports of particular goods in particular years we are focussing on the
margin of substitution between different national varieties of the same good,
which is what we want to do when estimating the g 's. We also include fixed
effects which vary by good and country, dgc . By including such variety fixed
effects we are ensuring that identification occurs along the time dimension alone,
an important consideration given the possibility that some varieties may have
faced systematically higher tariffs over time than others.
    Second, we lack data on foreign output of individual goods (Ygct ) and there-
fore have to make do with including foreign GDP (i.e. we replace Ygct with
GDPct in equation (1) above). We also control for the bilateral exchange rate,
Ect .
    Third, we should ideally be estimating g separately for each of our 114
goods g , but we lack the degrees of freedom to do this. We therefore follow
de Bromhead et al. (2019) by estimating across nine categories of goods h,
assuming a common elasticity h for all goods within a category (i.e. g =
h g  h). The nine categories are grain, animal products, machinery, minerals,
textiles, miscellaneous inputs, miscellaneous industry, food oils, and colonial
goods.23
    Finally, there are very strong time trends in the data: in particular, the
shares of several imports from the UK were systematically trending down across
  23 `Grain' includes barley, wheat and rice (SITC categories 041-043); `Animal' includes butter

and meat (SITC categories 012 and 023); `Machinery' includes SITC categories 711, 712, 714-
716, and 721; `Minerals' includes metals, coal and petroleum (SITC categories 311-313, 681,
and 682); `Textiles' includes both yarn and cloth (SITC codes 651-653); `Miscellaneous inputs'
includes such items as fertilisers, rubber, hides and skins, raw cotton and silk, and hair (SITC
codes 211, 231, 261-263, 271, and 561); `Miscellaneous industry' includes vehicles and rubber
manufactures, including tyres (SITC codes 629, 713, and 732); `Food oils' includes oils and
oilseeds of various kinds (SITC codes 221 and 412); and `Colonial' includes coffee, sugar, tea
and tobacco (SITC categories 061, 071, 074, and 121).




                                              16
our period. We therefore include country-specific time trends in all regressions.
   Our estimating equation is thus:


                  W
             ln(Vgct ) = ln(GDPct ) + ln(Ect ) - h ln(1 + tgct )
                              n
                       - h         ln(bi )igct + dgt + dgc + dc × trend + ugct   (2)
                             i=1




where good g is a member of goods category h, and where dc × trend represents
country-specific time trends. The non-tariff barrier that we consider is the quota
on textile imports from Japan, which came into effect in 1934. We also consider
three control variables which enter into the econometric specification as if they
were non-tariff barriers. These are the League of Nations trade sanctions against
Italy which operated from November 1935 to June 1936 (we let a dummy variable
be equal to one in 1936 for all imports coming from Italy in that year); the
various cartel arrangements of the period involving India or Indian producers;
and the boycott of UK cotton cloth which began in 1930.24 We allow the
latter to have a differential impact in 1930 and subsequent years, including two
variables in the regression for this purpose. We follow Santos Silva and Tenreyro
(2006) and use a PPML estimator to estimate (2). Since we are including both
114 × 42 = 4, 788 good times country fixed effects, and 114 × 15 = 1, 710 good
times year fixed effects, as well as country-specific time trends, we estimate
the equations using the ppmlhdfe estimator available in Stata (Correia et al.
2019a,b).25
    The results are given in Table 1. Italian sanctions were extremely effective,
and the boycotts lowered imports of British cotton cloth, but we found no
effect of cartels on trade flows. The key elasticities are the coefficients on the
tariff variable, which are our estimates of the h 's. We were unable to estimate
these for three commodity categories (grain, animal products, and miscellaneous
inputs) for the simple reason that there was no between-country variation in
tariff rates for those products (i.e. there was no discrimination involving these
goods). For the other six categories the estimates seem sensible: the elasticities
range from a minimum of 4.0 (textiles) to a maximum of 23.1 (miscellaneous
industry). The coefficients on the quota and tariff variables in column (5) jointly

imply (from equation 1) that the quota on Japanese piece goods was equivalent
to a 19.1% ad valorem tariff.26
    Table 2 compares our Indian trade elasticities with those obtained for the
UK by de Bromhead et al. (2019). Consistent with Imbs and Mejean (2017),
the Indian elasticities are in general larger (food oils being a striking exception).
For the three categories for which we were unable to calculate Indian elasticities
(grain, animal products and miscellaneous inputs) we used the British estimates.
This should not matter for the results: the h 's matter when calculating the
impact of tariff discrimination, but there was no discrimination for these three
categories of goods which is why we could not calculate the elasticities. We also
calculated the h 's using OLS rather than PPML, and Appendix 5 shows that
our results are robust to doing so.


5.2     Estimating 
We also estimated , the upper level elasticity of substitution between imports
and domestic expenditure.
   The most straightforward method was simply to run the OLS regression

                               ln(mt ) = -ln(1 + tt ) + ut                                 (3)

where mt is the value of imports in year t expressed as a share of total private
expenditure on both domestic and imported goods, ut is the error term, and tt
is the unweighted average tariff estimated for our sample of goods. The method
produced an estimate of  of 1.073, with a standard error of 0.376.27


5.3     Choosing values for other parameters
We assume that  , the mid-level elasticity of substitution between different
Armington aggregates of imported goods, is equal to 1. Appendix 5 shows that
our qualitative results are insensitive to varying this elasticity.28
  26 Similarly the boycott was equivalent to a 15.6% tariff on British cloth in 1930, and a

23.9% tariff in subsequent years.
  27 Total private expenditure on domestic goods was calculated by multiplying GDP by the

ratio of gross output to GDP at factor cost in 1951-2, and then subtracting the value of total
exports (both government and private). Gross output was taken to be equal to GDP at factor
cost plus total material inputs into all sectors. The 1951-2 input-output data are taken from
Ramana (1969, pp. 46-7). Sources for interwar GDP are as given in Section 4.3 of the text.
The aggregate Indian trade data are taken from the Annual Statement of the Sea-Borne Trade
of British India.
  28 de Bromhead et al. (2019) estimate  using the methods of Ottaviano and Peri (2012).

This involves estimating equation (2) for all nine categories of goods and extracting the goods

    Finally, we need to choose values for  , the supply-side elasticity of transfor-
mation between domestic output and exports. Here we proceed as in de Brom-
head et al. (2019): we use the fact that  = S /(1 - X ), where X = 1 - D
is the share of exports in total production, and assume (based on Tokarick
2014) that the log of S is normally distributed, with mean 0.403 and standard
deviation 0.468.


6     Counterfactual results
In this section we explore the impact of the changes in Indian trade policy
following the establishment of the Tariff Board on the recommendation of the
Indian Fiscal Commission. Since the first tariffs recommended by the Board
came into effect in 1924, we focus on the impact of trade policy changes from
that year onwards. To this end we first embed the elasticities described in the
previous section into the model outlined in Section 3. We then solve the model
for each fiscal year from 1923-4 to 1937-8 inclusive, using the tariffs and quotas
that were actually in place in every year.29 Finally, we solve the model for each
year, assuming counterfactually that trade policy was identical to what it was in
1923 throughout (that is, that ad valorem tariffs in each year were the same as in
1923, and that no quotas were in place).30 By comparing these counterfactual,
constant-policy equilibria with the actual equilibria we can infer the impact on
trade flows of the shifts in trade policy that took place after 1923. We repeat
this procedure 1000 times, each time drawing new elasticity values from normal
distributions whose means and standard errors were decribed in the previous
section.31 The result is 1000 estimates of the impact of trade policy on trade
flows for each year, allowing us not only to calculate the impact of policy, but
to assess how tightly estimated that impact is.
times country (variety) fixed effects. Since we are unable to estimate equation (2) for three
categories of goods, where there was no cross-country variation in tariffs, we cannot implement
this procedure in the Indian case. We therefore have to rely on the robustness checks in
Appendix 5.
  29 See footnote 21.
  30 Because we are only interested in the impact of trade policy, we assume that the 1930

boycott and Italian sanctions campaign would still have taken place, and that existing cartels
would have remained in place unchanged.
  31 In the case of  we draw 1000 replications of the log of 
                                                                  S and calculate  using the
formula in Section 5.3.

6.1           The impact of trade policy on the total value of im-
              ports
We begin with the impact of tariffs and quotas on the total value of Indian
imports. Figure 4 plots the percentage impact on imports from 1923 to 1937.
In each case the figure shows the percentage by which actual imports differed
from what they would have been, had trade policies remained fixed at their 1923
level. It plots not only the median estimated impact across all 1000 repetitions
for each year, but the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentile impacts also. In this
manner it indicates how senstitive our results are to the fact that our elasticities
are imprecisely estimated.
    As can be seen from Figure 4, by the 1930s protectionism was lowering
Indian imports by roughly 10% on average, although the effect is imprecisely
estimated (mostly reflecting the imprecision with which we estimated ). The
median estimate for 1934 was 10%, while the 25th and 75th percentile impacts
were 7.7 and 12.1% respectively.32 The value of Indian private imports fell by
  32 The 5th and 95th percentile impacts were 4.6 and 15.5% respectively. The gap between

these upper and lower bound estimates depends not just on the standard error of the elasticity
estimates, but on the size of the shock being imposed on the model, which is why the gap is



                                                    22
42% between 1923 and 1934, so our results indicate that protection accounted
for about a quarter of that decline. India was a developing economy and a
colony, very different from the rich industrial economies that have been the
focus of previous analysis. It is striking therefore that the results are so similar
to those obtained by Irwin (1998) for the United States, and de Bromhead et al.
(2019) for the UK.


6.2           The impact of trade policy on the share of Indian im-
              ports coming from the UK
The previous subsection showed that protection lowered Indian imports during
the 1920s and 1930s. But tariffs did not just increase during this period, they
did so in a discriminatory fashion. Not only did UK exports face lower tariffs
than non-British countries, but Japanese textile producers were subjected to
quantiative restrictions from 1934 onwards. What was the impact of trade
discrimination on the UK's share of Indian imports?

1937, as well as the counterfactual share that it would have enjoyed had Indian
protection remained at its 1923 level. Once again the figure plots not only the
median counterfactual share for each year, calculated across the 1000 replica-
tions, but the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentile impacts also. As can be seen,
the actual and counterfactual shares remain fairly close until 1931 but diverge
sharply thereafter. In 1934, to take the same example as in the previous subsec-
tion, the UK accounted for 46.3% of Indian imports. However, if protection had
remained at its 1923 level, the UK would only have accounted for 33.8% accord-
ing to our median estimate. Reflecting the fact that the g 's, which are what
really matter for the UK share, are relatively precisely estimated, our estimates
of the counterfactual UK share do not vary greatly across replications. The
25th and 75th percentile counterfactual shares are 34.8 and 32.8% respectively,
while the 5th and 95th percentile estimates are 36.3 and 31.3% respectively. By
the mid-1930s protection was boosting the UK share of Indian imports by more
than ten percentage points, or by more than a third. This is a large effect.


6.3       The impact of trade policy on the value of UK exports
          to India
Indian protection increased the UK's share of a shrinking pie. What was the net
impact on total British exports to India? Figure 6 plots the percentage impact
of the post-1923 shift in Indian protection on UK exports to India. As can be
seen, the fact that UK exporters to India faced higher tariffs was less important
than the fact that foreign exporters faced even higher levels of protection. The
net impact on total UK exports to India was strongly positive. Our median
estimate suggests that Indian protection boosted UK exports to that country
by 23.2% in 1934, a substantial effect, with 25th and 75th percentile estimates
of 18.8 and 28.2% respectively.33 This positive impact reflects the fact that
different national varieties of similar goods were highly substitutable for each
other (Table 1), which more than compensated British exporters for the decline
in total Indian imports.
    Far from hurting the UK textile industry, Indian protection greatly benefited
it (Figure 7). Our median estimate suggests that total UK exports of cotton
cloth were 55.1% higher in 1934 than they would have been if protection had
remained at its 1923 level (with 25th and 75th percentile estimates of 40.3 and
 33 The   5th and 95th percentile impacts were 12.3 and 35.5% respectively.

   India was an important market for the UK: in 1934 it took over 9% of total
UK exports, and 20% of its cotton cloth exports.35 Indian protection thus
boosted total UK exports by 2%, and its cotton textile exports by more than
10%. Whether or not the Indian fiscal autonomy convention was a "self-denying
ordinance" from the British point of view, Indian trade policy in the 1930s was
highly beneficial to the imperial power.


6.4             Impact on Japan
Indian protection did lower imports, by a little more than 10% according to
our median estimates, but Lancashire seems to have substantially benefited.
The big losers were those countries outside the British Empire that now faced
discrimination, such as Japan. Figure 8 plots the impact of Indian protection on
aggregate Japanese exports to that country. Our median estimates suggest that
protection lowered total Japanese exports to India in 1934 by 38.7%. The impact

is relatively precisely estimated.36 Figure 9 plots the impact on Japanese cotton
cloth exports: in 1934 protection was reducing these by a median of 59.3%.37
    These were very substantial effects and large enough to have an impact
on total Japanese exports. India accounted for almost 11% of total Japanese
exports in 1934, and for almost 14% of its cotton textile exports.38 Indian
protection thus lowered total Japanese exports by over 4%, and total Japanese
cotton cloth exports by over 8%.


7               Conclusion
It seems as though Indian nationalists were right, and that those British histo-
rians who bemoaned the impact of interwar Indian protection on the UK were
wrong. Partial equilibrium analysis may suggest that Indian protection must
have lowered UK exports to that country, but this ignores the fact that Indian

protection was discriminatory, and that elasticities of substitution between UK
and non-British varieties of the same goods were high. Far from hurting the
UK, Indian protection during this period helped it in both relative and absolute
terms.
    Most existing studies have found that the protection of the 1930s had only
modest effects on the volume and geographical composition of international
trade. This study, using a large new dataset on both trade and trade policy,
reaches a very different conclusion. To be sure, protection only explains a quar-
ter of the Indian trade collapse, but discriminatory trade policy had a large
impact on the composition of India's imports, and on different countries' ex-
ports to that market. This in turn played an important role in exacerbating
the geopolitical tensions of the time. In particular, given our results it is hardly
surprising that Indian protectionism was a major irritant in Anglo-Japanese
diplomatic relations throughout the decade (Osamu, 2000).
    We hope that we have demonstrated the usefulness of general equilibrium
approaches using high-resolution historical data. Using a large new dataset we
have found that trade elasticities in a large, developing country, India, were gen-
erally larger than in the United Kingdom at the same time. Our findings stand
in direct contrast both to the conclusions of contemporary British observers, and
to recent empirical findings from partial equilibrium analysis. Discriminatory
trade policy in the 1930s had a substantial impact on the size and composition
of trade flows.

Appendix 1. Indian interwar trade policy
This section provides an expanded and self-contained account of the description
of Indian trade policy contained in Section 2.
    Indian import tariffs had traditionally been low, reflecting the country's
colonial status and the liberal inclinations of the British imperial power.39 Land,
opium, and salt provided the bulk of the Indian government's revenues: customs
duties only accounted for 10% of government revenue in 1860-61, and just 5%
ten years later (Kumar, 1983, p. 916). Tariffs had been increased in the wake of
the 1857 Mutiny, but under pressure from Lancashire cotton interests they were
gradually reduced, and they were abolished altogether (except for on salt and
alcohol) in 1882. Acts VIII and XVI of 1894 introduced a general tariff of 5%,
with the duty on cotton yarns being offset by an equivalent domestic excise duty
so as to ensure that Indian manufacturers were not unfairly favoured (Act XVI).
However, in 1896 the import tariff on cotton piece goods was lowered to 3½%,
while the duty on cotton yarn was abolished (Act III). Since the excise duties on
domestically produced cotton goods (both yarn and cloth), at a new rate of 3½%
(Act II), were not abolished , there was now a negative rate of protection for the
Indian cotton spinning industry (Kumar, 1983, p. 921). On the eve of the war
India was thus a virtually free-trading country, and such tariffs as were levied
were designed to raise revenue rather than to protect domestic industries.40
    World War 1 was an important turning point. First, the war effort required
revenue, and the most obvious way for India to raise more was to increase tariffs.
The general tariff was therefore increased from 5 to 7½% in 1916, although
cotton duties remained unchanged which greatly limited the fiscal benefit of the
measure (Act IV).41 By late 1916 Austen Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
India, was demanding a £100 million contribution by India to the war effort,
while Indian nationalists objected to the exclusion of cotton from the general
tariff increase. The Government of India eventually acceeded to Chamberlain's
request, but only after the British government had agreed to allow India to
raise duties on cotton goods (still not including yarn) to 7½% (Act VI of 1917),
  39 While we make extensive references to the secondary literature below, an invaluable source

remains the Indian legislation of the period.
  40 Act XIV of 1899 allowed the government to impose countervailing duties in cases where

other governments were subsidising exports to India. Act VIII of 1902 allowed the government
to impose duties on imported sugar from countries protecting domestic sugar production by
more than a specified amount.
  41 Act XI of the same year gave the Governor General sweeping powers to restrict interna-

tional trade.




                                              36
without a countervailing increase in domestic excise duties (Dewey, 1978, pp.
41-3). Customs duties accounted for 20% of Indian government revenue during
1916-20 (Mukherjee, 2001, pp. 731-2).
    The end of the world war did not bring peace to India: war with Afghanistan
in 1919 was followed by the Waziri uprising which lasted into the following year.
Interest rates on Indian government debt rose. The general tariff was further
increased to 11% in 1921 (Act VI): cotton textiles were included and once again
there was no offsetting increase in domestic excise duties (Dewey, 1978, pp.
43-4).42 The following year the general tariff was once again raised, to 15%,
with imported cotton yarn now being subject to a duty of 5% (Act XII) (duties
on cotton piece goods remained unchanged) (Mukherjee, 2001, p. 732).43 De
facto, Indian cotton textiles were now enjoying substantial protection, despite
the fact that tariffs were being imposed for revenue reasons (Drummond, 1972,
p. 123), and were by this stage a more important source of government revenue
than the land tax.
    But the world war did not only lead to an increase in tariffs because of
government revenue needs. It also "produced a landslip in official attitudes
to protection" (Dewey, 1978, p. 45). Total war highlighted the desirability
of developing Indian heavy industry; Chamberlain followed his father, Joseph,
in pushing for imperial preference; the belief in laisser faire had been shaken;
Indian nationalist demands were strengthened by the country's contribution to
the war effort. Even before the war, the 1905 partition of Bengal had led to
a boycott of British-made goods, especially cloth, and had stimulated import-
substituting manufacturing in a number of sectors. Now Indian participation
in the British war effort heightened Indian demands for self-government. In
August 1917 Chamberlain's successor, Edwin Montagu, stated that the UK
favoured "the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an
integral part of the Empire." That incremental vision had however already been
severely undermined when in April 1919 British soldiers murdered almost 400
civilians in Amritsar, as well as by the subsequent British official response to
the atrocity. On August 1, 1920, Gandhi launched a policy of non-cooperation
against the British Raj, because of both Amritsar and the Allied treatment of
Turkey after World War 1. The aim was to achieve swaraj (self-rule) within
  42 Imports of cotton yarn remained duty-free. The duty on sugar was raised to 15%, and

that on a range of luxury goods to 20%.
  43 The rate on sugar was increased to 25%, and that on the afore-mentioned luxury goods

to 30%, while tariffs on a range of iron and steel products were raised from 2½ to 10%.




                                           37
a year, and involved among other things a boycott of imported cloth; non-
cooperation lasted until February 1922, when Gandhi cancelled the campaign
as a result of an attack on a police station (although he continued to argue for
a foreign cloth boycott in the years that followed) (Brown, 1985, pp. 213-8).
    Despite such setbacks, the British remained committed to a policy of tran-
sitioning India towards self-government within the Empire. In 1919, a British
Joint Select Committe stated that "Nothing is more likely to endanger the good
relations between India and Great Britain than a belief that India's fiscal policy
is dictated from Whitehall in the interests of the trade of Great Britain. That
such a belief exists at the moment there can be no doubt...Whatever be the
right fiscal policy for India, for the needs of her consumers as well as for her
manufacturers, it is quite clear that she should have the same liberty to con-
sider her interests as Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South
Africa." It thus proposed (and the government subsequently agreed) that the
British government "should as far as possible avoid interference on this subject
when the Government of India and its Legislature are in agreement" and that
any such intervention "when it does take place, should be limited to safeguarding
the international obligations of the Empire or any fiscal arrangements within
the Empire to which His Majesty's Government is a party" (U.K. Parliamentary
Papers, 1919, p. 11).
    This recommendation, accepted by the British government in 1921, that
Britain acknowledge India's right to "fiscal autonomy" took the form of a "con-
vention" rather than a statute, since the latter would have limited "the ultimate
power of Parliament to control the administration of India" and "the power of
veto which rests in the Crown". Indian historians have pointed out that the
Government of India was supposed to consult the British government before
tabling fiscal policy proposals, and have argued that the British government
de facto retained significant control over Indian trade policy (Mukherjee, 2001,
pp. 734-5). Yet the succeeding two decades saw the gradual development of far
more interventionist trade policies in the sub-continent.
    In 1922 the Indian Fiscal Commission recommended protection for Indian
industries on classic infant industry grounds (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1922
Sess II).44 Protection was to be resorted to "with discrimination", since indis-
criminate protection "would protect industries unsuitable as well as suitable,
  44 That is to say, Indian industries concerned would have to possess "natural advantages",

require protection to be able to develop in the first place, and would eventually be competitive
in world markets.



                                              38
and would impose on the consumer a burden in many cases wholly gratuitous"
(p. 49).45 In 1923 the Indian government accepted this recommendation, and
a Tariff Board was set up to implement it, although it was not as independent
of government as had been envisaged in the report. Although the remainder of
this section will follow the literature in focussing on the protection accorded to
the iron and steeel, and (especially) cotton sectors, reflecting their importance
in Indian trade and the Indian economy, nine other industries also obtained pro-
tection from the Tariff Board before the outbreak of World War 2: sugar, paper,
matches, salt, heavy chemicals, plywood and tea-chests, sericulture, magnesium
chloride, and gold thread. Rice and wheat were also singled out for protection
(Tomlinson, 1979, pp. 61-2). In some cases the tariffs involved were very high.
    The newly constituted Tariff Board immediately set about considering the
case for protection of the iron and steel industry. The Tata Iron and Steel
Company (TISCO) had been founded in 1907, and proved a useful asset during
the war. By 1921 it was in trouble, however, due to imported steel from the
European continent, in particular Belgium: it was this which had led the Indian
governemnt to set up the Fiscal Commission in the first place (Wagle, 1981).
Happily for TISCO, the Fiscal Commission had singled out the iron and steel
industry for special consideration as an industry which might warrant protec-
tion on national security grounds, and recommended that one of the first tasks
of the new Tariff Board should be to investigate this possibility (U.K. Parlia-
mentary Papers, 1922 Sess II, pp. 59-60). In June 1924 tariffs were therefore
introduced ranging from 15 to 25% ad valorem.46 In 1927 protection for the
industry was extended for a further 7 years, and importantly the duties were
now "differential", which is to say that they were in many cases lower for goods
"of British manufacture".47 The argument was that differential protection was
  45 Somewhat confusingly, therefore, the proposed policy was described by contemporaries as

one of "discriminatory protection". Notably, 5 Indian members of the 11-member Commission
argued for an unqualified commitment to protection (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1922 Sess
II, pp. 175-212). Roy (2017) provides a sympathetic account of the policy of discriminatory
protection.
  46 Act XIV. Several specific tariffs were also introduced.
  47 It is unfortunately difficult to be completely certain from the legislation alone if the phrase

refers to goods produced in the UK only, or to "British" goods more generally. Act III of 1927,
which introduced the differential tariffs, merely stated that "The Governor General in Council
may, by notification in the Gazette of India, prescribe the conditions subject to which articles
shall be deemed to be of British manufacture for the purposes of this section and of the Second
Schedule". As Thackeray (2017) points out, "British goods" generally referred in the 1930s
to goods coming either from the UK or her Dominions. This is reflected in the Indian trade
statistics (as well as the trade statistics of the UK and other British dominions and colonies),
which speak of `British and foreign merchandise' and provide summaries for `Total British
Empire' and `Total foreign countries'. In his statement on behalf of the Government of India



                                                39
required since British steel was tested according to the British Standard Speci-
fication, and was more expensive to produce and of higher quality than cheaper,
"untested", Belgian steel (Wagle, 1981; Roy, 2017).48 This legislation marked a
break with the past: previous attempts to introduce Imperial Preferences of any
kind had fallen foul of Indian nationalist opinion (who objected in this instance
also, albeit unsuccessfully).
    Protection for the Indian cotton industry was also increasing over time in
response to worsening market conditions.49 These were in part due to worldwide
price trends, and in part due to increasing competition from Japan which India
regarded as unfair due to inferior labour conditions there. The domestic excise
tax on Indian cotton goods was suspended in 1925 and abolished in the follow-
to the 1930 Imperial Conference, Sir Geoffrey Corbett spoke of how when it came to the steel
and cotton textiles industries, India had "fixed differential duties for British and foreign goods"
(U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1930-31, p. 131). It is difficult to imagine that Canadian steel
would have been described as "foreign" at this time. On the other hand, in his objection to the
1927 legislation, Motilal Nehru spoke of being "asked to give preference to the manufacturers
of the U.K. in the matter of steel" (Wagle, 1981, p. 127). On February 12, 1927, the Gazette
of India described the Bill as imposing duties "on steel of British manufacture sufficient to
protect the Indian manufacturer against competition from the United Kingdom and higher
duties on steel imported from other countries." In 1932 Sir Atul Chatterjee, speaking at the
Ottawa Conference, stated that "One of the most interesting things about the Indian system of
protection is that it has led directly to what has been in effect, if not in intention, a preference
for Empire goods. In two very important cases, iron and steel and cotton piece goods, it
has been found that the imposition of a lower rate of duty on goods made in the United
Kingdom is entirely consistent with India's interests" (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1931-32a,
p. 97). In its 1932 report on the cotton industry, the Indian Trade Board wrote that "in
his budget speech on the 28th February 1930 the Finance Member announced the intention
of the Government of India to raise the revenue duty on goods 11 to 15 per cent., and in
addition to impose a 5 per cent. protective duty, with a minimum of 3½ annas a pound on
"plain grey goods," on all cotton piecegoods imported from countries other than the United
Kingdom" (Indian Tariff Board, 1932, p. 4). Most compellingly of all, Sir David Chadwick,
who served as Secretary to the Government of India Commerce Department between 1922
and 1927, and went on to become Secretary of the Imperial Economic Committee (in which
position he served until 1946) (Dupree, 1987, p. 160), wrote in December 1927 of the duties
on iron and steel being "be split into two parts- a basic duty applicable to any imported steel
protected, and an additional duty if the steel were imported from countries other than the
United Kingdom" (Chadwick, 1928, p. 202). In addition, the Gazette of India of April 4,
1930, specified that in the case of duties on cotton goods, articles would be deemed to be of
British manufacture if "in the production of the article no process of manufacture other than
a process anterior to weaving has been carried out elsewhere than in the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" (p. 73). We thus feel confident that the phrase "of
British manufacture" did in fact refer to goods made in the UK; the way of reconciling this
with Corbett's statement is that the vast majority of imported "British" cotton or steel, using
Thackeray's language, would have come from the United Kingdom at this time. We have
therefore coded imports of iron and steel, and of cotton goods, coming from the Dominions,
as not being "of British manufacture".
  48 TISCO was at this stage the only Indian producer capable of making "tested" steel.
  49 An excellent and concise account is given in Indian Tariff Board (1932, pp. 1-8), on which

this paragraph largely draws.

ing year.50 In 1927, the Indian Tariff Board recommended that the tariff on
cotton piecegoods (but not yarn) be raised from 11 to 15%, with the President
of the Board recommending an additional duty of 4% on all Japanese cotton
goods. The Board also recommended that duties on cotton textile machinery
be abolished. The Indian government accepted the latter proposal but rejected
the others.51 Gandhi unsuccessfully tried to use this decision to coopt Indian
millowners into his swadeshi or self-sufficiency movement (Chatterji, 1983, pp.
265-7); following protests by the latter, the Indian government did agree in
September to introduce a minimum specific duty of 1½ annas per pound on
cotton yarn to complement the existing 5% ad valorem duty.52
    Competition from Japan continued to worsen, however, and concern about
unfair labour conditions in Japan was replaced with similar concerns regarding
China. Meanwhile the Depression hit both Britain and India, with major impli-
cations for Indian trade policy. The budgetary situation worsened in the UK,
implying that it was essential that the flow of remittances from India to the
UK be maintained, but government revenues in India were also under pressure.
Since tariffs were at this stage the most important source of revenue in India
the case for increasing customs duties became politically unanswerable, even in
the face of stiff opposition from Lancashire cotton interests (Chatterji, 1992, pp.
347-8). And by this stage Indian politics required that at least some of these
increases be protective in nature.
    Attention thus turned to the possibility of raising the tariff on cotton textiles
from 11% to the general rate of 15%. In 1930, the Indian government faced pres-
sure from two sides: Indian mill owners feared that 15% would not be sufficient
to protect them from Japanese competition, while the British government (fiscal
autonomy convention notwithstanding) worried about the impact of a 15% tariff
on Lancashire. An obvious solution to this political conundrum was to extend
the principle of differential protection to the cotton textile industry, imposing
higher tariffs on foreign (and in particular Japanese) cloth than on British cloth.
This however ran into the problem that the Indian Legislature was opposed to
Imperial Preference. The eventual solution, adopted in April 1930, was to in-
crease duties on British piece goods to 15% , with duties on foreign piece goods
  50 Act  XIX of 1926.
  51 Imposing  differential duties on Japanese cotton goods would have been in breach of the
Indo-Japanese trade agreement of 1904 (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1905), which entitled
Japan to "the lowest customs duties applicable to similar products of any other foreign origin"
(Art. I).
  52 Act XXIII of 1927.




                                              41
being raised to 20%. The legislation also specificied a minimum specific tariff of
3½ annas per pound on all imported plain grey piece goods, no matter what the
origin, which was non-discriminatory enough to get the measure passed (Act
XVII of 1930). With the budgetary situation continuing to worsen, in March
1931 the general tariff was raised to 20%, and the tariff on cotton piece goods
was raised to 20% for British goods, and 25% for non-British goods. On the
30th of September these duties were further raised by a quarter, implying a
general tariff of 25%, and duties for British and non-British piece goods of 25%
and 31¼% respectively.53
    In addition to these legislative moves to protect the Indian cotton industry,
nationalist agitation was also affecting cotton imports. Gandhi launched a new
campaign of civil disobedience in April 1930: according to Judith Brown, "The
main all-Indian index of the spread and strength of civil disobedience was the
boycott movement against foreign goods, particularly cloth" (Brown, 1977, p.
127). The boycott was better organised than in 1920-22, involving widespread
picketing of foreign cloth shops, and caused considerable concern among the
British authorities, who regarded it as being directed "chiefly, if not exclusively,
against British goods".54 The boycott was used as an argument by the British
Viceroy in India, Lord Irwin, to oppose the imposition of imperial preference on
India: this would, he argued, only make the boycott more effective (Tomlinson,
1979, p. 122). In March 1931 Gandhi and Irwin signed a pact according to which
the political boycotting of British goods would be discontinued, but peaceful
picketing could continue within the limits of the law (Brown, 1977, p. 186). The
accord soon broke down however: in January 1932 civil disobedience resumed,
with Congress recommending the boycott of "foreign cloth and all British goods"
(Brown, 1977, p. 283). On this occasion the agitation only finally came to an
end in April 1934.
    In September 1931, Britain left the gold standard. The October election
brought to power a National Government and strengthened the hand of those
in Britain advocating for protection and Imperial Preference. The first moves
towards protection were made in November 1931, and in the same month the
British government started preparing for the forthcoming Imperial Economic
Conference, to be held in Ottawa the following summer. Their hope was that
bilateral tariff bargains could be struck between the participants there (the UK,
 53 IndianFinance (Supplementary and Extending) Act, 1931.

India, and the Dominions) which would then be generalised as far as possible,
in "most-favoured-Imperial-nation" fashion (Drummond, 1972, pp. 90-91). In
February 1932 the UK Import Duties Act imposed a general 10% tariff on
imports not already subject to duties, with exceptions being made for a variety
of raw materials and foodstuffs, including raw cotton and wheat (Gordon, 1941,
p. 219). Imports from India were exempted from the tariffs until November,
giving time for an Anglo-Indian trade agreement to be signed at Ottawa.
    The Anglo-Indian deal signed at Ottawa granted continued tariff-free access
to the UK market for those Indian goods that had been temporarily exempted
under the Import Duties Act, and maintained or improved preferences on a wide
variety of Indian exports to Britain. In exchange, India granted tariff preferences
to a large range of UK exports, and in some cases to exports from British
colonies (as opposed to Dominions). These margins were generally 10% ad
valorem, although in some cases (notably motor cars) the margin was 7½%. The
agreement did not, however, prevent India from raising tariffs in the future, so
long as these preference margins were maintained (U.K. Parliamentary Papers,
1931-32b; Drummond, 1972, p. 131). Nor did the agreement deal with cotton
textiles, since in April 1932 the Indian Tariff Board had been asked to report
to the Indian Government on the subject; Lancashire interests hoped that the
outcome would be a greater tariff preference for British textiles in the Indian
market.
    The need for greater protection from Japanese competition had increased
in December 1931, when Japan quit the gold standard and the yen started
to depreciate. On August 30 1932 the duty on all non-British cottons was
increased from 31¼ to 50% (the Indo-Japanese trade treaty of 1904, which had
granted most-favoured-nation status to Japan, making it impossible to single
out Japanese goods for special attention).55 The increase was only until March
1933, maintaining the pressure on the Indian Tariff Board to increase Imperial
preferences in the sector in a more durable fashion (Chatterji, 1992, pp. 374, 378;
Drummond, 1972, p. 133). Hopes that it would do so were dashed, however
(Chatterji, 1981, p. 554): it recommended greater protection for the Indian
cotton textile sector, but came out against Imperial preferences, including the
existing ones. Meanwhile the yen continued to depreciate, and Japanese imports
  55 Not unreasonably, the Japanese protested against the fact that tariffs on British goods

were not being increased. This was dismissed by the British, who took the view that pref-
erences in India on British goods were not inconsistent with the UK's treaty obligations to
Japan (see footnote 51), presumably since British goods were not of "foreign origin" (Chatterji,
1992, p. 378).



                                              43
continued to put pressure on the Indian market.
    In March 1933 the 50% tariffs were extended through October; in April,
India gave Japan six months notice of its intention to denounce the 1904 trade
treaty, which would allow it to discriminate against Japanese imports ; later
in the same month the Safeguarding of Industries Act empowered the Indian
Governor General to impose "a duty of customs of such amount as he considers
necessary to safeguard the interests of the industry affected", in cases where
goods were being imported "at such abnormally low prices that the existence of
an industry established in British India is thereby endangered" (Act XIII). In
May the UK further increased the pressure on Japan by giving twelve months
notice of its intention to denounce those portions of the Anglo-Japanese trade
treaty dealing with West Africa and the West Indies (Best, 2002, p. 83). On
the 7th of June the tariff on non-British cotton goods was increased to 75%.
Japanese competition also encouraged Indian and Lancashire mill owners to see
if they could make common cause: in October, they signed the Lees-Mody Pact,
with the Indians agreeing not to oppose a reduction in the tariff rate on British
cotton goods back to its pre-September 1931 level of 20% (Chatterji, 1981, pp.
555-6).56
    Japan reacted to the increased tariff on non-British goods, in part by boy-
cotting Indian raw cotton, but also by opening trade negotiations with India
(Drummond, 1972, pp. 132-4; Rothermund, 19986, pp. 109-10; Chatterji, 1992,
pp. 378-80). The outcome was a trade agreement which came into effect on
January 8, 1934. This lowered the duty on foreign piece goods to 50%, in
exchange for quotas on Japanese exports of piece goods linked to Japanese im-
ports of Indian raw cotton (Chatterji, 1992, p. 395).57 New tariff legislation
in April confirmed this lower rate; it also maintained the 25% rate for British
piece goods, and set the rates on British and non-British cotton yarn to 5 and
6¼% respectively (Act XII). In January 1935, the Indian government agreed as
a general priciple that protective tariffs should be lower on UK than on other
  56 The  pact was incorporated as a Supplementary Agreement to the Ottawa agreements in
the following year.
  57 There was a final twist to the take of Indo-Japanese trade relations during this period

(Friedman, 1940; Thackeray, 2017, p. 394). Traditionally, the Japanese role in Asian eman-
cipation from Western rule had been a source of inspiration for Indian nationalists, but this
image was damaged by Japan's imperialistic expansion in East Asia. Thus, Indian nationalists
criticized the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and the Indian National Congress severely
condemned the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. At the Haripura Congress of February
1938, Congress called for a boycott of Japanese goods by the Indian population. In August
1939, Nehru himself visited Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Chungking to demonstrate the
solidarity of Indian nationalists with the Chinese Government.



                                             44
goods, although in the following year the Legislative Assembly asked the In-
dian government to denounce the Ottawa Agreement. There followed a long
series of trade negotiations between the British and Indian governments which
eventually resulted in a 1939 trade agreement that reduced the range of British
imports accorded preferential treatment in India.58 Chaudhuri's (1983, p. 869)
overall assessment is that "India, even before the Second World War, was coming
closer towards the adoption of a much more positive policy of controlling her
international economy, which was to become characteristic of official thinking
after Independence".




  58 Another policy shift discouraging imports, especially from the UK, concerned the proce-

dures for purchasing government stores. In 1924 control of these purchases was transferred
from London to the Government of India, and by the 1930s "the bulk of stores were obtained
by rupee tender in India rather than by sterling tender in London" (Tomlinson, 1979, p. 63).
In this paper we are focussing on private imports, which were unaffected by this policy shift.


                                             45
Appendix 2. Commodity classification
The data collection process initially involved collecting information on the 202
individual items falling within 35 3- digit SITC categories over the period
1923/24- 1937/38. However, a number of series which existed in the first year
of the sample were discontinued or reclassified in subsequent years. Likewise,
new categories were created over time, as imports of particular products were
reported in a more disaggregated fashion. Consequently, not all series were
consistently observed over the entire sample period.
    Our aim was to create the most disaggregated dataset possible, given the
changing classifications in the data. This required tracking these changing classi-
fications over time, and figuring out the minimum level of aggregation required
to produce series for categories of goods that were consistently defined over
time. This had to be done manually rather than algorithmically, in the sense
that the classifications in every year had to be read by us, and decisions about
aggregation made on that basis.
    For example, one of our 114 goods is "Refined Sugar", which is a fairly broad
category. Imports of different types of refined sugar were reported over the
course of the fourteen years in our sample. For example, "Sugar below 23 Dutch
Standard but not below 16 Dutch Standard" and "Sugar, 23 Dutch Standard
and above" were reported as separate categories during 1930/31- 1937/38 and
we would have preferred to work with these as separate categories in our anal-
ysis. However, this was not possible since from 1923/24- 1929/1930 these two
categories were included in a broader category titled, "Sugar, 16 Dutch Stan-
dard and above". We therefore had to aggregate the imports of all refined sugar
items from each country in each year, creating a new good classification "Refined
Sugar". Imports of this expanded category could be measured consistently over
time, whereas imports of "Sugar below 23 Dutch Standard but not below 16
Dutch Standard" and "Sugar, 23 Dutch Standard and above" could not.
    We went through a similar procedure for each of the 202 individual items
in our sample. For some items no aggregation was necessary as the items were
consistently reported across the sample period at the 202- level (for example,
"Wool, raw"). For other series the fact that the classification changed regu-
larly meant that the only way to ensure a consistent series was to aggregate a
large number of items. For example, the 16 separate items covering machinery
and millwork (excluding prime movers or electrical machinery) over the sample
period, had to be aggregated up to one series "Machinery and Mill-work. Ma-


                                        46
chinery, not being prime movers or electrical machinery" (good 716001 in our
dataset). Since we were aggregating import values rather than quantities, there
was no problem regarding different units. Finally, to generate a tariff rate for
each of our 114 goods we calculated an unweighted average of the tariff rates of
each of the constituent series.
    Table 3 lists the top 10 goods by import value in 1923/24, 1930/31 and
1937/38. As can be seen the lists are dominated by cotton manufactures and
machinery.
    Each of our 114 goods g falls into one of the 35 SITC categories s which
we started with when constructing the dataset. We are using the original Stan-
dard International Trade Classification, based on Statistical Office of the United
Nations (1951; 1953), since this is more appropriate for this period than more
recent revisions. On average there are 3.25 goods per SITC category, but the
range is relatively wide (standard deviation of 3.76 goods and a maximum of
13 goods per SITC category). For example, "Iron or steel, Sheets and plates"
is included with 12 other goods in SITC 681, "Iron or steel". The good "Grain,
wheat" is the only good in SITC 041. Of the 35 3- digit SITC categories in
our dataset, 20 contain one good, 9 contain between 2 to 6 goods and 6 contain
more than 6 goods. Table 4 lists the top 10 3- digit SITC categories in our
sample by import value.
    Out of these 34 SITC groups we construct 9 narrow categories which are used
when estimating the h 's. `Grain' includes barley, maize, wheat and rice (SITC
categories 041­044); `Animal' includes butter, eggs and meat (SITC categories
011, 012, 023, and 025); `Machinery' includes SITC categories 711, 712, 714-
716, and 721; `Minerals' includes metals, coal and petroleum (SITC categories
311­313, 681, and 682); `Textiles' includes both yarn and cloth (SITC codes
651­653); `Miscellaneous inputs' includes such items as fertilisers, rubber, hides
and skins, raw cotton and silk, and hair (SITC codes 211, 231, 261­263, 271,
and 561); `Miscellaneous industry' includes vehicles and rubber manufactures,
including tyres (SITC codes 629, 713, and 732); `Food oils' includes oils and
oilseeds of various kinds (SITC codes 221 and 412); and `Colonial' includes
coffee, sugar, tea and tobacco (SITC categories 061, 071, 074, and 121).
    The maximum number of goods g per narrow category is 29 (for machinery)
while the minimum is 2 for animal (just bacon and hams and butter). Full
details of the classification of each item in our sample can be found in Appendix
Table 1, available at https://cepr.org/content/trade-depression.

structure of the data as originally collected, and details how it was aggregated.
We take the example of the 3-digit SITC category 682, "Copper". In the first
column we list the individual items as they were reported in the trade statistics
(i.e. at the 202 level of disaggregation), such as "Metals and Ores. Copper.
Unwrought. Tiles, ingots, cakes, bricks and slabs". The ID 682-009 is the one
used for this item in our original dataset. The second column lists the name of
the item as reported in the trade statistics. The third column shows a numerical
ID for the good g to which the item in question belongs, in this instance "Copper.
Unwrought" (given in the fourth column). There are 114 of these goods. The
fifth column lists the 3-digit SITC code s to which the item and good in question
belong (in this case 682). The seventh column lists the narrow category h to
which the item, good, and SITC code belong (in this case 4, minerals: the
narrow categories are listed from 1­9 in the same order as they appear in the
regression tables).

Table 6 provides a list of the 42 countries used in our analysis and indicates
how they were described in the original sources. In some cases, we had to type
in data for several regions to calculate the data for one country. In the case of
Spain, we summed over Canary Isles and Spain; in the case of British Malaya,
we summed over the Federated Malay States, British Borneo and the Straits
Settlements; and in the case of Dutch East India we summed over Sumatra,
Dutch Borneo, and Celebes and Other Islands.

and cartels
Table 7 lists the commodities in our dataset that were affected by the voluntary
export restraint on Japanese piece goods that came into effect in 1934. The
"quota" dummy variable in the regressions reported in Table 1 takes the value
1 for the goods and years indicated in the table (for Japan only).

    What about the boycotts? Brown (1977, p. 129) argues that the 1930-
31 "piece-goods trade boycott clearly had a marked effect since the decline in
imports was greater than that of other commodities and affected British goods
more than those from other countries". Chatterji (1992, pp. 164-5) argues that
while it is difficult to disentangle the impact of boycotts from all the other factors
influencing Indian imports during the period, boycotts were a "factor working
against Lancashire during the inter-War years". He quotes British officials who
in 1932 were of the opinion that the boycott had had "very considerable effects"
on British cotton sales, which had slumped more than imports in general; a
particular worry was that boycotts might have permanent effects, by shifting
tastes towards locally produced cloth.
    Table 8 codes the boycotts of UK cotton cloth in the short run (1930) and
long run (1931 and subsequently). In all cases the "cotton cloth boycott" dummy
variables in the regressions reported in Table 1 take the value 1 for the goods
and years mentioned (for the U.K. only).

    In addition to trade policy, Indian industries were also involved in a num-
ber of cartels which may have influenced trade flows during this period. Indian
producers joined an international tea agreement in 1930. This was not renewed
in 1931 and 1932, but from 1933 up to the Second World War it attempted to
freeze the market share of the three participating countries, India, Ceylon and
the Dutch East Indies (Gupta, 2001; Suslow, 2005). The tea agreements seem
to have been moderately successful in 1930 in slowing the decline in tea prices,
and to have stabilized and reflated tea prices after 1933, a period when prices
for similar goods such as cocoa and coffee continued to fall (Gupta, 2001; Rowe,
1965, pp. 90, 148-51). Since the agreement mostly affected Indian producers
and exporters of tea, its effect on tea imports remains unclear in the literature.
The International Rubber Regulation Agreement of 1934 only came into force
as international recovery after the Great Depression was already underway, and
India was a fairly minor player in this market in comparison to Malaya, the
Dutch East Indies, Ceylon and Indochina (Rowe, 1965, pp. 90, 152-4), so the
consequences of the export quotas agreed upon by the contracting parties on
the structure of Indian imports remains unclear as well. India was also prob-
ably affected by the Achnacarry and subsequent agreements in the petroleum
industry (United States Congress, Senate, 1952), as well as by the Chadbourne
sugar agreement, which India joined together with the UK in late 1937 (Dye
and Sicotte, 2006).

    Table 9 below provides data on how these cartels were coded in our dataset.
International producer cartels in which British India was a member were coded
from Suslow (2005, Appendix 1). This was supplemented by information on
primary goods, and especially international sugar cartels, in Dye and Sicotte
(2006), US Secretary of Agriculture (1933), and Rowe (1965), and by informa-
tion on the Achnacarry and subsequent agreements in the petroleum industry,
in United States Congress, Senate (1952). We only include formal cartel agree-
ments concluded by British India domestic producers, trade organizations, or
the government. Cartels have to be in force at least 6 month in the correspond-
ing year to be coded as dummy=1. Only cartel members included in our country
sample are mentioned in the table.

Appendix 5. Robustness
Alternative estimates of the g 's
Table 10 presents alternative estimates of the g 's. The first row reproduces the
baseline results from Table 1. These regressions were estimated using PPML,
and used calendar year tariffs. The second row uses fiscal year tariffs. The third
and fourth rows repeat the exercise using OLS instead of PPML.
     As can be seen, replacing calendar with fiscal year tariffs makes relatively
little difference. However, using OLS significantly reduces the elasticities for
machinery and minerals (the latter now has the wrong sign, though it is statis-
tically insignificant) and increases the elasticity for miscellaneous industry.
     What really matters, however, is the impact of changing these elasticities
on our results regarding trade flows. We therefore re-ran our simulations using
six sets of elasticities. These are: the benchmark elasticities used in the body
of the paper; the three other sets of elasticities in Table 10;59 the benchmark
elasticities, but with the value of  lowered from its benchmark value of 1 to
0.5; and the benchmark elasticities, but with  raised to 2.
     Figure 10 shows the estimated impact of post-1923 protection on aggregate
trade flows (India's total imports, and the UK's and Japan's aggregate exports
to that country) under each of these six elasticity scenarios. As can be seen,
our results are not particularly sensitive to the elasticities used, except insofar
as total UK exports are concerned. Depending on the elasticities , the impact
could have been 4-5 percentage points lower than under the benchmark scenario,
or roughly 10 percentage points higher. Figure 11 performs the same exercise
for UK and Japanese exports of cotton cloth to India. Once again the Japanese
results are relatively insensitive to the elasticities used, and the UK results more
so. In all cases, however, the estimated impact of protection on trade flows is
very large, and our qualitative results survive.




 59 The   incorrectly signed minerals elasticities in Table 10 are simply set equal to zero.
