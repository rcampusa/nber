Jump Starting the Euro Area Recovery: Would a Rise in Core Fiscal Spending Help the Periphery?

                                         ABSTRACT

We show that a fiscal expansion by the core economies of the euro area would have a large and
positive impact on periphery GDP assuming that policy rates remain low for a prolonged period.
Under our preferred model specification, an expansion of core government spending equal to one
percent of euro area GDP would boost periphery GDP by over 1 percent in a liquidity trap lasting
three years, nearly half as large as the effect on core GDP. Accordingly, under a standard ad hoc
loss function involving output and inflation gaps, increasing core spending would generate
substantial welfare improvements, especially in the periphery. The benefits are considerably
smaller under a utility-based welfare measure, reflecting in part that higher net exports play a
material role in raising periphery GDP.

1. Introduction


If the euro area were a …scal union like the United States, there would be a strong case for …scal

expansion: the unemployment rate remains in double digits, in‡ation has run persistently too low,

and monetary policy has limited scope to provide additional stimulus. However, the euro area is

not a …scal union, and …scal expansion has to be carried out by member states. Given that the

periphery economies most likely to bene…t from domestic …scal expansion are constrained from

doing because of concerns about high public debt and …scal solvency, any sizeable …scal expansion

has to come from the euro area’s core economies.

   In this paper, we analyze the e¤ects of an expansion of …scal spending in the euro area’s core

economies. Rather than limiting attention to the e¤ects on the euro area as a whole, we focus

on how the stimulative e¤ects would be distributed between core and periphery: Would a core

…scal expansion have sizeable positive “spillovers” to periphery output and in‡ation, or would the

stimulus mostly be limited to those core economies opting to raise public spending? The answer is

clearly critical to evaluating potential welfare bene…ts. Even if core …scal expansion increased euro

area output and in‡ation, it may not be desirable if it caused core economies to overheat while

imparting little positive impetus to the periphery.

   The …scal consolidations that began in 2010 in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain

o¤ers some clues about the channels through which a prospective core …scal expansion might play

out.   On the one hand, the deep …scal cuts carried out from 2010 to 2013 had strong adverse

e¤ects on the periphery countries’domestic demand, due at least in part to the zero lower bound

on monetary policy (Blanchard and Leigh, 2014). On the other hand, the large negative output

gaps in those countries led to a decrease in relative price levels, and some improvement in external



                                                 1
demand. In this vein, Figure 1 illustrates the positive relationship between the average output gap

and price in‡ation for euro area economies in the aftermath of the …nancial crisis: the high degree of

resource slack in countries such as Spain and Portugal, partly driven by massive …scal consolidation,

translated into lower average in‡ation than in Germany. The euro area’s recent experience makes

clear that the net result of …scal consolidation, for both periphery and core countries, depends

on the stance of monetary policy and the relevance of the zero lower bound, on the size of the

multipliers, on the e¤ect of output gaps on in‡ation and by implication on relative prices, and on

the e¤ect of relative prices on imports and exports.

    The same considerations are likely to play a key role in in‡uencing the macroeconomic e¤ects

of a rise in core government spending, and suggest the importance of both aggregate (euro-wide)

and compositional channels.

    From an aggregate perspective, the e¤ects are likely to depend on how strongly monetary policy

reacts to the induced rise in euro area output and in‡ation. Outside of a liquidity trap, the ECB

would raise interest rates in real terms, which would dampen private demand in both the core and

periphery; and unless periphery net exports rose enough to compensate, periphery GDP would

likely fall.   But in a liquidity trap, higher core spending boosts in‡ation in both the core and

periphery, and potentially reduces real interest rates enough to provide a signi…cant boost both to

periphery and core GDP. From a compositional perspective, while the demand stimulus is likely

to a¤ect primarily core countries, the increase in in‡ation in core relative to periphery countries

leads to an increase in core relative prices, and to some reallocation of demand toward periphery

countries.

    To gauge the strength of the various channels and make an assessment of the likely e¤ects of a

core …scal expansion on core and periphery GDP, we use two variants of a New Keynesian model

of a currency union. Our benchmark model is quite simple –extending Gali and Monacelli (2008)



                                                  2
mainly by adding habit persistence in consumption to get more plausible dynamics –but is useful for

pinpointing how the various aggregate and compositional channels shape the response of periphery

output. Moreover, the simple structure facilitates showing how key features such as the Phillips

Curve slope a¤ect both the aggregate multiplier and spillovers to the periphery. However, we also

use a larger-scale DSGE model –which includes price and wage rigidities, endogenous investment,

and allows for non-Ricardian consumption behavior –to derive quantitative assessments in a more

empirically-realistic setting. Following the general approach of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans

(2005) and Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2011), we estimate this model by calibrating

key parameters to match the empirical responses to both a euro area monetary policy shock and

government spending shock.

   We …nd that, outside of a liquidity trap, the e¤ects of higher core government spending on

periphery GDP tend to be small and even negative (assuming that the import content of core

government spending is low). The small response of periphery GDP re‡ects that the central bank

raises real interest rates, more than o¤setting the stimulus arising from a depreciation of the

periphery’s terms of trade. These results concur with previous research by Wieland (1996) and

Kollmann et al (2014) indicating that …scal spillovers tend to be negative under …xed exchange

rates (assuming that the central bank responds according to a standard policy reaction function).

   The spillovers to periphery GDP are markedly di¤erent in a liquidity trap: Periphery GDP

tends to rise, re‡ecting the weaker interest rate response. The size of the periphery GDP response

to a core spending hike increases with the expected duration of the liquidity trap, with the import

content of core government spending, and with the responsiveness of in‡ation. In a relatively

short-lived trap lasting only a few quarters, the GDP stimulus to the periphery is small (unless

a sizeable fraction of core spending is imported), so that most of the expansionary e¤ects of the

…scal stimulus is con…ned to the core. However, higher core spending can provide a potent source



                                                3
of stimulus to the periphery if monetary policy is expected to be constrained from raising interest

rates for a prolonged period of a couple of years or more.

   The larger-scale model implies that a rise in core government spending has e¤ects on periphery

GDP that are about half as large as on core GDP in a three year liquidity trap; the aggregate euro

area multiplier of around 2 seems in line with both model-based analysis suggesting high multipliers

in a liquidity trap, and empirical analysis (both of which are reviewed in the next section). The

large spillovers to the periphery re‡ect a combination of factors: higher periphery net exports, lower

real interest rates as periphery in‡ation rises, and Keynesian multiplier e¤ects that boost domestic

demand (captured by the hand-to-mouth consumers in our model). But it bears emphasizing that

the sizeable spillovers don’t hinge on an implausibly large in‡ation response; though consistent

with the empirical responses of in‡ation to monetary and spending shocks, our model implies an

extremely ‡at Phillips Curve relative to most existing estimates. The Keynesian multiplier e¤ects

do play an important role, which seems in line with the substantial crowding in of domestic demand

in response to government spending shocks in our empirical VAR, as well as with evidence from the

literature on local multipliers (Nakamura and Steinsson 2014 and Acconcia, Corsetti, and Simonelli

2014).

   We also use the simple model to conduct normative analysis: one important upshot is the

reminder that the output and in‡ation responses perhaps shouldn’t be the sole criteria for judging

whether …scal adjustment is desirable. We consider two alternative welfare metrics, including an

ad hoc but standard criterion based on output and in‡ation gap variability in each region and a

utility-based criterion that is based on a population-weighted average of the utility functions of

households. Under either criterion, we show that the welfare bene…ts of core …scal expansion are

smaller than under …scal union. This is intuitive, and simply re‡ects that a core-only spending hike

delivers the most stimulus to where it is “needed least” insofar as resource slack is much smaller



                                                  4
than in the periphery. Under …scal union, more of the expansion could be targeted to the periphery,

allowing comparatively large welfare gains.1

    However, the alternative welfare criteria di¤er substantially in their assessment of whether a core

…scal expansion would improve welfare in the periphery economies. The ad hoc criterion indicates

that an expansion of core spending can elicit large welfare gains in both the core and periphery

by shrinking output gaps and increasing in‡ation closer to target. By contrast, the utility-based

criterion cares about whether the …scal stimulus boosts periphery consumption enough - and in

a front-loaded manner – to justify the utility cost of the increased employment. Accordingly, the

utility-based measure sees less bene…t from core …scal expansion than the simple ad hoc measure

because net exports play a substantive role in reducing the periphery’s output gap. In addition,

the consumption rise in the periphery is very drawn out, so that much of it occurs when the

economy has largely recovered. Our sense is that the utility-based analysis is useful for highlighting

that a focus on reducing output and in‡ation gaps may be too narrow in assessing the merits of

…scal expansion. However, as we argue below, the utility-based measure probably understates the

bene…ts of reducing the output gap and unemployment in economies facing high resource slack.

    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature on …scal

multipliers and spillovers. Section 3 presents the simple benchmark model in log-linearized form,

while Section 4 reports impulse responses to a core …scal expansion with a focus on factors deter-

mining spillovers to the periphery. Section 5 considers both the positive and normative e¤ects of

alternative …scal expansion packages against a reasonable baseline for the euro area.                     Section 6

examines robustness in the larger-scale model, while Section 7 concludes.
    1
      While our discussion here focuses on the desirability of …scal expansion in a prolonged liquidity trap, it bears
emphasizing that a core …scal expansion could potentially be counterproductive if monetary policy had latitude to
cut interest rates su¢ ciently. Indeed, the analysis of Gali and Monacelli (2008) suggests that it might be desirable
to respond to a contraction in periphery demand by cutting core …scal spending – thus better aligning business
cycles within the CU – and then cutting interest rates aggressively. While the implication that core consolidation
is desirable is perhaps somewhat model-speci…c, the more general message that core …scal expansion would not be
desirable if monetary policy could do the lifting seems very reasonable.

2. Brief Overview of the Literature


From an aggregate perspective, the models we consider are closely related to those of an extensive

literature examining …scal policy in a liquidity trap. This literature shows that the spending mul-

tiplier is likely to be substantially larger than in normal times, e.g., Eggertsson (2011), Christiano,

Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and Woodford (2011). The higher multiplier re‡ects that the cen-

tral bank does not raise nominal policy rates even though in‡ation rises, so that real interest rates

fall and domestic demand is crowded in. These crowding in e¤ects can be large if in‡ation is re-

sponsive to resource slack. For example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) showed that

the peak multiplier exceeds 2 in a long-lived liquidity trap under their preferred model speci…cation.

   A number of empirical papers have corroborated the implication of a large spending multiplier

when monetary policy is constrained. Some of this analysis has focused on the Great Depression

period given that monetary policy was arguably unreactive to …scal stimulus during most of that

time. Almunia et al. (2010) found a spending multiplier of over 2 using a panel VAR for major

industrial economies that is estimated over the interwar period and uses the same identifying

assumptions as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002). Gordon and Krenn (2010) estimated a spending

multiplier of slightly under 2 for the United States in a narrow window preceding the U.S. entry

into World War II. They argue that this is an ideal period for estimating the multiplier given

that government spending rose massively (by 13 percent of U.S. GDP between 1940:Q2-1941:Q4),

monetary policy was passive, resource slack still large, and tax rates weren’t (yet) adjusted up.

They also document a substantial crowding in of private demand.

   Blanchard and Leigh (2014) focused on the recent experience of …scal consolidation in the

euro area during the 2010-2012 period.     While some analysis suggested that deep spending cuts

would exert only a modest drag on output – or possibly even raise output through con…dence

channels (Alesina and Ardagna 2010) –Blanchard and Leigh showed that …scal multipliers in euro


                                                  6
area countries turned out to be much larger than forecast ex ante, implying that …scal cuts in

the periphery had considerably more adverse e¤ects than anticipated. Their estimates suggest a

spending multiplier of around 1.5 for the euro area.

   Both the theoretical and empirical literature has attempted to identify key factors in‡uencing

the size of the aggregate spending multiplier. In addition to the in‡ation response, the multiplier is

larger in a longer-lived liquidity trap, if the bulk of spending occurs when the zero bound constraint

is still binding (see the papers by CER and Woodford mentioned above), or if the economy is in

a deep recession with substantial excess capacity (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012 and Gordon

and Krenn 2010). Moreover, as indicated by Uhlig (2010), Erceg and Linde (2014), and Drautzberg

and Uhlig (2015), the tax reaction function can be quite consequential: the spending multiplier can

be signi…cantly lower if tax rates are adjusted quickly and if distortionary tax rates account for

most of the adjustment. In our analysis, we assume that …scal stimulus can be implemented fairly

quickly, and that taxes are either lump-sum (as in the simple model of Section 3), or that tax rates

at least adjust very slowly. The multipliers derived from our simulations would be lower under less

favorable assumptions on these dimensions.

   Several recent papers have analyzed …scal spillovers in a liquidity trap in stylized open economy

models. The qualitative analysis of Farhi and Werning (2012) shows that the pattern of spillovers

‡ips sign – from negative in normal times when the currency union monetary authority raises

interest rates – to positive in a liquidity trap.   Other papers, including by Cook and Devereux

(2011) and Fujiwara and Ueda (2013), have focused on environments with ‡exible exchange rates,

and have shown that a country expanding …scal spending is likely to cause its currency to depreciate,

potentially generating negative spillovers to its trading partners.

   As discussed in the introduction, an empirical implication of the models we consider is that …scal

expansion in core countries should boost periphery real net exports. This implication is consistent



                                                    7
with Beetsma et al (2006), who used a panel VAR framework to show that expansionary …scal

shocks in European Union economies typically increase the net exports of their trading partners

(and conversely for …scal contractions).

   We also draw on the literature estimating “local multipliers” to help assess the empirical plau-

sibility of our model(s) for the di¤erential e¤ects of a rise in core government spending on core

versus periphery output. This literature estimates how output is a¤ected in a region that boosts

government spending (e.g., a city or state) relative to other regions, and typically …nds that relative

output –i.e., output in the region experiencing the spending hike –rises by considerably more than

the increase in relative government spending (scaled by GDP). For example, Acconcia et al. (2014)

estimated a local multiplier of 1.5-1.9 for municipalities in Italy, using as an instrument sudden cuts

in municipal public spending triggered by the removal of local city councils (following evidence of

ma…a-related corruption); while Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) analyzed the e¤ects of changes in

defense expenditures concentrated in particular U.S. states, and estimated a local multiplier of 1.5.

Although our simple model in the next section constrains the local multiplier to be less than unity,

we interpret the estimates of high local multipliers as suggestive of strong Keynesian multiplier

channels, and hence build these features into the larger-scale model of Section 6.

   Finally, the Phillips Curve slope plays a paramount role in in‡uencing both the aggregate

multiplier, and in determining the size of compositional e¤ects on trade. The extensive empirical

literature estimating the Phillips Curve slope –both for the industrial economies, and the euro area

in particular – generally points to a low Phillips Curve slope. This includes estimates based on

DSGE models (Smets and Wouters, 2003), as well as from single equation models as in Blanchard,

Cerutti, and Summers (2015), with the latter highlighting a substantial fall in the Phillips Curve

slope in the early 1990s. Even so, it bears emphasizing that these estimates are generally consistent

with a noticeable response of in‡ation to a sustained rise in …scal spending, as we will show below.



                                                  8
Moreover, a number of papers suggest that the low estimated slopes partly re‡ect various forms

of misspeci…cation – including e.g., not taking adequate account of how TFP shocks or …nancial

conditions in‡uence marginal cost (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt 2015 and Gilchrist,

Schoenle, Sim, and Zakrajšek 2015) – and that the actual Phillips Curve slope is considerably

higher. Thus, although our own estimates in Section 6 imply a low Phillips Curve slope, and we

embed a low slope in the baseline calibration of our models, we also consider the implications of a

higher slope.



3. The Benchmark Open Economy Model


Our benchmark model is comprised of two countries that may di¤er in population size. Households

are in…nitely-lived, derive utility from consumption and leisure, and make consumption decisions

based on their permanent income. Monopolistically competitive …rms are subject to Calvo-style

pricing frictions, so that nominal prices adjust sluggishly. Similar to Gali and Monacelli (2008),

our model assumes that …nancial markets are complete both domestically and internationally, and

that producers set the same price in both the home and foreign market (producer currency pricing).

We generalize the Gali and Monacelli model by allowing for habit persistence in consumption, and

by assuming that some fraction of government consumption may be imported.

   Given the symmetric structure across countries, we look at the home country: the same equa-

tions and calibration apply to the foreign country (aside from population size). Our formulation

below highlights how the model can be decomposed into two parts. The …rst part, which deter-

mines the equilibrium for the currency union (CU) as a whole, is completely standard. The familiar

three equations – the New Keynesian IS curve, the AS curve, and the policy reaction function –

determine aggregate CU output, in‡ation, and policy rates, respectively; and per usual, a core …scal

expansion boosts CU output and in‡ation. The second part involves characterizing the di¤erence


                                                 9
between the response of periphery and core variables. These di¤erences depend exclusively on the

terms of trade and exogenous shocks, including to …scal policy. Importantly, monetary policy only

a¤ects the core and periphery through its e¤ects on the CU as a whole, but does not in‡uence the

terms of trade, or the di¤erences between the responses of periphery and core variables.2

    Our discussion below focuses on the log-linearized equations of the model; a full description of

the underlying model structure is provided in Appendix A.


3.1. The Log-Linearized Benchmark Model


Consumption demand in each economy is determined by the consumption Euler equation condition,

which for the home economy is given by:


                                          ct   =   ct+1jt   + iCU
                                                               t        ct+1jt ;                                 (1)


where iCU
       t  is the policy rate of the central bank in the currency union (CU),                  ct   is consumer price

in‡ation in the home economy, and          ct   is the marginal utility of consumption:

                                                    1
                                          ct   =      (ct     {ct   1       t ):                                 (2)
                                                    b

The marginal utility of consumption varies inversely with current consumption ct ; but rises with past

consumption due to habit persistence. Taken together, these equations imply that consumption falls

in response to higher real interest rates, with the sensitivity depending on intertemporal elasticity

in substitution parameter b =        (1    {       ) : The preference shock        t   boosts consumption demand

at any given interest rate.3       Given that households are in…nitely-lived and taxes are lump-sum,

the manner in which changes in government spending are …nanced has no e¤ect on consumption

decisions.
   2
     This decomposition depends importantly on our assumption of a symmetric structure across countries, including
in the calibration of structural parameters.
   3
     While our model also allows for discount factor shocks, these shocks have been omitted from the description of
the log-linearized equations. The discount factor shock boosts consumption demand, but has no e¤ect on potential
output or labor supply.


                                                            10
        Consumption demand in the CU as a whole is determined as a population-weighted average of

the demand of the home and foreign economies (with weights                               and      , respectively). Imposing the

aggregate resource constraints which equate CU consumption cCU              CU less govern-

        On the aggregate supply side, the in‡ation rate of domestically-produced goods in each country

is determined by a New Keynesian Phillips Curve.                           Thus, the home in‡ation rate                Dt   depends

both on the current marginal cost of production mct and future expected in‡ation:


                                                   Dt    =    Dt+1jt   +      mc mct :                                             (4)


The subscript “D” on in‡ation is used to distinguish the in‡ation rate on domestically-produced

goods         Dt   from the consumer price in‡ation rate               Ct :   Given our assumption of monopolistically

competitive producers and Calvo-style staggered price contracts, the parameter                                    mc   determining

the sensitivity of in‡ation to marginal cost mct depends on the mean price contract duration

The e¤ects on marginal cost associated with ‡uctuations in the product real wage are captured by

the term in brackets. Because wages are fully ‡exible, the product real wage rises in response to

an increase in work hours nt (          is the inverse Frisch elasticity), a fall in the marginal utility of

consumption     ct   (re‡ecting a wealth e¤ect), or to a depreciation of the terms of trade            t.   Marginal

costs also rise in response to factors which reduce the marginal product of labor, including a rise

in hours work (with sensitivity ), or decline in technology zt :

   Aggregate CU in‡ation is determined as a population-weighted average of equation (4):


                                             CU           CU               CU

Using the production function to substitute for hours in terms of output, CU marginal cost can be

expressed solely in terms of the CU output gap and its lag (with the latter re‡ecting the e¤ect of

habit persistence in consumption on labor supply). Thus, the New Keynesian Phillips Curve for

CU in‡ation is given by:


                             CU         CU                   CU            1

   The currency union central bank is assumed to adhere to a Taylor-type policy rule subject to

the ZLB of the form:

Thus, outside of a liquidity trap, the policy rate iCU
                                                    t  rises in response to an increase in the CU

underlying shocks and lags of ytCU;pot (due to habit persistence). For example, abstracting from

A rise in average CU government spending gtCU has the same positive e¤ect on currency union

potential output and the potential real interest rate rtCU;pot irrespective of how it is distributed

across the member states (as does the preference shock                      CU   and technology shock ztCU ). This

result rests on our assumption of a symmetric structure across the home and foreign economy,

aside from population size and home bias in trade.

   Our formulation highlights how a core …scal expansion can be thought of as partly operating

through aggregate channels –boosting euro area in‡ation, the output gap, and possibly the policy

rate.   Given the simple equation structure implied by the IS curve (3), the Phillips Curve (7),

and the CU policy rule (8), the …scal expansion has exactly the same e¤ects on aggregate variables

    This expression assumes that the government spending, consumption taste, and technology shocks all follow

addition to the aggregate impact, we are also interested in how the e¤ects of core …scal stimulus

would be distributed between the periphery and core. Accordingly, we next solve for the di¤erences

in the responses between the home and foreign economy.                                      This approach allows us to solve the

model in a way that sheds light on the question of why the stimulus has a di¤erential impact on

each economy.

      The resource constraint implies that home output yDt may be expressed as a weighted average

of consumption ct ; government spending gt ; and “net exports” nxt ; which are the the di¤erence

between exports mt and imports mt scaled by the trade share of GDP:


                                                              yDt = cy ct + gy gt + nxt ;                                                      (11)


Net exports in turn depend on the percentage di¤erence between exports and imports of each type of

tradable good, including private consumption goods (i.e., mct mct ) and government goods/services

(mgt           mgt ) :

                                                 nxt = ! cy (mct         mct ) + ! gy (mgt         mgt ):                                      (12)

                                                                                                                   C                           G
Each component is weighted by its respective GDP share (i.e. ! cy = ! C                                            Y   and ! gy = ! G          Y ).

Net exports of either type of tradeable rise if home goods become relatively cheaper –that is, the

home terms of trade                  t   depreciates –or if foreign demand rises relative to home demand.                                 Thus:


                                                      mct        mct = ct            ct +   c t,                                               (13)

                                                      mgt        mgt = gt            gt +   g t:                                               (14)


The parameters            c   and        g   capture the sensitivity of each component of real net exports to the terms

of trade and may di¤er between consumption and government goods.6

    Using the home resource constraint and its analogue for the foreign economy, the di¤erence

between home and foreign GDP may be expressed:


                  yDt    yDt = gy (gt          gt ) + cy (ct       ct ) + (nxt     nxt )                                            (15a)

                               = gy (1     !g          ! g )(gt    gt ) +   t   + cy (1        !c          ! c )(ct     ct ):


This equation says that home relative output yDt                       yDt depends on three factors – home relative

government spending, the terms of trade, and home relative consumption – and is very useful for

considering how a rise in foreign government spending gt (identi…ed with higher core spending

below) a¤ects the composition of aggegate demand across the home and foreign economy. Speci…-

cally, the “direct”e¤ect of a rise in foreign government spending of one percentage point of baseline

GDP gy gt is to reduce home relative output by (1                      !g   ! g ) percent, with the smaller-than-unity

response re‡ecting that some government spending may be imported.                                          We call this the “direct”

e¤ect because it holds relative prices (i.e., the terms of trade) constant.                                    The latter two terms

capture the strength of the rebalancing channel, and both vary positively with the terms of trade.

In particular, the term         t   captures how the home country’s terms of trade depreciation – which

would be expected following a rise in foreign government spending – shifts some demand toward

the home country through a net exports channel. The responsiveness coe¢ cient                                               is a weighted

average of the import price sensitivity of private consumption and government services (i.e.,                                          =

cy (! C + ! C )   c   + gy (! G + ! G ) g ). Moreover, home relative consumption ct                                   ct also varies posi-

tively with the terms of trade through the complete markets risk-sharing condition (16) below, and

thus also contributes to rebalancing:

                                                                                               1
                          ct   ct = {(ct   1      ct    1)   + b(1     !C       !C )   t   +       (   t      t ):                   (16)


    It may seem surprising that home relative consumption rises in response to the foreign govern-

ment spending shock. To provide more intuition for why this occurs in the benchmark model, it

                                                                  15
is helpful to draw on the consumption Euler equations to link the consumption di¤erential to the

long-term real interest rate di¤erentials in each economy:

                                                                                                 1

where the long-term real interest rate di¤erential (rLt                     rLt ) may in turn be expressed either in

terms of future short-term real interest rates, or in terms of expected in‡ation di¤erentials:

A foreign government spending hike initially causes foreign in‡ation to rise relative to home in‡a-

tion, implying that the home terms of trade depreciates. But for relative prices to converge in the

long-run –as they must given that the government spending shock is stationary –long-run expected
                                                                                                                    P1
in‡ation in the home country must exceed long-run expected in‡ation abroad (i.e., Et                                 j=1   Dt+j

       P1
> Et     j=1   Dt+j     in equation (18)); implying that expected long-run real interest rates fall at home

relative to abroad.7 Since it is the long-run real interest rate response that matters for consumption

in the benchmark model, equation (17) implies that periphery relative consumption rises relative

to foreign consumption (concurring with equation (16)).

    Relative price convergence plays a key role in accounting for large output spillovers to the

periphery following an expansion of foreign government spending in a liquidity trap. It is important

to point out that the implication that home relative consumption rises in response to higher foreign

government spending is somewhat model-speci…c, and in particular, re‡ects the dependence of

consumption on the long-term real interest rate in the New Keynesian model; as we will show in

Section 6, home relative consumption may decline if consumption depends more on current income

due to “hand-to-mouth”consumption behavior, or if it depends more on the short-term real interest

rate. Thus, the key implications about spillovers that we develop in the next section should not be
    7
      Because the price level immediately jumps in the core when government spending increases (while rising less or
falling in the periphery), the rise in the price level going forward (i.e., long-run expected in‡ation) must be higher in
the periphery.

regarded as hinging on the response of relative consumption; what matters instead is that foreign

government spending has a big enough e¤ect on home in‡ation and real interest rates –including

through the expectation that relative prices will eventually converge – that home consumption is

a¤ected signi…cantly.

    Turning to the home price-setting equation (4) and its foreign counterpart, it follows in‡ation

di¤erentials between the home and foreign economy depend on the di¤erence between home and

foreign marginal costs:


                            Dt      Dt   = (       Dt+1jt        Dt+1jt )   +    mc (mct   mct ):                 (19)


Relative marginal costs –using equation (5) and its foreign analogue –may be expressed:

                                               +
                         mct     mct =              (yDt        yDt ) +     t    (1 + )(zt    zt ):               (20)
                                           1

Relative marginal cost depends on relative output yDt                       yDt , the terms of trade, and on exogenous

productivity di¤erentials between the home and foreign economy.consumption.8                           A rise in home

relative demand boosts home relative marginal costs as wages rise more at home, and because of

diminishing marginal returns to production; conversely, the rise in foreign government spending

we focus on below causes foreign relative marginal costs to increase.                         As noted above, relative

demand can be expressed exclusively as a function of the terms of trade and exogenous shocks

(given complete markets).9

    Since in‡ation di¤erences between the home and foreign economy vary inversely with terms

of trade growth according to          Dt       Dt    =      (   t     t 1)      (see equation A.19 in the Appendix) ,

the solution for the in‡ation di¤erential in equation (19) implies that the terms of trade evolves
   8
     While this expression abstracts from habit for convenience, relative marginal cost also depends on lagged output
gaps.
   9
      There is also an additional role for the terms of trade to a¤ect marginal costs – captured by the middle term
of equation (20) – which re‡ects that a terms of trade depreciation, by increasing home relative consumption, raises
home relative marginal costs through a wealth e¤ect on wages.




                                                                17
according to:

                                   (       t         t 1)   = (    t+1jt         t)        mc (mct   mct ):                     (21)

From an intuitive perspective, a rise in foreign …scal spending gt initially increases aggregate de-

mand by relatively more abroad (as seen from equation 15a). This boosts relative marginal produc-

tion costs abroad, which causes the home terms of trade to depreciate (from equation 21, mct > mct ;

so that     t   rises).   The terms of trade depreciation helps rebalance some of the expansion in ag-

gregate demand towards the home economy. As can be seen by reformulating equation (21), the

home terms of trade continues to depreciate (i.e.,                                    t   > 0) as long as the terms of trade remains
                                               pot
below its ‡exible price level                  t     (in discounted present value):

                                                                                                  pot
                               (       t         t 1)   = (       t+1jt         t)   +    mc mc ( t      t );                   (22)


This expression abstracts from habit persistence for expositional convenience.10

       Equation (15a) underscores that the terms of trade simply evolves as an autonomous di¤erence

equation. Thus, the evolution of the terms of trade does not depend on CU monetary policy, or

whether the currency union is in a liquidity trap. Because relative output levels, relative in‡ation

rates, and relative consumption levels also only depend on the terms of trade, monetary policy has

no e¤ect on these variables: it can only operate through e¤ects that are felt uniformly across the

currency union members.11


3.2. Calibration


We calibrate our model at quarterly frequency, and assume a symmetric calibration for each country

block aside from di¤erences in trade intensities (due to di¤erent population sizes). While many
  10
       The parameter mc captures the reduced form sensitivity of marginal cost to the terms of trade gap. Even with
habit persistence, the terms of trade can be represented as a function only of the terms of trade gap (as a third order
di¤erence equation).
    11
       Moreover, given that we have solved for both aggregate CU variables and corresponding cross-country di¤erences,
country-speci…c variables may be solved for by the relevant identi…es. For example, given that aggregate CU output
is de…ned as ytCU = yDt + yDt , output of the home country may be solved for as yDt = ytCU + (1             )ytd , where
  d                                                       CU     d
yt = yDt yDt ; and foreign output is given by yDt = yt          yt :


                                                                           18
aspects of our calibration are standard, two classes of parameters – including those which govern

the responsiveness of in‡ation, and those which in‡uence trade ‡ows –deserve particular emphasis.

       The degree to which in‡ation responds to marginal cost is the key determinant of both the

aggregate response of CU in‡ation and output, and of the terms of trade response.                        Smets and

Wouters (2003) reported a Phillips Curve slope of                mc   = 0:009 based on estimating a DSGE model

using euro area data, which implies a mean price contract duration of 10 quarters (                 p   = 0:9). The

estimated slope of     mc   = 0:0034 that we report in Section 6 –when using the larger scale model to

…t the responses of empirical VARs to euro area monetary policy and government spending shocks

–implies even more sluggish price adjustment.12

       The response of relative prices in the euro area also seems consistent with a very ‡at Phillips

Curve. Although Figure 1 shows that in‡ation has run noticeably lower in the periphery than in

the core since the …nancial crisis, the di¤erence in in‡ation rates –and implied adjustment in the

terms of trade –seems quite modest in light of the much higher level of resource slack in periphery

economies.13 The upper panel of Figure 2 considers the relationship between the periphery terms

of trade and (periphery) relative marginal costs more directly.                   While the periphery’s terms of

trade have deteriorated (        t   > 0) since 2009 (the solid line) as periphery relative marginal costs

mct       mct have declined (the dotted line, where relative labor shares proxy for marginal cost

di¤erentials), the sensitivity appears quite low.                As seen in the bottom panel, a simple OLS

regression of (    t     t 1)        (   t+1jt   t)   (vertical axis) against mct       mct (horizontal axis) as

implied by equation (21) yields a slope estimate of               mc   = 0:006:

       Based on these considerations, we set          mc   = 0:005 (consistent with     p   = 0:93), which implies

very sluggish price adjustment.              Even so, we recognize that there is considerable uncertainty
  12
      A low Phillips Curve slope in the same range also helps to yield plausible in‡ation responses in the model
following a "Great Recession-sized” shock that generates a large and persistent output gap (as shown below).
   13
      The unemployment rate in the periphery remained in the high teens (levels typically associated with an economic
depression) through most of the 2012-2014 period, over twice the unemployment rate in core economies.




                                                            19
about the Phillips Curve slope.           Most of the extensive literature estimating the Phillips Curve

slope for the industrial countries using pre-…nancial crisis data reported estimates in the range

of   mc   = 0:009      0:014; well above our benchmark setting.14                 As noted in Section 2, some

recent research argues that the low estimated slopes may partly re‡ect various forms of model

misspeci…cation (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt 2014 and Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and

Zakrajšek 2015). With this in mind, we also consider the implications of a higher Phillips Curve

slope in our simulations below.

     The second key group of parameters are those determining the responsiveness of trade ‡ows

as a share of domestic output, including the import share of private (consumption) spending ! C ;

of public spending ! G ; and the trade price elasticity of each of these components (                      c   and   g,


respectively). Ceteris paribus, a higher trade share or higher trade price elasticity ampli…es the

“leakage” associated with a core …scal expansion to the periphery, and thus should push in the

direction of more balanced e¤ects across regions. Trade data from Eurostat for Spain and Italy

indicate an average import/GDP ratio of those economies of about 22 percent in 2007.15                               In

calibrating the trade share in our two country framework, a notable complication involves how

to treat periphery trade with non-EU members: periphery imports are closer to 14-15 percent of

GDP if all non-EU trade is excluded from our computation.                    We assume an import share of 15

percent of GDP for the periphery in our baseline and hence e¤ectively exclude non-EU trade, but

recognize that the e¤ects of a core …scal expansion in reality would depend on how the periphery’s

real exchange rate varied relative to non-EU trading partners.16                  Given that periphery GDP is

      The median estimates of the Phillips Curve slope in empirical studies by e.g. Adolfson et al (2005), Altig et al.
(2011), Galí and Gertler (1999), Galí, Gertler, and López-Salido (2001), Lindé (2005), and Smets and Wouters (2003;
2007) are in this range. As we discuss in Section 6, some recent estimates based on U.S. data point to a very ‡at
slope closer to our benchmark calibration.
   15
      This computation excludes their trade with each other (so as to e¤ectively treat them as a single country as in
the model).
   16
      If the ECB was unconstrained by the ZLB, the ECB would tighten policy in response to higher core spending,
and the euro would appreciate; however, in a deep liquidity trap, the euro (and hence periphery exchange rate) could
well depreciate as real interest rates declined.




                                                          20
about half of that of the core euro area countries, we set the country size parameters                = 1=3 and

   = 2=3; accordingly, balanced trade implies a trade share of 7.5 percent of GDP for the core.

    Our model requires parsing this import share of GDP into private and public spending com-

ponents. We set ! G = ! G = 0 under our benchmark, and then consider ! G = 0.2 (implying ! G

= 0.4) as a high side alternative. Under the benchmark with ! G = ! G = 0; the import share of

private consumption is 20 percent in the periphery and 10 percent in the core (i.e., ! C = 0.2 and

! C = 0.1).17 The trade price elasticity for both private consumption and government spending is

assumed to be slightly above unity (1.1), consistent with estimates from the macro literature on

trade price elasticities.

    The calibration of remaining parameters is fairly standard. The discount factor of                = 0:99875

implies a steady state real interest rate of 0.5 percent (at an annualized rate). With a steady state

in‡ation rate of 2 percent (i.e.,     = :005), the steady state nominal interest rate is 2.5 percent (i.e.,

i = :00625 at a quarterly rate). We set the intertemporal substitution elasticity                 = 1; which is

consistent with log utility over consumption.18          The habit parameter { is set to 0:8: This value

is on the higher side of the range of estimates in the empirical literature, but helps our model

generate a fairly plausible path for the aggregate spending multiplier, even if somewhat lower than

                                                                                                         1
estimated by e.g., Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The Frisch elasticity of labor supply of                    = 0:4

and capital share of        = 0:3 are in the typical range speci…ed in the literature. The government

share of steady state output is set to 23 percent (gy = 0:23); which is in line with the average

government spending share of GDP in the euro area in recent years.

    Our benchmark model assumes that the currency union central bank follows a Taylor-rule in

equation (A.27) that is somewhat more aggressive on in‡ation than a standard Taylor rule, and
  17
     The sizeable disparity between the import share of consumption and that of GDP re‡ects that nearly a quarter
of output is devoted to government spending.
  18
     The scale parameter on the consumption taste shock is set to 0:01 (this parameter is set to have a negligible
impact on model dynamics).

4. Impulse Response to Higher Core Government Spending


Figure 3 examines the e¤ects of a positive shock to core government spending that is scaled to

equal one percent of CU baseline GDP (i.e., 1.5 percent of core GDP). The government spending

hike is assumed to last 10 quarters, after which spending returns to its baseline level; this spending

path is captured by an MA(10) in our scenarios.

   We begin by considering impulse responses in normal times in which monetary policy is uncon-

strained by the zero lower bound. These responses are shown in the left column of Figure 3. From

an aggregate perspective, the higher core spending boosts CU output (the solid line in panel A), CU

in‡ation (panel C), and induces the central bank to raise the policy rate (panel E). Output rises

well above potential (not shown) because the Taylor rule implies that real interest rates increase by

somewhat less than the potential real rate (recalling equation 3); the positive output gap in turn

boosts in‡ation. The CU output multiplier is less than unity due to some crowding out of private

consumption, though habit persistence dampens these crowding-out e¤ects, and hence raises the

spending multiplier relative to a speci…cation abstracting from habit. As discussed above, these

e¤ects on the CU are identical to those that would obtain in a closed economy model.

   Turning to the compositional e¤ects across core and periphery, it is evident that the stimulus

to real GDP is con…ned exclusively to the core. While core output (dash-dotted line in panel A)

rises more than 1 percent above baseline for the duration of the spending hike –consistent with a

average spending multiplier of about 0.8 – periphery output (the dashed line) contracts modestly

in the short-run.   The relatively large increase in core GDP causes core in‡ation to run above

periphery in‡ation for some time, and the implied depreciation of the periphery’s terms of trade

(the dashed line in panel E) boosts periphery real net exports. However, because the rise in core


                                                 22
government spending triggers a sharp rise in real interest rates, the stimulus to periphery GDP

from higher real net exports is swamped by a fall in periphery consumption.

    To shed more light on why the output e¤ects of core spending hikes are strongly tilted towards

the core, it is useful to recall how relative aggregate demand yDt yDt is a¤ected by core government

spending (from equation 15a)):


                 yDt    yDt = gy (1     !g    ! g )(gt    gt ) +       t   + cy (1   !c   ! c )(ct   ct ):         (23)


With the import share of government spending set to zero (! g = ! g = 0), a 1.5 percent of GDP rise

in core government spending (i.e., gy gt = :015) would cause periphery relative demand yDt                        yDt to

fall by a commensurate amount if the terms of trade                t   remained unchanged, re‡ecting that in this

case neither relative consumption ct          ct nor relative trade ‡ows (captured by the term               t)   would

adjust. Given sluggish price adjustment, the terms of trade in fact changes very little in the near-

term, which accounts for why core output in fact rises nearly 1.5 percent above periphery output

(panel A) immediately following the shock.               Subsequently, the gap between core and periphery

output narrows as terms of trade depreciation (panel E) boosts periphery real net exports while

causing core real net exports to contract, and also induces periphery consumption to rise relative

to core consumption.19

    Even so, the …gure shows that this “rebalancing”towards the periphery isn’t particularly large

over the period in which the …scal expansion remains in force.                        The adjustment coming from

relative trade ‡ows       t   is quite modest because sluggish price adjustment damps the movements in

the terms of trade (panel F shows that the depreciation peaks at only 0.7 percent), and because

the trade responsiveness parameter           is fairly small (around 0.3) given observed trade shares and

our calibration of trade price elasticities of around unity.20 Similarly, periphery consumption rises
  19
     Our model constrains the “local currency multiplier” to be less than unity (as the 1.5 percent of GDP rise in
core spending relative to periphery spending causes core output to rise by less than 1.5 percent relative to periphery
output). The model of Section 6 includes hand to mouth agents that allow the local currency multiplier to be
considerably larger, and closer to the empirical estimates mentioned in Section 2.
  20
     Only about one quarter of the 1.5 percent “autonomous” shift in demand towards the core is o¤set by relative


                                                          23
only slightly above core consumption.21

    We next consider the e¤ects of core …scal expansion in a liquidity trap. The right column of

Figure 3 shows the e¤ects of the same 1.5 percent of GDP rise in core government spending in

a liquidity trap lasting 12 quarters; the liquidity trap is generated from an adverse consumption

taste shock that persistently depresses the potential real rate rtCU;pot :22 At an aggregate CU level,

the highly accommodative monetary policy stance in a liquidity trap makes …scal expansion more

potent in stimulating output and in‡ation than under the Taylor rule which is in force in normal

times. CU output expands around 1.3 percent after four quarters in a 12 quarter liquidity trap (the

solid line in panel B) rather than 0.7 percent in the case of no liquidity trap (the solid line in panel

A), with the larger expansion re‡ecting that private consumption is “crowded in”rather than out by

a fall in real interest rates. These aggregate implications are consistent with an extensive literature

showing that …scal policy has ampli…ed e¤ects in a liquidity trap, cf. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and

Rebelo (2011) and Woodford (2011). Consistent with this literature, the stimulus to CU output

due to …scal expansion quickly dissipates once government spending reverts to its initial level.

    The more accommodative monetary policy stance in a liquidity trap relative to normal times

imparts a commensurate degree of stimulus to each CU member, recalling from Section 2 that the

gap between the output responses in the core and periphery is invariant to monetary policy. Thus,

as can be seen by comparing panel B with panel A, the output responses in both the periphery

and core in panel B are shifted up by the same exactly the same amount in percent terms relative

to the case of no liquidity trap (e.g., about 0.5 percent after four quarters). Output still expands

by considerably more in the core, but the spillovers to the periphery are now positive and sizeable.

A liquidity trap, in e¤ect, “lifts all boats” in tandem relative to normal times. Intuitively, both
price changes after 10 quarters (the …nal quarter of the government spending hike).
  21
     Recalling the discussion in section 3, periphery consumption rises more than core consumption because periphery
expected in‡ation exceeds core in‡ation (given that core prices initially rise by more, and that relative prices must
converge in the long-run).
  22
     The taste shock is assumed to follow a …rst order autoregression with persistence of 0.9.



                                                         24
periphery and core GDP are boosted by the same degree because ECB policy rates do not rise

in a liquidity trap – which provides equivalent stimulus to each member state – and due to the

expansionary e¤ect this more accommodative policy stance has on in‡ation in each member.

       The larger GDP e¤ects on both the periphery and core in a liquidity trap are due to a larger

response of consumption relative to normal times. By contrast, given that real net exports depend

only on the consumption gap ct ct and terms of trade –both of which are invariant to the stance of

monetary policy –the response of real net exports turns out to be the same in a liquidity trap as in

normal times. Our results showing ampli…ed spillovers are consistent with the qualitative analysis

of Farhi and Werning (2012), who also underscore how a crowding in of private consumption plays

a key role in generating positive output spillovers in a liquidity trap.

       Overall, changes in core government spending seem likely to exert substantial e¤ects on pe-

riphery output in a deep liquidity trap. Under such conditions, a core government spending hike

increases periphery GDP through qualitatively similar channels as would an easing of monetary pol-

icy (if the periphery had an independent monetary policy): lower real interest rates boost periphery

consumption, and terms of trade depreciation stimulates net exports. However, a key di¤erence is

that a (hypothetical) monetary easing by the periphery central bank would depress nominal inter-

est rates and raise in‡ation, while the core …scal expansion we consider relies exclusively on higher

in‡ation to reduce real interest rates.23 A more subtle di¤erence –but which may have important

implications for welfare, as we explore in Section 5 –is that the stimulus to periphery GDP is very

drawn out.      As seen in Figure 3, periphery output (panel B) remains elevated for several years,

even after the government spending shock has died out and CU GDP returned to baseline. These

longer-term expansionary e¤ects re‡ect that periphery in‡ation must run persistently above core

in‡ation in the medium-run (panel D) to allow relative prices to converge back to their pre-shock
  23
     Moreover, under an independent monetary policy in the periphery, the periphery nominal and real exchange
rate would depreciate immediately.

level. Thus, …scal stimulus can have longer-lived distributional e¤ects on member states through

relative price channels even if the aggregate CU output e¤ects dissipate quickly.


4.1. The Longer the Liquidity Trap, the Stronger the Spillover E¤ects


A key question is how the e¤ects of a core spending expansion vary with the expected duration

of the liquidity trap. The upper panels of Figure 4 show the e¤ect of the same core government

spending expansion on both periphery output (left panel) and core output (right panel) for liquidity

traps ranging in duration from zero quarters (normal times) to 12 quarters. The e¤ects are derived

as the average response over the …rst four quarters following the stimulus, and hence can essentially

be read o¤ the IRFs in Figure 3 for both the normal times case and for the 12 quarter trap. The

…gure indicates that an expansion of core spending is “counterproductive” to the aim of boosting

periphery output even in a liquidity trap lasting up to about a year: periphery output falls slightly,

while the GDP stimulus accrues wholly to the core.

   Our result that the spillovers to the periphery are negative in a shorter-lived liquidity trap –

and that the aggregate multipliers are fairly modest –may seem surprising in light of the literature

suggesting a sharp disparity between the e¤ects of …scal expansion between a liquidity trap and

normal times.     There are three important reasons for why a short-lived liquidity trap doesn’t

look too di¤erent from normal times in our baseline model.        The …rst reason is that we allow

for substantial habit persistence in consumption.     This allays the strong “crowding out” e¤ects

on consumption that would occur in normal times when interest rates rise in response to higher

government spending, while limiting the crowding in e¤ects due to lower real interest rates in a

liquidity trap.

   The second reason –explored more fully below –is that in‡ation is much less responsive under

our calibration than often assumed in the literature.



                                                 26
    The third reason is that government spending shock is assumed to follow an MA(10), and

hence persists well beyond the duration of the shorter-lived liquidity traps considered in the …gure.

As emphasized by Woodford (2011) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2012), this …scal

overhang attenuates the aggregate CU multiplier relative to a “ideally-structured”…scal intervention

that dissipates before the economy exits the liquidity trap. In particular, to the extent that …scal

spending was expected to remain high even after the economy exited the liquidity trap, long-term

interest rates would be pushed up, generating negative spillovers to the periphery in short-lived

traps. It turns out that spillovers to the periphery would always be positive – even in a transient

liquidity trap – provided that the core spending only rose during the period in which monetary

policy was constrained by the ZLB. However, practical impediments would make it unlikely to

achieve a rapid phase-in and phase-out within a few quarters; and moreover, even if such a nimble

…scal response was feasible, the short duration wouldn’t provide much, if any, stimulus to the

periphery (since in‡ation wouldn’t rise much).24

    Somewhat more broadly, our results underscore that core …scal expansion would probably only

be likely to boost periphery GDP noticeably if the central bank was expected to remain accom-

modative for a fairly prolonged period of a couple of years or more.              We should add that some

caution is warranted with respect to the quantitative estimates from this simple model, as it tends

to understate spillovers relative to the policy-oriented model in Section 6; but this main conclusion

is robust.


4.2. The Steeper the Phillips Curve, the Stronger the Spillover E¤ects


While slow price adjustment seems consistent with Europe’s experience since the Great Recession,

it is possible that the Phillips Curve slope is higher than we have assumed in our benchmark
  24
     As Cogan et al (2010) have pointed out, only around a third of the increased U.S. federal spending on goods
and services authorized by the American Reconstruction and Recovery Act was earmarked to be spent within the
…rst two years of the ARRA’s passage in February 2009.



                                                      27
calibration.   Accordingly, Figure 5 shows IRFs to the core spending shock under a calibration

with a steeper Phillips Curve slope: speci…cally, we set    p   = 0:88, implying a Phillips Curve slope

parameter of     mc   = .017, which is slightly above the median point estimates in the literature

mentioned earlier.

   In normal times, the faster terms of trade adjustment (panel E) generates more rebalancing

towards the periphery than in the benchmark: However, monetary policy also raises interest rates

(panel E) by more given the bigger increase in in‡ation. As a result, CU output rises by less, and

periphery output still contracts (as under the benchmark calibration).

   The …scal expansion under the higher Phillips Curve slope does have dramatically di¤erent

implications than in the benchmark in a persistent liquidity trap. With the higher Phillips Curve

slope, the higher in‡ation implies much lower real interest rates, and consequently a much larger

expansion of CU GDP (comparing panel B of Figure 5 with panel B of Figure 3). With the larger

rebalancing e¤ect now reinforced by the bigger real interest rate decline, periphery GDP rises over

1 12 percent in a 12 quarter liquidity trap, over half as much as core GDP. The dashed lines in the

upper panels of Figure 4 show how the e¤ects on core and periphery GDP vary with the duration

of the liquidity trap under this alternative calibration.

   This calibration is useful for highlighting conditions that might give rise to very large positive

…scal spillovers, and is of particular interest given that calibrations of the Phillips Curve slope in

this range are often used in the literature. Although the implied responsiveness of in‡ation seems

somewhat of a stretch in light of the Great Recession experience, the scenario does underscore

some upside risk to …scal spillovers if in‡ation proves more responsive than assumed under the

benchmark.




                                                  28
4.3. The Larger the Import Content of Spending, the Stronger the Spillover E¤ects


Policymakers often draw attention to terms of trade adjustment as a key channel through which

the periphery might bene…t from a core …scal expansion. But with sluggish price adjustment, the

stimulus accruing through this channel is likely to be quite modest. Accordingly, we next consider

how allowing for a sizeable component of core spending to fall on periphery imports could facilitate

rebalancing the aggregate demand stimulus more evenly across the core and periphery.

    In an extreme case in which the core government spending was disbursed equally across currency

union members according to population size – a “no home bias” case in which ! G = 1/3 and ! G

= 2/3 – equation (23) indicates that the periphery and core would share equally in the stimulus.

Figure 6 shows the e¤ects in a less extreme case when the import share of core government spending

! G is set to 0.20 (20 percent of government spending in the steady state).                    As this reallocation

of spending has no consequences for CU aggregates, the e¤ects of the core spending hike on CU

output are identical to Figure 3 (in which ! G = 0): However, the changes in the pattern of GDP

response across core and periphery are striking: the rise in periphery GDP is more than half as

large as the rise in core GDP even in normal times. Thus, core spending may provide considerable

stimulus to the periphery even in a short-lived liquidity trap if it falls substantially on periphery

imports. As seen in the bottom panels of Figure 4, the boost to both periphery (and core) GDP

is even larger in a long-lived liquidity trap.

    Overall, these results underscore how direct purchases may allow core …scal spending to have

much more balanced e¤ects on core and periphery output even if terms of trade adjustment is quite

sluggish. It is important to note, however, that the greater spillovers to periphery GDP re‡ect a

larger boost to periphery real net exports than in the baseline without direct purchases; periphery

consumption actually rises a bit less than under our baseline calibration.25 As we will discuss in
  25
     Because the output expansion is more balanced across regions, there is less upward pressure on the terms of trade;
and hence periphery in‡ation doesn’t have to rise as much to bring relative prices back to their long-run equilibrium


                                                          29
the next section, these compositional e¤ects turn out to be consequential in evaluating the extent

to which increasing the import share of government purchases a¤ects welfare.



5. Welfare E¤ects of Higher Core Government Spending


The literature analyzing the e¤ects of …scal expansion in a liquidity trap has largely focused on

environments which abstract from di¤erences in economic conditions across countries or states.

The implicit assumption is that each member of a common currency area – whether a country or

state –faces an equally severe downturn, and would get a similar boost in government spending if

a stimulus package were enacted. The situation facing policymakers in Europe is di¤erent in two

important respects.          First, resource slack in the periphery economies is much larger than in the

core, and in‡ation is correspondingly more subdued. Second, assuming that …scal stimulus would

have to come mainly from the core economies, the expansionary e¤ects on CU GDP would be likely

to be concentrated in the core economies.

    These asymmetries across member states – both in initial business cycle positions, and in

the e¤ects of …scal policy – have important implications for gauging the welfare e¤ects of …scal

expansion.     In this section, we illustrate some of the considerations that would seem relevant in

designing a …scal stimulus program in this environment.

    To conduct our analysis, we use two alternative measures of welfare.                               First, we assume a

standard ad hoc loss function in which the policymaker only cares about minimizing squared output

gaps and in‡ation gaps in both the core and periphery economies:

           1X          n h              2                    2
                                                                 i              h          2                    2
                                                                                                                    io
   LCP
    t =
                   s           P er
                               Dt+s         +   y   xPt+s
                                                        er
                                                                     + (1   )       Core
                                                                                    Dt+s       +   y    xCore
                                                                                                         t+s             ;   (24)
           4
             s=0


Thus, the welfare loss LCP
                        t  is population-weighted average of the loss function for each CU member

(core or periphery). Each region’s loss function is simply a sum of the squared in‡ation gap and
level. This smaller rise in periphery expected in‡ation translates into a smaller rise in periphery consumption.


                                                             30
squared output gap, with the parameter          y   determining the relative weight on the output gap set

to 1=3 for each region.       The in‡ation target        is set to 2 percent. While this loss function is

admittedly simple, it helps address the interesting question of the extent to which …scal policy can

substitute for monetary policy when the latter is constrained by the ZLB by “…lling in” output

and in‡ation gaps.26      Our second welfare measure – considered in Section 5.2 – is based on the

discounted utility of households in our model.


5.1. Welfare Results under Ad Hoc Loss Function


5.1.1. Fiscal Expansion in Core and Periphery (Fiscal Union)


As a useful reference point for assessing the e¤ects of a core-only …scal expansion, we …rst consider

the welfare e¤ects of …scal expansion under the assumption that the euro area countries were part

of a …scal union.     From the perspective of the euro area as a whole, there would seem a strong

rationale for …scal expansion under current conditions: output gaps are large, in‡ation is below

target, and monetary policy is likely to be constrained by the ZLB for a prolonged period. A …scal

union would presumably give more scope to the periphery economies to expand domestic …scal

spending than in the current environment in which concerns about debt sustainability and adverse

market reactions appear to impose tight constraints. Exactly how much latitude is unclear, as it

would depend on the speci…c features of the …scal compact. However, it seems plausible that such

a union might allow an expansion in euro area government spending that was distributed roughly

equally across member states on a per capita basis.27 Accordingly, we assume that each member

state boosts …scal spending by a commensurate amount under …scal union.

    The welfare bene…ts of a …scal stimulus program clearly depend on how output and in‡ation
  26
     This assumption would seem most reasonable to the extent that the additional stimulus is on goods for which
there was considerable scope to substitute purchases intertemporally (e.g., construction or transport equipment).
  27
     The large-scale expansion of U.S. …scal spending authorized in 2009 under the ARRA was reasonably balanced
across U.S. states in per capita terms (Orr and Sporn, 2012), notwithstanding that spending on some components of
these programs (such as unemployment compensation) varied with regional economic conditions.



                                                       31
gaps in the core and periphery would evolve absent any …scal stimulus.                      Our baseline assumes

adverse consumption demand shocks (i.e., lower                 t)   cause a prolonged recession in the euro area

that is especially concentrated in the periphery.28 The solid lines in Figure 7 depict this baseline.

Speci…cally, the output gap in the core (the solid line in panel C) is about                  2 percent at the end

of 2015 and nearly closes within three years; whereas the output gap in the periphery (panel D) is

about     5 percent initially, and slack remains sizeable even after a few years. In‡ation stays well

below 2 percent in both the core (panel E) and periphery (panel F), but runs particularly low in the

periphery (with some de‡ation on average in 2015).29 Our calibration of the Taylor rule implies

that the CU interest rate remains pinned at zero for 12 quarters (noting that the policy rate is

expressed as an annualized percentage rate, or APR).


                  Table 1: Losses under Baseline: Ad Hoc Welfare Function

    Note: The overall loss LCP
                            t   is based on eq. (24) for 2015:Q1 to 2020:Q4. The core and periphery losses are based
on their respective discounted squared in‡ation and output gaps with y = 1=3:



    Table 1 reports the losses under the welfare measure (24) that are derived from cumulating the

discounted squared output and in‡ation gaps from 2015:Q1 to 2020:Q4; given that the e¤ects of the

…scal actions we consider on output and in‡ation gaps are small after six years, the welfare gains

reported below would change very little if the horizon were extended beyond that period. Clearly,
  28
      The e¤ects of …scal stimulus on output and in‡ation gaps analyzed below do not hinge on the particular type
of shock(s) driving the output gap in the baseline. Other shocks, such as the productivity shocks zt and zt ; would
yield similar results if calibrated to imply the same evolution of the core and periphery output gaps as shown in
Figure 7 (i.e., both the positive e¤ects would be similar, as well as the normative implications under the quadratic
criterion). This invariance re‡ects the tight link between output gaps and in‡ation in our benchmark model, and
would not obtain if there were features such as wage rigidities that implied tradeo¤s. It is important to note that
the welfare results under the utility-based criterion considered in Section 5.2 do depend somewhat on the nature of
the shocks driving the output and in‡ation gaps, re‡ecting that welfare depends on the evolution of consumption and
other variables; however, we found that experimenting with di¤erent underlying shocks had relatively little e¤ect on
our results (provided that the alternative shocks implied similar output gap and in‡ation responses).
  29
      The output gaps in the baseline are broadly similar –albeit somewhat smaller –to those forecast by the OECD
in its interim economic outlook that was released in March 2015 (for example, the OECD projects that the output
gap in the euro area will be about 3 percent in 2015, compared with 2-1/2 percent in our baseline, and almost 6
percent in the periphery, compared with 4 percent in our baseline). The large and persistent output gaps in the
baseline in turn imply considerable downward pressure on in‡ation, notwithstanding that Phillips Curve slope is very
‡at under our baseline calibration; under more typical calibrations of Phillips Curve slope used in the literature, the
decline in in‡ation would be even sharper.


                                                          32
losses are heavily concentrated in the periphery.

       Against this backdrop, we assume that a CU-wide …scal stimulus is initiated that boosts govern-

ment spending by 1 percent of baseline GDP in both the core and periphery. The stimulus begins in

the same quarter as the adverse shocks and lasts 12 quarters, and thus is “well-timed” to coincide

with the period in which monetary policy is constrained. We compute the model solution –both

under the baseline and for the scenario with higher …scal spending – using a nonlinear solution

algorithm for solving perfect foresight models in DYNARE.30

       The blue dashed lines in Figure 7 labelled “Fiscal Union: CU-Wide Stimulus” show the e¤ects

of this …scal expansion.      The joint …scal expansion narrows the periphery output gap (panel D)

substantially – as well as the gap between periphery in‡ation (panel F) and the 2 percent target –

while nearly closing the core output gap (panel C). Panel A in Table 2 reports the welfare gains from

…scal stimulus, which is measured as the di¤erence between the welfare loss assuming no stimulus

(from Table 1) and the welfare loss under the stimulus program.                   Aggregate welfare improves

substantially, with welfare losses cut by half relative to the baseline.             While both the core and

periphery experience welfare improvements, the periphery experiences much larger absolute gains

given the large initial output and in‡ation gaps in that region (which are penalized heavily under

the quadratic objective).

       Fiscal policy in this setting is similar to monetary policy insofar as both forms of stimulus

operate with equal force on each member state, and hence can’t close output (and in‡ation) gaps

in each.      Larger welfare improvements could be achieved by channeling relatively more of the

…scal stimulus to the periphery where the marginal value of additional stimulus is higher – and

thus essentially using core and periphery spending as separate instruments to “…ll gaps” in each
  30
      We assume in our simulations below that the CU central bank does not counteract the core …scal stimulus by
raising rates any earlier than in the absence of stimulus. This limited form of commitment modestly ampli…es the
stimulus from the …scal expansion. Upon exit, policy rates follow the Taylor rule, and thus eventually react to the
higher demand caused by the …scal expansion.

spending.

5.1.2. Fiscal Expansion only in Core


We next assess how a …scal expansion that was concentrated exclusively in the core would a¤ect

welfare in both the core and periphery; for comparability with the previous analysis, we continue

to assume that the core spending hike equals 1 percent of CU GDP. As seen by the red dotted lines

in Figure 7 labeled “Core Only Stimulus,” the core spending hike provides a much larger boost to

core GDP and in‡ation than to the periphery: the core output gap turns noticeably positive, while

the periphery output gap only narrows modestly.

       The …rst row of Panel B in Table 2 reports the welfare gains under the core-only …scal expansion

under our benchmark calibration in which the import content of government spending is zero

(! G = 0). The core …scal expansion improves welfare by less than under the …scal union case
  31
     As is clear from previous work by Gali and Monacelli (2008), it would not be optimal to close output or in‡ation
gaps in each member state if there were some costs of expanding government spending (at least beyond a certain
level). First, it would be essential to balance any direct …scal costs against the bene…ts of reducing output (and
in‡ation) gaps. Second, the optimal policy would also take account of how current increases in government spending
a¤ected the terms of trade and hence future output (and in‡ation) gaps. In particular, higher periphery government
spending would boost periphery relative prices and thus tend to hurt periphery net exports in the future. Because
the optimal policy would take account of both the direct …scal costs and the loss in future competitiveness, it would
not be optimal to close the periphery output gap completely (and similarly for the core).



                                                         34
(reported in the upper panel), especially for the periphery.             This is because the core expansion

boosts aggregate demand relatively more in exactly the region (the core) in which it is “least

needed”according to the ad hoc welfare criterion. The disparity in the welfare results between the

core-only and …scal union cases would be even larger if the size of the …scal expansion under each

case were chosen optimally to maximize the quadratic welfare criterion (24): this re‡ects that the

optimal expansion turns out to be considerably larger under …scal union because …scal union allows

more of the …scal stimulus to be channeled to the region where its marginal value is comparatively

high.32

       Even so, it is remarkable that the core-only …scal expansion does achieve a good portion of the

welfare gains that would accrue under …scal union.             Because output and in‡ation gaps are very

large in the periphery –and output spillovers to the periphery sizeable in a long-lived liquidity trap

– the periphery derives substantial bene…ts from core …scal expansion.                Moreover, even the core

bene…ts from a modest-sized expansion that can help pare its own output and in‡ation gap.

       An expansion of government spending in the core would raise welfare even more if some of the

increase in core government spending was on imported periphery goods.                    As we have shown in

Section 4.3, such an approach balances the stimulus to output and in‡ation more evenly across the

core and periphery, and thus appears more akin to …scal union than the case in which core spending

falls exclusively on domestically-produced goods. For a calibration with a high core import share

of 20 percent (! G = 0:2); the e¤ects of a core-only …scal expansion on output and in‡ation gaps

in each region are very similar to that achieved under …scal union (and hence not shown in Figure

7 for expositional reasons). By implication, Panel B in Table 2 shows that the welfare gains to

the currency union approach those achieved under …scal union, with both the core and periphery
  32
     The optimal spending hike under …scal union is 2.5 percent of CU GDP, while the optimal hike for the core-only
case is 3.1 percent of core GDP, which is equal to 2.1 percent of CU GDP. Under an optimally-sized …scal expansion,
the welfare gain to the CU is 18.0 under …scal union, compared with 14.9 under the core-only expansion.

5.2. Welfare Results under Utility-Based Criterion


Our previous welfare results indicate that an expansion of core government spending may improve

periphery welfare considerably by shrinking the periphery’s sizeable output and in‡ation gaps; and

that comparatively large welfare improvements –for both core and periphery –may be achieved to

the extent that a larger share of core government spending falls on periphery imports.

    We next consider the robustness of these normative results to an alternative welfare measure

based on the discounted conditional expected utility of the representative household in each member

state in our model:

        1
                  (                                                                                                     )
        X                                                   (Nt+j )1+     #G                                    1   1

   Et             ln (Ct+j    {Ct+j    1    C   t+j )     0           +      1 (Gt+j           {G Gt+j     1)       G       :
                                                              1+        1
        j=0                                                                  G

                                                                                                                        (25)

Household utility depends positively on public and private consumption, and inversely on hours

worked. Welfare in the currency union on the “utility-based”metric is simply a population-weighted

average of the utility functionals of periphery and core households.34


5.2.1. Fiscal Expansion in Core and Periphery (Fiscal Union)


Panel A of Table 3 reports welfare gains under …scal union using the utility-based objective (25) :

Because we continue to assume that government spending in each CU member would expand by 1

percent of GDP under …scal union, the impulse responses are the same as in Figure 7 (the dashed

lines labelled “Fiscal Union”). The utility gains in the table are summarized in terms of the “con-
   33
      If a sizeable share of the rise in core government spending fell on periphery imports, then a rise in core government
spending would boost periphery GDP and welfare even in a short-lived liquidity trap, at least under this ad hoc welfare
metric.
   34
      To perform this welfare analysis, we assume that households regard government spending on goods and services
as somewhat more substitutable through time than private consumption, and that habit persistence is somewhat
lower (speci…cally, we set G = 2; so that the elasticity of substitution is 2, and the habit persistence parameter {G
= 0.4). Finally, we set #G to account for a steady steady share of government consumption to output of :23; and
  0 so that N (hours worked per capita) equals unity in the steady state.




                                                            36
sumption equivalent compensation”(CEV henceforth), which is the permanent percent increase in

household private consumption –relative to the baseline with no …scal expansion –that is required

to make households equally well o¤ as under the government spending expansion. Following the

usual approach in the literature, household welfare depends on how the …scal expansion a¤ects the

entire in…nite discounted sum of period utility. The aggregate CU CEV is a population-weighted

average over the core and periphery.

households’ consumption that makes them— in expectation— equally well-o¤ under no …scal stimulus as when core
government spending expands. Aggregate CEV is calculated as the weighted sum of CEV in the core and periphery.



    As under the ad hoc loss criterion above, the equal-sized …scal expansion in each CU member

is strongly welfare-improving.       Fiscal expansion is bene…cial because it boosts utility directly

through increasing government services, and indirectly through inducing an expansion of private

consumption, with the latter re‡ecting that the higher in‡ation induced by the …scal expansion

reduces real interest rates. Crucially, this increase in utility from public and private goods comes

at a low cost in terms of foregone leisure because labor is underutilized and in‡ation suboptimally

low. The low level of in‡ation is undesirable because it implies substantial ine¢ ciency in goods

production in our modeling framework with staggered price setting (Rotemberg and Woodford,

1997), and hence acts like a tax on production; accordingly, a key bene…t of …scal expansion is

that it boosts productivity by pushing in‡ation closer to target (assumed to be 2 percent). Aside

                                                      37
from the implication –clear from Panel A in Table 3 –that the periphery bene…ts more from …scal

expansion due to its relatively large degree of slack, the logic favoring …scal expansion under …scal

union closely parallels that provided by Woodford (2011) for a closed economy.         In particular,

because the …scal expansion is the same in each CU member, it has no e¤ect on the terms of trade

or net exports; accordingly, all of induced expansion in employment goes to increasing either public

or private consumption.


5.2.2. Fiscal Expansion only in Core


The utility-based metric in e¤ect poses a much more stringent test than the simple ad hoc loss func-

tion (24) for assessing whether increases in core government spending improves periphery welfare:

assuming as we do that the periphery gets no direct utility bene…ts from the higher core government

spending (e.g., from better roads in France), periphery welfare only improves if the core spending

hike boosts periphery consumption enough to o¤set the cost of working additional hours. Thus,

the composition of the rise in periphery GDP matters a great deal for welfare, as well as the timing

of the rise in consumption. Even if the periphery output gap is large and the output spillovers to

the periphery fairly big–conditions that lead to substantial periphery welfare improvements under

the simple quadratic loss function – periphery welfare may fall under the utility-based criterion if

the rise in periphery GDP is driven by net exports, or if the stimulus persists too long.

   As seen in Panel B in Table 3 (above), the expansion of core spending in the case in which the

import content is zero (! G = 0) yields an improvement in core welfare.      Core welfare improves

because the core’s sizeable resource slack makes it less costly –and hence more desirable –to produce

more government services.     The e¤ects on periphery welfare are more complicated.         Periphery

discounted welfare improves, though by much less than core welfare. This re‡ects that the core

…scal expansion boosts the period utility of periphery households in the near-term, but has slightly



                                                 38
negative e¤ects on their period utility at horizons much beyond a year.

       Figure 8 is helpful for understanding these results, as it shows the “partial e¤ects”of a rise in core

government spending on key components of household welfare.35 Focusing …rst on our benchmark

case with ! G = 0 – shown by the red dotted lines – it is evident that periphery consumption

(panel B), real net exports (panel F), and employment (panel D) each respond positively to the

core spending shock. As might be expected in a deep recession, the bene…ts of the rise in periphery

(private) consumption outweigh the cost in terms of labor e¤ort at least in the near-term, which

accounts for why the period utility of the representative periphery household (panel H) improves

for over a year.      Some of the improvement in periphery household utility re‡ects that the core

spending hike boosts periphery in‡ation from a suboptimally low level, and this reduced in‡ation

tax distortion means that less labor is required to produce any given quantity of output.

       It may seem surprising that the core …scal expansion doesn’t provide an even more sustained

boost to periphery welfare: after all, the periphery responses look very similar qualitatively to

the usual e¤ects of a favorable monetary shock under an independent monetary policy, insofar as

lower periphery real interest rates crowd in consumption, and a depreciation of the periphery’s

terms of trade boosts real net exports. Monetary stimulus of this type might be expected to be

very bene…cial given the periphery’s poor initial conditions. However, to achieve welfare bene…ts

under the metric (25), it is critical that the policy action boost consumption in the near-term

when the gap between the marginal utility of consumption and disutility of work is especially large.

From the prism of the utility-based welfare metric, there are two key problems with how the core

…scal expansion a¤ects the periphery. First, a sizeable share of the expansion in periphery output –

about 1/4 under our benchmark calibration –is due to higher real net exports rather than increased

periphery consumption; in e¤ect, this diversion of employment towards net exports operates like a
  35
     Thus, the …gure shows the deviation between the responses that include a rise in core government spending
(layered onto the baseline) and the baseline.



                                                      39
tax, because it means that the rise in periphery employment is associated with a smaller near-term

consumption boost. Second, the stimulus to periphery consumption is very spread out over time, as

evident in panel B (and discussed previously in Section 4.3). The protracted consumption response

re‡ects that periphery in‡ation remains elevated for a long time –which holds down periphery real

interest rates –to allow the terms of trade to converge back to its pre-shock level. This longer-term

boost to periphery consumption, coming as it does after periphery consumption would have largely

recovered even absent …scal stimulus, simply isn’t worth the labor cost.

   These considerations also help explain why an expansion of core spending causes periphery

welfare to deteriorate considerably – as reported in Panel B in Table 3 – in the case in which

core imports are sizeable (! G = 0:2): These results di¤er dramatically from the implications of the

ad hoc loss function in which the higher import content was a major plus for welfare in both CU

members. As we have seen –and is also shown by the blue dashed lines in Figure 8 –the periphery

GDP expansion under the higher import share calibration is more heavily driven by net exports,

which the utility-based welfare measure views as undesirable.

   As might be expected, a core government spending hike yields a larger improvement in periphery

household welfare if initial conditions are noticeably worse than assumed in Figures 7 and 8. To

illustrate this, Table 4 reports the e¤ects of the same core government spending expansion against

an alternative baseline in which output gaps in each member are much larger (slightly below minus

8 percent in the periphery, and close to minus 3 percent in the core), and in‡ation falls well

below zero in the currency union as a whole.      Periphery period utility – as well as CU welfare

– improves very persistently under these conditions, leading to an improvement in the discounted

welfare measure. The output spillovers to the periphery are not only larger than under the initial

conditions underlying Figures 7 and 8, but fueled by a bigger consumption rise; moreover, the

welfare bene…ts of boosting both consumption and in‡ation are larger given the poorer initial



                                                 40
conditions.

households’ consumption that makes them— in expectation— equally well-o¤ under no …scal stimulus as when core
government spending expands. Aggregate CEV is calculated as the weighted sum of CEV in the core and periphery.



    Taking stock of our results, each of the alternative welfare measures we have considered – ad

hoc and utility-based – suggests that a suitably-designed …scal stimulus program in the core can

improve near-term welfare in both the periphery and core. The welfare improvements under each

measure are clearly larger and more persistent the worse the baseline and longer monetary policy is

likely to be constrained from raising interest rates. Welfare improvements would also be larger if

spillovers to periphery consumption were bigger than in our baseline (as would occur if e.g., prices

were more ‡exible than in our benchmark). However, there is clearly some tension between how the

welfare measures score policy actions which reduce the periphery output gap signi…cantly, but don’t

provide much short-run stimulus to consumption. This tension can have important implications

for the design of a core stimulus program, and in particular, for assessing the desirability of a higher

import content of core government purchases.

    Our sense is that the utility-based analysis is useful for highlighting how the welfare e¤ects of

…scal expansion depend partly on how the stimulus a¤ects the composition of demand – between

consumption and net exports – and that …scal policy may have long-lived e¤ects arising through

relative price channels that may possibly reduce welfare. Even so, the utility-based welfare met-

ric probably understates some of the bene…ts of reducing the output gap and unemployment in

economies plagued by high resource slack. Indeed, our model embeds two key assumptions – of


                                                      41
perfect consumption risk-sharing, and that all variation in labor e¤ort occurs at the intensive mar-

gin – that tend to minimize the costs of a large output gap, and correspondingly, to understate

the bene…ts of …scal expansion.    While these assumptions are useful for analytical tractability,

household consumption in reality depends heavily on each household’s employment status. These

considerations suggest that policies that could markedly reduce the periphery’s output gap –and as

a result, reduce both unemployment and consumption dispersion across households –would prob-

ably enhance periphery welfare. All in all, our sense is that the welfare bene…ts of …scal expansion

probably lie between the two measures, but tilt more in the direction suggested by the simple ad

hoc loss function.



6. The E¤ects of a Core Spending Expansion in a Larger Scale Model


The benchmark model is useful for highlighting many of the key factors likely to shape how a core

…scal expansion would a¤ect the periphery. However, the benchmark model likely understates both

the aggregate e¤ects of core …scal expansion and spillovers to the periphery due to the exclusion of

Keynesian multiplier and accelerator e¤ects on household and business spending. A consequence is

that the aggregate government spending multiplier is relatively modest even in a persisent liquidity

trap (unless in‡ation rises more than under our baseline calibration).

   Accordingly, we next reconsider the e¤ects of a core government spending expansion in a larger-

scale two country model with endogenous investment that closely follows Erceg and Linde (2013).

Abstracting from open economy features, the speci…cation of each country block builds heavily on

the estimated models of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (CEE, 2005) and Smets and Wouters

(2003, 2007). Thus, the model includes both sticky nominal wages and prices, allowing for some

intrinsic persistence in both components; habit persistence in consumption; and embeds a Q theory

investment speci…cation modi…ed so that changing the level of investment (rather than the capital


                                                42
stock) is costly. However, our model departs from this earlier literature by assuming that some

fraction of households are “Keynesian,” and simply consume their current after-tax income in a

hand-to-mouth fashion; this contrasts with our benchmark model which assumes that all households

make consumption decisions based on their permanent income. Galí, López-Salido and Vallés (2007)

show that the inclusion of non-Ricardian households helps account for structural VAR evidence

indicating that private consumption rises in response to higher government spending. Although

the inclusion of hand-to-mouth agents increases the spending multiplier even in normal times, we

will show that the ampli…cation e¤ects are considerably larger in a liquidity trap, and in particular,

can help generate sizeable spillovers to the periphery even if the Phillips Curve is very ‡at.

     On the open economy dimension, the model assumes producer currency pricing as in the bench-

mark. Financial markets are assumed to be incomplete, meaning that there is a single “internation-

ally traded” bond available to core and periphery households. However, given that the trade price

elasticity is calibrated to be close to unity, the implications of incomplete markets are similar to

those of complete markets; as we have discussed above, even complete markets may allow for size-

able country-speci…c ‡uctuations in consumption given that households have di¤erent preferences

over goods (see Cole and Obstfeld, 1991, for a more detailed discussion).

     Monetary policy is assumed to follow a Taylor-style rule, and government spending to evolve

exogenously. To satisfy intertemporal …scal balance, the distortionary tax rate on labor income is

assumed to adjust to both government debt and the change in government debt. We assume that

tax rates adjust inertially, so that a rise in government spending would mainly be de…cit-…nanced

(at least under normal conditions). A detailed description of the model is provided in Appendix

B.

6.1. Empirical Impulse Responses to Monetary and Fiscal Shocks in the Euro Area


We next use a structural vector autoregression estimated on euro area data over the 1970:1-2008:3

period to help gauge the dynamic e¤ects of both a monetary policy shock and a shock to euro

area government spending. We will use the empirical impulse responses to each of these shocks

both to estimate key parameters of our model –following the approach of CEE (2005) and Altig,

Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (ACEL, 2011) –and to assess the model’s empirical …t.36

    Speci…cally, we estimate a VAR where the vector               t   of endogenous variables is comprised of

government spending on goods and services (gt ), real GDP (yt ), real private consumption (ct ) ,

real gross investment (invt ), the GDP de‡ator in‡ation rate (              Dt ),   the nominal wage (wt ); and

the short-term interest rate (it ), which we interpret as the policy rate. Following the in‡uential

analysis of Angeloni et al. (2003), which estimated monetary transmission in euro area countries,

we also include commodity prices, U.S. output and the federal funds rate as exogenous variables

(collected in the vector      t ).   We assume that the endogenous variables collected in               t   can be

represented in reduced form as following a VAR of order p:


                                     t   =     + B (L)      t   + B(L)    t 1   + ut ;                        (26)

                               Eut u0t = V;

where B(L) is a pth -ordered polynomial in the lag operator, L: The structural economic innovations

"t are related to the reduced form innovations ut by the relation:

                                             ut = C"t ; E"t "0t = I,                                          (27)

where C is a square matrix and I is the identity matrix.

    We identify the monetary and …scal spending innovations through imposing timing restrictions

on the VAR. Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999), we identify the monetary
  36
     Given the complications posed by the zero lower bound constraint and possible changes in the transmission
of monetary and …scal shocks following the global …nancial crisis, we limit the sample for our VAR analysis to the
pre-crisis period.


                                                       44
policy innovation by assuming that it has no contemporaneous e¤ect on aggregate quantities and

prices (i.e., all other variables are ordered before the short-term interest rate in the VAR). As in

Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we identify a government spending shock by assuming that govern-

ment spending does not react contemporaneously to the remaining variables in the VAR, including

output.       This assumption seems reasonable over the pre-crisis period in light of our quarterly

estimation frequency, though clearly would be problematic after the onset of the …nancial crisis

(given that euro area governments quickly ramped up discretionary public spending in response

to current and prospective output declines).              These timing restrictions are implemented by a

standard Cholesky factorization of the matrix C which orders government spending …rst, and the

policy rate last, in the VAR.

      The solid lines in Figure 9 shows the impulse responses of each variable to a one standard

deviation rise in the euro area policy rate, while 95 percent standard error bands (derived from

Monte Carlo simulations) are shaded.              A monetary policy innovation of about 40 basis points

causes output to contract gradually, with the size of the decline reaching about 0.2 percent after

two years. Private investment falls by more than GDP - presumably re‡ecting the high interest

sensitivity of many components of investment spending –while consumption falls roughly as much

as GDP. The policy tightening causes price in‡ation to fall about 0.1 percentage points after some

delay. The initial jump in in‡ation is consistent with a short-lived “price-level” puzzle typically

found in VAR studies of the e¤ects of monetary shocks, see e.g., CEE (2005).

      The responses to the euro area government spending shock are shown by the solid lines in Figure

10. To facilitate interpretation and comparison with other estimates, we scale the shock to equal

one percent of euro area GDP, which corresponds to a rise in government spending of nearly 4 12

percent.37 The government spending shock boosts output persistently, and induces a substantial
 37
      The innovation to government spending is less than a tenth as large, about 0.4 percent.




                                                         45
crowding in of both private consumption and total gross investment at a horizon stretching out

almost two years. The actual output multiplier is about 1 12 at impact, and even somewhat higher

over the next year. Thus, government spending increases appear to have large and persistent e¤ects

on real activity, nothwithstanding a sizeable rise in the policy rate.                After some delay, in‡ation

also appears to rise somewhat, though con…dence intervals are wide.

       The response of output to the monetary policy shock seems well in line with the evidence

provided by Angeloni et al. (2003) in a similar VAR framework (as noted above), though the

latter was estimated over an earlier 1965-2001 sample period. Moreover, the output responses are

remarkably similar quantitatively to typical estimates of the output response to a monetary policy

innovation in the United States: ACEL’s VAR, for example, implies that a 40 basis point rise in

the U.S. policy rate would cause U.S. output to fall 0.2-0.3 percent after about 6 quarters, and

Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2011) report similar results.

       In some contrast, our implied estimate of the euro area government spending multiplier is

substantially higher than derived by Perotti (2007) for Germany in a similar VAR-based framework,

or that Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori (2011) found for a cross-section of OECD countries –many

of them European –based on a narrative approach to identifying …scal shocks in the spirit of Romer

and Romer (2010). Similarly, the U.S. government spending multiplier is usually estimated to be

around unity –as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002) –or somewhat below, at least in normal times

in which policy rates can adjust freely. Thus, while the high government spending multiplier we

estimate in the euro area suggest the importance of Keynesian-style multiplier e¤ects on private

demand, some caution is probably warranted in light of the relatively modest variation in euro area

government spending over the past several decades, and given that evidence for other countries –

and derived by alternative methods –points to somewhat lower multipliers in normal times.38
  38
     The estimated impulse responses do not seem particularly sensitive to shortening the sample period (i.e., starting
in the early 1980s), nor to adopting a more parsimonious speci…cation of the VAR.

6.2. Matching Model Responses to Empirical Responses


We follow the basic approach of CEE (2005) and ACEL (2011) to estimate a subset of model

parameters so that the model-implied impulse responses – to both a monetary shock, and in our

case, to a government spending shock –match their empirical counterparts in Figures 9 and 10 as

closely as possible.    We estimate an aggregate version of the model under the assumption that

parameters are equal in both the core and periphery and then compare these aggregate implications

to the data. Our model is formulated so that it imposes the same timing restrictions as the empirical

VAR (speci…cally, that the monetary shock has no contemporanous e¤ects on other variables).

   The vector of parameters       that we estimate play a key role in determining the interest sensi-

tivity of domestic demand and the slopes of the price and wage Phillips Curve. In particular, we

estimate the vector     = f{;   I ; P ; W ; G;   G;   Mg   where the parameters before the semicolon are

the external habit persistence parameter {, the parameter determining the costs of varying invest-

ment   I,   the price contract duration parameter     P,   and the wage contract duration parameter   W.


The parameters following the semicolon characterize the persistence of the AR(1) process deter-

mining government spending (of       G)   and its standard deviation    G.   The monetary innovation is

assumed to be i.i.d, but exerts persistent e¤ects given some structural persistence in the monetary

policy reaction function.

   This parameter vector is estimated conditional on calibrating all other model parameters as

described in Appendix B. However, a couple of features of the calibration merit some discussion.

First, although we simply calibrate the share of Keynesian households, we set the population

share to 0:65 – and thus pin it towards the upper side of plausible empirical estimates – to help

better match the crowding in of private consumption evident in the response to a government

spending shock. This choice implies that Keynesian households account for about 1/3 of aggregate




                                                      47
consumption in the steady state.39         Second, we set the parameters of the monetary policy rule

according to a Taylor-style reaction function with a coe¢ cient of 2:5 on in‡ation, but allow for a

modest coe¢ cient of 0:7 on the lagged interest rate in line with most empirical estimates. As we

found little evidence of a response of the policy rate to the output gap (or output growth rate), we

set these coe¢ cients to zero when matching the empirical responses. Finally, the import content

of government spending in each country is assumed to be the same as for private consumption

spending –13 percent for the periphery, and hence 6.5 percent for the core.

    The model impulse responses depend on the parameter vector                 in addition to the parameters

we have calibrated.       We stack the …rst T model impulse responses to the monetary shock and

the …rst T responses to the government spending shock into a 2T x1 vector                 ( ); and denote the

corresponding estimates derived from the SVAR above by ^ : Our estimator of                     is obtained as

the solution to:

                                 b = arg min( ^         ( ))0 z   1
                                                                      (^   ( )):                            (28)

where z is a diagonal matrix based on the 95 percent con…dence intervals for the impulse responses

shown in Figures 9 and 10.         Thus, impulse responses that are measured with greater precision

get more weight in determining the estimate of               : We set T = 20, so that impulse responses are

matched for 20 quarters.

    Table 5 reports the estimated parameters and standard errors (below), with the latter computed

for b using the delta-function method.            Our estimates of habit persistence in consumption {

= 0:877 and costs of adjusting investment         I   = 1:94 indicate an important role for real rigidities in

accounting for the empirical impulse responses.           The estimate of habit is somewhat above typical

estimates of the literature. The Calvo price contract duration parameter of           P   = :944 implies a very

low Phillips Curve slope – when expressed in terms of marginal cost – of only :0034; as indicated
  39
     Because Keynesian households are assumed to own no capital in our model (and hence have much lower steady
state income than forward-looking households), their share of aggregate consumption is much lower than their pop-
ulation share.


                                                        48
in Section 3 and as we will discuss further below, this speci…cation is very consequential. Wage

dynamics in the model depend on both the estimated wage contract duration paramer                        W   = 0:871

and on parameters which a¤ect strategic complementarities in wage-setting (the latter include the

Frisch elasticity of labor supply, and the degree of substitutibility between labor types). From a

reduced form perspective that is relevant for the model simulations below, nominal wage in‡ation

is somewhat less sensitive to the wage markup than price in‡ation is to the price markup.

      The solid lines in Figures 9 and 10 show the euro area aggregate responses of the model to both

the monetary shock and a government spending shock, and provide insight both into the ability of

the model to …t the data along these dimensions, and into key factors determining our parameter

estimates.      We begin with the responses to the monetary shock. As emphasized by CEE (2005),

empirical responses to a monetary shock are very informative for gauging the interest sensitivity

of domestic demand and its components, and also the slope of the price and wage Phillips Curves:

consistent with their analysis, our estimates of the structural parameters in Table 5 would change

little if we only …t the monetary shock (and thus can be regarded as largely “pinned down”by the

monetary shock).

      As seen in Figure 9, the model does very well in tracking how a monetary policy tightening

causes euro area output to fall, and also performs well in accounting for the comparatively larger

contraction in investment relative to consumption. The small decline in in‡ation in the empirical

VAR is best …t with a very ‡at Phillips Curve, which helps account for the high estimated value

of the contract duration parameter           P   in Table 5.40 More broadly, a low implied responsiveness
 40
      While the implied contract duration is extremely long, it is important to mention that our model does not embed


                                                          49
of in‡ation to resource slack seems consistent with the general resilience of euro area in‡ation in

the aftermath of the …nancial crisis. Even so, because the estimation procedure tries to make the

model …t the initial rise in in‡ation in the empirical VAR – a “puzzle” the model cannot account

for – the model impulse response understates the subsequent decline in in‡ation. Thus, it seems

plausible that the Phillips Curve slope may be at least somewhat higher than our estimate in Table

5.41

       Turning to Figure 10, the model also does well in …tting the empirical responses to a rise in

government spending. Notably, the model implies an initial rise in output of a little less than

1 12 percent, and of private consumption of almost            1
                                                              2   percent, both of which are very close to the

empirical responses, though it does imply somewhat less persistent responses thereafter.42 However,

the model implies only a small and transient rise in investment, in contrast to the larger and more

sustained response we estimate.           Thus, even with a large share of rule-of-thumb households, it

appears that our model may understate some of the Keynesian channels that would appear to drive

the empirical responses, though the model clearly moves in the right direction relative to the simple

model of Section 2.


6.3. Core Government Spending Hike in Normal Times


We next consider the e¤ects of a rise in core government spending in normal times that is scaled to

equal one percent of CU GDP. Given that the core and periphery are calibrated symmetrically, this

rise in core government spending has exactly the same aggregate CU e¤ects as would an equal-sized

rise in both core and periphery spending. We assume core government spending is increased in a
…rm-speci…c capital or other real rigidities that could help it account for the low reduced form slope with a much
shorter implied contract duration (corresponding to a signi…cantly lower value of P ).
   41
      On the other hand, some recent evidence based on U.S. data also …nds a very low Phillips Curve slope. Brave et
al. (2012) estimated the Chicago Federal Reserve’s DSGE model of the United States over the 1989:1-2011:4 period,
and found a Phillips Curve slope of only 0.002. Lindé, Smets, and Wouters (2016) estimated a Phillips Curve slope
of 0.005 (identical to our estimate for the euro area), and the estimate of Del Negro, Giannoni and Schorfheide (2015)
is similar.
   42
      The lower right panel of Figure 10 shows the response of consumption in the …rst few quarters following the
government spending hike – and omits con…dence intervals – in order to highlight the initial consumption rise.


                                                         50
uniform fashion for 12 quarters, and then immediately cut back to zero (i.e., spending follows an

MA(12) process with unit coe¢ cients).

    As seen in Figure 11, the responses to a core spending hike in normal times are similar qual-

itatively to the benchmark model.           CU output rises a little less than 1 12 percent initially (panel

A), then then dies out as policy rates increase (panel F). The stimulus to GDP is heavily con-

centrated in the core (panel C). Periphery real net exports are boosted by some direct purchases

of core goods/services from the core government, and from terms of trade depreciation (panel G)

as the higher core government spending puts upward pressure on the relative price of core goods.

However, periphery GDP (panel D) is basically ‡at as this stimulus to net exports is o¤set by a

fall in domestic demand (panel E shows consumption) that is induced by higher real interest rates.

Periphery GDP would contract noticeably if the policy reaction function put even a modest weight

on stabilizing the output gap (e.g., of 0.5 as under the standard Taylor rule).

    The Keynesian features in this larger model – while amplifying the CU multiplier modestly –

also drive a greater wedge between the response of core and periphery output. Notwithstanding

the leakage from lower core net exports, core GDP rises about 1 43 percent relative to periphery

GDP in the …rst year following the shock.             This is considerably larger than the GDP di¤erence

implied by the simple model results discussed in Section 4 (in which periphery private domestic

demand actually rises relative to that in the core). The bigger wedge between core and periphery

output responses in Figure 11 seems more in line with the literature on local multipliers, though

the local multiplier implied by our model is still only around 1 14 ; which is somewhat lower than

typical empirical estimates in the range of 1 21 to 2.43 Overall, both the estimates from the empirical

VAR in Figure 10 and the local multiplier literature suggest sizeable Keynesian multiplier e¤ects

that, if anything, may be somewhat larger than captured by our model.44
  43
     Recall from Section 2 that this literature aims to estimate how a di¤erential rise in government spending in one
region ‘A’vs. another region ‘B’a¤ects relative output levels.
  44
     Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) also emphasize that a simple model that embeds separable preferences as in


                                                         51
    Given our interest in spillovers, the local multiplier is important insofar as factors which raise

the local multiplier tend to generate larger negative spillovers to the periphery in normal times, at

least if monetary policy is su¢ ciently reactive to in‡ation (and/or the output gap). Intuitively,

stronger Keynesian multiplier e¤ects would imply more stimulus to the core if monetary policy

didn’t react. Hence, the central bank must raise interest rates more sharply to keep CU output

close to potential and in‡ation from rising above target, which in turn causes a deeper contraction

in the periphery.       Thus, conditions which imply a relatively larger aggregate CU multiplier in

normal times – re‡ecting a bigger e¤ect on the natural real interest rate r – actually tend to

generate bigger negative spillovers to the periphery. Stronger multiplier (and accelerator) channels

and the consequent boost in r have profoundly di¤erent e¤ects in a deep liquidity trap, as we

next consider; but it is important to keep in mind the risk that a core …scal expansion could hurt

periphery GDP if the CU faced less extreme economic conditions (such as a short-lived liquidity

trap followed by a fast hike in policy rates).


6.4. Core Government Spending Hike in Liquidity Trap


We next consider the same expansion of core …scal spending in a deep liquidity trap that would

last 12 quarters absent core …scal stimulus.              Our baseline assumes that the adverse aggregate

demand shock generating the liquidity trap is much larger in the periphery (as in Figure 7 in the

case of the simple model). In this section, we assume that the monetary policy reaction function is

very aggressive in responding to both the in‡ation and output gap, implying that monetary policy

remains accommodative even following this sizeable and persistent …scal expansion.45
Section 2 generates far too low a local multiplier, and propose non-separable preferences as a mechanism for generating
a larger local multiplier (in contrast with our focus on Keynesian multiplier and accelerator channels).
  45
     Speci…cally, we assume that the the ECB reaction function puts a substantial weight on the output gap of
unity. This choice helps account for a protracted liquidity trap in the baseline, and also implies monetary policy
“forbearance” in not reacting to the large …scal stimulus program we consider. More broadly, it seems reasonable
to characterize ECB monetary policy as putting a fairly large weight on the output gap as well as the in‡ation gap
in the period following the intensi…cation of the euro area debt crisis in 2011. In particular, the ECB put more
emphasis on the output gap in its communication about monetary policy, and left policy rates low in 2012-2013 even
though in‡ation ran only modestly below 2 percent.



                                                          52
   Aggregate CU output (solid line in panel A) rises much more in a protracted liquidity trap, and

periphery GDP (panel D) also rises substantially. The rise in periphery GDP partly arises from

the same channels as emphasized in Section 2.      In particular, net exports rise in response to the

rise in core domestic demand and to terms of trade depreciation. Moreover, periphery real interest

rates fall persistently, re‡ecting the expectation that periphery prices will eventually rise enough to

bring the terms of trade back to its pre-shock level. However, Keynesian e¤ects arising from the

hand-to-mouth consumers play a substantial role in amplifying this stimulus, and in contributing

to periphery GDP expansion. Of course, these Keynesian e¤ects also increase the response of core

GDP.

   All told, periphery GDP rises rises more than 1 14 percent after two years, which is almost half

the expansion in core GDP. Thus, as in the benchmark model of Section 2, the output stimulus

due to core …scal expansion becomes more balanced in a prolonged liquidity trap.          The implied

CU multiplier of over 2 is in the range of estimates of the spending multiplier in a deep recession

surveyed in Section 2.

   While we view our estimates – including of the aggregate government spending multiplier,

and spillovers to the periphery – as quite plausible, there is clearly some uncertainty about key

transmission channels.    Several observations seem worthwhile in this regard.       First, the model

may understate the importance of multiplier/accelerator e¤ects: as we noted, the model implies

an aggregate CU government spending multiplier lower than our empirical VAR, and a “local

multiplier” modestly below empirical estimates. To allow for larger Keynesian e¤ects, we have

explored extending the model to include a …nancial accelerator in each country block following

Christiano, Motto, and Rostagna’s variant (CMR, 2005) of the Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist

(BGG, 1999) framework. In a liquidity trap, we found that both the aggregate government spending

multiplier and spillovers are enhanced by …nancial frictions, re‡ecting that the boost in nominal



                                                  53
demand from higher core spending improves private sector balance sheets and lowers credit spreads.

   Second, the model may not adequately capture how in‡ation and in‡ation expectations evolve.

As we have noted, the very ‡at Phillips Curve slope we have imposed seems consistent with both

VAR-based estimates, and with the resilience of in‡ation during the …nancial crisis and its after-

math. But poor credit conditions and other adverse supply-side developments may have helped

account for why in‡ation didn’t fall much in spite of an enormous fall in output below trend (see

Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt 2014 and Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and Zakrajšek 2015), so

that the Phillips Curve slope could well be higher; in this case, the multiplier and spillovers would

also be larger.   On the other hand, our Calvo contract speci…cation implies an immediate jump

in both in‡ation and in‡ation expectations. But it is quite plausible that in‡ation and in‡ation

expectations would show a more gradual rise, perhaps more in line with the implications of Mankiw

and Reis’ (2002) sticky information model of price formation; or alternatively, in‡ation expecta-

tions could rise more gradually if expectations formation was partially adaptive. Ceteris paribus,

a more gradual rise in expected in‡ation would tend to reduce both the aggregate multiplier and

spillovers to the periphery.

   Finally, it bears emphasizing that the model’s implications of large spillovers depend on our

assumptions that neither monetary nor …scal policy acts to o¤set the stimulus.          Clearly, the

stimulus to the core and periphery would be much smaller if monetary policy began hiking rates

more quickly as resource slack and the in‡ation gap closed. On the …scal side, both the aggregate

multiplier and associated spillovers would be lower if the …scal reaction function implied a more

aggressive reaction to government debt (Drautzberg and Uhlig 2015).




                                                 54
7. Conclusions


Our paper has considered the implications for the euro area of a …scal expansion in the core

economies, with particular focus on how the periphery would be a¤ected.          We have shown that

not only does the …scal multiplier for the euro area as a whole become much larger in a prolonged

liquidity trap, but also that the stimulative e¤ects become relatively more balanced between the

core and periphery (though still tilted in favor of the core). Periphery GDP expands as domestic

demand is “crowded in” by lower real interest rates, and as net exports are boosted by terms of

trade depreciation and an expansion of domestic demand in the core economies. Accordingly, …scal

policy seems a potent tool to improve welfare throughout the euro area, at least to the extent that

welfare can be proxied by in‡ation and output gaps.

   While an extensive literature has focused on the potential bene…ts of …scal policy in a liquidity

trap, most of this analysis has abstracted from di¤erences in business cycle positions across member

states. Our analysis suggests that …scal spending is likely to be much more e¤ective in boosting

welfare to the extent that it can be targeted to countries or states facing relatively adverse business

cycle conditions.   Thus, a euro area …scal compact that would allow more distressed countries

greater latitude to engage in de…cit-…nanced spending could yield substantial bene…ts. Of course,

there are many challenges of designing a …scal union, including of how to limit the moral hazard

risks that such insurance might pose to other members of the compact.

   From a methodological perspective, our modeling framework has abstracted from a number of

features that would seem useful extensions for future research.      First, our analysis is conducted

under the assumption of perfect foresight, implying that the public is convinced that the economy

will eventually recover absent …scal action. The bene…t of …scal expansion would likely be greater

in a stochastic environment in which …scal expansion could help mitigate downside tail risks that

likely are substantial in a prolonged liquidity trap. Second, our simple benchmark model assumes


                                                  55
a representative agent structure with perfect risk sharing.             The bene…ts of …scal expansion –

especially using a utility-based welfare criterion –would presumably be greater in a heterogenous

agent framework in which risk-sharing was much less pervasive, and each household’s consumption

more dependent on its particular employment opportunities.46               Finally, it would be desirable to

extend our modeling framework to allow sovereign borrowing spreads to respond endogenously to

changes in …scal policy.




  46
     On the other hand, McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2015) argue that taking account of borrowing constraints
and uninsurable income risk may imply a somewhat lower interest elasticity of demand than implied by models which
assume that …nancial markets are complete at the national level. A lower interest elasticity would damp the …scal
multiplier in a liquidity trap.

This Appendix provides a detailed description of the benchmark model from which the log-linearized

equations in Section 3 are derived.

The preference speci…cation in equation (A.1) implies that household h derives utility from private
                                                                                  M Bt (h)
consumption Ct (h) ; government spending Gt (h); and real balances                 PCt ,     whereas utility declines

in hours worked Nt (h). The utility function is assumed to be separable in each of these arguments.

The subutility function over consumption incorporates external habit persistence –captured by the

presence of lagged aggregate consumption Ct                1    – with the degree of habit determined by the

parameter { 2 (0; 1) : There are two types of preference shocks, including a consumption taste

(demand) shock         t,   and a discount factor shock %t .         The latter type of shock has been widely

used in the ZLB literature (see e.g., Eggertsson, 2011, and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo,

2011) as a driving force of the “Great Recession.” Following Eggertsson and Woodford (2003),
                                                           M Bt+j+1 (h)
the subutility function over real balances, F                 Pt+j         , is assumed to have a satiation point

for M B=P .    Hence, the inclusion of money - which is a zero nominal interest asset - provides a

rationale for the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. However, we maintain the assumptions

that money is additive and that         0   is arbitrarily small so that changes in real money balances have

negligible implications for government debt and output. Finally, we assume that 0 <                             < 1,    > 0,

 g   > 0;   > 0,   0   > 0 and #g > 0.

In (A.2), all variables have been expressed in per capita terms. A household may either spend its

income either on consumption goods, which are subject to a sales tax of                         Ct ;   or can save by investing

in either government bonds BG;t (h) or contingent claims. The term                             t;t+1   denotes the price of an

asset that will pay one unit of domestic currency in a particular state of nature at date t + 1, and

Bt+1 (h) the quantity of claims purchased. Each household earns per capita labor income net of

taxes (1        N;t ) Wt (h)Nt (h) ;    earns rental income of RKt K on its …xed stock of capital K, receives

an aliquot share       t (h)    of the …rm pro…ts, and pays lump sum taxes of Tt to the government.A.1

        Each household h maximizes the utility functional (A.1) with respect to its consumption, hours

worked, government bonds, and holdings of contingent claims subject to its budget constraint (A.2),

taking bond prices, the wage, the rental price of capital (RKt ), and the price of the consumption

bundle (PCt ) as given. The …rst order condition(s) for contingent claims both at home and abroad

implies the complete markets condition that the marginal utility of a “euro” is equalized across

home and foreign households:




                                                           t   =    t;


Because the marginal utility of consumption equals                       Ct   =      t PCt   (and analogously for foreign

households), the complete markets condition may be written in the familiar form:

                                                               PCt
                                                 Ct   =   Ct       =     Ct QCt :                                        (A.3)
                                                               PCt
 A .1
     While our description of the benchmark model allows for exogenous taxes on consumption and labor income, we
abstract from these features in Section 3 (by setting these tax rates equal to zero at all times).


                                                               77
Thus, a depreciation of the home economy’s consumption-based real exchange rate (QCt rises)

boosts the marginal utility of foreign consumption relative to the marginal utility of home con-

sumption.

   The …rst order conditions with respect to Ct ; Nt , and BG;t are given by:



                                                                       1

                                                  (1 + C;t )

                               mrst =             = (1    N;t )      ;
                                               Ct               P Ct
                                                  1 + iCU

                                                     PCt+1

The …rst of these conditions indicates that the marginal utility of consumption decreases in current

consumption, but decreases in past consumption due to habit. The second equation is the labor

supply curve, which relates the household’s marginal cost of working – expressed in terms of the

                                 0 Nt
consumption good, i.e., mrst =     Ct
                                        –to the after-tax consumption real wage. The …nal expression
                                                       %t+1
is the consumption Euler equation, where       t   =    %t    is simply a rescaling of the time preference

shock.

   The problem for the foreign households h is isomorphic to the problem outlined above for the

domestic households.


A.2. Firms and Price-Setting


Below, we describe the problem for the home producers of both …nal and intermediate goods.


A.2.1. Production of Final Goods


We assume that a single …nal domestic output good YDt is produced using a continuum of di¤eren-

tiated intermediate goods YDt (f ). The technology for transforming these intermediate goods into



                                                   78
the …nal output good is constant returns to scale, and is of the Dixit-Stiglitz form:
                                           Z      1                  1
                                                                                  1+   p

                                  YDt =               YDt (f ) 1+        p   df            ;       (A.5)
                                              0

where   p   > 0.

   Firms that produce the …nal output good are perfectly competitive in both product and factor

markets. Thus, …nal goods producers minimize the cost of producing a given quantity of the output

index, YDt , taking as given the price PDt (f ) of each intermediate good YDt (f ). Moreover, …nal

goods producers sell units of the …nal output good at a price PDt that can be interpreted as the

aggregate domestic price index:
                                               Z      1                  1         p

                                   PDt =                  PDt (f )       p   df        :           (A.6)
                                                  0




A.2.2. Production of Domestic Intermediate Goods


Intermediate good i is produced by a monopolistically competitive …rm, whose output YDt (i) is

produced according to a Cobb-Douglas production function:


                                   YDt (i) = K(i) (Zt Lt (i))1                         ;           (A.7)


where Zt denotes a stationary, country-speci…c shock to the level of technology. Intermediate goods

producers face perfectly competitive factor markets for hiring capital and labor. Thus, each …rm

chooses K (i) and Lt (i), taking as given both the rental price of capital RKt and the aggregate

wage rate Wt . Within a country, labor and the capital stock (albeit …xed in the aggregate) are

completely mobile; thus, the standard static …rst-order conditions for cost minimization imply that

all intermediate …rms have identical marginal cost per unit of output:
                                                           1
                                              Wt                     RKt                   1
                               M Ct =                                                          ;   (A.8)
                                          1                                        Zt1

                                                            79
where the standard static cost minimization problem of the …rm implies that

                                                                                              Lt
                                                                RKt =                    Wt      :                                                      (A.9)
                                                                               1              K

       Intermediate goods-producing …rms set prices according to Calvo-style staggered contracts, and

set the same price in both the home and foreign market (i.e., the home market price PDt (i) equals

the price in the foreign market of PM t (i)).                                      In particular, …rm i faces a constant probability,

1       p,    of being able to re-optimize its price, PDt (i). Firms which are not allowed to reoptimize

their prices in period t (which is the case with probability                                         p ),   update their prices according to the

following formula

                                                        P~Dt (i) = (1 +                 D ) PDt 1 (i);                                                 (A.10)


where         D   is the steady-state (net) in‡ation rate and P~Dt is the updated price.
                                                                                            opt

A.3. Traded Goods


Household consumption Ct in the home economy depends both on its consumption of the domestically-

produced …nal output good CDt and on its consumption of the foreign …nal output good MCt (i.e.,

consumer goods imports) according to the CES utility function:

                                                             1          C        1      1+      C
                                                     C
                                                           1+ C       1+ C     1+ C
                         Ct =    (1      ! C ) 1+     C   CDt     + !C       MCt                    :                        (A.13)


The quasi-share parameter ! C in equation (A.13) may be interpreted as determining household

preferences for home relative to foreign goods, or equivalently, the degree of home bias in household

consumption expenditure. The domestically-produced …nal good is purchased at a price of PDt ,

while the foreign imported good is purchased at a price of PM t ; given the …xed exchange rate

and our assumption of producer currency pricing, the law of one price holds, so that PM t = PDt :

Households choose CDt and MCt to minimize the cost of producing the consumption good Ct taking

the prices PDt and PM t as given. This familiar cost-minimization problem implies the following

demand schedules for the imported and domestically-produced good:
                                      (1+ C )                                                           (1+ C )
                          PM t          C                                               PDt               C
             MCt = ! C                          Ct        and     CDt = (1      !C )                              Ct ;       (A.14)
                          PCt                                                           PCt

while the consumer price index PCt , is given by:

                                                             1             1       1+   C
                                                           1+ C          1+ C
                            PCt =        (1      ! C )PDt         + ! C PM t                :                                (A.15)


   Similarly to households, the home government also produces …nal government goods (and ser-

vices) Gt using both the domestically-produced …nal good GDt and imports of the foreign …nal

good MGt according to the CES production function:

                                                            81
                                                                1          G        1      1+      G
                                                      G
                                                              1+ G       1+ G     1+ G
                          Gt =        (1       ! G ) 1+G    GDt      + !G       MGt                    :                        (A.16)


The parameter ! G measures the import share of government consumption; thus, total home imports

depend both on the demand of households, and of the government.                                    The government’s demand

schedules for both the domestically-produced …nal good and for imported goods are isomorphic to

that of households:
                                     (1+ G )                                                           (1+ G )
                         PM t          G                                              PDt                G
         MGt = ! G                             Gt    and        GDt = (1        !G)                                 Gt ;        (A.17)
                         PGt                                                          PGt

although it is important to note that the degree of home bias in government spending ! G may di¤er

from that in private spending ! C ; and that the government’s willingness to substitute between home
                      (1+     G)                                                                   (1+         C)
and traded goods (                 ) may also di¤er from that of households (                                       ). The price index
                         G                                                                                 C


for government purchases is given by:

                                                                1              1      1+   G
                                                              1+ G           1+ G
                                   PGt =       (1    ! G )PDt        + ! G PM t                :                                (A.18)


We de…ne the terms-of-trade as
                                                              PM t  P
                                                      t   =        = Dt ;                                                       (A.19)
                                                              PDt   PDt

so that an increase in    t   implies that the home economy can buy less imports for any given level

of exports.


A.4. Fiscal Policy


The government …nances its nominal spending on goods and services PGt Gt through a consumption

sales tax, labor tax, and lump-sum tax (we assume that seignorage revenue is de minimis). Thus,

evolution of nominal government debt, BG;t , is determined by:


                 BG;t = (1 + it         1 ) BG;t 1        + PGt Gt      C;t PCt Ct       N;t Wt Lt              Tt :            (A.20)


                                                                82
We assume that the consumption sales tax         C;t   and labor tax     N;t   are determined exogenously, so

that lump-sum taxes adjust to satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget constraint.                Thus,

the …scal rule has no e¤ect on macro variables (other than the stock of debt and the lump-sum tax

level itself).


A.5. Aggregate Resource Constraints


The aggregate resource constraint for the domestic economy is given by:


                                YDt = CDt + GDt +              [MCt + MGt ] ;                         (A.21)


where exports are weighted by the relative population size of the foreign to home country                  as

the variables are expressed in per capita terms. Similarly, the resource constraint for the foreign

economy is given by:

                                YDt = CDt + GDt +              [MCt + MGt ] :                         (A.22)


where exports are weighted by the relative population size of the home to foreign country              : The

total population is normalized to unity, i.e.,



                                                  +         = 1:                                      (A.23)


    We also make the assumption that trade is balanced for both private consumption and govern-

ment services, which implies that:

                                                 !C =        !C ;                                     (A.24)


and

                                                 !G =        !G:                                      (A.25)


    Given complete …nancial markets, the current account and net foreign assets are always equal




                                                       83
to zero. The nominal trade balance (in absolute levels) is given by


                              T Bt        PDt [MCt + MGt ]                PM t [MCt + MGt ] :                    (A.26)


A.6. Monetary Policy


The currency union central bank is assumed to adhere to a Taylor-type policy rule subject to the

ZLB. Given that we start out with a log-linearized version of the model, it is convenient to simply

specify the reaction function as a linear relation (aside from the zero lower bound), expressing

variables in deviation from baseline form:


                                     iCU
                                      t  = max             i;        CU
                                                                     t    +       CU
                                                                               x xt    ;                         (A.27)


Here i denotes the steady-state (net) nominal interest rate (equal to r +                       where r    1=    1);   CU
                                                                                                                       t


is currency union in‡ation, and xCU
                                 t  is the currency union output gap. Currency union in‡ation

 CU    is itself a population-weighted average of the in‡ation rate                         in both the home and foreign
 t                                                                                     Ct


country:

                                                  CU
                                                  t    =        Ct   +      Ct :                                 (A.28)


where each country in‡ation rate is simply the log percentage change in the respective consumption

price index (i.e.,   Ct   = ln(PCt =PCt   1 )).   The CU output gap xCU
                                                                     t  is the di¤erence between currency

union output ytCU and its potential level ytCU;pot ; with both variables again simply population-

weighted averages of the respective country variables:


                                              ytCU = yDt +                yDt ;                                  (A.29)


and:

                                           ytCU;pot = yDt
                                                       pot
                                                           +                 ;pot
                                                                           yDt    :                              (A.30)




                                                                84
Appendix B. The Large-Scale Open Economy Model


The large-scale model closely follows Erceg and Lindé (2013) aside from some features of the …scal

policy speci…cation. As in the benchmark model described in Appendix A, the model consists of two

countries –home and foreign –that share a common currency. The larger-scale model extends the

benchmark model on a number of dimensions, including allowing for endogenous investment, hand-

to-mouth (HM) or “Keynesian”households, sticky wages as well as sticky prices, trade adjustment

costs, and incomplete …nancial markets across the two countries. Although the model we focus on

in Section 6 abstracts from a …nancial accelerator, the appendix concludes with a brief description

of how the model may be modi…ed to include a …nancial accelerator (Section B.6).


B.1. Firms and Price Setting


B.1.1. Production of Domestic Intermediate Goods


As in the simple model, there is a continuum of di¤erentiated intermediate goods (indexed by

i 2 [0; 1]) in the home country, each of which is produced by a single monopolistically competitive

…rm. In the domestic market, …rm i faces a demand function that varies inversely with its output

price PDt (i) and directly with aggregate demand at home YDt :
                                                          (1+   p)
                                               PDt (i)      p
                                     YDt (i) =                       YDt ;                   (B.31)
                                                PDt

where   p   > 0, and PDt is an aggregate price index de…ned below.

   Each producer utilizes capital services Kt (i) and a labor index Lt (i) (de…ned below) to produce

its respective output good.    The production function is assumed to have a constant-elasticity of

substitution (CES) form:

                                                 1                           1
                                                                                 1+
                                      1+
                         YDt (i) =   !K  Kt (i) 1+ + ! L 1+ (Zt Lt (i)) 1+            :      (B.32)



                                                     85
The production function exhibits constant-returns-to-scale in both inputs, and Zt is a country-

speci…c shock to the level of technology. Firms face perfectly competitive factor markets for hiring

capital and labor. Thus, each …rm chooses Kt (i) and Lt (i), taking as given both the rental price of

capital RKt and the aggregate wage index Wt (de…ned below). Firms can costlessly adjust either

factor of production, which implies that each …rm has an identical marginal cost per unit of output,

M Ct . The (log-linearized) technology shock is assumed to follow an AR(1) process:


                                                           zt =       z zt 1     + "z;t :                                          (B.33)


        We assume that purchasing power parity holds, so that each intermediate goods producer i

sets the same price PDt (i) in both blocks of the currency union, implying that the foreign import

price PM t (i) = PDt (i) and that PM t = PDt . The prices of the intermediate goods are determined

by Calvo-style staggered contracts (see Calvo, 1983). In each period, a …rm faces a constant

probability, 1             p,   of being able to re-optimize its price (PDt (i)). This probability of receiving a

signal to reoptimize is independent across …rms and time. If a …rm is not allowed to optimize its

prices, we follow Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003), and

assume that the …rm must reset its home price as a weighted combination of the lagged and steady

state rate of in‡ation PDt (i) = ^                                           p        1
                                 Dt 1 PDt                     1 (i)   =                         PDt   1 (i)   for the non-optimizing …rms.

This formulation allows for structural persistence in price-setting if                                        p   exceeds zero.

        When a …rm i is allowed to reoptimize its price in period t, the …rm maximizes:

B.1.2. Production of the Domestic Output Index


Because households have identical Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, it is convenient to assume that a

representative aggregator combines the di¤erentiated intermediate products into a composite home-

produced good YDt :


                                                     Z     1                 1
                                                                                          1+       p

                                          YDt =                YDt (i) 1+        p   di                :                                        (B.36)
                                                       0

The aggregator chooses the bundle of goods that minimizes the cost of producing YDt , taking the

price PDt (i) of each intermediate good YDt (i) as given. The aggregator sells units of each sectoral

output index at its unit cost PDt :

                                                      Z        1                 1             p

B.1.3. Production of Consumption and Investment Goods


Final consumption goods are produced by a representative consumption goods distributor. This

…rm combines purchases of domestically-produced goods with imported goods to produce a …nal

consumption good (CAt ) according to a constant-returns-to-scale CES production function:

                                        C       1                                                                1
                                                                                                                       1+     C
                                                                              C
                                      1+ C    1+ C
                          CAt =    !C        CDt     + (1            !C )   1+ C
                                                                                     ('Ct MCt )                1+ C
                                                                                                                                  ;             (B.38)


where CDt denotes the consumption good distributor’s demand for the index of domestically-

produced goods, MCt denotes the distributor’s demand for the index of foreign-produced goods,
(see the household problem below); then the corresponding element of                       t;t+j           equals     t;t+j   divided by the probability

that the speci…ed state will occur.



                                                                    87
and 'Ct re‡ects costs of adjusting consumption imports. The …nal consumption good is used

by both households and by the government.B.3 The form of the production function mirrors the

preferences of households and the government sector over consumption of domestically-produced

goods and imports. Accordingly, the quasi-share parameter ! C may be interpreted as determining

the preferences of both the private and public sector for domestic relative to foreign consumption

goods, or equivalently, the degree of home bias in consumption expenditure. Finally, the adjustment

cost term 'Ct is assumed to take the quadratic form:
                                     2          0                              12 3
                                                    MCt
                                          'MC
                              'Ct = 41          @ M CDt a                     1A 5 :                                    (B.39)
                                           2      C
                                                    Ct 1
                                                                Dt 1


This speci…cation implies that it is costly to change the proportion of domestic and foreign goods

in the aggregate consumption bundle, even though the level of imports may jump costlessly in

response to changes in overall consumption demand.                 We assume that the adjustment costs for

                                                                          MCt

                                        ; so that adjustment costs are external to individual distributors.

        Given the presence of adjustment costs, the representative consumption goods distributor

chooses (a contingency plan for) CDt and MCt to minimize its discounted expected costs of pro-

ducing the aggregate consumption good:

The distributor sells the …nal consumption good to households and the government at a price PCt ,

which may be interpreted as the consumption price index (or equivalently, as the shadow cost of

producing an additional unit of the consumption good).
 B .3
     Thus, the larger-scale model constrains the import share of government consumption to equal that of private
consumption.

the weight ! I in the investment index to di¤er from that of the weight ! C in the consumption

goods index.B.4


B.2. Households and Wage Setting


We assume a continuum of monopolistically competitive households (indexed on the unit interval),

each of which supplies a di¤erentiated labor service to the intermediate goods-producing sector

(the only producers demanding labor services in our framework) following Erceg, Henderson and

Levin (2000). A representative labor aggregator (or “employment agency”) combines households’

labor hours in the same proportions as …rms would choose. Thus, the aggregator’s demand for

each household’s labor is equal to the sum of …rms’ demands. The aggregate labor index Lt has

the Dixit-Stiglitz form:
                                                 Z     1                                 1+       w
                                                                            1
                                         Lt =              ( Nt (h)) 1+         w   dh                ;         (B.41)
                                                   0

where       w   > 0 and Nt (h) is hours worked by a typical member of household h. The parameter                      is

the size of a household of type h, and e¤ectively determines the size of the population in the home

country. The aggregator minimizes the cost of producing a given amount of the aggregate labor

index, taking each household’s wage rate Wt (h) as given, and then sells units of the labor index to

the production sector at their unit cost Wt :
                                                       Z       1                         w

                                            Wt =                   Wt (h)   w   dh            :                 (B.42)

choose to set their wage to be the average wage of optimizing households. We denote the share of

FL households by 1-& and the share of HM households by &.

F (:) over real balances is assumed to have a satiation point to account for the possibility of a

zero nominal interest rate; see Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for further discussion.B.5 The

(log-linearized) consumption demand shock                       ct   is assumed to follow an AR(1) process:


                                                       ct   =         ct 1    +"   c ;t:                                         (B.45)

where       is the depreciation rate of capital.

        Financial asset accumulation of a typical member of FL household h consists of increases in

nominal money holdings (M Bt+1 (h)                      M Bt (h)) and the net acquisition of bonds. While the

domestic …nancial market is complete through the existence of state-contingent bonds BDt+1 , cross-

border asset trade is restricted to a single non-state contingent bond issued by the government of

the foreign economy.B.6

        The terms BGt+1 and BF t+1 represents each household member’s net purchases of the govern-

ment bonds issued by the home and foreign governments, respectively. Each type of bond pays one

currency unit (e.g., euro) in the subsequent period, and is sold at price (discount) of PBt and PBt ,

respectively. To ensure the stationarity of foreign asset positions, we follow Turnovsky (1985) by

assuming that domestic households must pay a transaction cost when trading in the foreign bond.

The intermediation cost depends on the ratio of economy-wide holdings of net foreign assets to

nominal GDP, PDt YDt , and are given by:

                                                                         BF t+1

                                                                         PDt YDt

If the home country is an overall net lender position internationally, then a household will earn

a lower return on any holdings of foreign bonds; conversely, if the home country is a net debtor

        The domestic contingent claims BDt+1 are in zero net supply from the standpoint of home economy as a whole.


                                                                   91
position, home households pay a higher return on their foreign liabilities. Given that the domestic

government bond in the home economy and foreign bond have the same payo¤, the price faced by
                                                                                    PBt

interest rate on domestic bonds (and similarly for foreign bonds) hence equals it = 1=PBt                       1.

      Each member of FL household h earns after-tax labor income, (1                      N t )Wt (h) Nt (h),   where

 Nt   is a stochastic tax on labor income. The household leases capital at the after-tax rental rate

(1     Kt )RKt ,   where   Kt   is a stochastic tax on capital income. The household receives a depreciation

write-o¤ of PIt      Kt    per unit of capital. Each member also receives an aliquot share              t (h)   of the

pro…ts of all …rms and a lump-sum government transfer, T Rt (h) (which is negative in the case of a

tax). Following Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), we assume that it is costly to change

the level of gross investment from the previous period, so that the acceleration in the capital stock

is penalized:
                                                                            2
                                                     1     (It (h) It     1)
                                            It (h) =     I                      :                               (B.49)
                                                     2           It 1

      In every period t, each member of FL household h maximizes the utility functional (B.44) with

respect to its consumption, investment, (end-of-period) capital stock, money balances, holdings

of contingent claims, and holdings of domestic and foreign bonds, subject to its labor demand

function (B.43), budget constraint (B.46), and transition equation for capital (B.47). In doing so,

a household takes as given prices, taxes and transfers, and aggregate quantities such as lagged

aggregate consumption and the aggregate net foreign asset position.

      Forward-looking (FL) households set nominal wages in staggered contracts that are analogous

to the price contracts described above. In particular, with probability 1                   w,   each member of a

household is allowed to reoptimize its wage contract. If a household is not allowed to optimize its

wage rate, we assume each household member resets its wage according to:


                                          Wt (h) = ! tw 1 ! 1   w
                                                                    Wt   1 (h);                                 (B.50)

                                                          92
where ! t   1   is the gross nominal wage in‡ation rate in period t              1, i.e. Wt =Wt      1,   and ! =   is the

steady state rate of change in the nominal wage (equal to gross price in‡ation since steady state

gross productivity growth is assumed to be unity). Dynamic indexation of this form introduces

some element of structural persistence into the wage-setting process. Each member of household h

chooses the value of Wt (h) to maximize its utility functional (B.44) subject to these constraints.

   Finally, we consider the determination of consumption and labor supply of the hand-to-mouth

(HM) households. A typical member of a HM household simply equates his nominal consumption

spending, PCt (1 +            HM
                        Ct ) Ct    (h), to his current after-tax disposable income, which consists of labor

income plus lump-sum transfers from the government:

                                         HM
                        PCt (1 +   Ct ) Ct       (h) = (1        N t )Wt (h) Nt (h)    + T Rt (h):                  (B.51)


   The HM households are assumed to set their wage equal to the average wage of the forward-

looking households. Since HM households face the same labor demand schedule as the forward-

looking households, this assumption implies that each HM household works the same number of

hours as the average for forward-looking households.


B.3. Monetary Policy


As in the simple benchmark model, the currency union central bank is assumed to adhere to a

Taylor-type policy rule although we allow here for some inertia in the interest rate reaction function

that is captured by the term           CU
                                    i it 1 :




                             iCU
                              t  = (1          i) (
                                                      CU
                                                      t     +       CU
                                                                 x xt    +      CU
                                                                             i it 1   + "M;t :                      (B.52)

The monetary policy shock, "M;t ; which we use when we estimate some of the model parameters in

Section 6.2, is assumed to be normally and idependently estimated with zero mean and standard

deviation       M.


                                                            93
    When monetary policy is subject to the ZLB, the policy rule is modi…ed as follows:


                           iCU
                            t  = max            i; (1     i) (
                                                                      CU
                                                                      t    +      CU
                                                                               x xt      +       CU
                                                                                              i it 1   ;                     (B.53)


where i is the steady state nominal interest rate: as before, iCU
                                                               t  measures the currency union policy

rate as a deviation from steady state, so that iCU
                                                t  =                       i implies that the policy rate is zero when

expressed in levels.


B.4. Fiscal Policy


The government does not need to balance its budget each period, and issues nominal debt BGt+1

at the end of period t to …nance its de…cits according to:

        PBt BGt+1      BGt = PCt Gt + T Rt              N t Wt Lt          Ct PCt Ct         Kt (RKt       PIt )Kt
                                                                                                                             (B.54)
                                                 (M Bt+1         M Bt );

where Ct is total private consumption. Equation (B.54) aggregates the capital stock, money and
                                                                                                                 R1
bond holdings, and transfers and taxes over all households so that, for example, T Rt =                              0   T Rt (h)dh.

The taxes on capital     Kt   and consumption           Ct   are assumed to be …xed, and the ratio of real transfers

                            T Rt
to (trend) GDP, trt =       Pt Y ,   is also …xed.B.7 Check footnote for comment! Government purchases

have no direct e¤ect on the utility of households, nor do they a¤ect the production function of the

private sector.

    When we estimate the model, the process for the (log of) government spending is given by an

AR(1) process:

                                          (gt      g) =      G (gt 1       g) + "g;t ;                                       (B.55)


where "g;t is independently normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation                                          B.8
                                                                                                                           G.
 B .7
      Given that the central bank uses the nominal interest rate as its policy instrument, the level of seigniorage is
determined by nominal money demand.
 B .8
      When we simulate the e¤ects of higher spending in Sections 6.3 and 6.4, we instead assume that spending follows
an MA(12) process, i.e. gt g = 11  s=0 "g;t s .




                                                                 94
   We assume that policymakers in the core and periphery adjust labor income taxes to stabilize

the debt/GDP ratio and the de…cit. Speci…cally, the labor tax rate evolves according to:


           Nt      N   =   1 ( Nt 1   N)    + (1      1 ) [ 2 (bGt        bG ) +   3(   bGt+1   bG )] :   (B.56)


B.5. Resource Constraint and Net Foreign Assets


The home economy’s aggregate resource constraint can be written as:


                                      YDt = CDt + IDt +              It   +    Mt ;                       (B.57)


where      It   is the adjustment cost on investment aggregated across all households. The …nal con-

sumption good is allocated between households and the government:


                                                   CAt = Ct + Gt ;                                        (B.58)


where Ct is (per capita) private consumption of FL (optimizing) and HM households:


                                            Ct = (1      &)CtO + &CtHM :                                  (B.59)


   Total exports may be allocated to either the consumption or the investment sector abroad:


                                                Mt = MCt + MIt :                                          (B.60)


The evolution of net foreign assets can be expressed as:

                                  PB;t BF;t+1
                                                = BF;t + PM t             Mt    PM t Mt :                 (B.61)
                                       bt

This expression can be derived from the budget constraint of the FL households after imposing

the government budget constraint, the consumption rule of the HM households, the de…nition of

…rm pro…ts, and the condition that domestic state-contingent non-government bonds (BDt+1 ) are

in zero net supply

   Finally, we assume that the structure of the foreign country is isomorphic to that of the home

country.

                                                          95
B.6. Production of capital services


In an augmented variant of the model, we incorporated a …nancial accelerator mechanism into both

country blocks of our benchmark model following the basic approach of Bernanke, Gertler and

Gilchrist (1999). Thus, the intermediate goods producers rent capital services from entrepreneurs

(at the price RKt ) rather than directly from households. Entrepreneurs purchase physical capital

from competitive capital goods producers (and resell it back at the end of each period), with the

latter employing the same technology to transform investment goods into …nished capital goods

as described by equations B.47) and B.49).          To …nance the acquisition of physical capital, each

entrepreneur combines his net worth with a loan from a bank, for which the entrepreneur must

pay an external …nance premium (over the risk-free interest rate set by the central bank) due

to an agency problem.       Banks obtain funds to lend to the entrepreneurs by issuing deposits to

households at the interest rate set by the central bank, with households bearing no credit risk

(re‡ecting assumptions about free competition in banking and the ability of banks to diversify

their portfolios). In equilibrium, shocks that a¤ect entrepeneurial net worth –i.e., the leverage of

the corporate sector –induce ‡uctuations in the corporate …nance premium.B.9


B.7. Solution Method and Calibration


To analyze the behavior of the model, we log-linearize the model’s equations around the non-

stochastic steady state. Nominal variables are rendered stationary by suitable transformations.

To solve the unconstrained version of the model, we compute the reduced-form solution of the

model for a given set of parameters using the numerical algorithm of Anderson and Moore (1985),

which provides an e¢ cient implementation of the solution method proposed by Blanchard and
 B .9
     We follow Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2008) by assuming that the debt contract between entrepreneurs
and banks is written in nominal terms (rather than real terms as in Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist, 1999). For
further details about the setup, see Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), and Christiano, Motto and Rostagno
(2008). An excellent exposition is also provided in Christiano, Trabandt and Walentin (2007).

Kahn (1980). When we solve the model subject to the non-linear monetary policy rule (??), we

use the techniques described in Hebden, Lindé and Svensson (2009). An important feature of the

Hebden, Lindé and Svensson algorithm is that the duration of the liquidity trap is endogenously

determined.B.10

         The model is calibrated at a quarterly frequency.                 As in the simple benchmark model, the

country size parameter             = 1=3; so that the periphery (the home country) constitutes 1/3 of euro

area output. The trade share of the periphery is set to 15 percent of periphery GDP. This pins

down the trade share parameters ! C and ! I for the home country under the additional assumption

that the import intensity of consumption is equal to 3/4 that of investment. The trade share of

the foreign economy is thus 7.5 percent. We assume that                      C   =   I   = 2, consistent with a long-run

price elasticity of demand for imported consumption and investment goods of 1:1. The adjustment

cost parameters are set so that 'MC = 'MI = 1, which slightly damps the near-term relative price

sensitivity. The …nancial intermediation parameter                   b   is set to a very small value (0:00001), which

is su¢ cient to ensure the model has a unique steady state.

         The utility functional parameter           is set equal to 1 to ensure that the model exhibit balanced

growth, while the parameter determining the degree of habit persistence in consumption is estimated

to be { = 0:877 (as discussed in the text). The Frisch elasticity of labor supply is set to 0.4 (so

   = 2:5): The utility parameter            0   is set so that employment comprises one-third of the household’s

time endowment, while the parameter                   0   on the subutility function for real balances is set at an

arbitrarily low value (so that variation in real balances do not a¤ect equilibrium allocations). We

set the share of HM agents & = 0:65; implying that these agents account for about one third of

aggregate private consumption spending (the latter is much smaller than the population share of

HM agents because the latter own no capital).

         In future work, it would be of interest to solve the model in a fully non-linear form.




                                                               97
         The parameter determining investment adjustment costs is estimated to be                 I   = 1:941: The

depreciation rate of capital            is set at 0:03 (consistent with an annual depreciation rate of 12

percent). The parameter               in the CES production function of the intermediate goods producers

is set to        2; implying an elasticity of substitution between capital and labor (1 + )= , of 1/2.

The quasi-capital share parameter ! K – together with the price markup parameter of                         P       = 0:20

– is chosen to imply a steady state investment to output ratio of 15 percent. In the augmented

version of the model with a …nancial accelerator, our calibration of parameters follows Bernanke,

Gertler and Gilchrist (1999). In particular, the monitoring cost,                , expressed as a proportion of

entrepreneurs’ total gross revenue, is set to 0:12. The default rate of entrepreneurs is 3 percent

per year, and the variance of the idiosyncratic productivity shocks to entrepreneurs is 0:28:

         As discussed in the text, the Calvo price contract duration parameter is estimated to be                     p   =

0:944, while the wage contract duration parameter is estimated to be               w   = 0:871: We set the degree

of price indexation        p   = 0:65 and wage indexation indexation      w   = 0:65; while the wage markup               W


= 1=3:B.11 The parameters of the monetary rule are set such that                    = 2:5,   x   = 0, and       i   = 0:7:

With the discount factor set at            = 0:99875 and the in‡ation target at 2 percent, the steady state

nominal interest rate is 2.5 percent.

         The parameters pertaining to …scal policy are intended to roughly capture the revenue and

spending sides of euro area government budgets. The share of government spending on goods and

services is set equal to 23 percent of steady state output. The government debt to GDP ratio, bG ,

is set to 0:75, roughly equal to the average level of debt in euro area countries at end-2008. The

ratio of transfers to GDP is set to 20 percent. The steady state sales (i.e., VAT) tax rate                           C   is

set to 0:2, while the capital tax          K   is set to 0:30. Given the annualized steady state real interest

         Given strategic complementarities in wage-setting, the wage markup in‡uences the slope of the wage Phillips

Curve.

rate (of 0.5 percent), the government’s intertemporal budget constraint then implies that the labor

income tax rate   N    equals 0:42 in steady state. We assume an unaggressive tax adjustment rule

in (B.56) by setting    1   = 0:985 and   2   =   3   = :1.

   Finally, the …rst order autoregressive coe¢ cient          g   on the government spending shock is esti-

mated to be 0.92, while the persistence of the consumption demand shock is set to 0.9, and the

technology shock 0.975 (noting that we assume that government spending follows a moving average

when simulating the e¤ects of a core government spending hike).
