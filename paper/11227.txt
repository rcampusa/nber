This article studies optimal remedies in a setting in which damages vary among plaintiffs and are

difficult to determine. We show that giving plaintiffs a choice between cash and coupons to purchase

units of the defendant’s product at a discount – a “coupon-cash remedy” – is superior to cash alone.

The optimal coupon-cash remedy offers a cash amount that is less than the value of the coupons to

plaintiffs who suffer relatively high harm. Such a remedy induces these plaintiffs to choose coupons,

and plaintiffs who suffer relatively low harm to choose cash. Sorting plaintiffs in this way leads to

better deterrence because the costs borne by defendants (the cash payments and the cost of providing

coupons) more closely approximate the harms that they have caused.

I. Introduction

         In many consumer lawsuits, the remedy takes the form of awarding plaintiffs coupons

that can be used to purchase the defendant’s product at a discounted price. Commentators

generally have been highly critical of this type of remedy. The dominant reason is that coupons

are thought to facilitate a settlement between the defendant and the lawyers representing the class

of consumers that is not in the best interests of the consumers.1 Coupons also have been shown

in some circumstances to give defendants an incentive to raise the prices of their products and in

other circumstances to lead consumers to buy an excessive amount of the products.2

         In this article we show that the use of coupons can be socially valuable. Specifically, we

demonstrate that it is possible to design a remedy in which coupons are offered as an alternative

to cash — a “coupon-cash remedy” — that will lead defendant firms to bear costs that better

reflect the harms that they have caused.3 By making firms’ costs more closely correspond to

their harms, the remedy will induce firms to make better ex ante decisions regarding how much

care to take.4

         To see why a coupon-cash remedy can lead to more accurate liability for defendants,

consider the following example, motivated by the facts in Tuchman v. Volvo Cars of North




         1
            Specifically, a defendant and a class lawyer have an incentive to overstate the value of the coupons to the
class, so that the defendant’s costs are reduced and the lawyer’s legal fees are enhanced. See generally Miller and
Singer (1997, pp. 107-12) and Leslie (2002, pp. 1004-52).

          Remedies involving a choice of cash or coupons have been used in a number of cases. See Gramlich

1056-57). See also note 5 below.

America.5 Suppose a car manufacturer chooses a type of tire that, given the common use of its

cars, makes the tires unusually prone to failure when driving on pot-holed pavement. Such

pavement is much more common in urban areas than in suburban areas. As a result, drivers who

drive primarily in urban areas have higher expected damages than drivers who drive primarily in

suburban areas. Suppose also that it is very difficult or expensive to determine the driving habits

of tens of thousands of class members. The court now offers the following remedy: coupons

good for the purchase of four new tires during the next year, with a face value of $1,000, or $500

in cash. The coupon option will be more valuable to individuals who drive mainly in urban

areas, while the cash alternative will be more valuable to individuals who drive primarily in

suburban areas. Thus, the liability costs borne by the car manufacturer will naturally reflect the

driving habits of — and therefore the harms suffered by — its customers. In contrast, if a cash

remedy were used alone in these circumstances, a court would find it difficult to determine how

much harm had been caused and would be likely to either overestimate or underestimate

damages.

         The point of the preceding paragraph is relevant in a wide range of circumstances. It

applies whenever damages are difficult to measure, plaintiffs vary in the harm suffered, and

plaintiffs who incurred above-average losses are likely to have above-average demands for the

defendant’s product in the future. It is then possible to structure a coupon-cash remedy that leads

high-loss plaintiffs to prefer coupons and low-loss plaintiffs to prefer a smaller cash alternative;

available at http://www.gardencitygroup.com/cases (see link to “Volvo Tire Settlement”). The settlement offered
“authorized claimants” a choice of four new replacement tires, or a $1,000 credit towards the purchase or lease of a
new Volvo, or $500 in cash.

the plaintiffs’ choices reveal the relative mix of high-loss and low-loss victims, and thereby

result in a more accurate assessment of damages.6

         We formally analyze the coupon-cash remedy in a model in which firms differ in the

distribution of harms they cause to victims. Ideally, firms that cause higher expected harm

should take greater care. The court, however, cannot observe firm type directly. Thus, if a pure

cash remedy were employed, it would have to be the same for all firm types and would lead to

underdeterrence of firms that cause high harm on average and overdeterrence of firms that cause

low harm on average. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct a coupon-cash remedy that

reduces both the underdeterrence and the overdeterrence that would result under the cash

remedy.

         In section II we describe the general model and prove the main result. In section III we

provide an example.7



II. The Superiority of the Coupon-Cash Remedy

         In this section we compare the coupon-cash remedy to the pure cash remedy in a general

model. Each firm chooses a level of care that affects the probability of harm. Victims differ in

the level of harm that they suffer. Each firm is characterized by a parameter that determines the

distribution of harm among victims. Let

         6
          For another illustration of how a coupon-cash remedy could help reveal damages, consider the following
example. Suppose that the pricing of upgrades to a computer operating system has been deemed to be
anticompetitive. Some consumers upgrade frequently, and suffer relatively high harm, while others do so only
occasionally, and suffer relatively low harm. A time-limited coupon for a discount off of the price of an upgrade is
more valuable to the former group, while a smaller cash alternative may be preferred by the latter group.
         7
          To our knowledge, the point that a coupon-cash remedy can reveal harm better than a pure cash remedy,
and thereby induce better care decisions by potential injurers, has not been made previously. Relatedly, however,
Gramlich (1986, pp. 268-69) discusses the advantage of a coupon remedy over a cash remedy in terms of




                                                   -4-
         x = level of care chosen by a firm;

     p(x) = probability that harm occurs; pN(x) < 0;

         h = harm suffered by a consumer;

         θ = firm type; 0 # θ # 1;

     g(θ) = density of firm types;

   f(h, θ) = density of harm among consumers caused by a θ-type firm; and

  F(h, θ) = cumulative distribution of harm among consumers.

We assume that Fθ < 0, so firms with a higher θ cause higher harm on average.

        Let

     h̄(θ) = average harm suffered by consumers of a θ-type firm,

where

                                                4
                                        h̄(θ) = Ihf(h, θ)dh.                                                 (1)
                                               0

Note that h̄(θ) also represents total harm, assuming that the population is normalized to be unity.

        The first-best level of care for a θ-type firm, x*(θ), minimizes

                                            x + p(x)h̄(θ).                                                   (2)

Obviously, x*(θ) is strictly increasing in θ since h̄(θ) is strictly increasing in θ.

        We assume that if an accident occurs, firms are strictly liable for harm.

        The cash remedy. Under a pure cash remedy, the court determines the level of damages

to impose on the defendant firm. Let

         d = damages imposed under the cash remedy.


compensating victims without having to identify them (though he does not consider a coupon-cash remedy in this
regard).



                                                   -5-
The court is assumed to know the various distributions described above, but not each defendant

firm’s type.

       Consider the behavior of a firm, given damages d. The firm will pick the level of care x

to minimize

                                             x + p(x)d.                                             (3)

Let x(d), which is independent of θ, be the solution to this problem. The court’s problem then is

to choose d to minimize social costs,

                                                    1
                                    x(d) + p(x(d))Ih̄(θ)g(θ)dθ.                                     (4)
                                                    0

       We now show that, given optimal damages d*, there exists a firm whose θ is strictly

between 0 and 1 that takes first-best care; we designate this the θ*-type firm. Firms with lower θ

take excessive care and firms with higher θ take inadequate care.

       To see that there exists a θ*-type firm, suppose otherwise, that x(d*) $ x*(1) or x(d*) #

x*(0). Suppose first that x(d*) > x*(1). Since every firm is taking excessive care, social costs

clearly would decline if d were lower. Now suppose x(d*) = x*(1). Given that the 1-type firm is

taking first-best care, the derivative of (2) with respect to x evaluated at x(d*) is 0 for θ = 1 and

positive for θ < 1 (since x*(θ) is strictly increasing in θ). The derivative of social costs (4) with

respect to damages d can be written as

                                         1
                                   xN(d)I[(1 + pN(x(d))h̄(θ)]g(θ)dθ.                                (5)
                                         0

Clearly, xN(d) > 0. The expression in brackets is the derivative of (2) with respect to x, which is

positive for θ < 1 and 0 for θ = 1. It follows that (5) must be positive, contradicting the




                                              -6-
optimality of d*. Hence, x(d*) < x*(1). By a similar argument, it follows that x(d*) > x*(0).

Thus, given d*, there exists a firm such that 0 < θ < 1 that takes first-best care.

        To summarize, the pure cash remedy is a second-best outcome in which all firms are

induced to take the same level of care because the court cannot make the costs borne by each

firm depend on the harm it causes. Consequently, some firms (θ < θ*) are induced to take

excessive care, while other firms (θ > θ*) are induced to take too little care. Only one type of

firm — the θ*-firm — takes first-best care.

        The coupon-cash remedy. Under a coupon-cash remedy, the court chooses the number of

coupons to award and a cash alternative. We assume that the value a consumer attaches to a

coupon depends on the harm he has suffered, with the valuation increasing in harm (consistent

with the tire example described in the introduction). The cost to the firm for each coupon that is

redeemed is the same for all consumers.8 Let

         n = number of coupons available to each consumer;

     v(h) = value of each coupon to a consumer whose harm is h; vN(h) > 0;

         c = cost to a firm of each coupon that is redeemed; and

        m = cash alternative available to each consumer (“m” for money).

        Consider the decisions of consumers whether to elect coupons or cash. An h-type

consumer — a consumer whose harm is h — will prefer coupons over cash if nv(h) > m. To

make the comparison between the coupon-cash remedy and the pure cash remedy interesting, we




        8
         We make this assumption for simplicity. This would be the case if all consumers electing to receive
coupons would have purchased the good anyway, for then each coupon results in the same loss of revenue.



                                                  -7-
assume that n and m are chosen so that for some positive value of h, consumers are indifferent

between coupons and cash.9 Let

  h^(m, n) = value of h at which a consumer is indifferent between cash amount m and n coupons.

Since the value of coupons is increasing in h, consumers with lower h prefer cash and consumers

with higher h prefer coupons.

        Given consumers’ decisions, the cost borne by a θ-type firm is

                                   mF(h^(m, n), θ) + nc(1 – F(h^(m, n), θ)).                                  (6)

        To demonstrate that the coupon-cash remedy is superior to the cash remedy, we first

show that it is possible to pick the number of coupons n and the cash alternative m such that the

θ*-firm under the coupon-cash remedy bears the same cost as under the pure cash remedy and

therefore continues to choose first-best care. This condition will be satisfied for any n and m

combination such that

                              mF(h^(m, n), θ*) + nc(1 – F(h^(m, n), θ*)) = d*.                                (7)

Observe that if m is set equal to d* and n is set equal to d*/c, so that nc = d*, then (7) would be

satisfied, and the outcome for all firms under the coupon-cash remedy would be identical to that

under the pure cash remedy.

        To see that it is feasible to set n = d*/c, observe that the upper bound on n, call it ~
                                                                                               n(m), is

determined by the requirement that not all consumers prefer coupons to cash. In other words,

~
n(m) solves ~
            n(m)v(0) = m, so that ~
                                  n(m) = m/v(0). Thus, n = d*/c is feasible if d*/c < ~
                                                                                      n(d*) =

d*/v(0) or, equivalently, if v(0) < c. This condition states that the consumer who suffers the least

        9
          Otherwise, all consumers would elect cash or all consumers would elect coupons. The latter outcome is
equivalent to the pure cash remedy from the perspective of firms. The reason is that the cost to each firm is
independent of the harm suffered by the plaintiff; consequently, all firms would take the same level of care.



                                                 -8-
harm, and consequently values coupons the least, values a coupon less than the cost to the

defendant of providing the coupon. We assume that this plausible condition holds.

         We next show that, starting from m = d* and n = d*/c, it is possible to lower m and raise

n so as to reduce the excessive care taken by firms with θ < θ* and increase the inadequate care

taken by firms with θ > θ*, while still satisfying (7).

         Starting from m = d* and n = d*/c, it is obvious that if m decreases, n must increase in

order for (7) to be satisfied again; otherwise the left-hand-side of (7) would be a weighted

average of d* and a number less than d*.

         To see that there exists an n high enough to restore the effect of the reduction in m, lower

m to d* – ε and raise n to (d*/c) + δ(ε), where δ(ε) is chosen to satisfy (7). It is clear from the

definition of h^(m, n) that lowering m and raising n reduces h^ (both changes make coupons more

attractive relative to cash). Consequently, F(h^(m, n), θ*) decreases and (1 – F(h^(m, n), θ*))

increases. It follows that the necessary increase in n required to satisfy (7) is less than the

increase in n needed if F(.) and (1 – F(.)) did not change. We next calculate the δ — referred to

as δ̄(ε) — required to satisfy (7) on the assumption that F(.) and (1 – F(.)) do not change. This δ

solves

             (d* – ε)F(h^(d*, d*/c), θ*) + ((d*/c) + δ)c(1 – F(h^(d*, d*/c), θ*)) = d*.               (8)

Thus,

                       δ̄(ε) = εF(h^(d*, d*/c), θ*)/c(1 - F(h^(d*, d*/c), θ*)).                       (9)

We now show that n = (d*/c) + δ̄(ε) is feasible, that is, that (d*/c) + δ̄(ε) < ~
                                                                                n(d* – ε) = (d* –

ε)/v(0), or [(d*/c) + δ̄(ε)]v(0) < d* – ε. This condition is satisfied for ε sufficiently small because

as ε goes to 0, δ̄(ε) goes to zero (see (9)), and the condition becomes v(0) < c, which we


                                              -9-
previously assumed holds. Clearly, therefore, n = (d*/c) + δ(ε) is feasible for ε sufficiently

small.

         We next demonstrate that by picking ε sufficiently small, we can improve the care

choices of all firms other than the θ*-firm without affecting the care choice of that firm. To do

this, we demonstrate that the slope of the care function (care as a function of θ) is positive if ε is

positive, but can be made arbitrarily small by picking ε sufficiently small; therefore, this slope

can be made less than the slope of the first-best care function. This implies that firms for which

θ < θ* can be induced to take less care, but not too much less care, and firms for which θ > θ*

can be induced to take more care, but not too much more care.

         From (2), the first-order condition determining the first-best level of care for a θ-type

firm, x*(θ), is

                                        1 + pN(x*(θ))h̄(θ) = 0.                                      (10)

We assume that the second-order condition is satisfied, which requires that pO(.) > 0. Totally

differentiate (10) with respect to θ to obtain:

                              pO(x*(θ))x*N (θ)h̄(θ) + pN(x*(θ)) h̄N(θ) = 0.                          (11)

Given our assumption that Fθ < 0, firms with a higher θ cause higher harm, so h̄N(θ) > 0. Since

pN(.) < 0 and pO(.) > 0, (11) implies that x*N (θ) > 0. Let the minimum value of the slope of the

first-best care function be

                                      * N = inf [x*N (θ)].
                                     xM                                                              (12)
                                           θ є [0, 1]

         Under the coupon-cash remedy with m = d* – ε and n = (d*/c) + δ(ε), a θ-type firm

chooses care level x(θ) to minimize

                                  x(θ) + p(x(θ))l(θ),                                                (13)

By steps analogous to those employed in the preceding paragraph, it is straightforward to show

that

                                  pO(x(θ))xN (θ)l(θ) + pN(x(θ))lN(θ) = 0.                                           (15)

Observe that lN(θ) = –[ε + cδ(ε)]Fθ > 0 since Fθ < 0. Thus, xN (θ) > 0. In other words, for ε > 0

the slope of the care function under the coupon-cash remedy is positive. Moreover, as ε goes to

zero, lN(θ) goes to zero (since δ(ε) also goes to zero), which implies that xN (θ) goes to zero.

Therefore, it is possible to pick ε sufficiently small so that the slope of the care function under

the coupon-cash remedy is less than the slope of the care function in the first-best solution for all

                                 * N defined by (12). This implies that if ε is small enough, the
values of θ, that is, less than xM

coupon-cash remedy does not cause firms for which θ < θ* to take too little care, or cause firms

for which θ > θ* to take too much care. Thus, there exists a ε > 0 that improves the care decision

of every firm without affecting the care decision of the θ*-firm.10



III. An Example

         In this section we present an example that illustrates the superiority of the coupon-cash

remedy. There are two levels of harm, low harm hL and high harm hH. Firms either take low

care xL or high care xH. The respective probabilities of harm occurring are p(xL) > p(xH). There


         10
           Although we have shown that a coupon-cash remedy can lead to better care decisions of firms, the
detrimental effects of coupons (discussed in the first paragraph of this article) also need to be taken into account. .



                                                    - 11 -
are two types of firms, a low-harm causing firm θL and a high-harm causing firm θH, where θ is

the fraction of high-harm victims injured by a firm, with θL < θH. The total harm caused by each

firm is, respectively, h̄L = (1 – θL)hL + θLhH and h̄H = (1 – θH)hL + θHhH.

       We assume that the first-best solution involves the θL-firm taking low care xL and the θH-

firm taking high care xH. In other words,

                                 xL + p(xL)h̄L < xH + p(xH)h̄L,                                (16)

and

                                 xH + p(xH)h̄H < xL + p(xL)h̄H.                                (17)

       Under the cash remedy, in which both firms are subject to a damage payment d, they will

take high care if and only if

                                  xH + p(xH)d < xL + p(xL)d.                                   (18)

Because the government cannot distinguish between the firms, the outcome under the cash

remedy must be that both firms take low care or both firms take high care. We assume that the

second-best outcome is for both firms to take high care. This can be accomplished by setting d

to satisfy (18), that is, d* > (xH – xL)/[p(xL) – p(xH)]. Thus, under the cash remedy, too much care

will be taken by the θL-firm.

       Now consider the coupon-cash remedy, and let vL and vH be the value of a coupon to low-

harm and high-harm victims, respectively, with vL < vH. Low-harm victims will choose the cash

alternative m and high-harm victims will choose the n coupons if

                                      nvL # m < nvH.                                           (19)




                                            - 12 -
                                                                                        ~
Assuming (19) holds, the costs borne by the two firms if harm occurs are, respectively, hL(m, n)

                       ~
= m(1 – θL) + ncθL and hH(m, n) = m(1 – θH) + ncθH. Thus, the low-harm firm will choose low

care if and only if

                                    ~                    ~
                          xL + p(xL)hL(m, n) < xH + p(xH)hL(m, n),                                  (20)

and the high-harm firm will choose high care if and only if

                                    ~                    ~
                          xH + p(xH)hH(m, n) < xL + p(xL)hH(m, n)                                   (21)

        We now show that there exists a number of coupons n and a cash amount m that satisfies

(19), (20), and (21), and that thereby achieves the first-best outcome. First, let m = nvL. It is

clear, then, that (19) holds since vL < vH. After some manipulation, it also can be seen that (20)

and (21) will hold if and only if

              (xH – xL)/[p(xL) – p(xH)][vL(1 – θH) + cθH] < n
                                                                                                    (22)
                                 < (xH – xL)/[p(xL) – p(xH)][vL(1 – θL) + cθL].

Since vL < c (this follows from our assumption in the general model that v(0) < c) and θL < θH,

the left-hand term in (22) is less than the right-hand term. Thus, there exists an n that satisfies

(22), and which consequently generates a first-best outcome.

        To illustrate the significance of the coupon-cash remedy, let the levels of harm be hL =

$100 and hH = $1,000; the costs of care xL = $50 and xH = $250; the probabilities of harm p(xL) =

.4 and p(xH) = .1; and the firm types θL = .2 and θH = .8. The first-best solution requires that the

θL-firm, which causes harm of h̄L = $280, take low care, and the θH-firm, which causes harm of

h̄H = $800, take high care. Under the pure cash remedy, the second-best solution is for both

firms to take high care, which can be accomplished by setting damages at d* > $667. This

results in social costs of $317. Under the coupon-cash remedy, let the valuation of coupons be vL


                                            - 13 -
= $5 and vH = $30; and the cost to a firm of issuing a coupon be c = $25. Then, for example, if

the remedy consists of the choice of 40 coupons or $200 in cash, the low-harm victims will

choose cash and the high-harm victims will choose coupons. Now, instead of both firms bearing

damages of d* > $667 when harm occurs, the θL-firm bears costs of $360, which causes it to

choose low care, and the θH-firm bears costs of $840, which causes it to choose high care. This

results in social costs under the coupon-cash remedy of $288, a 9.1 percent improvement.
