   the poor and their               offspring.          Children     of     the   poor weighed

   between 2,900             and 3,200       grams on average at oirtn, or about the

   10th     to        25th        centile     of      modern       hirthweight       standards.

   suffered from higher rates of infant                     mortality than         today.    But

   infant mortality               was far    worse than that expected from a modern

   schedule of mortality by birthweight,                    and a major        determinant    of

   excess        mortality         appears     to     be the poor quality of nineteenth

   century obstetrics.

     The health and nutritional status of the urban poor figure prominently in

historical    discussions    of living standards in mid-nineteenth           century America.

Contemporary     observers   and modern historians have charged that           a    substantial

fraction     of working-class     families   were    unable   to purchase adequate        food.

clothing, and shelter, and that their health and nutritional Status suffered the

expected consequences (Griscom, 1845; Commons, St         al. ,   1918; Ware, 1924; Sullivan,

1955; Wilentz, 1984).        There is also an emerging debate on the possible change

in standards of living in mid-century.         According      to Komlos (1987) an increase

in the relative price of food after 1840 led to a reduction in its per capita

consumption.      Rapid urbanization     may have resulted in deteriorating            health,

mortality, and environmental conditions, and living standards may have worsened

in the North during the Civil War (Yasuba, 1962; Fogel, 1988; Mitchell, 1903;

Fite, 1910; Lebergott, 1964; Engerman, 1966; DeCanio and Mokyr, 1977).

     This paper presents an analysis of birthweights and infantmortality in mid-

nineteenth century     Philadelphia,    using obstetrics      records    from Philadelphia's

Almshouse hospital, an institution for the poor and their offspring.                Through the

lens of anthropometric data we examine the extent of relative deprivation of the

urban poor, changes in standards of living in mid-century and during the Civil

War, and the relationship between birthweight and infant mortality.

     Recent work by          economic   historians    has     demonstrated    the    value   of

anthropometric    data in studying patterns of health and nutritional Status in

nineteenth-century America (Steckel, 1979b; Margo and Steckel, 1982, 1983; Fogel,

at al., 1983; Fogel, 1987; Steckel, 1986a, l986b; Komlos, 1987; Margo and Steckel,

1988). Union Army muster rolls reveal that the urban poor achieved only about the

25th centile of modern adult height standards around 1860.1                But short stature


     1
       This statement is based on the assumption that the urban poor would
nostly mature to be unskilled laborers in urban areas, whose adult heights
reached the 25th centile; see Margo and Steckel (1983).
                                                                                                    2

in adults is cumulative, reflecting nutritional deficiencies and environmental

insults during the growing years and not just deprivation at any one point in

time.     Evidence on adult heights can be supplemented with that for children

(Tanner, 1982).            Of particular value    is evidence   on birthweights.   Modern studies

have shown          that    variations     in birthweight    are   sensitive   to a variety    of

socioeconomic and demographic factors and that birthweight is an excellent overall

indicator of newborn health.               Low birthweight, defined to be   2500   grams or less,

is associated today with a significantly increased risk of neonatal mortality

(Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt, 1968; for general references in the area see

Tanner,    1978;         and Hurley,     1980).   Previous   studies have suggested     that low

birthweights may have been an important determinant of short adult stature and

of high rates of neonatal mortality in the past (Tanner, 1982; Floud and Wachter,

1982; Steckel,           1986a; Fogel, 1987).       More important is that birthweight is a

contemporaneous          indicator of the standard of living.

        The Almshouse data suggest that birthweights among the urban poor averaged

between 2,900 and 3,200 grams (6.4 to 7.1 pounds) in the 1850s and 1860s and that

birthweights         fell sharply during the Civ1 War years.               Compared with modern

standards the urban poor were lighter at birth, and their mortality experience

as infants was considerably worse than that predicted from a modern schedule of

mortality by birthweight.              A   key determinant of mortality at the Almshouse was

the   poor quality of nineteenthcentury obstetrics                    practice (Shorter, 1981;

Leavitt, 1986).             In particular, the failure of obstetricians to intervene in
                                           -• and when intervention     took place, the use of
lengthy or difficult            labors

forceps    -   -   led   to a higher probability of infant death.
1. The   Data

     The Alashouses of Philadelphia --        the poor   house, the work house, and the

hospital    -   - originated   in the eighteenth century.   Like their counterparts in

other cities, the institutions served the poor and their offspring.2          Beginning

in the nineteenth century physicians attending births at the Almshouse hospital

recorded    information    on the mother, the delivery, and the infant, including

(beginning in 1848) weight at birth.        The data base for the paper consists of all

4,841 births occurring at the hospital from 1848 to         l873.
     The Almahouse       hospital was an institution where poor women, regardless of

age, marital status, nativity,         and health, gave birth (see Table I for sample

statistics).       Approximately    34 percent were over age 25, only 17 percent were

under 20 years old, and for 40 percent, the birth was at least their second.

Nearly half (42 percent) claimed to be married or widowed.             The majority of

mothers (69 percent) were foreign born, primarily Irish (50 percent), and only

17 percent were native to Philadelphia.

     Pregnant women came to deliver their babies at the Almshouse hospital through

varied channels.      Many entered the poor house or the work house well before giving

birth, brought there by the Guardians of the Poor, a civil group which scoured

the city for poor in need of relief.        The majority of the women were destitute,

abandoned, and without other housing; they were, in other words, the poorest of

the poor.        Women close to labor and those suffering from venereal and other

Alahouses of Philadelphia.    Alexander (1980) discusses the early history of

1874 to 1877. From 1877 to 1885 the register lists only the child's name,
race, and sex.
                                                                                                 4

diseases were brought directly to the hospital; they spent little or no time at

the poor house or the work house prior to giving birth.           A   final group, typically

foreign born, went to the hospital to give birth because, being new to the city,

they had no other choice.

     Mean birthweightsof Almshouse infants by year of birth are graphed in Figure

1.   While the overall mean was 3,377 grams, the average birthweight fluctuated

from year to year and across decades.          The average birthweight rose in the early

1850s reaching a peak in 1856, fell through the Civil War years reaching a trough

in 1866, and then increased from 1866 to 1873.

      An analysis of the determinants of birthweight reveals the role of maternal

characteristics,      including nativity, and also supports the general reliability

of the data.       Two   regressions   are reported    in Table    2.    Regression   (1)   was

estimated on a sub-sample for which information on gestational age was available

(1854 to 1873) and regression      (2)   used the full sample.      The dependent variable

is measured in grams. While the R2's are relatively low, the variance explained

is higher when gestational age is included.

     Demographic       characteristics    of     the   mother     influenced    birrhweight.
                                                                                             4
Birthweight increased (at a decreasing rate) with maternal age and with parity.

One might expect married women (or widows) to be better-off               economically than

single women, and hence to give birth to heavier babies.5             The effects of marital

status are small and statistically insignificant, however,              in both regressions.

Mothers who    were   diagnosed as "alcoholic" or having venereal disease had babies


          These patterns   are typical of modern data; see, for example, Hardy and
Mellits    (1977).

       In their study of birthweights in nineteenth-century Montreal, Ward and
Ward (1984, p. 335) found that unmarried women bore babies who were, on average,
100 grams lighter than babies born to married women.
                                                                                                   5

that were hundreds of grams lighter.6

       Ethnic and rural-urban differences in diet, socioeconomic status, disease

environment, and the frequency and intensity of female labor force participation

might be expected to produce ethnic and rural-urban differences in birthweights.7

All ethnic and nativity groups had lighter babies than the Irish. The weight gap

between Irish and non-Irish infants -- between 90 and 200 grams, depending on the

regression - -    is   similar to the gap observed in Montreal among the same groups

in the late-nineteenth          century   (Ward    and Ward,    1984).8      Mothers native to

Philadelphia gave birth to infants who were significantly lighter than did mothers

born elsewhere in the United States.9

       The sex and gestational age of the child affected birthweight.                Males were

approximately 100 grams heavier at birth, identical to the difference                   observed

today    (Tanner,      1978).    Birthweight      increased    (at    a decreasing   rate)   with

gestational     age, also a pattern found in modern data.            The coefficients of several

                                          consumption on fetal growth have been
widely noted in the literature; see Tanner (1978).
       Because birthweights vary with mother's height, ethnic differences in
maternal stature could produce ethnic differences in birthweight, This factor
could not be investigated because maternal stature was not reported (but see
footnote 14).
     8 The reason
                  why Irish babieswereheavier is unclear, although one possibility
is ethnic differences in mother's height: Irish mothers may have been taller
than other mothers. This is suggested by the fact that Irish males were taller
as adults than other European males in the mid-nineteenth century, and that the
Irish who migrated to       th
                           United States were probably taller than the Irish who
remained behind.    See Steckel (l986b) for evidence on ethnic differences in
adult height and Margo and Steckel (1983) on the relationship between migration
and   height.
       According to Margo and Steckel's (1983) study of antebellum heights,
persons born in large cities (population of 10,000 or more) were significantly
shorter as adults than persons born in rural areas. Thus our finding suggests
that the rural-urban difference in adult height may have originated in part in
the fetal period.

independent variables
                           --   for example,    mother's age and ethnicity       and whether the

motherwas venereal or an alcoholic          -
                                                differ in magnitude     between the regressions

with and without gestational age, which suggests that these characteristics

influenced the extent of prematurity along with birthweight.

     Previous      studies have revealed monthly variation              in infant mortality     in

nineteenth-century       cities    (Cheney,     1984).       Seasonal    variation     in wages,

employment, food prices, and the disease environment may                 have   caused variation

in birthweight        which,    in turn,   may     explain    monthly    variation     in infant

mortality)'0       The regressions provide some indication that birthweights varied

seasonally:       infants born in the   winter and summermonthswere lighter than those

born in the spring or fall,           But the differences are small, suggesting               that

seasonal variation in birthweights            cannot explain monthly variation in infant

             11
mortality,

     Changes in birthweight over time were examinedby a series of dummy variables

for various time periods.         The results demonstrate that the time patterns evident

in Figure 1 are not due to changes in the composition of the sample                   over   time.

After controlling       for other factors, birthweights         rose in the late l8SOs but

declined sharply (by 220 to 240         grams) during the    Civil War decade.       The recovery

in birthweights that began at the end of the 1860s was insufficient, however, to

reverse the decline.




     10
        Cheney (1984) argues that some portion of high infant mortality during
the summer months may have been related to nutritional deficiencies.

         Steckel (198Gb) shows that, among slaves, seasonal variations in
birthweight were a major factor behind seasonal variations in infant mortality.

2. Birthweights

     Modern birthweight standards are 3,400 grams for females and 3,500 grams for

males,   or an average of 3,450 grams (Tanner, 1978).           Compared with modern

standards, Almshouse     infants appear to have been relatively     healthy   at birth

(recall the mean is 3,377 grams).    Furthermore, only during the Civil War decade

did birthweights fall below levels considered normalby current standards.12         But,

as pointed out previously, the hospital served an impoverished clientele, and one

might have expected birthweights of Almshouse infants to have been even lower than

those of their richer contemporaries and considerably lower than today.        Several

biases in the data can be considered.

     Systematic measurement     error is one possibility.      No description of the

weighing    procedure   survives, but in all   likelihood    the babies were weighed

unclothed (or were weighed with a blanket, the weight of which was subtracted)       13
As appears to have been typical of hospitals during the period, the weights were

reported to the quarter-pound, but heaping alone would not bias the mean.

     The strongest argument against measurement error is that birthweights were

similarly high at lying-in hospitals in ocher cities. According to data collected

by Storer (1850), the mean birthweight at Boston's Lying-In Hospital in the late
l840s was    3,368 grams.   Mean birthweights at a lying-in hospital in Montreal

during the secondhalf of the nineteenth century ranged from 3,200 to 3,600 grams,

depending    on the decade (Ward and Ward,      1984).      Although the evidence    is

admittedly fragmentary, it seems doubtful that systematic measurement error is

     12
        If the 1860s are excluded the mean birthweight         rises to 3,466 grams.
The mean birthweight during the 1860s was 3,336 grams.

     13
        Several stillbirths weighingunder a pound were recorded, which would not
be credible if they included the weight of a blanket. A photograph appearing in
Cone (1961, p. 496) suggests the typical practice in late eighteenth century
Europe was to weigh babies naked.
                                                                                              8



responsible for the relatively higher birthweights of A].rnshouse infants.

       The exclusion of sickly infants who were not weighed could bias the mean

birthweight upward.      These babies were often stillborn or dead shortly after

birth.   Judging by their mortality experience, which was far worse than average,

the average birthweight of babies who were not weighed must have been between

1,000 and 2,000 grams.     Approximately 4 percent of all infants were not weighed.

If each weighed 1,000 grams (the lower bound), the overall mean birthweight would

fall from 3,377 to 3,243 grams.       The adjustment, while not trivial, leaves the

substantive finding of relatively high birthweight unaffected.

       This leaves a third possibility     -   - prenatal   care during the third trimester

may have     raised brthweights   at the Almshouse above levels outside the hospital.

Modern studies in less-developed countries demonstrate that food supplements and

reductions     in work effort late in pregnancy result in increased birthweights

(Lechtig, at al., 1975; Naeye and Peters, 1982). As pointed Out previously, some

mothers would have been brought to the Almshouse weeks before delivery, and they

may have benefited from lessened physical labor and a more nutritious diet than
that obtainable outside the Almshouse)4

       We have examined the effect of prenatal care by calculating the mother's

length of stay at the Almshouse       prior to giving birth.         Although there is no

information on the date    of admittance       in the obstetrics records, we were able to

link   the   names of those giving birth to other Almshouse records to obtain the




     14 For a similar
                      argument in the case of Boston, see Vogel (1980). According
to Ashby's (1915) study of early twentieth century England, pregnant women who
entered lying-in hospitals during their last trimester had infants whose
birthweights were 300 grams higher than did mothers who entered such hospitals
just prior to giving birth.
Length of stay prior to birth for the year 1854.15     The average length of stay

was 46 days.   Only a tenth entered within three days of giving birth. Twenty-five

percent spent at least two months and a tenth spent the entire last trimester at

the Almshouse.

     A regression of birthweights in the linked (1854) sample indicates that women

who spent at least one month at the Almahouse prior to delivery gave birth to

infants who were 115 grams heavier than average.16    The effect of prenatal care

was imprecisely estimated, however, because the 95 percent confidence interval

around the coefficient is [-50 grams, 280 grams.     The mean birthweight in 1854

is 3,450 grams.    Subtracting the estimated effect of prenatal care (115 grams)

produces   an adjusted mean of 3,335 grams.    Subtracting the upper bound of the

confidence interval reduces the mean further to 3,170 grams, or approximately

eight percent below the unadjustedmean.   The ameliorative impact of the Almshouse

suggests that at least some of Philadelphia's poor received considerably better

care within the confines of the poorhouse than outside it)'7

     Accounting for the two downward adjustments, average birthweights among the

urban poor ranged between 2,900 and 3,200 grams around 1850 to 1870, or about 8

        Length of stay was derived by linking the obstetrics records to the
"Almshouse Hospital Female Register, 1803-1887" (record series 35.116, Archives
of the City and County of Philadelphia). The register records admittances on a
daily basis.   The obstetrics records give the name of the mother and the date
of birth of the infant. To perform the linkage it was necessary to search the
register for the name of the mother for all days previous to the date of birth.
Because this procedure proved to be extremely costly, we were able to perform the
linkage for only a single year. The year 1854 was chosen because the number of
births was relatively high.
     16
         In his study of birthweights in Vienna in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, Ward (1986, p. 10) found that length of stay raiaedbirthweight
by 4.1 grams per day, which translates into 123 grams a month, quite close to our
estimate,

                                                                            of
birthweight from 2900 and 3,200 falls between the 10th and the 25th centile

a modern birthweight distribution      (see Tanner, 1978), which is consistent with

the evidence presented above on the short adult stature of the urban poor and

roughly equivalent to levels in many less-developed countries today)8

     Thus the urban poor began life at a nutritional disadvantage.              In modern

data, factors associated with reduced birthweight include maternal malnutrition,

maternal   or   fatal   infections, heavy physical   labor during pregnancy,     alcohol

consumption, ingestion of toxic substances, and a genetic predisposition           to low


birthweight     (Stein. at al., 1975; Hurley, 1980; Naeye and Peters, 1982; Tanner,

1978; Hytten and Leitth,     1971).   Except for genetic predisposition, it is likely

that all other factors mattered among the urban poor, although their relative

importance cannot be deduced from the available evidence.19         That the mothers of

the urban poor would have been poorly nourished by modern standards and subject

to a variety of infections, seems impossible to doubt, given their general poverty

and poor environmental conditions. Labor force participation rates among foreign-

born and single women were high (Dublin, 1979; Goldin and Sokoloff,                 1982;


     18
        For example, a mean birthweight falling between 3,000 and 3,100 grams
would be close to levels observed in Mexico and Thailand in the mid-1950s
(Meridith, 1970 ,p. 232). The estimated range is also similar to the range of
                                                                           see Tanner
birthweights recorded at lying- in hospitals in nineteenth-century Europe;
(1981).
     19
        Genetic factors may be ruled out because it is doubtful that genetic
differences among the urban poor were large, given the populations from which
they were drawn. Short maternal stature, however, may account for some of the
reduced birthweight.  According to Hytten and Leitch (1971, p. 308) birthweight
declines by about 20 grams per inch of mother's height.    Although we have no
information on the adult heights of urban women during the period, adult female
slaves were about 1.5 inches below modern standards (Steckel, 1986a). Since it
is doubtful that urban women differed significantly in stature from adult
female slaves (a conclusion suggested by the evidence on adult male heights),
short maternal stature could explain at most 12 percent (30/250) of reduced
birthweights among the urban poor.

Stansell, 1986), and there is little evidence that poor women reduced physical

labor during pregnancy.            The level of alcohol consumption during the period was

high enough        to    suggest     that its   negative    effects   on birthweights   were
                 20
substantial.

      Our results        indicate that birthweights      fell sharply during the Civil War

decade, and it is unlikely that the biases discussed above are responsible for

the   decline.21          A widely used benchmark        for judging declines    in average

birthweight is that observed during the Dutch famine of World War II.               Due to a

sharp reduction         in caloric intake, birthweights in the central part of Holland

in 1944 fell about 300 grams below the normal level (Stein, at al., 1975).                By
the standards of the Dutch famine experience the decline in birthweight at the

Almshouse   -   - 299   grams comparing the trough in 1866 to the average weight diring

the 1850s   -   - was   severe.

      Previous studies have documented a decline in real wages during the Civil

War years and stagnant economic growth over the decade as a whole (Mitchell, 1903;

Lebergott, 1964; Engerman, 1966).          A time   series regression of average birthweight


     20
        According to Abel (1982) daily consumption of more than 2 ounces of
absolute alcohol by pregnant women is associated with a
                                                        significantly increased
risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and reduced birtliweight. Rorabaugh's (1979)
estimates of absolute alcohol consumption during the late antebellum period are
close to or exceed this figure and, as he points out, there is no evidence that
women were generally more temperate than men.
      21 It might be argued that the decline in birthweight during the Civil War,
and the absence of an upward trend itt birthweight over the whole
                                                                     period, may be
misleading for the urban poor as a whole. The number of births at the hospital
was roughly constant from year to year (except during the Civil War, when the number
of births fell). If the population from which Almahouse mothers were drawn was
increasing in size over time, the Almshouse admittance policy may have produced
a group of mothers that was increasingly impoverished over time, especially
during the Civil War. This tendency would be offset, however, by increases over
time in the real incomes of the urban poor. Unfortunately, a direct examination
of the hypothesis is not possible, because we lack detailed information on the
socioeconomic background of the mothers.

                                                         a time trend yields an
(1860 to 1873) on a distributed lag in the real wage and

elasticity    of mean birthweight with respect to the real wage of 02, and a

             coefficient   on the time trend22         Since   the trend   in birthweight,
positive

               for the decline     in real wages, was negative,       it appears that the
unadjusted

decline in real wages was the major factor behind the decline in birthweight.23

        Our findings have implications for comparisons that have been made between

living standards of the urban poor and of slaves.            According to Steckel (1986a),

the average birthweight        of slave infants around 1850 was about 2,300 grams.

                                                             at birth than were
Judging from out estimates the urban poor were far healthier

slave infants.     But the mean adult heights of the two groups were the same (Margo

and Steckel, 1983).        Consequently, patterns of physical growth during childhood

and early adolescence must        have   differed markedly between slaves and the urban

         which supports      Steckel's    (1986a,   1986b)   contention   that   the   factors
poor,

producing     the extraordinary    rate of catch-up growth were unique to the slave
              24
population.




     22 Based on                                                      Thus the
                 preliminary runs, the lag was set at two periods.
independent variables are: the current real wage, the real wage lagged once,
the real wage lagged twice, and a time trend.      The purpose of including a
distributed lag in the real wage is to allow for the possibility that the
nutritional status of the mothers might not respond immediately to the decline
in the real wage, The real wage refers to unskilled labor and was taken from
Lebergott (1964). There is some evidence (Mitchell, 1903, p. 302) that female
                                                                     use of the
wages declined relative to male wages during the early years; if so,
                                                                         of the
Lebergott series (which refers to males) may understate the importance
real wage in explaining the decline in birthweight.
        23
        An increase in the labor force participation of women might also be
responsible for some of the fall in birthweight.   According to Engerman (1966),
however, the evidence for an increase in labor force participation is ambiguous.
        24
        In particular, Steckel (1986b) argues that the improvement in the slave
diet was timed with entry into the labor force in early adolescence.        The
                                                                           than
improvement was sufficient to generate a rate of catch-up growth higher
any observed in modern populations.
3. Infant Mortality    at the Almshouse

     The Almshouse data suggest that birthweights among the urban poor were below

modern standards.     In modern data, reduced birthweight is associated with higher

levels of neonatal mortality.      The mortality    experience of Alashouse        infants,

however, was far worse than that predicted by a modern schedule of mortality by

birthweight.

     Death rates by gestational age and birthweight are presented in Tables 3 and

4.   Information is only available on fetal deaths (called "stillbirths" in the

records) and first day deaths (deaths during delivery or shortly after birth).

Because the distinction between fetal and first day       deaths   was not always clearly

made, Table 4 nets out fetal deaths.

     Overall,   the death rate (fetal plus      first   day) was 82.6 per 1000 births.

The overall first-day death rate was 25.3 per 1000 live births.25          The death rate

fell with gestational age and was u-shaped with         respect    to birthweight.    Below

2,500 grams and above 4,000 grams the death rate increased sharply. The relative

effects of gestational age and birthveight were smallest among            low   birthweight

infants,    These patterns are consistent with those displayed by modern schedules

of mortality by birthweight (Shapiro, et al., 1965; Tanner, 1978).

     In 1960 the fetal death rate in the United States was 16.1 per 1000 births.

First-day deaths were 14.8 per 1000 live births in 1935 and 9.3 per 1000 live

births in 1964 (Shapiro, Ct     al.,   1965).   The higher rate of fetal loss at the

Almshouse   may not be too surprising: some of the mothers attempted to abort


     25
        The calculations (and the figures in Tables 3 and 4) exclude mothers
diagnosed as venereal, because their infants experienced much worse mortality
than the average, even holding constant birthweight (see Table 5).     If such
mothers were included the death rate (fetal plus first day) would rise to 88.7
per 1000 births, and the first day death rate would rise to 29.2 per 1000 live
births.
                                                                                    14


through physical means or the use of chemical abortifacients26 But the first-

day death rate and the implied neonatal death rate are also higher, aspecially

among infants weighing under 2,500 grams.    In 1950 the neonatal death rate under

2,500 grams was 173.1 per 1000 live births, and the neonatal death rate was twice

the first day death rate (Shapiro, et al,, 1965, pp. 271, 318)27        Our estimate

of the first-day death rate for babies under 2,500 grams is 125.8 per 1000 live

births.    Doubling the figure gives an estimate of the neonatal death rate of   25L6

per 1000 live births, 45 percent higher than the figure in 1950.        Furthermore,

it is likely our estimate is biased do%mward, because the ratio of the neonatal

death rate to the frat-day death rate declined over time (Shapiro, at al., 1965,

p. 271).

     Further analysis of the determinants of fetal and first day deaths in Table

5 supports    the reliability of the mortality    data,   and also reveala how the

conditions surrounding the birth influenced the chancea of infant death.      Column

(1) reporta a logistic regression of the probability of a fetal or first- day

death, and column (2) reports a regression of first day     deaths,   Because of the

overwhelming importance of geatational age, the aample nc1udes only observations

for which geatational age was available.

     Prematurity and low birthweight were by far the most important determinants

     26 The conclusionis
                          suggested by marginal notes in the obstetrics records.
An alternative explanation of the high fetal death rate stresses the effecta of
dietary supplements ifl   late
                             pregnancy given to otherwise malnourished mothers;
in such cases the fetal death rate (in late pregnancy) may be higher than it
would be otherwise (see Keilmann, et al., 1983).
     27 The ratio of the neonatal and first
                                               day death rates was calculated by
averaging over all birthweighta.     It is unclear from the medical literature
whether the probability of a frat day death (relative to the probability of a
neonatal death) is higherfor babiea under 2,500 gras. If the relative probability
were higher, our estimate of the neonatal death rate under 2,500 gras would be
biased upwards.
                                                                                  15

of infant mortality, and the signs of the coefficients mimic the patterns in

Tables 3 and 4. The probability of a fetal death increased with the age of the

mother, while the probability       of a first-day death decreased with her age,

patterns found in modern data.28      Babies born to mothers diagnosed as venereal

had higher death rates, even after controlling for lower average birthweight.29

     As in the analysis of birthweight, one might expect married women or widows

to be better-off economically, and their infants to have a lower risk of dying.

Although   the effects of marital    status have the correct sign (negative), the

coefficients are statistically insignificant.    Somewhat surprisingly, the child's

sex was unrelated to mortality.30    The seasonand year of birth also had no effect

on the probability of infant death.31     Compared with other ethnic groups, Irish

babies faced a greater risk of dying, although the difference was small relative

to other factors.32

     28
        Shapiro, et al. (1965, pp. 320-21) show that the fetal death rate increases
with the age of the mother beyond age 20, and that the neonatal death rate has
an inverted U-shape with respect to mother's age. The inverted U-pattern is
consistent with the signs of the age and age squared coefficients in the regression
of first-day deaths. The coefficient on parity in the regression of first-day
deaths is also consistent with modern data, which shows a strong positive
relationship between parity and infant mortality, particularly for women under
age 25 (the majority of Almshouse mothers); see Shapiro, et al. (1965, jj.)
     29
        The result presumably reflects the transmission of venereal disease from
the mother to the fetus.
     30
        The result is puzzling, because in modern data males have higher fetal
and perinatal death rates than females, although the differences are small; see
Shapiro, et al. (1965, p. 311).
     31 The infant death
                          rate, not controlling for other factors, was 25 percent
higher in the l860s than in the l850s. Thus the insignificant coefficients on
the year of birth dummies imply that the factors controlled for in the regression-
-in particular, birthweight--account for the rise in mortality during the Civil
War decade.
     32
        One explanation of the higher mortality among Irish infants concerns
religion. A majority of Irish mothers were unwed, and    presumably the vast
majority were Roman Catholic. If the social consequences of illegitimacy were
                                                                                            16

        The conditions    surrounding the birth greatly affected          the probability   of

infant death.        Other things equal, a lengthy labor was associated with higher

mortality, as was the use of forceps.          The results suggest that the poor quality

of nineteenth-century obstetrics practice may have been an important reason for

the high first-day       death rate,    According   to Shorter (1981; ace also Leavitt,

1986)    ntenention during delivery      was discouraged, and the preferred regimen was

to let nature run her course.          In lengthy or difficult deliveries forceps were

used, but the emphasis was on saving the mother, not the infant,               The Almshouse

data suggest that, had the attending physician been able to monitor fetal health

more closely during labor and had he tha willingness (and ability) to intervene

earlier      and more successfully,      the   first-day   death   rate    would   have been

significantly lower,33

        Previous    studies of brthweights and infant mortality           in the nineteenth

century have applied modern schedules of mortality by birthweight to estimated

birthwai&nt     distrbutons to    generate estimates of neonatal mortality         (Steckel,

1986; Fogel,       l987).   in modern data, moat neonatal mortality is accounted for


worse  in Irish neighborhoods, unwed Irish mothers may have tried to induce
abortona more often than other mothers, or engage in other activities (for
example, hide the pregnancy from relatives, and have little or no prenatal
care) leading to a higher probability of an infant death. Alternatively, and
perhaps more likely, the effect may be due to ethnic differences in socioeconomic
status, the disease envrornent, female labor force perticipaton, -or the
length of stay in the Almahouse prior to giving birth (see footnote 15).
Unfortunately, the latter possibility     - differences in the length of stay - -
                                               -


cannot be investigated because the linked sample is too small to analyze mortality.
        33                                -



        Because moat beoies in the nineteenth century ware delivered by midwives,
and midwives used forceps infrequently, the forceps explanation may be relevant
only for hospital births. Midwives, however, also followed the non-intervention
regimen, which by itself increased the frequency of first-day deaths,
     34
        For example, oteckel (l986a) estimated slave neonatal mortality in a
four stage procedure: He first estimated a regression of height at ages 3 and
4 on birthwaight, using modern data. Next, ha used the regression coefficients
to predict the mean birthwaight of slave infants, given slave heights at ages 3
                                                                                             17

by those under 2,500 grams at birth, and the death rate under 2,500 grams varies

little across countries, developed or underdeveloped (Fogel, 1987, p. 477).                Our

results suggest, however, that the mortality schedule by birthweight has not been

stable over time.       Infant death rates under 2,500 grams were considerably higher

in the nineteenth century than they are today. It follows that estimates of infant

mortality     derived    from applying       modern   mortality   schedules   to historical

birthweight distributions are biased downward,35



4. Conclusion

     The social history of the urban poor in mid-nineteenth century America is

a history of deprivation.       We have presented evidence on one important aspect of

urban poverty and its consequences       -   - birthweights and infant   mortality - -   using
evidence    derived from the obstetrLcs case records of Philadelphia's            Alashouse

hospital.    Adjusting for various biases, it appears that the children of the urban

poor weighed between 2,900 and 3,200 grams at birth, or 250 to 550 grams below
modern standards.       Birthweights declined during the Civil War decade, consistent

with the poor state of the economy in the 1860s. Because birthweights were lower

than modern standards, the urban poor suffered higher levels of infant mortality

than today,     But infant mortality was considerably worse than that expected from

a modern schedule of mortality by birthweight,            and a major determinant of the


and 4, which were derived from the slave manifests.       He           then chose a modern
distribution of birthweight whose mean mostly closely                 corresponded to the
estimated mean birthweight of slave infants.      The final           step was to apply a
modern schedule of mortality by btrthweight to the estimated          distribution of slave
birthweights.

        It also follows that such a procedure may incorrectly estimate the
proportion of decline over time in neonatal mortality due to increasing birthweight
and will also miss the interaction effect between shifts in birthweight and
shifts in the birthweight-mortality schedule.
                                                                                              18

excess mortality appears to have been the poor quality of nineteenth-century

obstetrics. By the mid-twentieth century         hospital births   were coamon occurrences,

average birthweights          in the United States were higher than those observed in our

sample, and the birthweight-mortality           schedule had shifted downward         (Shorter,

1981;    Leavitt,     1986;    Shapiro,   at al., 1965).    It is not yet clear when

                                                                            were
birthweights began to rise and whether improvements in obstetrical practice

responsible for the shift in the birthweight-mortality             schedule,36

        In sum, birthweights of the urban poor in nineteenth-century America are

consistent with evidence on their terminal heights.          They were born into the 25th

centile by modern standards and died in approximately the same condition. Their

birthweights,       however, can explain only a small      portion of their high infant

mortality.      Birthweights        did not decline    during mid-century        as   has   been

hypothesized, but they did respond severely to the deprivation and dislocation

wrought by the American Civil War.




        36
        Leavitt (1986), for example, argues that while infant mortality was
lowered by the shift of births from home to hospital, maternal mortality was,
at least in the short run, increased.
