We surveyed representative samples of Italian residents at three critical points in the COVID-19
pandemic, to test whether and how intentions to comply with social-isolation restrictions respond
to the duration of their possible extension. Individuals reported being more likely to reduce, and
less likely to increase, their self-isolation effort if negatively surprised by a given hypothetical
extension (i.e., if the extension is longer than what they expected), whereas positive surprises had
no impact. These results are consistent with reference-dependent preferences, with individual
expectations serving as a reference point, and loss aversion. Our findings indicate that public
authorities should carefully manage expectations about policy measures and account for
behavioral reactions to deviations from previous announcements.

1. Introduction

We study how government announcements and individuals’ expectations about a policy’s duration

affect citizens’ willingness to comply. We investigate this topic in the context of the COVID-19

pandemic, when compliance with lockdown measures was crucial to slow down the spread of the virus

and alleviate the burden on the health systems (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). We conducted

three cross-sectional surveys on representative samples of the Italian population at critical moments of

the pandemic and found that the willingness to comply with the self-isolation measures is sensitive to

how long citizens expect the measures to last in comparison with the end date announced by the

government. Respondents expressed a lower willingness to comply with self-isolation measures if the

possible extensions of these norms were longer than they expected. Moreover, individuals grew more

impatient over time and reported a lower intention to comply after the government extended the duration

of the lockdown.

    Many public policies aim to influence citizens’ behavior. Policymakers can leverage on incentives

and sanctions; however, strict enforcement is often costly, and voluntary compliance is crucial to

achieve the desired behavior. Ensuring voluntary cooperation is particularly important when individuals

do not fully internalize the negative effects that their behavior might have on others. The social

distancing measures that many countries introduced to contrast the spread of COVID-19, ranging from

limitations to gatherings to shelter-in-place orders, are a relevant example. In this context, one

additional complication is that people might not even be aware of hurting others when violating social-

distancing rules, because many infected individuals are asymptomatic and unaware of being positive

due to limited testing capabilities (especially so at the onset of the pandemic). Thus, voluntary

compliance is critical (Watanabe and Yabu 2020), and so is the investigation of what factors motivate

it (Maharaj and Kleczkowski 2012).

    Some studies have documented that compliance with social distancing measures can depend on

socio-economic constraints, e.g. whether citizens have access to flexible work arrangements

(Papageorge et al. 2020), but also on behavioral factors, such as beliefs about the infectiousness of the

virus (Akesson et al. 2020) and their sense of civic duty (Barrios et al. 2020; Durante et al. 2020). Our



                                                   2
research provides evidence of another important behavioral factor: people’s expectations of the duration

of self-isolation measures.

    In the spring of 2020, governments adopted different approaches to communicate the duration of

the COVID-19 lockdown to the public; some implemented the measures “until deemed necessary”,

whereas others specified an end date. 1 These choices identify a tension between different potential

effects. On the one hand, limits to personal mobility and economic activity without setting an end date

can increase the perceived severity of the crisis, thus improving compliance; at the same time, they

might also increase anxiety or fatalism, thus potentially reducing the respect of the rules. 2 On the other

hand, a specific end date may be easier to communicate to the public, although it might convey the idea

that the epidemic will be under control by that date. However, because of the uncertainty surrounding

the pandemic’s severity and its evolution, authorities could not rule out potential extensions to the

announced end date of the restrictions. Lengthening the lockdown after having set clear expectations

may reduce the public’s acceptance, trust in the authority, and ultimately reduce compliance. 3 These

tensions witness the importance of understanding how citizens’ willingness to comply with social

distancing measures depends on the announced duration of the measures and their possible extensions.

    The psychological mechanisms that we study, and their behavioral consequences, are akin to those

identified in other contexts where reference points and expectations showed to influence decisions.

Consistent with prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992),




1
  In the Hubei province of China, where the virus originated and first spread, authorities imposed a strict lockdown
of the population without setting a defined end date (Yang and Kubota 2020; Hessler 2020). In Italy and other
countries such as Canada, France, the United States, India and the United Kingdom, instead, the government
enacted stay-at-home mandates specifying an end date for the measures. However, most countries extended the
lockdowns beyond the end that that they had originally set. In Ontario (Canada), for example, two weeks after
enacting a two-week public-school closing, the provincial government issued a further extension of the closure
without defining an end date. The governments of France also considered an extension of the lockdown measures,
with politicians and commentators debating whether the extension should be in place for an additional specified
period of time, or indefinitely until necessary (France 24, 2020). Similarly, the British Prime Minister announced
on March 23rd, referring to the just-introduced lockdown measures in the country that the government was going
to revisit the end date after three weeks, and relax them only if the evidence showed that it was possible to do so
(BBC News 2020; Davies and Diver 2020).
2
   Previous research found that quarantine measures have negative short and long-term psychological effects,
including anxiety and post-traumatic stress, with even more severe effects for longer quarantines (Brooks et al.
2020). For the role of fatalism, see Akesson et al. (2020).
3
  Moser and Yared (2020) discuss additional tradeoffs that governments face when deciding between committing
not to extend the lockdown measures beyond the date originally set or, instead, keeping open the option to extend
them if the evolution of the epidemic makes it necessary.

                                                         3
individuals have shown to value the outcomes of certain decisions based on an internal reference point.

Abeler et al. (2011) show that reference points can be exogenously altered, and that high expectations

can nudge workers to work longer hours and earn more money (see also Camerer et al., 1997 and

Thakral and Tô, 2017 for similar results). Reference points have proved to influence efforts also in a

variety of other settings, such as physical activity (Allen et al. 2017), buying decisions (Wenner, 2015;

Kőszegi and Rabin, 2006), 4 and charitable giving (Exley and Terry, 2019).

    In the context of our study, another implication of moving the deadline of the social distancing

measures is the so-called “goal gradient” effect, according to which the farther a person is to a goal the

less likely they exert effort to achieve it (Bonezzi et al. 2011; Heath et al. 1999). This effect is visible

in several contexts, such as the dissatisfaction that consumers may have from experiencing a lower

quality of a good or service than they expected, or that patients and airline passengers feel if wait times

are longer than announced. These mis-confirmations may lead the individuals to not engage with a

service or purchase a good again (e.g. see Craig et al., 2017). 5 In the case of the COVID19 outbreak,

moving the goalpost of when the social distancing measures will be lifted might have led to frustration

among the public if they began to believe that the goal was unattainable (Huang et al. 2012; Louro et

al. 2007).

    Our study shows that citizens’ willingness to comply with government policies is sensitive to

expectations in a manner consistent with prospect theory, in a context where citizens’ compliance has

high stake consequences for public health. Because the evolution of the policy responses to COVID-19

in Italy resembles the subsequent experience of other countries, our results may extend beyond this

specific case and have implications for the timing of policy announcements by other governments

around the world. In this way, we offer insights on the importance of communication framing and

expectation setting by governments interested in implementing behavioral change policies. This is

particularly true for time-limited policies that inevitably set an expectation among the public about their

 Insights for good and service providers vary; for example, foot-in-the-door techniques (asking initially for a
small commitment, and escalate later) may facilitate initial adoption, but lead to a negative shock in the future.
Door-in-the-face approaches, whereby the proposer starts by asking a strong commitment, may discourage
adoption but, conditional on adopting, may lead to positive surprises and higher satisfaction and retention (Staw
1981; Kelly and Milkman, 2013).

duration. Since acceptance and compliance by citizens are as difficult to achieve as important to the

effectiveness of the policy, governments should pay attention to how they communicate interventions.

    In the next section, we report the institutional background and the methodology of the study; in

Section 3 we describe the data, and we discuss the results of the empirical analyses in Section 4. We

conclude, in section 5, with policy implications from our study and directions for future studies.



2. Institutional background and survey

In early 2020, Italy was the first Western country to implement a lockdown in response to the rapidly

growing number of COVID-19 cases at the outset of the virus outbreak. The government first

communicated the implementation of the lockdown as temporary and announced a specific end date

that it later revised twice before gradually relaxing the measures (see Appendix A for a detailed account

of COVID-19 events and policy responses in the country). Despite media coverage stressing the gravity

of the virus, hefty fines and severe sanctions for lawbreakers, the Italian government initially struggled

to ensure full compliance by the public.

    To study how the duration of stay-at-home measures influenced compliance, we collaborated with

a well-established survey firm to run three carefully timed surveys on representative samples of the

Italian population. 6 In Figure 1, we plot some indicators of the epidemiological developments, the

timing of the main policy responses, and the timing of the three waves of our survey. The first wave ran

on March 18-20, 2020, the second on April 8-10, and the third on April 22-24; the three waves reached

nationally representative samples of 894, 891 and 912 individuals, respectively.

  SWG is one of the most established market research firms in Italy and a member of the European Society for
Opinion and Marketing Research. The company manages a panel of over 60,000 individuals in the country.
Respondents fill the surveys online or respond to questions via an online computer-assisted telephone interview
(CATI) software. The firm began administering questions related to the COVID-19 epidemic in a weekly survey
in late January 2020. We added a set of questions to three of SWG’s surveys (questions in Italian and their English
translation are in Appendix B).

data. Last update May 19, 2020.


    Each survey wave had four main parts. In the first part, respondents answered questions about what

actions they were adopting to reduce the likelihood of contagion.

Next, we measured respondents’ awareness of the official end date of the stay-at-home measures by

asking them to report it. Third, after showing all respondents the officially announced end date to fix

for heterogeneous levels of awareness (April 3 in wave 1, April 13 in wave 2, and May 3 in wave 3),

we recorded the respondents’ subjective expectations on possible extensions of the measures. In this

question, there were four statements and we asked participants to choose the one they believed would

be most likely to occur. The options were as follows: (a) “the measures will end on the date indicated

by the Government”; (b) “the measures will be extended by a few weeks”; (c) “the measures will be

extended by a few months”; and (d) “the measures will be extended indefinitely, until deemed

necessary”. Finally, we asked respondents to consider a set of scenarios with different extensions of the

stay-at-home measures, and to indicate their intentions to comply with the restrictions under each

scenario. There were three cases for them to consider, each with a different duration of the extension:


                                                   6
“by a few weeks”, “by a few months”, “indefinitely, until deemed necessary”. In each scenario,

participants would select one of five options: “I would significantly increase my isolation”, “I would

somewhat increase my isolation”, “I would continue in my current behavior”, “I would somewhat

reduce my isolation”, “I might decide not to comply with the rules”. We presented the scenarios in

random sequence to avoid ordering effects. This design allows us to determine whether the duration of

the extension affects intentions to comply with stay-at-home measures. Further, we can assess whether

any given extension represented a surprise (positive if the extension is shorter than what the respondent

expected, negative otherwise) or was close to individuals’ expectations. The survey also included a

module with questions about the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics.



3. Data and descriptive statistics

Characteristics of the sample

Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, both

overall and for each survey wave. 39.7% of respondents live in one of the five regions 7 where the

disease initially spread on a larger scale (i.e., the “Red Zone” – see Appendix A). 17.2% reside in

Lombardia, the region that experienced the largest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. 32.8% of

participants are older than 60, and as such, are in the sub-population at highest risk of severe effects

from COVID-19. 8 We also report summary statistics on the number of social-isolation behaviors that

respondents reported having adopted. On average, respondents adopted 4.3 of the 6 recommended

behaviors listed in the survey, and 46% of the sample reported adopting all six recommended

behaviors. 9 Table C1 in Appendix C shows these statistics for various relevant sub-groups.

  The five regions were Lombardia, Veneto, Marche, Piemonte, Emilia-Romagna.
8
  See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html.
9
  The six recommended behaviors listed in the survey were: “I try to keep a safe distance from people”, “I do not
go to crowded places”, “I go to supermarkets as seldom as possible”, “I no longer meet with friends”, “I no longer
meet with relatives who do not live with me”, and “I do not leave home except in an emergency”. Due to a coding
error, in the second wave the survey firm coded this question as single-response instead of multiple-response. We
have thus discarded the question from wave 2. See Appendix Tables C2 and C3 for details.

                                                        7
Awareness of end date of stay-at-home provisions

To achieve widespread compliance, awareness of a policy’s provisions is crucial. A large majority of

respondents reported accurately the date that the Italian government had announced as the deadline for

the stay-at-home measures as of the date of the survey (i.e., April 3, April 13 and May 3 for the first,

second and third wave, respectively). The share of respondents who reported the correct date was 77.2%

overall (73.5% in wave 1, 64.7% in wave 2, and 93.4% in wave 3; see Table C4 in the Appendix). 10

These findings indicate that in spite of a large share of the population being knowledgeable about the

relevant deadlines, between 25%-30% of the population was either confused or not well informed about

the timeline of the measures.

Notes: The table reports the average age of participants as well as percentages of participants with
certain characteristics. Red Zone refers to the following regions: Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Marche,
Piemonte, Veneto. The variable “economically comfortable” indicates respondents who reported that
their household income allows them to live “comfortably” or “without concerns”. The variable “Facing
economic difficulties” identifies respondents who reported that they “are having economic difficulties”,
“make to the end of the month with much struggling”, or “are poor and their income does not allow
them to make it to the end of the month”. “Compliance with social-isolation measures” is the number
of social-isolation measures respondents report having adopted, and “adopting all social-isolation
measures” is the percentage of respondents who reported adopting all recommended measures (see
Appendix Tables C2 and C3 for details). We used sampling weights (provided by SWG) to compute
these statistics.

10
   The proportions are similar among red-zone residents and those living in the rest of the country (77.3% vs.
77.2%) and among respondents younger than 60 and older than 60 (76.9% vs. 77.6%).

                                                           8
Respondents’ expectations about possible extensions of stay-at-home measures

As shown in Figure 2, the distribution of expectations about the duration of possible extensions of the

stay-at-home measures was different across the three waves. In the first wave (conducted in the early,

ascending, stage of the epidemic), only 2.8% of respondents believed that the lockdown would end on

the official date (April 3). 42.7% expected the government to extend the provisions by a few weeks,

20.4% by a few months, and 34.1% for an indefinite time. In the second wave (during the “plateau”

portion of the epidemiological curve in the country), again only a few responded expected the measures

to end at the (new) official date (April 13), but many more believed the extension to last only a few

weeks compared to wave 1 (70.9%), and fewer expected longer extensions. In the third wave, we

observe an increase in this trend with nearly 40% of respondents expecting that the lockdown would

actually end on the (new) date (May 3), almost half believing it would last only a few more weeks, and

a small minority expecting extensions by months or an undetermined time. 11 The shift in expectations,

with an increasing share of respondents expecting an earlier end of the social distancing rules, followed

at least in part the evolution of the epidemic and the actual policy. Considerable heterogeneity remained,

however, within each wave about how long the measures would remain in place.




11
   These proportions are similar among residents of red-zone and non-red zone regions, and among respondents
younger than 60 and those older than 60 (see Table C5 in the Appendix)

4. Analyses

Figure 2 shows that there is a discrepancy between the duration of the self-isolation measures expected

by citizens and that announced by the government. The analyses we present in this section offer insights

as to how individuals respond to government communication, and the extent to which they rely on their

own beliefs. Analyzing expectations as reference points is also informative as to the nature of

preferences; in particular, we can test whether positive or negative “surprises” (i.e., the duration of self-

isolation restrictions is shorter or longer than expected, respectively) have a similar or asymmetric effect

on intentions to comply. We first report some descriptive graphical evidence and then turn to regression

analyses.



Announced lockdown extensions and self-isolation intentions

In Figure 3 we report the distribution the respondents’ intentions to comply with stay-at-home

restrictions under the three scenarios of potential extensions to the date announced by the government

at a given time: “a few weeks”, “a few months”, or “indefinitely”. Because extreme compliance

intensions were infrequent, we grouped intentions to comply categories into three: “maintain”, “reduce”

                                                         10
(combining “would reduce self-isolation” and “would consider no longer respecting the rules”), and

“increase” (“increase somewhat” and “increase greatly” self-isolation efforts) 12. Most respondents

(between 63% and 70%) in all scenarios indicated that they intended to “maintain” their current self-

isolation efforts, with a decline in case of longer extensions. The proportion of respondents who

intended to increase self-isolation is similar across the three scenarios (between 17.2% and 17.7%).

Conversely, the share of respondents who would reduce it increases with the length of the expected

extensions, going from 12.4% in the scenario where the lockdown is extended by a few weeks to 19.5%

in the case of indefinite extension. There are also differences across waves, with a drop in the proportion

of respondents who intend to increase their compliance and a rise in those decreasing it in more recent

waves (see Appendix for details). Intentions to comply are thus sensitive to the hypothesized duration

of lockdown extensions. This could be due to the cost of isolation increasing with its duration. As a

longer lockdown is plausibly connected to more severe epidemiological environments, also its benefits

could increase with duration, but not necessarily as steeply as the cost.

Notes: The graph reports the sampling-weighted proportion of respondents who stated their intention
to increase, maintain, or reduce their compliance with self-isolation measures, by hypothesized
extension scenarios. “Increase self-isolation” corresponds to the intention to either “increase
substantially” or “increase somewhat” self-isolation; “Reduce self-isolation” includes the options
“reduce somewhat” or “consider not complying with restrictions”; “Maintain self-isolation” indicates
intention to “continue with current self-isolation behavior”. The design-based F statistic for the test of
equality of distribution in the five (mis)match cases is 21.9 (p<0.001).

Expectation on extensions and self-isolation intentions

To investigate the extent to which intentions to comply with the lockdown depended on individual

expectations about how long the measures would be in place, we defined a measure of match (or

mismatch) between expectations and extension scenarios (see Table 2). A “match” occurs when the

extension scenario coincides with the respondents’ expectations. Mismatch cases can be positive or

negative: “shorter“ and “much shorter” indicate instances where the scenario hypothesizes that the

measures will end sooner than the respondent expects, whereas “longer” and “much longer” denote

cases in which the hypothesized extension dates end later than a respondent’s expectation. 13

Notes: The rows of this table report the lockdown extension scenarios presented to the respondents; the
columns refer to the respondents’ expectations about the duration of the lockdown. We indicate as a
“match” the cases in which the expectations corresponded to the hypothesized extensions. “Shorter”
and “much shorter” correspond to cases where the hypothesized duration of the measures is less than
the expected duration; “longer” and “much longer” indicate that the scenario hypothesizes the measures
to end later than expected.



13
  Potentially, we could create a further category for the combination “end on announced date”-“extended
indefinitely”, but we consider the shock of an indefinite extension not too different between those expecting an
immediate end and those expecting a few weeks extension and, therefore, keep them in the same category.

                                                                                                12
    Figure 4 shows the distribution of self-isolation intentions by the (mis)match between expectations

and hypothesized extension scenario. The sampling-weighted averages show that the proportion of

respondents who report a willingness to increase compliance with self-isolation measures decreases as

the hypothesized extension of the measures gets longer than the respondents expected. Conversely, the

more negative the surprise between scenario and expectations, the higher is the proportion of individuals

expressing the intention to reduce their level of compliance. For extreme mismatches (where the

scenario is much longer than expectations), the share of respondents who indicate they would reduce

compliance is higher than the share of those who would increase it. We find similar patterns in each

wave (see Figure C2 in Appendix C). We also observe an asymmetry between positive surprises, which

are not associated with changes in compliance intentions, and negative ones, for which we find a

reduction in compliance intentions. This is consistent with reference-dependent preferences, with

expectations acting as reference points, and with individuals placing more weight on negative than

positive news.

Notes: The graph reports the sampling-weighted proportion of respondents who stated their intention
to increase, maintain, or reduce their compliance with self-isolation measures, by (mis)match between
the hypothesized extension scenarios and their expectation about this extension. “Increase self-
isolation” corresponds to the intention to either “increase substantially” or “increase somewhat” self-
isolation; “Reduce self-isolation” includes the options “reduce somewhat” or “consider not complying
with restrictions”; “Maintain self-isolation” indicates intention to “continue with current self-isolation
behavior”. The design-based F statistic for the test of equality of distribution in the five (mis)match
cases is 18.29 (p<0.0001).

                                                                                   13
Regression analyses

We investigate the statistical significance of these differences, and their robustness to controls, with

multinomial regressions analyses. The outcome variable is the choice between increasing, maintaining

(the default option) and reducing compliance. The covariates on which we focus are the different

extension scenarios, the expectations about extensions that the respondent reported, and the type of

mismatch between scenarios and expectations. Additional covariates include indicators for each wave,

and the set of socio-demographic features reported in Table 1. Table 3 reports the parameter estimates

in relative-risk-ratio transformations. For each specification, the first column displays the estimated

coefficients for the option to increase compliance, and the second the estimates for the option to reduce

compliance.

    The estimated coefficients from specification (1) indicate that respondents, on average, were

significantly more likely to express the intention to reduce their compliance when presented with a

scenario that implied an extension longer than a few weeks. They were also less likely to report a

willingness to increase (and more likely to decrease) compliance in wave 3. In specification (2) we

included indicators of the respondents’ expectations, setting “the lockdown will end as planned” as the

omitted category. Respondents who expected that the government would extend the duration of the

lockdown were less likely to report the intention to reduce compliance compared to those who expected

the lockdown to end on the announced date (without any large or statistically significant differences

across groups who expected different extensions). In specification (3) we add among the covariates the

deviations from the extension scenarios, with “extension matching expectations” as the omitted

category. The results confirm the descriptive evidence from Figure 4. Respondents who experienced

negative surprises were significantly less likely to report the intention to increase compliance, and

(especially) more likely to report the intention to reduce it, compared with the “extension matching

expectations” case. Positive surprises imply reactions in the opposite direction, although these effects

are weaker and, in most cases, not statistically significant. Wald tests for differences between the

estimated coefficients on the positive and negative surprise indicators provide further evidence of the




                                                   14
significance of the asymmetric effect of deviations of extension scenarios from expectations. 14,15 Thus,

the most significant reaction (statistically and in size) to the discrepancy between extension scenarios

and expectations is the intention to reduce compliance when the hypothesized extension is longer than

expected, while the reaction to shorter than expected extensions is negligible. These findings are

consistent with expectations serving as reference points, and loss aversion triggering a stronger reaction

in the loss domain.

     Because expectations about the duration of the lockdown measures vary, we can further investigate

whether all types of expectations are equally relevant reference points. Some respondents believed that

the isolation restrictions would end at the officially announced dates. This was more frequent in the

third wave. Because the official date was plausibly salient, a question is whether it was also a stronger

reference point. This question is also relevant for policy, if announcing a specific end date generates a

salient reference that is consequential for compliance intentions. Here we focus on the negative surprise

effect because it is stronger and more consistent. In specification (4), we report estimates from

regressions where the covariates include interaction terms between the indicators for the hypothesized

extension being longer than the expectations, and the different expectations. Given the increased detail

of the analysis, we grouped the expectation-mismatch indicators for “shorter” and “much shorter”, and

for “longer” and “much longer” into only two categories (“shorter” and “longer”, respectively). The

estimates show that the negative reactions to expectation mismatches are particularly strong for those

who expected an end of the lockdown at the announced date (who are more likely to reduce

compliance), as well as for those who expected an extension by a few weeks (who are less likely to

increase compliance). The non-significant effects for those expecting the lockdown to be extended by



14
   In Appendix Table C6, we show that the results are robust to controlling for respondents’ baseline levels of
compliance, both using a binary indicator for whether the respondents reported complying with all six listed
social-isolation behaviors (as seen in Table 1, this splits the sample approximately in half), and using the number
(count) of social-isolation measures respondents report having adopted.
15
    In Appendix Table C7, we present results from specifications that include indicators for scenarios and
expectations both directly and in deviations from the scenarios. Although there is some variation in deviations for
each level of expectations, this variation is many cases limited to one or two categories, which makes the
interpretation of the coefficients on the expectations-scenario deviations indicators problematic. To mitigate the
concern, in Table C6 we present results after aggregating “shorter” and “much shorter” into one category
(“shorter”) and “longer” and “much longer” into one category (“longer”). Although the estimated coefficients are
smaller in magnitude, our main result that negative surprises lead to reduced compliance is robust to this
alternative specification.

Notes: The baseline option is “maintain current behavior”, the omitted scenario is “a few weeks”, and
the omitted wave is Wave 1. We report the estimates as relative risk ratios. Each respondent selected
one option from each of three questions, therefore there are up to three observations per individual in
the regression sample. All regressions include, among the covariates, gender, age, education, whether
the respondent lives alone or with her/his parents, marital status, whether the respondent has children,
whether s/he is currently employed, whether the respondents’ household is currently facing economic
difficulties, and whether they live in one of the “Red Zone” regions. The regressions include sampling
weights. Linearized standard errors are in parenthesis. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

5. Discussion

Announcements belong in the policymakers’ toolkit to affect citizens’ behavioral response to policies.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments heavily relied on citizens’ willingness to

comply with social-distancing measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Achieving full compliance

via strong formal enforcement (e.g. fines, geo-tracking) is not only controversial in democratic

countries but also costly to implement. Hence, persuading the public to self-isolate is a critical

mechanism.

    To maximize the effectiveness of temporary isolation efforts, authorities must manage public

expectations about when such measures will be relaxed or lifted. Our findings show that expectations

about the duration of social isolation measures influence the public’s intention to comply. Importantly,

people’s willingness to comply in case of an extension depends on how the length of this extension

compares with their own expectations. Negative surprises (i.e., lockdown measures will be in effect for

a longer time than expected) are associated with a lower willingness to increase compliance. These

results are consistent with and contribute to a growing literature that explores the role of expectations

as reference points, and the asymmetric effect of positive and negative deviations of realized scenarios

from expectations.

    One caveat of our study is that we measure intentions to comply with social-distancing restrictions,

rather than actual behavioral change due to extensions of the measures. As such, social desirability bias

could be a concern, as people may be inclined to understate the extent into which they are considering

reducing their effort, attenuating our estimates of a negative surprises. However, respondents’ identities

were unknown to the researchers, and the fact that even in the middle of the epidemic more than half of

participants admitted not complying with some of the social distancing measures suggests that social

desirability may not be a crucial concern in this context, as recent evidence shows (Jensen, 2020).

    Because the evolution of policy responses to COVID-19 in Italy resembles that of other countries,

our results may extend beyond the national boundaries and have implications for policy announcements

by other governments around the world. More broadly, our findings provide insights to public

authorities on how to manage people’s expectations in public health emergencies that require prolonged

or intermittent lockdown measures.

Appendix A: Detailed chronology of COVID-19 events and policy responses in Italy



The Government of Italy declared a six-month long state of emergency to respond to the COVID-19

outbreak on January 31, 2020, after blocking air traffic from China the day before. Cases of contagion

in the northern regions of the country rose more rapidly than in the rest of the country, which led to a

series of national and local government measures being implemented concurrently. In the most affected

region, Lombardia, the government suspended most public activities, including economic and

educational ones, in ten villages in Lombardia, with similar measures being adopted in one village in

Veneto region the following day. On February 23, further tightening of restrictions in these villages

were applied, including a prohibition to access or leave the area or hold any type of meeting for the

following fourteen days.

On the same day, several regions in the North of Italy suspended upcoming public events, and closed

schools and museums, until Sunday, March 1 for Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and Emilia

Romagna, and February 29 for Piemonte, with the provision that the deadline might change as the

“epidemiological scenarios” developed.

On February 24, other northern regions adopted similar isolation measures, such as Liguria and the

Province of Trento, followed by the central region of Marche (announcing a preliminary deadline for

March 4). On March 1, the Government issued a decree suspending public events and closing schools

until March 8 in Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia Romagna and in some provinces of Marche and Liguria.

On March 4, the closure of schools was extended to the whole country until March 15.

On March 8, the government implemented a total lockdown and banned individual movements with an

exception for work or health reasons or for necessity (e.g. purchasing of food and medicines) in the

whole of Lombardia and in selected provinces in Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Marche and Piemonte, for

a total of 14 provinces in the North of the country. The following day the government extended these

measures to the whole country. These restrictions were announced to remain in place until April 3. On

March 11th, the government also ordered the closure of most retail shops until March 25, with the

exception of grocery shops and pharmacies. This included restaurants, bars, and most personal services

(e.g. hairdressers).

                                                   ii
On March 22, the government announced that the originally scheduled end date for the closure of

commercial activities (March 11) was extended to April 3, and further suspended commercial and

industrial activities, and prohibited individual movements outside the town of domicile, with an

exception of work or health reasons or for absolute necessity.

On April 1, the government extended a total lockdown to the whole country until 13 April, and on April

10 it was prolonged until May 3.

On April 26, the government announced a starter plan for the so-called “phase 2”, that would start from

4 May. Due to the “Phase 2”, movements across regions would still be forbidden, while the ones

between municipalities would be allowed only for work and health reasons, as well as for visits to

relatives. Re-opening of manufacturing industries and construction sites are allowed too.

On May 13, the government announced schools would remain closed until September.



On May 16, the Prime Minister announced the Government plan for the easing of restrictions.

Due to the plan, most businesses could reopen, and free movement was granted to all citizens within

their Region; inter-regional travel was not permitted, unless it is for absolute necessity. Swimming

pools, gyms and then theatres and cinemas could also reopen.

On June 3, the government allowed unrestricted travel to and from EU countries and between Italy's

regions. The inter-regional and foreign travel ban remained in place until after Italy's June 2 Republic

Day holiday, avoiding any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend.

Notes: The table reports the average age of the participants belonging to various sub-categories. Red
Zone includes residents of the following regions: Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Marche, Piemonte,
Veneto. The variable “economically comfortable” is equal to 1 if respondents reported that their
household income allows them to live “comfortably” or “without concerns”, whereas “Facing economic
difficulties” is equal to 1 if the respondent replied that they “are having economic difficulties”, “make
to the end of the month with much struggling“, or “are poor and their income does not allow them to
make it to the end of the month”. “Compliance with social-isolation measures” is the number of social-
isolation measures respondents report having adopted, and “adopting all social-isolation measures is a
dummy variable indicating respondents who reported adopting all recommended measures (see
Appendix Table C2 for details). We used sampling weights to adjust these statistics.

Notes: The baseline option is “maintain current behavior”, the omitted scenario is “a few weeks”, and
the omitted wave is Wave 1. We report the estimates as relative risk ratios. Each respondent selected
one option from each of three questions, therefore there are up to three observations per individual in
the regression sample. The control variables include gender, age, education, whether the respondent
lives alone or with her/his parents, marital status, whether the respondent has children, whether s/he is
currently employed, whether the respondents’ household is currently facing economic difficulties, and
whether they live in one of the “Red Zone” regions. “Compliance” is an indicator variable for whether
respondents reported adopting all six social-isolation emasures listed in the survey (see Appendix Table
C2). The regressions include sampling weights. Linearized standard errors are in parenthesis. ***

Notes: The baseline option is “maintain current behavior”, the omitted scenario is “a few weeks”, and
the omitted wave is Wave 1. We report the estimates as relative risk ratios. Each respondent selected
one option from each of three questions, therefore there are up to three observations per individual in
the regression sample. The control variables include gender, age, education, whether the respondent
lives alone or with her/his parents, marital status, whether the respondent has children, whether s/he is
currently employed, whether the respondents’ household is currently facing economic difficulties, and
whether they live in one of the “Red Zone” regions. The regressions include sampling weights.

Notes: The chart reports the share of respondents who indicated their intention to maintain, increase or

reduce their compliance with self-solation provisions, separately by the different extension scenarios.

We used sampling weights to compute these statistics (SWG provided the weights).

Notes: “Increase self-isolation” corresponds to the intention to either “increase substantially” or
“increase somewhat” self-isolation; “Reduce self-isolation” includes the options “reduce somewhat” or
“consider not complying with restrictions”; “Maintain self-isolation” indicates intention to “continue
with current self-isolation behavior”. We used frequency weights to compute these statistics (SWG
provided the weights). The graph also reports confidence intervals and the value of the design-based F-
statistics from a test of differences in distributions.
