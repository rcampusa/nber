Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policy in a Currency Union

                                           ABSTRACT

We lay out a tractable model for fiscal and monetary policy analysis in a currency union, and analyze
its implications for the optimal design of such policies. Monetary policy is conducted by a common
central bank, which sets the interest rate for the union as a whole. Fiscal policy is implemented at
the country level, through the choice of government spending level. The model incorporates country-
specific shocks and nominal rigidities. Under our assumptions, the optimal monetary policy requires
that inflation be stabilized at the union level. On the other hand, the relinquishment of an
independent monetary policy, coupled with nominal price rigidities, generates a stabilization role for
fiscal policy, one beyond the efficient provision of public goods. Interestingly, the stabilizing role
for fiscal policy is shown to be desirable not only from the viewpoint of each individual country, but
also from that of the union as a whole. In addition, our paper offers some insights on two aspects of
policy design in currency unions: (i) the conditions for equilibrium determinacy and (ii) the effects
of exogenous government spending variations.

1       Introduction
The creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) has led to an array of new
challenges for policymakers. Those challenges have been re‡ected most visibly in the
controversies surrounding the implementation and proposed reforms of the Stability
and Growth Pact, as well as in the frequent criticisms of the interest rate policy of the
European Central Bank. From the perspective of macroeconomic theory, the issues
raised by EMU have created an urgent need for an analytical framework that would
allow us to evaluate alternative monetary and …scal policy arrangements for EMU,
or other monetary unions that may emerge in the future. In the present paper we
propose a tractable framework suitable for the analysis of …scal and monetary policy
in a currency union, and study its implications for the optimal design of such policies
from the viewpoint of the union as a whole.

     In our opinion that analytical framework has to meet several desiderata. First,
it has to incorporate some of the main features characterizing the optimizing models
with nominal rigidities that have been developed and used for monetary policy analy-
sis in recent years. Secondly, it should contain a …scal policy sector, with a purposeful
…scal authority. Thirdly, the framework should comprise many open economies, linked
by trade and …nancial ‡ows.
     It is worth noticing that while several examples of optimizing sticky price models
of the world economy can be found in the literature, tractability often requires that
they be restricted to two-country world economies.1 Yet, while such a framework
may be useful to discuss issues pertaining to the links between two large economies
(say, the U.S. and the euro area), it can hardly be viewed as a realistic description
of the incentives and constraints facing policymakers in a monetary union like EMU,
currently made up of twelve countries (each with an independent …scal authority),
but expected to accommodate as many as thirteen additional members over the next
few years. Clearly, and in contrast with models featuring two large economies, the
majority of the countries in EMU are small relative to the union as a whole. As a
result, their policy decisions, taken in isolation, are likely to have very little impact

mann (2001), Chari , Kehoe and McGrattan (2003). Only a subset of these contributions feature a
role for a …scal sector. For a recent analysis of monetary-…scal policy interaction in a two-country
setting and ‡exible exchange rates see Lombardo and Sutherland (2004). For a two-country analysis
more speci…cally tailored to a monetary union, see Ferrero (2005).

on other countries. While it should certainly be possible, as a matter of principle, to
modify some of the existing two-country models to incorporate an arbitrarily large
number of countries (i.e. an N -country model, for large N ), it is clear that such
undertaking would render the resulting model virtually intractable.
    In the present paper we propose a tractable framework for policy analysis in a
monetary union that meets the three desiderata listed above. First, we introduce
nominal rigidities by assuming a staggered price setting structure, analogous to the
one embedded in the workhorse model used for monetary policy analysis in closed
economies, which we treat as a useful benchmark. Secondly, we model the currency
union as being made up by a continuum of small open economies, subject to im-
perfectly correlated productivity shocks. This approach allows one to overcome the
tractability problems associated with “large N,” by making each economy of negli-
gible size relative to the rest of the world . Finally, we incorporate a …scal policy
sector, by allowing for country-speci…c levels of public consumption, and by having
the latter yield utility to domestic households.

    Our analysis focuses on the optimal …scal and monetary policies from the view-
point of the currency union as a whole. In particular we determine the monetary
and …scal policy rules that maximize a second-order approximation to the integral
of utilities of the representative households inhabiting the di¤erent countries in the
union.
    Two main results emerge from that analysis. First, we show that it is optimal
for the (common) monetary authority to stabilize in‡ation in the union as a whole.
Attaining that goal generally requires o¤setting the threats to price stability that
may arise from the joint impact of the …scal policies implemented at the country
level. Our …nding would thus seem to provides a rationale for a monetary policy
strategy like the one adopted by the European Central Bank, i.e. one that focuses on
attaining price stability for the union as a whole.2 It is important to stress, however,
that the optimality of that policy is conditional on the national …scal authorities
simultaneously implementing their part of the optimal policy package. The latter
implies a neutral …scal stance in the aggregate–in a sense to be made precise below–
, which poses no in‡ationary pressures on the union. As discussed below, in the
   2
    Benigno (2004) obtains a similar result in the context of a currency union model without a …scal
sector. His analysis focuses on the implications of asymmetries across countries on the de…nition of
the relevant price index to be stabilized. Our focus is instead on the interaction between monetary
and …scal policies.



                                                 2
absence of such coordinated response by the national …scal authorities, the union’s
central bank may …nd it optimal to deviate from a strict in‡ation targeting policy.
    Second, under the optimal policy arrangement, each country’s …scal authority
plays a dual role, trading-o¤ between the provision of an e¢ cient level of public goods
and the stabilization of domestic in‡ation and output gap. Interestingly, we …nd that
the existence of such a stabilizing role for …scal policy is desirable not only from the
viewpoint of each individual country, but also from that of the union as a whole.
Our simulations under the optimal policy mix of a representative economy’s response
to an idiosyncratic productivity shock show that the strength of the countercyclical
…scal response increases with the importance of nominal rigidities. Our …ndings on
this front call into question the desirability of imposing external constraints on a
currency union’s members ability to conduct countercyclical …scal policies that seek
to limit the size of the domestic output gap and in‡ation di¤erentials resulting from
idiosyncratic shocks.

    In addition to the main results just described, our paper sheds new light on two
additional aspects of policy design in currency unions, in the presence of nominal
rigidities. The …rst issue pertains to the conditions for equilibrium determinacy. As is
well known from the closed economy literature, in order to guarantee the uniqueness of
equilibrium the central bank must eventually adjust the nominal interest rates more
than one-for-one with changes in in‡ation, a property generally referred to as the
“Taylor principle.”3 When joining a currency union, a small economy relinquishes its
ability to meet the Taylor principle, since variations in its rate of in‡ation that are the
result of purely idiosyncratic shocks will have a small (in…nitesimal, in our model)
e¤ect on union-wide in‡ation, and will thus induce little or no response from the
union’s central bank. This may raise doubts regarding the possibility of guaranteeing
a unique equilibrium and avoiding unnecessary sunspot ‡uctuations in that context.
Our analysis demonstrates that the equilibrium path for country-level variables will
be uniquely determined so long as the equilibrium is determinate for the union as a
whole. This can in turn be guaranteed by having the union’s central bank follow an
interest rate rule that satis…es the usual Taylor principle.
    Secondly, we provide an analysis of the e¤ects of an exogenous change in govern-
ment spending in a small open economy belonging to a monetary union (or, equiv-
alently, under a hard peg). While in the closed economy counterpart the e¤ects of
  3
      See, e.g., Woodford (2001).



                                            3
a change in government spending are ambiguous, –since they always depend on the
endogenous response of monetary policy to the …scal intervention4 – this is not case
for a country in a currency union: in the latter case an increase in government spend-
ing always raises output and the price level in the short run, after which a period of
sustained de‡ation is needed to restore the initial terms of trade.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop the basic model. In
Section 3 we characterize the equilibrium dynamics in a currency union, from the
perspective of both a single member economy and of the union as a whole. In Section
4 we study optimal monetary and …scal policy in a currency union. We take for
granted an institutional arrangement in which monetary policy is conducted by a
common central bank, whereas …scal policy is conducted at the level of each member
country. We contrast the case of full price ‡exibility to the more realistic one involving
nominal rigidities. Section 5 concludes and suggests extensions for future work.


2       A Currency Union Model
We model the currency union as a closed system, made up of a continuum of small
open economies represented by the unit interval. Each economy, indexed by i 2
[0; 1] is of measure zero; as a result, its domestic policy decisions do not have any
impact on the rest of the union. While di¤erent economies are subject to imperfectly
correlated shocks, we assume that they share identical preferences, technology, and
market structure.5
     Next we describe in detail the problem facing households and …rms in our model
economy.

2.1     Households
Consider a typical country belonging to the monetary union (say, country i). We
assume it is inhabited by a representative in…nitely lived household seeking to maxi-
mize
                                  X1
                                       t

    4
    See, for instance, Linnemann and Schabert (2003).
    5
    In Galí and Monacelli (2005) we use a similar modelling formalism, though the focus of the
paper–the design of monetary policy by a single, small open economy with its own central bank–is
very di¤erent from the one in the present paper.

               i
   Variable CF;t  is an index of country i’s consumption of imported goods, given by:
                                             Z 1
                                   i

                                                     0

where cif;t log Cf;t
                  i
                     is, in turn, the log of an index of the quantity of goods consumed
by country i’s households that are produced in (and, hence, imported from) country
f . That index is de…ned in a way symmetric to (3), that is:
                                       Z 1                  1

                                            0

    Notice that in the speci…cation of preferences described above 2 [0; 1] is the
weight on imported goods in the utility of private consumption. Given that the weight
of the home economy in the union is in…nitesimal, a value for strictly less than one
re‡ects the presence of home bias in private consumption, implying that households
in di¤erent countries will have di¤erent consumption baskets.7 Equivalently, we can
think of as an index of openness.
    Finally, notice that parameter > 1 denotes the elasticity of substitution between
varieties produced within any given country, independently of the producing country.
    Maximization of (1) is subject to a sequence of budget constraints of the form:

     As discussed below, each country produces a continuum of di¤erentiated goods, represented by
the unit interval. Each good is produced by a separate …rm. No good is produced in more than one
country.
   7
     As a result, CPI in‡ation di¤erentials across countries may emerge, even if the law of one price
holds for each individual good.

in units of the single currency). Dt+1         is the nominal payo¤ in period t + 1 of the
portfolio held at the end of period t (and which includes shares in …rms, local and
foreign), Wti is the nominal wage, and Tti denotes lump-sum taxes.
    We assume that households have access to a complete set of contingent claims,
traded across the union. Qt;t+1 is the stochastic discount factor for one-period ahead
nominal payo¤s, common across countries. Also, implicit in the notation in (5)–which
features a single country index for each price–is the assumption that the law of one
price holds across the union.

country yields the demand functions:

                                                                            Pc;t Cti    (8)

   Combining all previous results, we can write total consumption expenditures by
country i’s households Pti Ci;t
                            i         i
                                + Pt CF;t    i
                                          = Pc;t Cti . Thus, and conditional on an optimal

                                                    6
allocation of expenditures, the period budget constraint can be rewritten as:

                     i
                    Pc;t Cti + Et fQt;t+1 Dt+1
                                           i
                                               g       Dti + Wti Nti + Tti        (9)

   In what follows we assume that the period utility takes the simple form

                                                                         N 1+'
                   U (C; N; G)      (1      ) log C +        log G               (10)
                                                                         1+'

where parameter       2 [0; 1) measures the weight attached to public consumption
(relative to private consumption).
    The remaining optimality conditions for country i’s households are thus given by:

                                                           Wti
                                 Cti (Nti )' = (1      )    i
                                                                                 (11)
                                                           Pc;t
                                                i
                                   Cti        Pc;t
                                   i          i
                                                        = Qt;t+1                 (12)
                                  Ct+1       Pc;t+1
which are assumed to hold for all period and states of nature (at t and t + 1, in the
case of (12)). Taking conditional expectations on both sides of (12) and rearranging
terms we obtain a conventional Euler equation:
                                                       i
                                          Cti        Pc;t
                            Rt Et         i          i
                                                                  =1             (13)
                                         Ct+1       Pc;t+1
where Rt = Et fQ1t;t+1 g is the gross nominal return on a riskless one-period discount
bond paying o¤ one unit of the common currency in t + 1 or, for short, the (gross)
nominal interest rate. Below we assume that the union’s central bank uses that
interest rate as its main instrument of monetary policy.
    For future reference it is useful to note that (11) and (13) can be respectively
written in log-linearized form as:

                          wti    pic;t = cit + ' nit   log(1         )

                        cit = Et fcit+1 g   (rt     Et f   i
                                                           c;t+1 g       )       (14)
where, as before, lower case letters denote the logs of the respective variables,
  log is the time discount rate, and ic;t pic;t pic;t 1 is CPI in‡ation. The above
optimality conditions hold for all i 2 [0; 1]

2.1.1    Some De…nitions and Identities

Before proceeding with our analysis, we introduce several assumptions and de…nitions,
and derive a number of identities that are extensively used below.
     We start by de…ning the bilateral terms of trade between countries i and f as
  i     Ptf
Sf;t    Pti
            , i.e., the price of country f ’s domestically produced goods in terms of
country i’s. The e¤ective terms of trade for country i are thus given by
                                           Pt
                              Sti
                                           Pti
                                                 Z       1
                                    = exp                    (pft         pit ) df
                                                 Z0 1
                                    = exp                    sif;t df
                                                     0
                                                           R1
where sif;t log Sf;t
                 i
                     . Equivalently, in logs, we have sit = 0 sif;t df .
   Notice also that the CPI and the domestic price levels are related according to:

                                      i
                                     Pc;t = Pti (Sti )
or, in logs:

                                     pic;t = pit +                  sit              (15)
    Hence, it follows that domestic in‡ation – de…ned as the rate of change in the
price index for domestically produced goods, i.e., it pit pit 1 –and CPI in‡ation
are linked according to the equation:

                                     i           i
                                     c;t   =     t   +                sit            (16)
which makes the gap between our two measures of in‡ation proportional to the percent
change in the terms of trade, with the coe¢ cient of proportionality given by the index
of openness .
    Notice that the distinction between CPI in‡ation and domestic in‡ation, while
meaningful at the level of each country, vanishes for the currency union as a whole.
                                                                    R1
Formally, integrating (15) over i 2 [0; 1] and using the fact that 0 sit di = 0, yields
the basic equality:
                                       pc;t = pt
and, hence,    c;t   =   t.


                                                  8
2.1.2      International Risk Sharing

Under the assumption of complete markets for state-contingent securities across the
union, a …rst order condition analogous to (12) will hold for the representative house-
hold in any other country, say country f :
                                              !          f
                                                                !
                                       Ctf              Pc;t
                                        f              f
                                                                    = Qt;t+1               (17)
                                       Ct+1           Pc;t+1
      Combining (12) and (17), we obtain:

                                       Cti = #i Ctf (Sf;t
                                                      i 1
                                                          )                                (18)

for all i; f 2 [0; 1] and all t, and where #i is a constant which will generally depend
on initial conditions regarding relative net asset positions. Henceforth, and without
loss of generality, we assume symmetric initial conditions (i.e., zero net foreign asset
holdings for all countries, combined with an ex-ante identical environment), in which
case we have #i = # = 1 for all i 2 [0; 1].
    Taking logs on both sides of (18) and integrating over f we obtain

                                       cit = ct + (1                ) sit                  (19)
             R1
where ct      0
                  cft df is the (log) aggregate consumption index for the union as a whole.

2.2      Optimal Allocation of Government Purchases
Country i’s public consumption index is given by
                                              Z   1                         1
                                                                1
                                 Git                  Git (j)       dj
                                              0

where Git (j) is the quantity of domestic good j purchased by the government. For
simplicity, we assume that government purchases are fully allocated to domestically
produced goods.8
   For any given level of public consumption Git (whose determination is a central
focus of the analysis below), the government allocates expenditures across goods in
  8
    For OECD countries, there is evidence of strong home bias in government procurement, over
and above that observed in private consumption . See for instance Trionfetti (2000) and Brulhart
and Trionfetti (2004).




                                                       9
order to minimize total cost. This yields the following set of government demand
schedules, analogous to those associated with private consumption:
                                            Pti (j)
                                Git (j) =                         Git
                                             Pti
    In order to focus our attention on the determination of its aggregate level and
its e¤ects (rather than the distortions induced by its …nancing), we assume that
government spending is entirely …nanced by means of lump sum taxes (accruing to
domestic residents).

2.3     Firms
2.3.1   Technology

Each country has a continuum of …rms represented by the interval [0; 1]. Each …rm
produces a di¤erentiated good with a linear technology:
                                   Yti (j) = Ait Nti (j)                            (20)
for all i; j 2 [0; 1], where Ait is a country-speci…c productivity shifter. The latter is
assumed to follow an AR(1) process (in logs):
                                   ait =    a   ait   1   + "it
where ait log Ait , a 2 [0; 1], and f"it g is white noise.
    The assumption of a linear technology implies that the real marginal cost (ex-
pressed in terms of domestic goods) is common across …rms in any given country, and
given (in logs) by
                         mcit = log(1          i
                                                 ) + wti pit ait
        i
where     is a (constant) employment subsidy whose role is discussed below.
                hR                   i 1
                    1 i         1
   Let Yti           Y
                   0 t
                           (j)    dj     denote the aggregate output index for country i.
The amount of labor hired is thus given by
                                         Z 1
                                                         Y i Zi
                                      i
                                    Nt =     Nti (j) dj = t i t                     (21)
                                          0                At
               R 1 Yti (j)
where Zti       0 Yti
                            dj. In the Appendix we show that equilibrium variations in
 i          i
zt   log Zt around the perfect foresight steady state are of second order. Thus,
and up to a …rst order approximation, the following relationship between aggregate
employment and output holds for all i 2 [0; 1]:
                                      yti = ait + nit                               (22)

                                                10
2.3.2        Price setting

Firms are assumed to set prices in a staggered fashion, as in Calvo (1983). Hence,
a measure 1        of (randomly selected) …rms sets new prices each period, with an
individual …rm’s probability of re-optimizing in any given period being independent
of the time elapsed since it last reset its price. As is well known, the optimal price-
setting strategy for the typical …rm resetting its price in period t can be approximated
by the (log-linear) rule:9

                                                          X
                                                          1
                           pit   =       + (1         )         (     )k Et fmcit+k + pit+k g                                        (23)
                                                          k=0

where      pit
          denotes the (log) of newly set prices in country i (same for all …rms reop-
timizing), and      log 1 is the (log) of the optimal markup in the corresponding
‡exible price economy (or, equivalently, the markup prevailing in a zero in‡ation
steady state).

    The approximation is carried out around a zero in‡ation steady state. See the appendix in Galí
and Monacelli (2005) for a derivation in the context of a model with an identical price-setting block.

                                                                11
condition for country i:
                                              Yti = Cti (Sti ) + Git                                      (25)
   A log-linear …rst order approximation of that market clearing condition around a
(symmetric) steady state is given by:10

                                  ybti = (1              cit +
                                                      ) (b             sit ) +     gbti                   (26)
where a " b " symbol is used to denote log deviations of a variable from its steady
                                             G
                  bt xt x, and where
state value, e.g. x                          Y
                                               denotes the steady state government
spending share.
    Using (19) and the terms of trade de…nition, we can rewrite (26) as follows:

                         ybti =         gbti + (1          )b
                                                            ct      (1         ) (pit     pt )            (27)
    The previous equation establishes that domestic output is positively related to
government spending, union-wide consumption (which is an index for the strength of
foreign demand), and inversely related to domestic prices (relative to average prices
in the union).

   Notice that we can integrate (27) over i 2 [0; 1] in order to obtain the union-wide
goods market clearing condition:

                                ybt = gbt + (1      )bct                          (28)
             R1                R  1 i
where ybt      ybi di, and gbt
             0 t
                                   gb di.
                                 0 t
   Similarly, integrating (14) over i     [0; 1] and combining the resulting di¤erence
equation with (28), yields the following union-wide dynamic IS equation:

               ybt = Et fb
                         yt+1 g          (1         )(rt        Et f   t+1 g       )       Et f gbt+1 g   (29)
            R1
where t      0 i;t
                   di. We can solve the previous equation forward and, under the
assumption that limT !1 Et fb
                            gt+T g = limT !1 Et fb
                                                 yt+T g = 0 , write it in level form as:

                                                          X
                                                          1
                      ybt =       gbt      (1         )          Et frt+k         t+k+1          g
                                                          k=0

  10
     The derivation makes use of a …rst order Taylor expansion of log(Yti Git ), as shown in the
Appendix. We also use the fact that in a symmetric steady state S i = 1 (and hence si = 0) for all
i 2 [0; 1].


                                                            12
    Hence, we see that ‡uctuations in union-wide output will result from variations
in union-wide government spending and expected long-term rates, with the weight
attached to both factors being positively and negatively related, respectively, to the
steady state share of government spending in output.

3.2     The Supply Side: Marginal Cost and In‡ation Dynamics
Given our assumption of price setting à la Calvo, the dynamics of domestic in‡ation in
terms of real marginal cost in each individual country are described by the di¤erence
equation
                                i
                                t =                  c it
                                      Et f it+1 g + mc                            (30)
where mcc it = mcit + denotes the (log) deviation of real marginal cost from its steady
                (1   )(1 ) 11
state, and                .
    Using some of the previous results, we can further derive the following expression
for marginal cost:

                mcit = wti          pit   ait    log(1                 i
                                                                           )
                       = (wti        pic;t ) + (pic;t         pit )        ait          log(1       i
                                                                                                        )
                       = cit + ' nit +          sit          ait       log(1              i
                                                                                              )   log(1     )   (31)

   We can now combine (31) with (22) and (26) to obtain an expression for marginal
cost as a function of output and government spending, all expressed in deviations
from steady state (and up to a …rst order approximation):
                                     1
                      c it =
                      mc                  +'          ybti                       gbti     (1 + ') ait           (32)
                                1                                  1
    The intuition for the negative relationship between marginal cost and government
spending is easy to grasp: given output, an increase in government spending crowds
out domestic consumption and/or generates a real appreciation, both of which tend
to reduce real marginal cost through their negative e¤ect on the product wage.12
In addition, we see that the elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to output
is increasing in the government share . The reason is simple: in response to a
  11
     Notice that under our assumptions the fact that each individual economy is open does not a¤ect
the form of the equation relating domestic in‡ation to real marginal cost. See Galí and Monacelli
(2005) for further discussion and a formal derivation.
  12
     Notice that the corresponding elasticity is increasing in , since the greater the weight of gov-
ernment spending in aggregate demand the larger will be the percent decline in consumption needed
to keep output constant.

                                                        13
given percent increase in output, and given an unchanged current level of current
government spending gbti and technology ait , a larger is associated with a larger
percent increase in consumption and/or the terms of trade. As a result, a larger
increase in the product wage and, hence, marginal cost will obtain.
    Combining (30) and (32) we can derive a version of the new Keynesian Phillips
curve (NKPC), applying to each economy in the union:

            i                  i               1
            t   =       Et f   t+1 g   +           +'   ybti       gbti   (1 + ') ait   (33)
                                           1                   1
   Notice also that by integrating the previous equation over i [0; 1] we can obtain
the corresponding new Keynesian Phillips curve for the union as a whole:
                                               1
           t    =       Et f   t+1 g   +           +'   ybt        gbt    (1 + ') at    (34)
                                           1                   1
           R1
where at        0
                    ait di.

    We have now derived the set of log-linear equilibrium conditions for in‡ation and
output in each individual country (summarized by (27), and (33)), as well as for the
union as a whole (given by (29) and (34)), as a function of government spending
(local and union-wide) and the common interest rate. Given the equilibrium path
of those variable, one can use (14) (or, equivalently, (12)) to back out equilibrium
consumption in each country.

   Next we turn to the analysis of some properties of that equilibrium, before we
plunge into the central question of optimal policy design. We start with a brief (but
important) digression on the conditions for equilibrium determinacy in a currency
union.

3.3    Equilibrium Determinacy in the Currency Union: A Di-
       gression
We start our digression by noticing that the linearized equilibrium dynamics for the
currency union as a whole are analogous to those in the baseline, closed economy
new Keynesian model. In particular, and given an exogenous stationary process
for fgt ; at g, the equilibrium dynamics for union-wide in‡ation t and output ybt ,
are described by equations (29) and (34). In order "to close the model" those two
equations should be supplemented with an additional equation describing how the
central bank sets the interest rate rt .

                                                   14
   As is well known from the closed-economy literature, to the extent that the interest
rate rule adopted by the central bank satis…es the so-called “Taylor principle,” the
equilibrium path for output and in‡ation is uniquely pinned down, as a function of
the exogenous shocks (see Bullard and Mitra (2001), Woodford (2001)).
   Consider, for the sake of concreteness, the following interest rate rule for the
union’s central bank:
                           rt = +       t + a at + g g  bt                         (35)
where      is assumed to be non-negative. Under that speci…cation of monetary policy,
a straightforward application of the …ndings of Bullard and Mitra (2001) to our model,
implies that the equilibrium for the union will be uniquely determined if and only if
    > 1, i.e., if the central bank adjusts the short-term nominal rate more than one-
for-one in response to variations in union-wide in‡ation t .13 Given the equilibrium
values for ybt , one can easily back out aggregate consumption b ct (using (28)), as well
as other variables of interest.
    Suppose that the interest rate rule followed by the union’s central bank guarantees
a unique equilibrium for union-wide variables. What can we say about the uniqueness
of equilibrium in each of the member countries?
    Notice that for each individual country’s economy one can also derive conditions
analogous to the closed economy. The corresponding in‡ation equation is already
given by (33). The corresponding dynamic IS equation can be easily derived by
combining (26) with (14) and (16), which yields

                ybti = Et fbi
                           yt+1 g   (1      )(rt    Et f   i
                                                           t+1 g    )            i
                                                                          Et f gbt+1 g            (36)
    While the previous equations take the form of the analogous conditions for the
standard closed economy model, there exists an important di¤erence: even if the
union’s central bank follows an interest rule satisfying the Taylor principle, its setting
of the interest rate rt no longer responds systematically to domestic in‡ation it (or
domestic output ybti , for that matter), since the latter has only an in…nitesimal weight
in aggregate in‡ation t (or in ybt , in the case of output).14 Hence, a straightforward
application of the Taylor principle logic seems to imply that equilibrium should indeed
  13
     In Section 4 we show that the optimal monetary policy in the currency union can be implemented
by a policy of this form, with a speci…c choice of coe¢ cients a and g , but an arbitrary          > 1.
  14
     Even if fundamental shocks are highly correlated across countries (thus allowing for potentially
high correlation between it and t ), it is still the case that rt will not respond to an eventual change
in it that is driven by revisions in expectations unrelated to economic fundamentals, the source of
potential indeterminacy.


                                                   15
be indeterminate in each individual economy, since from the latter’s point of view rt
can be viewed as exogenous. That logic, nevertheless, is incorrect, for it fails to take
into account an additional condition -given by equation (27)- that must be satis…ed in
equilibrium for each individual economy, and which we repeat here for convenience:

                            ybti =       gbti + (1        )b
                                                           ct         (1     )(pit      pt )

    That condition establishes a link between the levels of domestic output and do-
mestic prices (with the remaining variables being exogenous) which is absent in the
closed economy benchmark model. That link is a consequence of the e¤ects of the
terms of trade on demand, combined with the one-to-one mapping between domes-
tic prices and the terms of trade (given pt ) which results from the assumption of a
common currency (and, hence, a constant exchange rate). Roughly speaking, the
adoption of a hard peg against a currency of a country (or a currency union) whose
price level is uniquely pinned down by its own monetary regime, acts as a substitute
for the adoption of an autonomous monetary policy satisfying the Taylor principle.
    The previous point can be demonstrated quite easily. First note that we can
combine (27) and (28) to yield:

                            ybti     ybt =        gti
                                                 (b       gbt )       (1     )(pit      pt )   (37)

Second, subtracting (34) from (33) and combining the resulting expression with (37)
allows us to derive, after some straightforward algebra, the following di¤erence equa-
tion for country i’s terms of trade, sit pt pit ,

                                   sit = ! sit    1   + ! Et fsit+1 g + ! uit                  (38)

                1
where ! 1+ + [1+'(1   )]
                         2 [0; 1+1 ) and uit = ' (bgti gbt ) + (1 + ')(ait at )
   The above di¤erence equation (38) has a unique stationary solution, of the form:

                                                           X
                                                           1
                                   sit   =   sit 1    +           (    )k Et fuit+k g          (39)
                                                           k=0

where          2!
                      2 (0; 1).
    Given the equilibrium path for the terms of trade fsit g, determined by (39), we
can back out the equilibrium levels of domestic prices and output using the de…nition
of the terms of trade and (37).

3.4    The E¤ects of Domestic Government Spending Shocks
While not the focus of the present paper it is useful to consider the e¤ects of an
exogenous change in government spending, in order to understand the mechanisms
that may make it a useful policy tool in the absence of an autonomous monetary
policy.
    For concreteness, let us assume that government spending follows a exogenous
AR(1) process
                                 gbti = g gbti 1 + "ig;t
    Without loss of generality, we assume that the union’s economy is in a perfect
foresight, zero in‡ation steady state and we set pt = gbt = at = ait = 0 for all t. Under
the previous assumptions, we have ut =       ' gbti . It then follows from (39) that

                                    pit =   pit   1   +   g   gbti                      (40)

where g 1 ' > 0.
                   g
    Hence, a positive shock to domestic government spending leads to a persistent
rise in the domestic price level, though the latter eventually returns to its original
level (given stationarity of gbti ). Equivalently, domestic in‡ation initially increases, but
eventually turns negative. How long in‡ation remains positive after the shock will
depend on both and g .
    Given the response of domestic prices fdpi+k g1   k=0 , the e¤ect of on domestic output
on impact and over time can be derived from equation (27):

                                 i          k
                               db
                                y+k =       g     (1          ) dpi+k

   Notice that the e¤ect on impact is given by

                                    i

 y+0   = , in other words, output increases one for one with government spending,
since there is no crowding out e¤ect resulting from higher domestic prices (we have
a unit "level" multiplier). When prices are not completely sticky ( > 0) the price
level rises, thus dampening the direct e¤ect of government spending on output. Hence,

     Notice that the sign and qualitative pattern of the economy’s response to a change
in government spending are unambiguous when the country belongs to a currency
union, as in the analysis above. This is in contrast to a closed economy or an open
economy with autonomous monetary policy, since in those cases the e¤ects of a …scal
shock depend on the endogenous response of monetary policy to the …scal interven-
tion.16
     Figure 1 displays the e¤ects on output, the output gap, the domestic price level
and in‡ation of a one percent rise in government spending for alternative values of
the price stickiness parameter #. The output gap is de…ned here as the deviation
of output from its level under fully ‡exible prices (and given by equation (32) for
 c it = 0). Hence we see that a rise in government spending leads to a terms of
mc
trade appreciation (rise in the price level) and a rise in output. The latter e¤ect is
stronger when prices are more rigid. When prices are ‡exible (and the output gap
is by de…nition zero), the e¤ect on output is dampened but never to such an extent
that the output multiplier turns negative.


4      Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy Design
Next we derive and characterize the optimal …scal-monetary regime in the currency
union. The institutional constraints are as follows. Monetary policy is conducted in a
centralized fashion by a common central bank, which sets the short-term nominal rate
rt . Fiscal policy is conducted by each country’s …scal authority, which determines
the steady state level of government spending Gi , a constant employment subsidy i
and–most importantly, given our focus–follows a rule describing short term variations
in government spending fb  gti g in response to shocks of di¤erent nature.
     We seek to derive the monetary and …scal policy rules that maximize the welfare
of the union as a whole, given those assumed institutional constraints. We start
by analyzing the social planner’s problem. Then we show under what conditions
the e¢ cient allocation can be supported as an equilibrium, under the assumption of
  15
   That crowding e¤ect is never strong enough to generate a negative response of output. In fact,
under ‡exible prices (constant markup), equation (32) reduces to

                                           yti =    gti
                              @
where       1+'(1   ) > 0 and @ > 0.

‡exible prices. Finally, we derive the optimal (second-best) policies in the presence
of nominal rigidities.

4.1       The Social Planner’s Problem
The union’s optimal allocation in any given period can be described as the solution
to the following social planner’s problem:
                                    Z 1
                               max      U (Cti ; Nti ; Git ) di
                                              0

subject to the technological and resource constraints

                                            Yti = Ait Nti
                                                 Z 1
                                       i   i          f
                                     Yt = Ci;t +     Ci;t df + Git                                      (41)
                                                         0

for all i 2 [0; 1]. Notice that the previous constraints already embed the optimal
condition whereby the di¤erent good types in any given country should be produced
and consumed in identical quantities.17
    Under our speci…cation of preferences, the optimality conditions for the social
planner’s problem are:
                                                               Z       1
                       (Nti )'   (1       )(1        )                     (1          )
                           i
                               =           i
                                                         =                                 df =
                        At                Ci;t                     0
                                                                                 f
                                                                                Ci;t              Git
for all i 2 [0; 1]. In words, the marginal loss of utility for a household in country i
of producing an additional unit of the composite good, given by (Nti )' =Ait , must be
equal, at the margin, to the utility gain resulting from any of the three possible uses
of that additional output: consumption by domestic households, consumption by all
households in the union, and domestic government spending.
    Using the resource constraint (41), and the fact that Yti = Ait Nti , we can guess
and verify that the solution to the social planner’s problem is given by:

                                                   Nti = 1                                              (42)

                                                  Yti = Ait                                             (43)
                                        i
                                       Ci;t = (1             )(1            ) Ait                       (44)
 17
      That condition in turn implies that Zti = 1 in (21), for all i 2 [0; 1]


                                                     19
                                         f
                                        Ci;t = (1                          ) Ait                                  (45)
                                                  Git =                   Ait                                     (46)
for all i; f 2 [0; 1], and all t.
    Combining (44) and (45), together with de…nition of country i’s total consumption
index (2), we can derive an expression for the latter under the optimal allocation (in
logs):                                   Z                            1
                       cit   = (1       )   ait   +                       aft df + log(1                      )
                                                                  0
or, in levels,
                                    Cti = (1              ) (Ait )1                 (At )
                R1
where At exp 0 aft df is an index of union-wide productivity.
   Aggregating over countries, we obtain the corresponding optimal allocation for
the union as a whole:
                                    Y t = At
                                            Ct = (1                        ) At
                                                  Gt =                    At

4.2     Decentralization of the E¢ cient Allocation under Flexi-
        ble Prices
Before we turn to the interesting case of optimal policy in the presence of nominal
rigidities, it is useful to examine the case of ‡exible prices, since it constitutes a useful
benchmark as shown below.
    We start by showing how, under certain conditions, the union-wide optimal allo-
cation derived above can be supported as an equilibrium in the presence of ‡exible
prices. Letting variables with an upper bar denote their values in a ‡exible price
equilibrium we have
                              1                   i
                        1           = M Ct
                                                          i
                                         (1                   )            i        i        i
                                    =                                 C t (N t )' (S t )
                                        Ait (1                    )
                                                          i                                  i            i
                                       (1                     )        i           i        Yt           Gt
                                    =                                 Ct        (N t )'              i
                                      Ait (1                      )                              Ct
                                                      i
                                        1                                       i       i        i
                                    =                     (1              (Gt =Y t )) (N t )1+'
                                        1

                                                              20
    In order for the equilibrium allocation under ‡exible prices to correspond to the
union’s socially optimal allocation the following conditions must be satis…ed for all
i 2 [0; 1] and t. First, the subsidy i must be set at a level

                                                     i        1
                                                         =                                      (47)

       Secondly, government spending must be set according to the rule18
                                                 i
                                             Gt =                 Ait                           (48)

    If both conditions are satis…ed for all i 2 [0; 1], the ‡exible price equilibrium will
yield the level of employment and output in each country that is optimal from the
                             i             i
union’s perspective, i.e., Y t = Ait and N t = 1, for all i 2 [0; 1], and all t.19 It is easy
to check that the remaining optimality conditions will also be satis…ed as a result of
households’optimization.
    Notice that in the economy with ‡exible prices, the lack of an autonomous mon-
etary policy is of no consequence for the attainment of the optimal allocation, for
monetary policy is neutral in that environment (it can only in‡uence the path of
prices). As a result, local …scal authorities can focus exclusively on the e¢ cient
provision of public consumption goods, according to rule (48) (shadowing the cen-
tral planner’s decisions on that front). In our example economy that rule implies a
                                         i    i
constant government spending share Gt =Y t = = for all t.
    While the level of prices in the union and in each individual country is determined
by the monetary policy regime, each country’s terms of trade as well as the in‡ation
di¤erentials vis a vis the union are fully determined by real factors in the present
scenario. More speci…cally, note that the path for the terms of trade that will support
the e¢ cient allocation is given by:
                                     i       i                1
                                   S t = (C t =C t ) 1              = Ait =At                   (49)

for all i 2 [0; 1], and all t. Given the de…nition of the terms of trade it follows that
the in‡ation di¤erential will be inversely proportional to the productivity growth
  18                   i       i
      Or, equivalently, Gt = Y t
   19
      In contrast with Galí and Monacelli (2005), where the optimal allocation problem is analyzed
from the viewpoint of a small open economy, here the choice of the subsidy is not a¤ected by any
desire to in‡uence the terms of trade in a country’s favor. The reason is simple: that goal cannot be
attained by all countries simultaneously, and hence it serves no purpose when trying to decentralize
the solution to the union’s social planner problem. As a result the only role played by the subsidy
is to o¤set …rms’market power.

                                                         21
di¤erential:

                                t     t   =   ( ait   at )



    In the following section we assume that (47) is satis…ed, so that the only remaining
non-o¤set distortion is the presence of nominal rigidities. Our aim is to determine
the optimal design of policy in such an environment, when there is a single monetary
policy but decentralized …scal policies.

4.3    Optimal Policy Design in the Presence of Nominal Rigidi-
       ties
In the presence of nominal rigidities it will generally be impossible for a monetary
union to attain the optimal allocation. The reasons are well understood. First,
staggered price setting implies that the level of employment and output within each
country may di¤er from the e¢ cient one at any point in time, both in the aggregate
and across sectors (i.e., good types). This will be true even if the distortion associ-
ated with market power is o¤set by means of a subsidy, as discussed above. Secondly,
the sluggish adjustment of prices, combined with the impossibility of nominal ex-
change rate adjustments (inherent to a currency union), implies that the changes in
terms of trade that would be required to support the optimal allocation cannot occur
instantaneously.
    As shown in Galí and Monacelli (2005) in the context of a related model, when
each individual country has its own currency and an autonomous monetary policy (as
opposed to the monetary union case considered here), a monetary policy that succeeds
in stabilizing the domestic price level in each country would replicate the ‡exible price
equilibrium and, hence, the optimal allocation. Under a currency union, however, and
to the extent that di¤erent countries experience asymmetric shocks leading to dis-
crepancies among their natural interest rates, the lack of a country-speci…c monetary
policy (i.e., an independent interest rate setting) makes it impossible to attain that
outcome. As a result, the union as a whole will experience some deviations from the
optimal allocation and, accordingly, some welfare losses. What is the monetary/…scal
policy mix that will minimize those losses? That is the question we address next.




                                              22
4.4     Union Members’Tradeo¤s
Let y it = ait and g it = log + ait denote the (logs) of output and government spending
in country i associated with the union-wide e¢ cient allocation (or equivalently, with
the ‡exible price equilibrium under an optimal policy). We use the notation yeti and
geti to denote the log deviations of country i’s output and government spending from
those benchmark levels, i.e., yeti yti y it and geti gti g it , which we henceforth refer
to as country i’s output gap and government spending gap, respectively.
      It will prove convenient to de…ne the following measure of the …scal stance:

                                     feti           geti    yeti
                                             = (gti             yti )      log

which we henceforth refer as the …scal gap.20
    Using (32), together with the fact that y it y i = g it g i = ait (where variables
without time subscripts denote steady state values), we can derive the following
relationship between the real marginal cost, and the output and …scal gaps:
                                                  1

where we have imposed an optimal steady state government spending share ( = ).
   We can combine the previous expression with (30) to obtain a version of the new
Keynesian Phillips curve for each union member, expressing domestic in‡ation in
terms of the corresponding output and …scal gaps:

   In addition we can combine (27), (28) and (49), to obtain an equation determining
the change in the output gap di¤erential as a function of the di¤erentials in …scal gap
changes, in‡ation and productivity growth:

                yeti    yet =     ( feti   fet ) [( it            i
                                                         t ) + ( at    at )]      (51)
                           1
    The previous two equations describe the evolution of country i’s output gap and
price level as a function of the domestic …scal gap, given the productivity di¤erential
   Strictly speaking, g it and, hence, geti are only well de…ned if
  20
                                                                                           > 0, which we assume for the
remainder of this section.

                                                           23
and the union wide …scal and output gaps. They also make clear the nature of the
tradeo¤s facing policymakers in the union. To illustrate those tradeo¤s, assume that
yet = fet = pt = 0. Consider equation (50), describing the evolution of the price level
in country i. As in the familiar closed economy benchmark, that equation implies
that prices could be fully stabilized by closing the output and …scal gaps at all times,
thus trying to replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium allocation. Yet, (51) makes clear
that this will not be feasible in the presence of asymmetric productivity shocks since,
in that case, closing the output gap (without creating a …scal gap) requires that the
terms of trade and, hence, domestic prices, adjust.

4.5    Union-Wide Tradeo¤s
The evolution of in‡ation, the output gap, and the …scal gap for the currency union is
described by two aggregate equilibrium relationships familiar from the closed economy
case. Thus, by integrating (50), we can derive an equation describing union-wide
in‡ation in terms of the corresponding gaps:


                      t   =    Et f   t+1 g               fet
                                              + (1 + ') yet                (52)
                                                   1
   The union’s output gap is determined by a dynamic IS-type equation, which we
can derive using (29):


       yet   = Et fe
                   yt+1 g     (1       )(rt      Et f   t+1 g       rrt )    Et f get+1 g             (53)
             =       fet      (rt     Et f    t+1 g     rrt ) + Et fe
                                                                    yt+1 g              Et ffet+1 g
               1                                                               1
where rrt is the union’s natural rate of interest, given by

                  rrt =        + (1          ) 1 (Et f y t+1 g          Et f g t+1 g)
                       =       + Et f y t+1 g
                       =       + Et f at+1 g

    Notice that, to the extent that the union’s aggregate …scal gap fet remains stable
at zero, there is no tradeo¤ between stabilization of the output gap and in‡ation for
the union as a whole. In that case the outcome yet = et = 0 could be easily attained
by having the central bank follow a rule of the sort

                                        rt = rrt +              t


                                                  24
    On the other hand, if the aggregated decisions of the local …scal authorities lead
to ‡uctuations in the union-wide …scal gap, the job of the single central bank is made
considerably more di¢ cult. To illustrate this formally, notice that we can integrate
(53) and combine it with (52) to yield:

                                           '         X
                                                     1

      t   =       Et f   t+1 g     +           fet         Et (rt+k          t+k+1       rrt+k )
                                       1             k=0

                  '      X
                         1                                         X
                                                                   1
          =                        k
                                       Et ffet+k g   (1        )         k
                                                                             Et f(rt+k          t+k+1   rrt+k )g
              1          k=0                                       k=0

   Notice that a positive union-wide …scal gap, current and/or anticipated, will gen-
erate upward pressure on current in‡ation. That pressure can only be partly o¤set
by having the central bank run a tighter monetary policy, which would require rais-
ing current and/or future interest rates above their natural level, thus dampening
the expansionary impact of members’ …scal policies on the union’s output gap and
in‡ation. Below we show that this is indeed the sort of rule that the union’s central
bank should adopt, as part of the optimal monetary-…scal policy mix for the union.

4.6       The Optimal Policy Problem
What is the path for the …scal gap, for each country and in the aggregate, that is
consistent with maximization of the union’s welfare? What are the resulting optimal
output gap and price level paths for the union consistent with that optimal choice?
    In the Appendix we show that a second order approximation to the sum of utilities
of union households about an e¢ cient steady state takes the form:

                             Z
              1X

              2 t=0            0                                             1

where tips denotes terms that are independent of policy.
   We de…ne the optimal policy mix for the currency union as the set of rules for the
…scal gaps ffeti g for all i 2 [0; 1] and the common interest rate frt g, along with with
the associated second best outcomes it , yeti for all t, that maximize (54), subject to
(50), (51), and the "aggregation" constraints

                    t =        t di ;

                                                          25
    The optimal policy problem can be solved in two stages. First, we determine
the processes f it , yeti , feti g, for all i 2 [0; 1]; that maximize (54) subject to (50), (51)
and (55). Secondly, given the solution to that …rst-stage problem, we determine the
interest rate rule that will support the implied paths for the union-wide in‡ation,
output gap and …scal gap, using (53).
    The optimality conditions associated with the …rst-stage problem are given by:
                                          i                    i                           i

(discounted) Lagrange multipliers associated with constraints in (50), (51) and (55),
and i ; 1 = 0.
    Integrating (56) over i 2 [0; 1], combining the resulting equation with (59), we
obtain:                                  Z                                 1

   Similarly, integrating (57) over i 2 [0; 1], combining the resulting equation with
(60), we obtain:                       Z 1

for t = 0; 1; 2; :::
    Integrating (58) over i 2 [0; 1], combining the resulting equation with (61) and

                                                                               26
   Notice that (62) and (63), together with the union-wide equilibrium conditions
(52) and (53), imply that the equilibrium under the optimal policy will satisfy

                                       t   = yet = fet = 0                                (64)

for all t. This is one of the central results emerging from our analysis. In words, we
can state it as follows: the combined monetary-…scal policy mix must be such that,
at the union level, in‡ation, the output gap and the …scal gap remain at a constant
(zero) value, at all times. That condition requires, in turn, that the equilibrium
interest rate rt equals the union-wide natural rate rrt at all times. As argued above,
and conditional on fet = 0 for all t, the union’s central bank can implement the
desired outcome by adopting a policy rule of the form:

                                      rt = rrt +        t




    What are the paths of in‡ation and the output gap for each union member asso-
ciated with the optimal policy? What …scal policy will support those paths?
    Combining (57) and (58), and noticing that (60) and (61) imply 1  y;t + f;t = 0,
we obtain:
                             (1 + ') yeti + feti = ' i ;t                       (65)
    In this second best environment, as long as prices are less than fully ‡exible, we
have i ;t > 0. Hence (65) immediately implies that, unlike the union-wide policy
prescription (64), setting feti = yeti = 0 for each member country i cannot be an
equilibrium under the optimal policy.
    To fully characterize the equilibrium dynamics, we notice that the aggregate mul-
                R1 i
tiplier   ;t = 0    y;t di (from (59)) must evolve exogenously from the viewpoint of
the single member country. By substituting (59), (60) and (61) into (56), (57) and
(58), we de…ne a rational
                  n            expectationsoequilibrium under commitment in country i as

policy responses by means of some simulations.

4.6.1    Dynamic Simulations

In this section we illustrate the equilibrium behavior of the prototype member econ-
omy under the commitment policy described above. We resort to a series of dynamic

                                               27
simulations, and adopt the following benchmark parameterization. We assume ' = 3,
which implies a labor supply elasticity of 31 . We assume a steady-state markup
   = 1:2, which implies that , the elasticity of substitution between di¤erentiated
goods (of the same origin), is 6. Parameter is set to a benchmark value of 0:75
(a value consistent with an average period of one year between price adjustments),
although below we report results of sensitivity analysis on this parameter. We assume
  = 0:99, which implies a riskless annual return of about 4 percent in the steady state.
As for the …scal sector, we parameterize the steady state share of government spend-
ing in output as = = 0:25, roughly the average of government …nal consumption
for the euro zone.
    We follow the real business cycle literature (King and Rebelo (1999)) and assume
the following autoregressive process for labor productivity in country i:

                                    ait = 0:95 ait   1   + "ai;t
     Figure 2 displays impulse responses to a one percent (asymmetric) rise in produc-
tivity in the domestic economy for alternative values of the price stickiness parameter
  . In particular, = 0 represents the limiting case of full (domestic) price ‡exibility.
The …gure is representative of the main result of the paper.
     Consider …rst the case of full price ‡exibility ( = 0). In that case there is no loss of
e¢ ciency associated with in‡ation, since the latter no longer creates any relative price
distortions. Hence, as shown in the …gure, it is optimal to fully close the …scal gap and
the output gap, in response to asymmetric movements in productivity.21 . As a result,
it is optimal to have the union member fully absorb the rise in productivity through
an adjustment in the terms of trade brought about by a change in the domestic price
level, while maintaining output and government spending at their …rst-best levels.
     To the extent that price stickiness is present ( > 0), there are welfare losses associ-
ated with departures from price stability, in addition to those stemming from nonzero
output and …scal gaps. However -as discussed above- the ‡exible price/e¢ cient al-
location is not feasible under the currency union regime. In particular, the rise in
productivity must be absorbed only via a gradual and persistent fall in the price
level, with the consequent relative price distortions. As a result, the optimal policy
mix requires expanding the …scal gap to bring about the rise in demand necessary
to accommodate the desired expansion in output, thus smoothing the adjustment
  21
   In fact, under price ‡exibility, equation (50) does not act as a constraint on the evolution of
domestic prices. Hence, optimal policy in this case must satisfy equation (65) with i ;t = 0.

of prices over time. To see that formally, notice that in the equilibrium under the
optimal policy equation (51) simpli…es to:

                               yeti       feti + pit =   ait
                                                         e
                                      1
where eait ait at (and where, without loss of generality, we have normalized pt = 0).
Hence, to the extent that the price level reacts gradually, the rise in productivity will
be absorbed via a combination of a fall in the output gap and a rise in the …scal gap.
In general, the local …scal authority is required to trade-o¤ movements in in‡ation on
the one hand with movements in the output and …scal gap on the other. The higher
the degree of price rigidity, the larger the implied ‡uctuations of both gaps under the
optimal policy.
    Notice that, under our benchmark parameterization, welfare losses from any given
output gap variation are of an order of magnitude larger than the ones implied by the
same variation in the …scal gap. This explains why in Figure 2 the implied volatility
of the …scal gap is larger than the one in the output gap. The optimal balance
between the two variables will in general depend on the relative weights attached to
the quadratic terms in yeti and feti in the welfare loss function (54). These weights
depend in turn on parameters ' and . The lower the elasticity of labor supply (i.e.,
the larger ') the smaller the adjustment in the output gap (relative to the …scal gap),
whereas the larger (the share of government spending in the optimal steady state)
the lower the adjustment brought about via the …scal gap (relative to the output
gap).


5    Conclusions
We have developed a tractable multicountry framework suitable for monetary and
…scal policy analysis in a currency union. As an application of the model, we have
determined the optimal monetary-…scal policy mix in the presence of idiosyncratic
shocks to productivity. Given our assumed nominal rigidities, the presence of those
shocks, combined with the impossibility of resorting to nominal exchange rate ad-
justments, induces an ine¢ cient response of the terms of trade that generates room
for …scal policy as stabilization tool. In particular, the union-wide optimal policy
calls for variations in local government spending that go beyond the mere e¢ cient
provision of public goods. On the other hand, our …ndings suggest that the union’s
central bank should stick to a policy that aims to stabilize the price level in the union

                                           29
as a whole, thus resisting any temptation to accommodate the in‡ationary pressures
that may arise from the aggregation of local …scal policies.
    Our framework calls for extensions on a series of grounds. In order to meet
our self-imposed tractability requirement, we restrict ourselves to less-than-general
parametric speci…cations for utility and technology, and ignore capital accumulation.
Furthermore, our model ignores other aspects that are likely to be relevant for the
design of optimal policies. Missing elements include, among others, the presence of
sticky wages (along with sticky prices), the need to rely on distortionary taxes, the
e¤ects of government debt policies, and the likely existence of non-fully Ricardian
behavior on the part of households. Finally, our framework assumes the presence of
complete international …nancial markets. By relaxing the assumption of perfect risk-
sharing, we could generate a complementary role for …scal policy as a cross-country
insurance tool. The emergence of a potential con‡ict between the latter and the
stabilization role described in the present paper is likely to constitute an interesting
line worth exploring in future research. We plan to pursue some of those extensions
in future work.

   In order to express utility in terms of in‡ation we make use of the following
Lemma:
                1
                    P1          t               P1     t

   Proof: see appendix 2.


   Now we can write the discounted sum of utilities across households as:

   Appendix 2: Proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2

   Lemma 1: zt '         2
                                 varj fpt (j)g
   Proof: let pbt (j)            pt (j)              pt . Notice that,

                                             1
                        Pt (j)
                                                      = exp [(1             ) pbt (j)]
                         Pt
                                                                                             (1        )2
                                                      ' 1 + (1              ) pbt (j) +                     pbt (j)2
                                                                                                  2
                                                                                                      R1    Pt (i)
                                                                                                                       1
    Furthermore, from the de…nition of Pt , we have 1 =                                               0      Pt
                                                                                                                           di. Hence, it
follows that
                                       (    1)
                         Ej fb
                             pt (j)g =             pt (j)2 g

                                                                                      Pt (j)
   In addition, a second order approximation to                                        Pt
                                                                                                      , yields:

                                                                                         2
                                             Pt (j)
                                                              '1            pbt (j) +         pbt (j)2
                                              Pt                                         2

   Combining the two previous results, it follows that

                                  Z      1
                                                 Pt (j)
                                                                  di = 1 +                  pt (j)2 g
                                                                                        Ej fb
                                     0            Pt                              2
                                                                       = 1+             varj fpt (j)g
                                                                                  2
from which it follows that zt '                        2
                                                            varj fpt (j)g

   Lemma 2:            t=0           zt =        2          t=0        t

  Proof: we make use of the following property of the Calvo model, as shown in
Woodford (2001, NBER WP8071):

                                             X

                                                                                1X
                                                                                 1
                                                       t                                      t   2
                                                           varj fpt (j)g =                        t
                                             t=0                                   t=0

            (1   )(1         )
where                            , as in the text. The desired result follows trivially from Lemma
1.
