          Fluctuations of business activity in the United States clearly
have their monetary and financial side, but these aspects of U.S.
economic fluctuations exhibit few quantitative regularities that have
persisted unchanged across spans of tine over which the nation's financial
markets   have themselves undergone significant change.

       The evidence on monetary and financial aspects of U.S. business
cycles assembled in this paper shows major differences among the pre World
War I, inter—war, and post World War II periods, and between the first and
second halves of the post—war period. Evidence suggesting changes from
one period to another repeatedly emerges, regardless of whether the method
of analysis is simple or sophisticated, regardless of whether the underlying
data are annual or quarterly, and regardless of whether the relationships
under study are bivariate or multivariate. Moreover, the differences
between one period and another are significant not just statistically but
also economically, in the sense of major differences in the magnitude and
timing of cyclical movements.

          The paper's main message, therefore, is a warning against accepting
too readily — either as a matter of positive economics or for policy
purposes — the appearance of simple and eternal verities in much of the
existing literature of monetary and financial aspects of business fluctuations.
?bre complicated models involving many variables and/or nonlinear
relationships may have remained stable, but the evidence clearly shows
that simple linear relationships among only a few such variables have not.

           MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE

                            Benjamin N. Friedman*


          The monetary and financial aspects of fluctuations in economic

activity have attracted the attention of economists and other observers

of the business cycle for a long time. Throughout the nineteenth century

and into the early years of the twentieth, business downturns in the

United States were typically associated in a quite obvious way with

9panics'   or other sharp discontinuities in the financial markets. Such
readily visible events have all but vanished since the establishment of
the Federal Reserve System in 1914 and especially the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation in 1934, but the pace of activity in the financial

markets   has continued to vary closely with that in many of the economy's
nonfinancial markets. Much of this covariation is by now highly familiar,
if not necessarily well understood. The regularities on which macroeconomists
have    focused most intensively in this context are those involving money

(including either high-powered money or deposit money), credit (including

public debt, private debt, or the sum of the two), and interest rates.1

In large part because of the availability of data extending back to the

early   years of this century, and in some cases still earlier, the documentation
of these regularities over fairly long time periods is now broadly familiar.
         One factor motivating the long history of interest in this subject

is, of course, simply the desire to understand more fully the underlying

causes and internal dynamics of business fluctuations. Implications for

public policy have also been important in this regard, however. A common

thread running through decades of literature on the monetary and financial

aspects of business cycles has been the actual or potential role of monetary
                                       —2--




policy in affecting either real economic outcomes or price stability,

or both. Indeed, even those strands of literature which have argued vigorously

against the existence of any possibility for monetary policy to improve

real outcomes have heavily emphasized the negative results to follow,

typically via the speed or variability of price inflation, from an ill chosen

(according to that view) policy regime.

         The basic theme of this paper, in contrast to much of the extensive

1                 4—kr r,-1- + -I-            --4- 1-1                   +-4.,-
                                                         Sj LVLfl A LL —CA L L V C £ C S a t.- .L'J1 V 1 I


connecting   monetary and financial variables to the business cycle exhibit

few   if any strongly persistent regularities which have remained even
approximately invariant in the context of the widespread and, in some
instances,   dramatic changes undergone by the U.S. financial markets over

familiar time periods both long and short. At a qualitative level, of

course, broadly familiar regularities have characterized many monetary

and financial aspects of U.S. business fluctuations. The procyclical

behavior of money, credit and interest rates is well known, as is the

tendency of money and credit growth to "lead" real economic growth at

major business cycle turning points. Nevertheless, these characteristic

qualitative features of most business fluctuations have not corresponded

to persistent regularities in the quantitative relationships that constitute

the main focus of modern business cycle analysis.

         The finding that stable quantitative relationships to monetary

and   financial   variables have been absent from the U.S. business cycle

experience does not mean that monetary and financial phenomena are

unimportant elements of business fluctuations, nor that there is no

consistent   basis for seeking to understand or explain these phenomena.
The basic monetary and financial elements of economic behavior have no
                                           —3—




 doubt persisted      in some fundamental sense. The problem is instead that

 these basic elements of economic behavior do not correspond straightforwardly

 in theory or closely in practice to the specific quantities that economists

can typically measure. In addition, the relevant behavior is probably

 far too complex to be readily represented in simple linear relationships

limited to very few variables.

            From the perspective of positive economics based on familiar and

available data, therefore, the main message of this paper is that simple

relationships usually taken to be central to monetary and financial aspects

of business cycles have in the past changed often and much. From the

perspective      of inferences about monetary policy, the chief implication
is   a warning against proceeding as if any one, or a few of these simple

relationships will reliably remain immutable.

            Changes in   the working of the U.S. financial markets that are
potentially important for monetary and financial aspects of business
fluctuations are not difficult to identify. Within the twentieth century
the entire apparatus and orientation of U.S. monetary policy have undergone

several dramatic shifts. In addition to monetary policy, major changes

in government regulation       and the expansion of government intermediation
have been further potentially important and often shifting influences.
Moreover, the nation's private financial institutions and practices have
also   undergone profound and far reaching changes over these years, in part

in   response to changing patterns of government regulation and monetary
policy but as a result, too, of private institutions' taking advantage of
new developments      elsewhere in the economy.
            Jny attempt to see whether the monetary and financial aspects
of   U.S.   economic fiuctuatiors have remained invariant, or nearly so, in
                                        —4--




the   face of these financial market changes must at the   outset   confront the

methodological choice between structural and reduced-form approaches to this

question. A structural framework imposes potentially valuable restrictions

on    the way   in which the corresponding empirically estimated model summarizes

the   quantitative relationships exhibited by the prior experience in question.
Whatever analysis is grounded in a specific structural model is therefore
conditional on those restrictions. Istrictions that are valid reflections
of    actual economic behavior will enable the model to extract the relevant

behavioral relationships more efficiently from the available data, but

incorrect or arbitrary restrictions will distort the representation of those
relationships. Either kind of error can introduce the appearance of change
where in fact there has been continuity, or of continuity where there has

been change.

          The subject of monetary and financial influences on economic

fluctuations is not lacking for suggested structural frameworks. One

long—familiar strand of thinking along these lines, which has emphasized

interest rate, asset price, and credit rationing effects on specific kinds of

spending, is the expanded IS—LM aggregate demand model typical of the

post—Keynesian neoclassical synthesis, perhaps best exemplified empirically

by the MPS model.2 A closely related line of structural analysis, which

has placed more emphasis on portfolio substitutions and asset valuations,

is the disaggregated asset market approach of Tobin (1961, 1969) and

Erunner and Meltzer (1972, l97). A third line of analysis, which in its

structural components is also related to these two, but which has more

narrowly emphasized the role of monetary assets in affecting aggregate

demand, is the monetarist model of Friedman (1956, 1971), as exemplified

empirically by the St. uis model.3 A more different line of structural
                                          —5—




analysis is the rational expectations model of aggregate supply developed

by Lucas (1972, 1973), and exemplified empirically by Sargent (1976). A

still more recent line of analysis has been the explicit banking sector

model of Fama (l980a, 198Gb).4 Moreover, each of these different structural

approaches essentially refers to a closed economy. To the extent that the

U.S. economy's increasing openness may also be important for monetary and

financial aspects of economic fluctuations, the range of choice — and,

consequently, of potential disagreement —        is   only greater.

          The approach taken in this paper is to sidestep the choice among,

or synthesis of, these disparate structural models, and to employ instead

only a reduced-form empirical approach that in principal is compatible

with any of them. The basic advantage in this approach is to avoid making

the analysis conditional on explicit structural restrictions that would

attract sharp disagreement from the outset, and that could indeed be

incorrect. The key disadvantages are the loss of efficiency in the extraction

of the relevant quantitative relationships from the data and, correspondingly,

the loss of explicit connection between the estimated relationships and

more specific elements of monetary and financial behavior.

          Section   I sets the stage for the empirical analysis by briefly
reviewing the major twentieth century changes in the U.S. financial
markets that would make it surprising if there had been no significant
changes    in the monetary and financial aspects of U.S.     economic fluctuations
during    this period —   at   least under the view that the prevailing institutions,

including government structures as well as private business practices,

importantly affect economic behavior. Section II documents at a

qualitative level the familiar interrelatedness of money, credit, interest

rates and nonfinancial economic activity in a business cycle context, but
                                      —6—




then goes on to point out some changes in these relationships over time

that   are apparent even at a very simple level of analysis. Section III

digresses to consider the relationships connecting money, credit and

their respective "velocities" to the flucutations of both nominal and

real income during the economy's seven and one—half recognized business

cycles since World War II. Section IV applies formal time—series and

frequency-domain   methods to examine at a quantitative level,    and in an

explicitly   dynamic context, the familiar relationships introduced in
Section II. Section V pursues this line of analysis further, to determine
whether differences in these familiar relationships from one time     period

to   another are signficant not just in a statistical sense but economically

as well. Section VI digresses again to consider the post—war evidence on

the economy's "credit cycle." Section VII concludes by summarizing the

principal    eitirical findings presented throughout the paper.
i.                 the U.S. Economy's   Financial   Structure

       whether or not the monetary and financial aspects of economic

fluctuations in the United States have changed their character over any

specific period of time        within the twentieth century, for example, or

since World War II, or since October 1979 —          is   an empirical issue. Before

examining the evidence on this question, however, it is appropriate to ask

whether during the relevant time     period   there have been changes in the

economy's underlying financial structure that, at least in principle, could

have effected changes in the cyclical relationships between monetary and

financial variables and nonfinancial economy activity. Three broad

categories of changes in the U.S. economy's financial structure stand out

in this regard.

       First, within the time period spanned by available data (and studied

in this paper) ,   the   entire apparatus and orientation of U.S. monetary

policy have undergone dramatic shifts. Before 1914 the United States had no

central bank as such, but relied instead on a largely unregulated national

banking system anchored by a gold standard. Prompted by a recurrent series

of financial crises and panics, especially in 1901, 1907 and 1913, Congress

created a new Federal Reserve System charged with the basic task of

preserving stability in the financial markets —more specifically,

instructed "to furnish an elastic currency." The macroeconomic objectives

almost universally associated with monetary policy in the post World War II

era, including especially the objective of price stability, received no

mention in the original Federal Peserve Act.

       Between 1914 and World War II, monetary policy evolved in a variety

of ways, as Federal Peserve decision makers gradually came to understand

what effects the System's open market purchases and sales of government
                                          —8—




securities   had   in   the new world of fractional reserve banking directly

based on central bank liabilities. The establishment in 1923 of what

subsequently evolved into today's Federal Open Market Committee led

temporarily to an increasing emphasis on open market operations in       a   monetary

policy context, but in the 1930s the confusions of the depression and the

associated international monetary crisis, including the abandonment of the

gold standard in 1934, arrested the developmont of the monetary policy

mechanism. Then, during World War II and thereafter until 1951, this

evolution effectively ceased as the Federal Reserve assumed an obligation

to support the open market price of the government's outstanding debt (which

was then almost entirely a war loan)

          In 1951 the Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord relieved the central

bank of this obligation, and monetary policy assumed the quasi—independent

macroeconomic role it      has played   ever since. Even so, there have been

several   major changes in monetary policy orientation and procedures since
then.     In the early post-Accord years, the Federal Reserve keyed its
operations to the net free reserve position of the commercial banking system.
By the late 1960s, the principal policy focus had changed to setting
interest rates on short—term debt instruments, sometimes Treasury bills
and later on federal funds. From 1970 onward, quantity targets for
the growth of various aggregative measures of money and credit, including

especially the narrowly defined money stock (Ml), played a generally increasing

albeit sporadic role in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.

In 1979 the Federal Reserve announced a renewed emphasis on these quantity

growth targets and adopted new operating procedures, based on the growth rate

of nonborrowed bank reserves, for achieving them. In 1982 the Ml target was

publicly suspended, however, and the weight placed on even the broader money

and credit targets in 1982 and 1983 was uncertain. As of the time of writing,
the role of quantity growth targets in U.S. monetary policy may be

central, irrelevant or, more likely, somewhere in between.

          Second, the often shifting evolution of monetary policy has hardly

been the only way in which actions of the federal government (not to mention

those of state governments) have effected structural changes that may

well have altered, perhaps importantly, how the economy's financial and

nonfinancial markets interact in a business cycle context.6 Government

regulatory actions have also been a potentially important and often

changing influence. The three most dramatic such changes — the insurance

of private bank deposits, the prohibition of interest on demand deposits,

and the separation of the commercial banking and securities industries —

all    took effect in the l930s. Further potentially important changes in

bank regulation and supervision have occurred since then from time to tin,

including most prominently the key legislation governing bank holding

companies in the late 1960s and the deregulation of banks and other

depository institutions in the early 1980s. Moreover, in several further

complete turns of the wheel, the prohibition of interest on demand deposits

has   become effectively inoperative within the past decade, while long-standing
prohibitions on interstate banking and on banking firms engaging in the
securities business (and   vice versa) are even now becoming fictional. Perhaps

most   importantly, in recent years the entire distinction between transactions
balances and savings balances has become blurred to the point of meaninglessness.
         changes in government financial regulation have also extended well
beyond   the banking system and other depository institutions. The

securities legislation of the 1L93Os created a whole new separate industry,

and subsequent regulation has continued to affect how it works. Key regulatory

changes effected by the Securities and Exchange Commission have ranged
                                       —10--




from requiring competitive bidding in most public utility company

underwritings   beginning in   the 1950s, to allowing the spread of open—

end   mutual funds beginning in the 1960s, to prohibiting fixed minimum
commissions on stock exchange brokerage beginning in the 1970s, to
permitting shelf" offerings of corporate securities beginning in the
1980s. As a result of these and many other regulatory actions over the
years, the securities markets in the United States function differently
today   than they thu in   earlier times.
         The National Banking Act of 1933 introduced deposit interest rate

ceilings, in part. as a response to banks' alleged overly aggressive

bidding for interbank demand deposits during the l920s. The ceilings have

also applied to time and saving deposits, however, and in this context

they have at times had enormous impacts on the workings of the financial

markets and on the financing of economic activity. Specific episodes of

disintermediation during the 1960s and 1970s, due to Regulation Q    ceiling
rates that remained low in comparison to sharply rising market interest

rates, led to the rise of whole new patterns of portfolio behavior and to

periodic depression in the homebuilding industry. The Federal Reserve System

first moved to eliminate these adverse effects in 1970 by suspending the

ceiling on interest paid on most large bank certificates of deposit. As of

the time of writing, these ceilings appear to be on the way out altogether

as a result of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary

Control Act of 1980.

        A related development in the government's role in the credit market,

which came about in part in response to the distortions caused by deposit

interest ceilings, has been the great increase in government intermediation.

The Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank
                                         —11---




began operations before World War II, but the scale of their activity was small

at first and their initial focus was on agricultual credit. The Federal

National Mortgage Association began its lending operations in 1955.          Only in

the 1960s and 1970s, however, as periodic disintermediation became severe,

did the scope and size of government financial intermediation expand

greatly. In recent years, the government sponsored credit agencies have

been joined by pools issuing mortgage—backed securities that are not only

government sponsored but, in some cases, formally guaranteed. As of

the late 1960s, and as recently as 1982, it was not atypical for these

quasi—government institutions to account for half or more of all home

mortgage lending in the United States in high disintermediation years.

Moreover, in recent years the federal government has extended its direct

loan and loan guarantee operations far beyond housing— and agriculture—

related credits, to the benefit of such diverse borrowers as college students,

New York City, and the Lockheed and Qrysler corporations.

       Third, the nation!s private financial institutions and practices

have undergone profound and far reaching changes over these years, in part

in response   to changing patterns of government regulation and monetary
policy but    also in large part as a result of private initiatives taking

advantage of new developments elsewhere in the economy, including

especially the rapidly changing technology of communications      and data
processing.    New forms   of   deposits (for example, negotiable time certificates,

Eurodollar credits, and money market deposit accounts) and new securities

(for example, variable—rate mortgages, floating—rate notes, interest rate

futures, and listed stock options) have come, and in some cases gone. So

have new kinds of financial institutions (for example, money market mutual

funds and mortgage pass-through pools).
                                       —12—




        Other   forms of   change in private financial practices have been more

gradual, but potentially just as important. The nation's financial

markets have steadily become less segmented, and presumably more efficient

in the classic sense. Diverse regional markets have become more integrated,

though still far from entirely so, and barriers separating different kinds

of borrowers from different kinds of depositors or lenders have steadily

eroded. Meanwhile, some institutions like pension funds      and   credit unions

have grown rapIdly in relative terms, while others like insurance companies

and mutual savings banks have done the opposite. In a further series of

developments of potentially very great importance for the questions at

issue here, the U.S. financial markets as a whole have at times become less

open to foreign participation, and more recently more so, as capital controls

have come and gone, while most (though not all) foreign markets have become

more accessible from here. Indeed, during large parts of the period under

study here, many key foreign currencies simply were not convertible.

        Although adequately summarizing the elements of these private

financial market changes that are of greatest potential importance in a

business cycle context is probably impossible, given the space available

here, several basic trends that are relevant in this context stand out. One

is that transactions costs have fallen, irregularly but persistently nonetheless,

over   the period under study in this paper. Pnother is that financial assets
have increasingly become negotiable, and those which have always been
negotiable   have become more liquid. A third is that, despite the potentially

very important episodes of retrogression, financial markets around the world

have in fact become more closely integrated.

         In light of these changes in the role of monetary policy, in government

regulations and intermediation, and in private financial institutions and

practices, it would be astonishing if there had been no changes at all
                                  -13-




in the relationships connecting money, credit and interest rates to U.S.

economic fluctuations. In the context of business cycles, however, as

opposed to a study of financial markets per se, what matters is whether

these (or still other) changes have brought about significant, and

economically important, changes in such relationships at the macroeconomic

level.

II. Basic    Cyclical   Relationships in Monetary and   Financa1   Data

         The four panels of Figure 1 give an overview of the basic relationships

of four key monetary and financial variables to U.S. economic fluctuations

by showing these variables' annual variation from either 1891 or 1919 to the

present. The figure does not explicitly include any measure of

nonfinancial   economic activity, but the conventional shadings indicate
business contractions as designated by the National Bureau.
         The top   panel of the figure shows the annual percentage change in

the money stock, measured both by the Friedman—Schwartz "old M2" concept

for   18 91-1975 and by the "new Ml" concept for 1919-82. The "old M2" measure
includes   currency held by the public plus "adjusted" total deposits at

commercial banks but not at nonbank depository institutions (and also,

since 1961, excluding large certificates of deposit) .       The "new Ml" measure

is   that adopted in 1980 (as "Mi-B") by the Federal Reserve System,
including currency held by the public plus all checkable deposits other than
those   held by foreign commercial banks and official institutions, and

as amended in 1982 to include travellers' checks.8 As is well known from

the work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 1970, 1983) and others, the

major historical fluctuations in U.S. nonfinancial economic activity have

been accompanied by often sharp fluctuations in the rate of money growth.

Prominent examples that stand out in the figure include the episodes of

negative money growth in 1921, 1931 and 1949, and the sharp slowing of money

growth in 1938. Especially during the post World War II period, however,

fluctuations in economic activity and variations in money growth have both

been more modest. The comovernent of money growth and real economic growth

has been less pronounced also, although it is still readily visible.

       The   second panel of Figure 1 shows the annual percentage change in
domestic   nonfinancial credit, including the total outstanding credit

market indebtedness of all U.Spublic and private sector borrowers other

than financial intermediaries.9 As is documented in Friedman (1981, 1983a)

domestic nonfinancial credit has also borne a close relationship to U.S.

nonfinancial economic activity, especially in the post-war period. Even

before World War II, however, several major episodes of negative credit

growth, including those in 1921, 1931 and 1938, stand out as having

occurred in conjunction with recognized economic fluctuations.

       The bottom two panels of Figure 1 show the annual average levels

of interest rates on prime 4—6 month commercial paper offered in New York,

and on Baa—rated corporate bonds, respectively.10 The main features that

stand out immediately in the interest rate data are the great volatility of

both short- and long—term rates before 1930 and after 1970, the extraordinarily

low level of both rates during the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the persistent

upward trend since World War II. Js is thoroughly familiar, however,

interest rates also fluctuate cyclically, and many of the recognized business

cycle episodes during this period also coincide with readily visible interest

rate movements.

       Table 1 focuses more closely on the comovernents of both the 4l money stock

and domestic nonfinancial credit with economic activity by arranging seasonally

adjusted quarterly data in the context of the seven and one—half complete

episodes since World War II designated as contractions and expansions by the

National Bureau.11 For each designated contraction or expansion, the taJle

shows the average per annum growth rate of money and credit, respectively.
Despite the secular post—war trend toward faster growth of money and credit,

the   strongly cyclical aspect of both money growth and credit growth stands

out clearly in these summary data. Money growth in expansions has exceeded

money growth in contractions by nearly 1 3/4% per annum on average, while

credit growth in expansions has exceeded credit growth in contractions by

nearly 1 1/2% per annum on average. The basic cyclical regularity is much

more striking than these average differences suggest, however. Money growth

in each expansion was faster than in the preceding contraction, and money growth

was slower in each contraction than in the preceding expansion.    Similarly,

credit growth in each expansion was faster than credit growth in the preceding

contractions and credit growth in each contraction was slower than in the

preceding expansion.

         Table 2 presents analogous data (not seasonally adjusted) for the

post—war cyclical levels and movements of short— and long—term interest

rates. Once again a secular post—war trend, toward higher interest rates

and larger (absolute) interest rate changes, stands out immediately.

Interest rates have also exhibited strong cyclical regularities, but they

are not so striking as in the case of money and credit growth.    Interest

rate levels have been lower in expansions than in contractions by about

3/4% on average, but there has hardly been uniformity in this respect.

In only two expansions were short—term interest rates lower than in the

previous   contraction, and in only one expansion was the long—term rate lower
(by more than a single basis point)
         By contrast, the chief cyclical regularity that does stand out in

Table 2 is the rise of the short—term interest rate in every expansion and

the corresponding decline in every contraction. The 6 3/4% (algebraic)

contractions, respectively, dwarfs the small difference in the corresponding

average levels. The long—term interest rate has also risen in all seven

post-war expansions and declined in six of the eight contractions, although

here the (algebraic) difference for the respective average changes has

been much smaller, as most familiar theories of the pricing of long— versus

short—term assets imply.

        In summary, both the annual data plotted in Figure 1 and the cycle-

specific averages of quarterly data shown in Tables 1 and 2 give the

impression of strong and persistent regularities in the monetary and

financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations. On closer inspection,

however, many of these regularities turn out not to be so regular or so

persistent after all. Although the investigation of these relationships

in a dynamic context is the subject of SectionslV and V below, Table 3 provides

a quick overview by showing simple correlation coefficients relating the

annual movements of the monetary and financial variables plotted in

Figure 1 to the annual percentage change in real gross national product.14

For the nonetary and credit aggregates, the table also shows analogous

correlations for the corresponding aggregates deflated by the gross national

product    rri.ce deflation.
          In order to highlight changes in these relationships over time,
Table 3 presents correlation coefficients separately for the pre World War I
 (l89l19l6)q    inter—war (1919—40), and post   World War II   (1947—82) periods,

and also for two sub-periods (1947-65 and l966-32) within the post-war period.

Especially from the perspective of changes in monetary policy, other possible

breaks in the post-war period would also be logical, including 1951 when

the   Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord took effect, 1970 when the Federal

Reserve System first began to employ explicit monetary aggregate targets

and also first began to suspend Regulation Q ceilings, and 1979 when the

Federal Peserve (temporarily) adopted new operating procedures. The

break at 1966 roughly separates the early post—war years of low price

inflation, stable real economic growth and few apparent "supply shocks"

from the subsequent years of rapid and accelerating price inflation, less
stable and on average slower real growth, an occasional large supply—
side    disturbances.

          For each monetary or financial variable among the eight considered,

and for each separate time period, Table 3 reports the simple correlation

of the variable's annual percentage change (for interest rates, the absolute

change)   with the annual percentage change of real gross national product
for three lead—lag relationships: first with the monetary or financial
variable leading real growth by one year, next contemporaneously, and last
with that variable lagging real growth by one year.

          In contrast to the appearance of strong regularities in Figure 1

and in Tables 1 and 2, the dominant impression given by these correlations

is the absence of systematic relationships that have persisted across the

different time periods under consideration.15 The only two consistently

significant relationships are the tendency of real M2 growth to be rapid

(slow) contemporaneously with rapid (slow) real growth, and of long-term

interest rates to fall (rise) in the year before a year of rapid (slow)

real   growth. Nominal Ml growth was strongly positively   correlated with

contemporaneous    real growth during the inter—war period, but less so during
either half of the post-war period considered separately and not at all
for    the post—war period overall. Peal Ml growth was strongly correlated

with contemporaneous real economic growth earlier on, but not during the
                                       —19—




later post—war period. Neither nominal nor real Mi growth has shown a

significant lead or lag relationship to real economic growth on an annual

basis. Nominal M2 growth was strongly positively correlated with

contemporaneous    real growth during the pre—war and inter—war periods, but
not since World War II.
          Nominal credit growth resembles nominal Ml   growth in being strongly
postively correlated with contemporaneous real economic growth during
the inter—war period and the early post—war period, but not for the
later post—war period or for the post—war period as a whole. For the
inter—war and early post—war periods, lagged credit growth has been
significantly correlated with real economic growth, although positively
in the former years and negatively in the latter. Ieal credit growth has
been    positively correlated with real economic growth on a contemporaneous

basis   throughout the post—war period, but it was not so earlier on.
          Finally, both short— and long—term interest rate changes have
been negatively correlated with contemporaneous real economic growth, and
(except for short-term rates in the inter-war period) with the following
year's real growth, throughout the period under study here. Many of these
correlations are not significant, however. The contemporaneous relationship for

short—term rates is significant except for the inter-war years, and for
long—term rates it   is   so except for the early post—war period. The change
in   short—term rates has been positively correlated with the prior year's

real growth, but significantly so only during the pre--war and early

post—war periods.

         Simple correlations based on annual data are a crude way of

summarizing economic relationships, of course, even when they allow for
                                       —20—




modest leads or lags. Nevertheless, if the regularities connecting
monetary and financial variables to business cycles were sufficiently

powerful and persistent, they would be likely to show up more strongly

even in these simple correlations. That they do not is hardly the end

of the story, but the fact that it is necessary to look harder in order

to   find them is itself suggestive.
 III. Money,      Credit   and   '\1ocity"   in Post-War Business cles

          A subject that has run throughout the long standing literature

 of monetary and financial aspects of economic fluctuations is the respective

 roles in this context of money (or credit) and the associated "velocity"

 defined simply as the ratio of nominal income to money (or, again, to

credit). Before examining the U.S.           experience   in this regard, it is

useful to point out the absence of any economic meaning of "velocity"

as so defined —       other   than, by definition, the income-to—money ratio.

Because the "velocity" label may seem to connote deposit or currency

turn—over rates, there is often a tendency to infer that "velocity"

defined in this way does in fact correspond to some physical aspect of

economic      behavior. When the numerator of the ratio is income rather
than transactions or bank debits,, however, "velocity" is simply a
         16
ratio.

          1s Table 1 shows for the post-war period, both money and credit

grow   faster on average during economic expansions than during contractions.
The issue of money or credit movements versus their respective "velocities,"
in   a business cycle context, is simply the distinction between movements

of nominal income that match movements of money or credit and movements

of income that do not, and hence that imply movements in the income—to—money

or income—to—credit ratio.

         Table 4, using quarterly data for post-war cyclical episodes

exactly analogues to the money and credit growth averages in Table 1, shows

that the "velocity" associated with each aggregate has also exhibited

strong cyclical properties. Monetary velocity, which has had an upward

secular trend since World War II, has risen on average in each expansion
                                      —22—




and has declined on average in six of eight contractions. The average

growth   of monetary velocity in expansions has exceeded that in contractions
by about 4 3/4% per annum, a much greater difference than the 1 3/4% per
annum shown in Table 1 for money growth itself. Credit velocity, which
has been trendless on average since World War II, has risen on average in
four of six expansions and declined on average in each contraction.
The average    growth of credit velocity in expansions has exceeded that in
contractions   by about 4 1/4% per annum, again a much larger difference

than the 1 1/4% per annum difference shown in Table 1 for credit growth.

         Because   the numerator of the "velocity" ratio is nominal income,
while business cycle expansions and contractions typically refer to
fluctuations of real economic activity, it is difficult to go much further
in considering money, credit and their respective "velocities" in a business
cycle context without allowing for cyclical variation in price inflation.
As Table 5 shows, however, during the post-war period price inflation
has apparently followed the business cycle with a sufficient lag that
the movements of real and nominal gross national product during expansions
and contractions have almost exactly corresponded on average. Real
income, of course, has grown on average in each expansion and declined on
average in each contraction, with an (algebraic) difference of nearly 6%
per annum between the mean for all expansions and the mean for all contractions.
By contrast, because of the upward secular trend in price inflation, nominal
income declined in the first three post—war contractions but increased
in   the subsequent five. Even so, the difference between the average growth

of nominal income in expansions and contractions, respectively, has been

about 6 1/2% per annum — almost identical to the corresponding difference

 for real income. At least for averages across business cycle expansions

and contractions, therefore, relationships to nominal income (like those

based on "velocity ratios) approximately carry over to relationships to

real income, and hence to economic fluctuations in the ordinary business

cycle    sense. Table 6 summarizes these      relationships by collecting

the means from Tables 1, 4 and 5 and the corresponding        implied means
of    price inflation.17

          Table   7 pursues further the distinction of money and credit
growth versus "velocity" growth by showing an       analysis of variance for

the   respective real and nominal income identities summarized in terms
of means   in Table 6.     The   upper half of the table first decomposes the
variation   of real income growth into components representing nominal

growth, price inflation and their covariance, and then decomposes the

variation of nominal income growth into components representing money

growth, "velocity" growth (that is, nominal income growth which does

not correspond to     money growth) and the associated covariance term.
         The first column of the table applies this decomposition only to
contractions, treating each one as       a simple observation —   in other words,
asking what role money growth, "velocity" growth and price inflation have
played in accounting for differences between one business contraction and
another. The average (negative) real growth rate has varied little among
successive contraction episodes, so that the differences here are almost
entirely differences among respective contractions' rates of price inflation

and hence of nominal growth. The results show that money growth variations

have dominated velocity growth variations in accounting for these differences.

Analogous results presented in the second column show an even greater

predominance of money growth variations over velocity growth variations in
accounting for nominal income growth differences across expansions. The final

column of the table presents the results of an analogous decomposition applied

to all contractions and all expansions, again treating each as a single

observation        in other words, asking what role money growth, velocity

growth and price inflation have played in accounting for differences not

just among contractions or among expansions but also between contractions

and expansions. In this context the respective variations of money

growth and velocity growth have been more nearly coequal, and also importantly

correlated.

         The   lower half of Table 7 presents the analogous three sets of
decompositions including credit and credit velocity." The results are
similar to those for money and money velocity shown above, but in each
case with a smaller role for the aggregate, and consequently a greater
role   for velocity. Variations in credit growth have predominated over

velocity growth variations only in accounting for differences among

expansions. For differences among contractions, the two have been

approximately coequal, and importantly correlated. Variations in credit

velocity, and its correlation with credit growth variations, have been

more   important than variations in credit growth per se in the broader
cyclical context of accounting also for differences between expansions and
contractions.

IV.     Dynamic Relationships

          Simple annual correlations like those shown    in   Table 3 fail to convey

that it is important to know about the comovement of economic time series

in a business cycle context for at least three reasons. First, the relevant

lead—lag relationships may be distributed over either more or less than one

year. The work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963), for example, concluded that

variations in money growth typically lead variations in income growth by

less than a year. Second, even highly significant lead correlations may

merely reflect the interaction of contemporaneous (or even lagged) relationships

among time series that are individually autocorrelated. In contrast to the

propositions that characterized much of the earlier literature of monetary

and financial aspects of economic fluctuations, which typically referred simply

to the comovement among two or more variables, the modern analysis of business

cycles focuses instead on whether movements in one variable are systematically

related to those parts of the movements in another that are not purely

autoregressive. Third, the relationship of one variable to another may depend

on what further variables the analysis includes. The proposition that two

variables exhibit a stable relationship to one another without allowance

for   further variables implies either that other variables are unimportant
to   that relationship or that whatever other variables are relevant have

not varied (will not vary) significantly during the period under study.

The results presented in this section of the paper extend the simple overview

provided    in Table 3   so as to take account of each of these potentially

important   considerations.
         Table   8 presents   F—statistics for conventional exogeneity (t1causality")

respectively to the growth of Ml, M2 and credit, and the change in short-

and long—term interest rates, for the same time periods used in Table 1,

and Table 9 presents analogous results for bivariate relationships to

real economic growth.18 Such exogeneity tests constitute the dern

formal analog to the investigation of leads and lags that has been central

to the more traditional business cycle literature. Once again, however,

the chief impression given by these results is the absence of persistence

over time in familiar simple quantitative relstionships.

         The often assumed relationship by which Ml growth helps explain

either nominal or real economic growth, but not vice versa, appears in

the results in Tables 8 and 9 only since World War II, and only when the

first half of the post-war period is included. Growth in M2 helps

explain nominal economic growth only before World War I, and does not

help explain real economic growth in this sense in any of the three periods

studied. Credit growth helps explain nominal income growth both in the

inter—war period and in the post—war period as long as the more recent

post—war years are included, but for the post—war period as a whole nominal

income growth also helps explain credit growth. Credit growth does not

help explain real income growth in this sense in any period. The change

in short—term interest rates helps explain both nominal and real income

growth, but not vice versa, in the pre—war period and in the second half of

the post—war period. The change in long—term interest rates helps explain

both   nominal   and real income growth, but not vice versa, in the inter—war

period and the first half of the post-war period.

         It is important to distinguish these generally negative findings

from the more traditional propositions, noted and in some cases documented

above, about the comovement in a simple sense, including lead and lag

relationships, connecting income with familiar monetary       and   financial

variables. As Figure 1 and Tables    1-3   show, each of the five monetary

and financial   variables considered here has exhibited distinctly cyclical

movements, at least during some time periods. What the tests in Tables 8

and 9 seek to establish, however, is not just whether a variable has

fluctuated   in conjunction with movements in income but whether it has
shown a relationship to that part of the movement in income which is not
explainable in purely autoregressive terms. Even a readily visible simple
relationship to income fluctuations need not — indeed, evidently often
does not    imply a corresponding relationship to the elements of income
fluctuations that are not purely autoregressive.
         More importantly, the basic theme of this paper focuses less on
what   helps explain what than on which if any quantitative relationships

have persisted across spans of time during which the U.S. financial markets

have   undergone changes like those reviewed in Section I, which at least in
principle could have importantly affected the     monetary and financial aspects

of   economic fluctuations. Table 10 presents further F-statistics testing
the null hypothesis of absence of structural change in the bivariate
relationships summarized in Tables 8   and 9,   against   the alternative hypothesis
of   breaks at World War II and at the mid-point of the post-war period to date

(and also, for relationships involving M2 and the short—term interest rate,

at World War I). In all but two isolated cases, the data indicate significant

structural change. What is especially striking in the results of these

stability tests is that even sets of coefficients which Tables 8 and 9 report

to be not significantly different from zero are nonetheless significantly

different   from one another.

          Annual data, of course, may simply be too coarse to capture the

relevant   behavior connecting these aspects of aggregative economic

activity. Tables 11 and 12 therefore present F-statistics for analogous

bivariate exogeneity tests for the respective relationships of nominal and

real   income growth to the growth of mbney (Ml) and credit and the
change in short— and long—term interest rates, based on quarterly data for
the post World War II period.19 Money growth consistently helps explain
both nominal and real economic growth, as is familiar from previous work,
but these results show that either nominal or real income growth also
typically helps explain money growth (so that money does not 'cause'T income
in the Granger sense). Credit growth helps explain nominal income, but

not vice versa, in the second half of the post—war period. For the post-

war period as a whole, credit growth again helps explain nominal income

growth,   while the      reverse effect is only   marginally significant.       Changes

in short—term     interest    rates consistently help   explain   nominal income

growth, but not vice versa, and the same is true with respect to real

income growth in the later post—war years. changes in long—term                interest
rates   never help explain income at all in this context. Finally, Table 13

shows that most of these quarterly results also fail to exhibit stability

across the earlier and later halves of the post—war period. Further results

(not shown) are also broadly similar for other logical break—points like

those suggested in Section II.

          One   reason   why relationships like these may appear to be unstable,

of course, is that they are misspecified —           for   example, by   the   omission

of other relevant variables. Given the results for the bivariate relationships

in Tables 8 and 9 and Tables 11 and 12, in which several monetary and

financial variables each appear to be related to either nominal. or

real income growth at least in some periods, it is difficult to justify the

use of only bivariate relationships. Table 14 presents F—statistics for

analogous exogeneity tests based on a five—variable annual system including

real income growth, price inflation, money (Ml) growth, credit growth and

the change in the short—term interest rate, for the same inter—war and

post—war periods studied earlier.

      Even with only three monetary and financial variables in the system,

however, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions from this expanded

analysis. Among the three, only money growth significantly helps explain

real income growth — given the presence of the other included variables

in any period examined, and even this effect is evident only for samples

including the first half of the post—war period.20 At the same time, real

income growth helps explain both money growth and credit growth during the

full post—war period, and also helps explain money growth during the later

post—war years. Peal income growth only marginally helps explain the short-

term interest rate change. Once again, what significant regularities do

appear have not been regular enough to persist across different time periods.

        The same generalization also characterizes analogous results for

multivariate systems estimated for the post World War II period using

quarterly data. There is little point in displaying vast quantities of

empirical results along these lines, since the basic lack of consistency

is readily apparent just from a summary    of   what does and does not help

explain real income growth in quarterly systems based on different sub—

periods. For the quarterly version of the same five—variable system shown

 in Table 14, neither money growth nor credit growth nor the short-term

 interest rate change significantly helps explain real income growth, even
                                           —30—




 at   the .10 level — again, given the presence of one another —              for   1952:1—

 l982:IV, 1952:I—1965:IV or 1966:I—l982:iV. By contrast, for the four—

 variable system estimated for 1953:I-1978:iV in Friedman (1983a), including

all of the same variables as in Table 14 except the interest rate change,

money growth and credit growth each significantly help explain real

income growth at the .05 level.21 Similarly, for the six-variable system

estimated for 1962:111-1979:111 in clarida        and   Friedman (1984), including

all   of   the same variables as in Table 14 plus the change in the federal

government budget deficit, credit growth significantly helps explain real

income growth at the .01 level, money growth does so at the .05 level,

and the short-term interest rate change does so at the .10 level.22

           Moreover, these multivariate relationships too show significant

evidence of instability from one time period to another, thereby

revealing that the instability of the bivariate systems documented in

Table    10 is not due to anything so sinpie as merely omitting a small number
of familiar variables. Table 15 presents F—statistics testing the null
hypothesis of absence of structural change in the five—variable annual
relationships summarized in Table 14, and in the corresponding quarterly
relationships, against the alternative hypothesis of a break between the
inter—war and post—war periods or between the first and second halves of
the post—war period. The annual data indicate significant structural
change in     each   relationship at World War II,   though   only   for   the interest
rate equation at 1965.     appearance of stability between the first and
                              The

second halves of the post-war period is probably just due to lack of
degrees of freedom, however, since the corresponding quarterly              data indicate

highly     significant structural change in each relationship at l965:IV. In

sum, neither using quarterly data in place of annual, nor using multivariate

systems in place of bivariate, nor doing both at once, overturns the

general finding of heterogeneity from one period to another in the monetary

and financial aspects of economic fluctuations.

          Finally, because the very notion of business "cycles" suggests the

possibility of comovements that recur at possibly regular intervals, it is

interesting to see whether the frequency—domain properties of the comovements

studied    here can provide further information to supplement the time—domain
properties reported above. In particular, what light can the associated
frequency—domain properties of these data shed on familiar questions like
the "leads and lags" of monetary and financial aspects of economic fluctuations?
          ]\s would be expected, frequency—domain methods immediately confirm
the presence of strong cyclical comovements along the lines reported in
Section II. The top two panels of Figure 2 show     the respective power

spectra of rtoney growth and credit growth, estimated using the fuLl sets

of   available post-war quarterly data spanning 1947 :I-l982:IV   for money and

1952:I-l982:IV    for credit.23 Both spectra display substantial "noise"
at high    frequencies    say, 1.5 radians and above. More importantly from

the perspective of the questions addressed here, both also display

significant power at or near frequencies plausibly related to recognized

business    cycles. The record of seven complete cycles from the peak in
1948:IV to that in 1981:111 implies a mean cycle length of just under 19
calendar quarters, equivalent to a frequency of almost exactly 1/3 radian.
The spectra of both money growth and credit growth display sharp spikes at
just that point.

          Closer    analysis of these two power spectra indicates, however, that

the    respective    frequency-domain properties of money and credit growth

are not identical. In the range of .20— .79 radian, corresponding to a

period    of 2—8 years, the value of the test statistic for the null hypothesis
of no difference between the two spectra is 3.90 (distributed normally with
22 degrees of freedom), indicating that the two spectra do differ
significantly at the .01 level.24 One way to explore further the nature
of   this difference in the frequency-domain properties of money and credit

growth is to examine their respective coherences with real income growth,

shown in the bottom two panels of Figure 2. Not surprisingly, both

coherences display increases at about 1/3 radian. In the same range of

.20— .79 radian, the coherence of real income growth with money growth is

.98 with standard error .01, while the coherence of real income growth with
                                                  25
credit growth is .96 with standard error .02.

          In   the same vein as the analysis of lead and lag relationships via the
bivariate exogeneity tests reported above, a plausible question to ask in
this    context is whether these respective coherences indicate that either

money growth or credit growth, or both, tend to lead real income growth.

In fact, both do so, and credit      sonwhat more so, although the indicated
leads are both surprisingly short in comparison to those usually suggested
in the time-domain literature. Money growth leads real income growth by        a

phase   angle   of only .11 radian (or .35 quarter, based on the 20 quarter

midpoint of the 2-8 year range) with standard error .05, while credit

growth leads real income growth by .32 radian (or 1.02 quarters) with

standard error .06. Even so, the difference between these two leads is not

statistically significant. The value of the test statistic for the null
                                          —33—




hypothesis of no difference between the two         coherences   in the same .20— .79

radian range is only .39 (distributed as a t-statistic           with   22 degrees of

freedom) ,   not   significant at any reasonable level.

         In addition, in the same vein as the analysis of partial relationships

via the multivariate exogeneity tests reported above, a further plausible

question to ask in this context is whether the partial coherence of either

money growth or credit growth with real income growth is significantly

different from zero — in other words, whether either adds significantly

to explaining the frequency—domain properties of real income growth —

given the presence of the other. \s is largely consistent with the
time—domain     results, the answer is no in both cases • For       the same range

of   .20- .79   radian,   the values of the relevant test statistic (distributed
as an F-statistic with 2       and 20 degrees    of freedom) are .04    for   the
additional      role of money growth and .42 for the additional role of credit

growth. Neither value is significant at any reasonable level.

V. Statistical Significance and Economic Significance

       The results of the stability tests reported in Tables 10 and 15 indicate

strong evidence of statistically significant differences, between one

time period and another, in both bivariate and multivariate relationships

summarizing the monetary and financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations.

For many purposes, however, the statistical significance of such differences

does not necessarily mean that they are significant in a broader economic

sense. After all, two corresponding coefficients, estimated for different

time periods, can differ by an amount that is statistically significant

but economically trivial if each is individually measured with sufficient

precision. In addition, in dynamic relationships involving several coefficients,

offsetting shifts in different coefficients can. leave important properties

of the resulting overall relationship unaffected.

       The structural shifts in the monetary and financial aspects of the

u.s. business cycle experience reported above are signficiant not just

statistically but economically as well. Table 16 shows the full sets of

estimation results for the bivariate annual relationship between real income

growth and money growth summarized in the top panel of Table 9, for 1919-40,

1947—65 and 1966-82, respectively. As Table 10 shows, the data indicate

statistically signficant shifts in these two estimated relationships.

Comparison of the three full sets of results shown in Table 16 confirms that

these significant differences are typically due not to small changes in a

few precisely measured coefficients but to one or even several quite large

changes, sometimes even involving switches of sign.

       Figure 3 shows the implications of the differences among these

respective sets of estimated coefficients for the overall relationship

between real income growth and money growth by tracing out the first ten
years of the dynamic response pattern exhibited by the solved—out (but not
orthogonalized) moving-average representation of each of the three estimated
bivariate autoregressions. The implied own—disturbance responses shown in
the   upper left and lower right panels of the figure are roughly similar

among the three systems, but the implied cross—disturbance responses

shown in the upper right and lower left panels diverge sharply and even

include differences in the direction of the initial responses.

         Table 17 and Figure 4 present analogous sets of estimation results

and associated dynamic response patterns for the bivariate annual relationship

between real income growth and credit growth summarized in the middle panel

of Table 9. Here again large differences appear among corresponding

coefficients estimated for different time     periods,   as do readily visible

differences among the implied response patterns, especially for the respective

cross—responses. In addition, further results (not shown) indicate

similar large differences for systems relating the growth of either money

or credit to nominal income gowth1 as well as for systems relating either real or

nominal income growth to the change in short—term interest rates. Finally,

still further results (also not shown) indicate large differences in the

results for analogous systems based on quarterly data, estimated for

1947:I—l965:IV and   1966:I—1982:IV.
         In sum, the differences between one time period and another that

characterize the monetary and financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations

have been significant both statistically and economically, reflecting major

differences in the magnitude as well as the timing of the comovements between

income and money, credit and interest rates.

 vi. The Credit Ojcle

          A final financial aspect of U.S. economic fluctuations that bears

 investigation here is the familiar "credit cycle" by which the economy's

public and private sectors alternate over the business cycle in their

respective volumes of credit market borrowing. In brief, the basic idea

behind this familiar notion is that federal government reliance on the

credit market typically bulges when weakness in the economy enlarges the

government's budget deficit, while the private sector's borrowing does just

the   opposite as a   consequence of the cyclical variation of typically debt-

financed   spending. 2s a result, federal government borrowing is greater in
economic contractions than in expansions, while private sector borrowing is
greater in expansions than in contractions. This cyclical regularity is
broadly familiar in somewhat    general terms, although to date little if any

forinalanalysis   of it has appeared.
          Table 18 summarizes the main outlines of this regularity by showing
the respective quarterly average growth rates of federal government debt and
the remainder of domestic nonfinancial credit (including the debt of state and
local governments) during    the six and one—half recognized business cycles

since  1953. In part because of the lag of federal tax receipts behind
fluctuations in economic activity, but also in part because of the upward
secular trend in the growth rate of federal debt outstanding (as budget

deficits have grown, while the level of federal debt outstanding has shrunk,
relative to nonfinancial economic activity), the basic regularity of the
"creditcycle" is more uniformly descriptive of private than of public
borrowing.26 In four contractions out of six, average federal debt growth
was faster than in the preceding expansion, but the mean difference in

growth rates between contractions and expansions has been less than 1/2%

per annum. By contrast, private debt growth in each expansion has been

faster than in the preceding contraction, while private debt growth in

each   contraction has been slower than in the preceding expansion, resulting
in a mean growth rate in expansions fully 2% per annum greater than in
contractions.
         Attempts   to analyze the dynamic aspects of these regularities using

the same time-domain results applied in Section IV yielded few interesting

results, but the corresponding frequency—domain results do bear inspection.

The top two panels of Figure 5 show the respective power spectra of

federal and private sector     debt growth, estimated using quarterly data for
1952:I-l982:IV. The spectrum for federal debt growth displays an obvious
spike at almost exactly the mean cyclical frequency of 1/3 radian, while
that   for private debt growth exhibits a large spike at a frequency only

moderately higher. In contrast to the results reported in Section IV for

the growth of money and credit, the respective frequency—domain properties

of federal and   private   debt growth do not exhibit significant differences.

In the range of .20—.79 radian, the value of the test statistic for the

null hypothesis of no difference between these two spectra is only .44

(distributed normally with 22 degrees of freedom), not    significant at
any reasonable level. The bottom two panels of Figure 5 show the respective
coherences of federal debt growth and private debt growth with real income

growth. Both show increases at about 1/3 radian, although the coherences

are smaller than those reported above for the growth of money and credit.

In the same range of .20— .79 radian, the coherence of real income growth

with federal debt growth is .36 with standard error .19, while the

coherence between private debt growth and real income growth is .77 with

standard error .09.

      In addition to this evidence of regular comovements of federal and

private debt growth with real income growth at cyclical frequencies, the

associated phase relationships (corresponding to leads and lags in the

time domain) provide some support for the idea that private borrowing

activity helps in part to determine real income   while   the federal

government's budget posture reacts passively.27 Federal debt growth lags

real income growth by a phase angle of 1.47 radians (or 4.7 quarters)

with standard error .55, while private debt growth leads real income

growth by a phase angle of .97 radians (or 3.1 quarters) with a standard

error or .18. Despite the small standard errors,however, these apparent

differences are not statistically significant. The value of the test

statistic for the null hypothesis of no difference between the two

coherences in the same .20- .79 radian range is only .002 (distributed as

a t-statistic with 22 degrees of freedom).

      Similar   negative results emerge from asking whether either federal
debt growth or private debt growth significantly contributes to explaining
the frequency-domain properties of real income growth in the presence of the
other.28 In the range of .20- .79 radian, the values of the test statistic
(distributed as an F-statistic with 2 and 20 degrees of freedom) for the
partial coherence of real income growth with federal debt growth and with
private debt growth — in each case taking the other as given — are
respectively 1.49 and .17. Neither is significant at the .10 level.
     In sum, there is evidence of a "credit cycle" in the sense of regular

movements of federal and private sector debt growth, and regular comovements
                                    —39—




of each with real income   growth, at cyclical frequencies. In addition,
there is some indication that private debt growth leads real income

growth while federal debt growth lags, but the differences between

these respective comovements are not statistically significant, nor does

either federal or private debt growth contain significant information

about real income growth beyond what is also in the other.

      There can be no doubt that economic fluctuations in the United

States have their monetary and financial side. The comovements among
money, credit,   interest rates and nonfinancial economic activity are

evident enough at the crudest eyeball level of inspection, as well as

in the results of sore sophisticated time— and frequency—domain exercises.

Moreover, many of these comoveitents have coincided with major historical

business cycle episodes.

        On closer inspection, however, these monetary and financial aspects

of U.S. economic fluctuations exhibit few quantitative regularities

that   have persisted unchanged across spans of time in which the nation's
financial markets have undergone profound and far reaching changes.
The evidence for the absence of such persistent quantitative regularities
assembled in this paper shows major differences among the pre World
War I, inter—war, and post World War II periods, and between the first

and second halves of the post—war period. Evidence suggesting changes

from one period to another repeatedly emerges, regardless of whether

the method of analysis is simple or sophisticated, regardless of whether

the underlying data are annual or quarterly, and regardless of whether

the relationships under study are bivariate or multivariate. Moreover,

the differences between one period and another reported here are significant

not just statistically but economically as well, in the sense of major

differences in the magnitude and timing of cyclical comovements.

        The paper's main message, therefore, is a warning against accepting

too readily —    either   as a matter of positive economics or for policy

purposes — the appearance of simple and eternal verities in much of the
                                   —41—



existing literature of monetary and financial aspects of business fluctuations.

More complicated models involving many variables and/or nonlinear

relationships may have remained stable, but the evidence clearly shows that

simple linear relationships among only a few such variables have not.

*1 am grateful to Diane Coyle and Ken Weiller for research assistance and

helpful discussions; to them as well as Stephen Golcifeld, Allan Meltzer,

Ibert Gordon and other participants in the NBER business cycles conference

for   useful comments on an earlier draft; and to the National Science
Foundation and      the   Alfred P.   Sloan   Foundation for research support.
1.    Stock prices have also attracted substantial attention in a business

      cycle context, but less so than has been the case for money, credit

      and interest rates.

2.    See, for example, de Leeuw and Gramlich (1968, 1969), Pndo (1974) , and

      Modigliani and 2ndo (1976).

3. See, for example, Anderson and Jordan (1968) and Anderson and Carison

      (1970) .    These models are really reduced—form in spirit, however.

      See Jonson (1976) for an example of an attempt at a more structural

      rendering of the same ideas.

4. Empirical work to date among these lines has mostly adopted a

                 approach. See, for example, King and Plosser (1981)
      reduced—form

5. Much earlier on the Bank of the United States had constituted a
      rudimentary form of central bank, but it passed         out of   existence when
      Andrew Jackson declined to renew its charter in 1832.            From then until
      the   passage of the National Banking Act in 1864, private commercial

      banks were chartered exclusively by the individual states. Thereafter,

      until 1914, federally chartered banks enjoyed a monopoly over the

      note—issuing power but continued (as they do today) to share other

      banking    functions, like deposit taking, with state chartered banks.
6. The discussion that follows focuses narrowly on the financial
      markets and therefore omits such important elements of the changing
      role   of government as taxes, government spending, bankruptcy

      arrangennts, and so on — all of which could importantly affect the

      relationships between monetary and financial variables and levels of

      economic activity.

 7. The underying data are annual averages centered on June 30. From

      1890 to 1907 the annual data are averages of quarterly figures.

      From 1908 to 1945 they are averages of end-of-month data. From

      1947 to 1975 they are averages of daily—average monthly data.

 8. The underlying data, constructed for this paper, are annual

      averages of monthly data, including end—of—month data through

      1946 and daily-average data since 1947.     (The Federal Peserve has

      constructed the official new Ml series back only to 1959.)

 9. The underlying data are end—of—year data. The domestic nonfinancial

      credit concept is roughly analogous to 8primary    securities"   in the

      sense of Gurley and Shaw (1960).

10. The      data are annual averages of daily—average monthly data.
11. The expansion ending in 1948:IV officially began in 1945:IV, but
      the analysis here and below excludes it   so as   to avoid any remaining
      effects due to the wartime economy.
12.   The table excludes credit growth for the first contraction and

      expansion   because quarterly credit data are available only from
      1952:1   onward.

13. It is at first tempting to suggest that, given the upward secular
      trend, the lower average levels for expansions are simply due to the
      omission of      the expansion that began in 1982:IV; but any such

      claim would,     of course, be merely a forecast.
14.   From 1929 to 1982 the underlying GNP data are the standard National

      Income and Product Accounts estimates. From 1909 to 1928 the data are

      U.S. Department of Commerce estimates which (in principle) are

      analogous to the subsequent N.I.P.A. estimates at the aggregate level.

      From 1890 to 1908 the data are Department of Commerce estimates based

      t-rn             (1Q1
15.   In addition, because the underlying variables are serially correlated,

      the conventional statistical confidence levels indicated in Table 3

      are    overstated.
16. See Cramer (1983), for example, for evidence on the different respective
      movements of income and total transactions.
17.   The reason for calculating the relationships among the nonfinancial

      variables    a second time in the lower half of the table is that
      quarterly credit data are not available for the first post—war
      contraction and expansion. The same point applies to Table 7 below.
18. The      underlying vector autoregressions include a constant term and

      and two   lags   on each variable in each equation. The results for

      analogous autoregressions also including a linear time trend are

      broadly similar. (The most interesting difference to emerge on the

      introduction of a time trend is that Ml no longer helps explain

      nominal income.) Io lags appear to be sufficient to eliminate most,

      if not all, of the serial correlation in the residuals of the

      equations based on these annual data. Because each equation includes

      lags on both variables, and therefore a rational distributed lag,
      there is of course   no limitation on the length of lag in the economic
      process   represented.

19. The underlying vector autoregression systems include a constant term

      and four lags on each variable in each equation.     (The discussion

      of lag length in footnote 18 applies here too.) Once again, the

      results for analogous autoregressions also including a linear time

      trend are broadly similar.

20. In this system the most interesting difference to appear on the

      introduction of a time trend is that the one variable which

      helps explain real income growth is not money growth but the change

      in short—term interest rates.

21. In this system real growth in turn helps explain money growth but not

      credit growth.

22. In this system real growth in turn helps explain money growth but not

      credit growth nor the interest rate change.

23. This exercise relies on data for the full post—war period, despite the

      time—domain   evidence of structural change within that period, so   as

      to provide enough observations to make the frequency—domain analysis

      sensible. Both spectra, as well as the coherences displayed below,

      were estimated using a triangular window with bandwidth 11..

24.   I am grateful to Jim Powell for assistance in constructing the

      tests,    and for calculating the test statistics and their
      distributions, reported here and in Section VI below.
25. With the estimated coherences so close to unity, the calculated
      standard errors are not well behaved.
26. See Friedman (1983b) for a discussion of the divergent trends in
      federal deficits and federal debt outstanding in relation to economic
      activity.
27. This idea is consistent with a cyclical role for "credit crunches.
     It is also consistent with the fact that only some one—fourth
     of the cumulative federal budget deficit incurred during the
    period under study here would have emerged if the economy had
    remained at "high employment" throughout; see again, for example,
    Friedman (l983b).
28. The lack of significance here parallels the results of time—domain
    exogeneity tests.
