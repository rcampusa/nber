              PATH DEPENDENCE IN AGGREGATE OUTPUT

                            ABSTRACT


     This paper studies an economy in which incomplete markets
and strong complementarities interact to generate path dependent
aggregate output fluctuations. An economy is said to be path
dependent when the effect of a shock on the level of aggregate
output is permanent in the absence of future offsetting shocks.
Extending the model developed in Durlauf 11991(a),(b)). we
analyze the evolution of an economy which consists of a countable
infinity of industries. The production functions of individual
firms in each industry are nonconvex and are linked through
localized technological complementarities. The productivity of
each finn at t is determined by the production decisions of
technologically similar industries at t-1. No markets exist
which allow finns and industries to exploit complementarities by
coordinating production decisions. This market incompleteness
produces several interesting effects on aggregate output
behavior. First, multiple stochastic equilibria exist in
aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished by
differences in both the mean and the variance of output. Second,
output movements are path dependent as aggregate productivity
shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the economy
across equilibria. Third, when aggregate shocks are recurrent,
the economy cycles between periods of boom and depression.
Simulations of example economies illustrate how market
incompleteness can produce rich aggregate dynamics.

Introduction
        Recent developments in theoretical macroeconomics have emphasized the
potential for multiple, Pareto-rankable equilibria to exist for economies where various
Arrow-Debreu assumptions are violated. Authors such as Diamond [19821 and Cooper
and John [1988] have emphasized how incomplete markets can lead to coordination
failure as economies may become trapped in Pareto-inferior equilibria; lEcHer [1986, 1990]
and Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny [1989] have obtained similar results due to imperfect
competition. These different approaches share the idea that strong complementarities in
behavior can lead to multiplicity. Intuitively, when technological or demand spillovers
make agents sufficiently interdependent, high and low levels of activity can represent
internally consistent equilibria in the absence of complete, competitive markets. Most of
these models describe multiple steady states in economies rather than multiple
nondegenerate time series paths and consequently cannot address issues of aggregate
fluctuations.1 Further, this literature has not shown how economies can shift across
equilibria, inducing periods of boom and depression.
        A separate empirical literature has concluded that output fluctuations are
strongly persistent. Researchers such as Campbell and Mankiw [19871, Durlauf 11989]
and Phillips [1990] have concluded from a variety of perspectives that aggregate output in
advanced industrialized economies contains a unit root. Perron [1989], on the other hand,
has argued that real GNP data reflects one or two trend breaks. One interpretation of
this result is that the probability density characterizing innovations to a stochastic trend
places a large weight on zero. Hamilton 11988] finds evidence of persistence in the sense
that the mean of permanent output movements is a function of whether the economy is
in a state of boom or recession. Despite differences in both the methodologies and
conclusions of work on output persistence, this literature has generally concluded that


        1lmportant exceptions to this claim are Diamond and Fudenberg [1990], which
describes how self-fulfilling expectations lead to cycles in search models and Heller 11990]
which models multiple capital accumulation paths in models with imperfect competition.

long run forecasts of real activity are strongly dependent on some part of contemporary
fluctuations.
        One interpretation of the many results on output persistence is that real activity
is path dependent'— the long term behavior of output is affected by the sample path
realization of the economy. This notion has been employed to understand such
phenomena as the evolution of particular technologies (David [1986,1988], Arthur [1989]),
the distribution of trading patterns (Krugrnan [1990,1991)) and the emergence of multiple
equilibria in aggregate activity (Durlauf [1991(a),(b)]). David [1988] argues that path
dependent models can provide a general framework for integrating economic theory with
economic history. The literature on path dependence has generally argued that the
realized pattern of economic activity induces intertemporal complementarities in
production, which leads to multiple time series paths for the same economy. As such,
this literature contains ideas very similar to the work on multiple equilibria and
coordination failure.
        One definition of path dependence, which we employ in this paper, is as follows.
Suppose that aggregate output in the economy, Y2, is a measurable function of some set
of exogenous variables.2 Denote the u-algebra characterizing the history of these
exogenous variables as      which  means that Y e 1Y. Innovations to the exogenous
variables lie in the changes in the sequence of c-algebras, i.e.    — j3. Further,
suppose that the stochastic process characterizing the exogenous variables has the
property that for all I greater than some fixed date T, a4— a = 0, which means that
no new innovations affect the economy after 7'.   Aggregate output is path dependent if


                  limProl4E(Yr+ I           — E(YT+S    a0) = 0) c 1.                 (1)


This definition says that the particular sample path realization of a sequence of

        2Observe that the mapping from the exogenous variables to Y will generally be a
function of the stochastic process governing the exogenous variables.

                                            2
innovations can have indefinite effects on real activity. One may verify that models with
unit roots, trend breaks, or state dependent growth rates are all path dependent according
to this definition. At the same time, the definition incorporates stationary, nonergodic
economies as well as economies which shift between equilibria.          Path dependent
economies exhibit substantial output persistence as the effects of an economy's realized
sample path can have permanent effects in the absence of offsetting future shocks.
        The purpose of the current paper is to understand the implications of models of
multiple equilibria for path dependence. We do this by modelling coordination problems
in an explicitly stochastic framework.As developed in Durlauf [1991(a),(b)1, the
microeconomic specification of the economy is expressed as a set of conditional
probability measures describing how individual agents behave given the economy's
history. An aggregate equilibrium exists when one can find a joint probability measure
over all agents which is consistent with these conditional measures; multiplicity occurs
when more than one such measure exists. This approach, by expressing the equilibrium
of the economy as a stochastic process, permits one to describe directly the time series
properties of aggregate fluctuations along different equilibrium paths.
        Specifically, we examine the capital accumulation problems of a set of infinitely-
lived industries. We deviate from standard analyses in two respects. First, firms in each
industry face a nonconvex production technology.           Second, industries experience
technological complementarities as past high production decisions by each industry
increase the current productivity of several industries. Learning-by-doing is one example
of this phenomenon. Industries do not coordinate production decisions because of
incomplete markets. By describing how output levels and productivity evolve as
industries interact over time, the model characterizes the impact of complementarities
and incomplete markets on the structure of aggregate fluctuations.
        Our basic results are threefold.           First, we show that with strong
complementarities and incomplete markets, multiple stochastic equilibria can exist in
aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished by differences in both the mean and


                                             3
the variance of output. Second, we illustrate how aggregate output movements will be
persistent as aggregate productivity shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the
economy across equilibria. Third, we provide conditions on the aggregate productivity
shocks which will cause the economy to cycle across equilibria. Although the current
model does not exhibit a unit root, one will emerge if deterministic technical change is
introduced.
          Section I of this paper outlines the evolution of an economy composed of a large
set of industries whose production functions are linked by localized intertemporal
complementarities.     Section II describes how multiple equilibria can arise when the
economy experiences industry-specific shocks. Section HI explores the implications of
aggregate or economy-wide shocks for path dependence. Section IV simulates several
examples of the economy to see what sort of time series patterns emerge in aggregate
output. Section V contains summary and conclusions. A Technical Appendix follows
which contains proofs of all Theorems.


L A model of interacting industries


          Consider a countable infinity of industries indexed by L3 Each industry consists
of many small, identical firms. All firms produce a homogeneous good; industries are
distinguished by distinct production functions rather than distinct outputs.            The
homogeneous final good may be consumed by the owners of the firms or converted to a
capital good which fully depreciates after one period.           Industry i behavior is

      3Durlauf [1991(a)] derives a general equilibrium version of this economy where
consumers are risk neutral, as the expected utility of consumer r takes the form

                               U,t =     E( P'Cr,t+jIWt).
                                          3=0
When agents are risk neutral, the weights fi' correspond to date-zero Arrow-Debreu
prices. Our model is therefore a variant of the economy analyzed in Brock and Mirman
[1972).

industries employing nonconvex technologies. Production occurs with a one period lag;
firms at 1—1 employ both one of two production techniques and a level of capital to
determine output at t. Only one technique may be used at a time. Cooper [1987]
originally introduced this production function to model coordination problems; Murphy,
Shleifer, and Vishny [1989] exploit a similar technology to analyze multiple equilibria in
economic development.       Milgrom and Roberts (1990] discuss how these              sorts   of
nonconvexities can arise as firms internally coordinate many complementary activities to
achieve efficiency. The technique-specific production functions produce Y1 and
through

    and t       are industry-specific productivity shocks; . is an aggregate productivity
shock and F     is a fixed overhead capital cost. t_1,         'i—i' and —i are elements of
2_i•   Recalling that firms within an industry are identical, we define a technique choke
variable   w which equals 1 if technique        1   is used by industry i at i, 0 otherwise and
   = {...w1_1, ,c&; ''i+1, ) which equals the joint set of techniques employed at 1.
           We place several restrictions on the production technologies.           First, each


                                                    5
technique fulfills standard curvature conditions. Further, we associate technique 1 with
high production. Specifically, net capital NK1, which equals K c' for technique 1 and
K1 for technique 2, has a strictly higher marginal (and by implication total) product
when used with technique 1 than technique 2. A firm chooses technique 1 if it is willing
to pay fixed capital costs in exchange for higher output.

         Both techniques are assumed to exhibit technological complementarities, as the
history of realized activity determines the parameters of the production function at I
Homer's [1986] model of social increasing returns shares this feature. Arrow [1962]
postulated that these types of productivity spillovers could occur due to learning-by-
doing. Our specification of complementarities differs from Homer's in two respects.
First, all complementarities are local as the production function of each firm is affected
by the production decisions of a finite number of industries. The index i orders industries
by similarity in technology; spillovers occur only between similar technologies. David
[1988) and Rosenberg [1982] describe the historical importance of local complementarities


                                                6
in the evolution of technical innovations. Second, our complementarities are explicitly
dynamic. Past production decisionsaffect current productivity, which captures the idea
of learning-by-doing.
       Specifically, we model the complementarities through the dependence of the
productivity shocks ( and m on the history of technique choices. This form for the
complementarities is appropriate when the amount of time spent at an activity is the
appropriate metric for the rate of learning-by-doing.         These intertemporal
complementarities are assumed to be the only source of dependence across shocks. In
addition, the aggregate productivity shocks obey a Markov process.4 Prob(r Iv) denotes
the conditional probability measure of z given information v Ak: = (i—k...i...i-1-l}

        Markets are assumed to be missing in the sense that individual firms cannot
coordinate to exploit complementarities. Consequently, no industry may be compensated
for choosing technique 1 in order to expand the production sets of other industries; nor,

        4This assumption is made for technical convenience; in particular, all of our
results still hold if there is feedback from the level of real activity at 1—1 to

                                                7
given our conceptualization of industries as aggregates of many small producers, can firms
within an industry strategically choose a technique in order to induce higher future
productivity through complernentarities. Further, firms are assumed to be unable to
combine under joint management in order to internalize the complementarities.
        It is straightforward to verify, from standard dynamk programming arguments,
that profit maximization by each firm implies that K1 is chosen to solve


                        suP(flfl(K-_FC ,e3—K1 ,f3f2(K1, t'tli, e)—K1,)                  (4)


so long as the K1 is feasible V i. These capital choices are feasible whenever aggregate
output is sufficiently large at i—i. Without loss of generality, we place an additional
restriction on the level of output produced each period which ensures that the supply of
potential capital is as least as great as the demand implied by eq. (4) in all periods,
which renders the economy stationary.

                                                            and   .
        Under Assumptions 1-3, it is straightforward to verify that the technique choice
    is a stationary and measurable function of (,                     Further, Assumption 2
places strong restrictions on the conditional technique choice probabilities.


Theorem 1. Structure of conditional technique choice probabilities


The conditional technique choice probabilities obey stationary measures of the form




                                             8
             Prob(w111 I        = Prob(w,1   I

        Once technique choices are determined, one can solve for the optimal levels of
capital and output for each firm. In fact, a sufficient condition for the existence of
equilibrium capital and output sequences for all firms is the existence of a joint
probability measure over all technique choices which is consistent with the conditional
measures in Theorem 1. To see this, observe that the optimal choices of output and
capital for all industries at all dates obey the same conditional probability structure as
the technique choices,


   Proh(L'1 t' Yi,vKi,t I       = Froô(w1,       'i 1,K w11_1 I e                ' E(1 I a1)), (6)

which means that the existence of a joint measure over the technique choices is equivalent
to the existence of a joint measure over all output and capital decisions.
        The existence of an equilibrium may therefore be verified once it is established
that the initial conditions and transition probabilities in this economy always generate a
joint probability measure over {w0,w1,._wj, the set of technique choices over all
industries and all dates. The existence of an equilibrium can therefore be reduced to the
question of when a set of conditional probabilities may be extended to define a joint
probability measure over a set of random variables indexed by Z2, the two-dimensional
lattice of integers. Dobrushin 11968] has given conditions characterizing when such an
extension exists.5       The localized structure of our complementarities ensures that
Dobrushin's criteria are satisfied, which leads to Theorem 2.

         5The Kolmogorov Extension Theorem cannot be directly applied since we are
working with conditional probabilities rather than unconditional probabilities over all
finite sets of the stochastic process               Unlike the Kolmogorov Extension
Theorem, Dobrushin's Theorem does not show the joint measure is unique.

H. Long run behavior under industry-specific shocks


         In order to see how industry-specific and economy-wide shocks interact to affect
the aggregate equilibrium, we first consider the case where e = 0, no economy-wide
shocks exist.
      We restrict the conditional probabilities in order to discuss multiplicity and
dynamics. Past choices of technique 1 are assumed to improve the current relative
productivity of the technique. As a result, technique 1 choices will propagate over time.
Further, we assume that w=l is a steady state, which means that when all productivity
spillovers are active, the effects are so strong that high production is always optimal.


Aumption 4. Impact of past technique choices on current technique probabilities6

Let c and / denote two realizaüons of             If W Wj ViE Ak,, then

B. Pro6(w = 1              = 1 V 5€ Ak,) = 1.

        Whenever some industry chooses 4 = 0, a positive productivity feedback is lost.
Different configurations of choices at t—1 determine different production sets and

        his assumption can be reformulated in terms of restrictions on the technique-
specific production functions.

choice probabilities from below and above by erI and     errt respectively.

        Since        is an equilibrium, the aggregate economy exhibits multiple equilibria
if for some initial conditions, ç'rz4 fails to emerge as I grows. Notice that even if 'o =?
favorable   productivity shocks will periodically induce industries to produce using
technique 1. The choice of technique 1 by one industry, through the complementarities,
increases the probability that the technique is subsequently chosen in several industries.
With strong spillovers, these effects may build up, allowing wr1 to emerge from any
initial conditions. The model therefore allows us to analyze the stability of a high
aggregate output equilibrium from arbitrary initial conditions.
         In fact, the limiting behavior of the economy is determined by the bounds err
and   err'.   If the probability of high production by an industry is sufficiently large for
all production histories, then the spillover effects induced by spontaneous technique I
choices cause the economy to iterate towards high production. Alternatively, if technique
1 probabilities are too low in the absence of active spillovers, spontaneous technique 1
chokes will not generate sufficient momentum to achieve the            equilibrium.   e'r
and   err' bound the degree of complementarity in the economy. Large values of err
imply complementarities are weak as technique 1 is chosen relatively frequently regardless
of the past. Conversely, small values of err' imply strong complementarities; the
probability of current high production is very sensitive to past technique choices.
Theorem 3 shows how long run industry behavior is jointly determined by initial
conditions and conditional technique probabilities.


Theorem 3. Conditions for uniqueness versus multiplicity of long run equilibrium



                                             11

If complementarities are sufficiently strong, no industry converges to the high production

If cornplementarities are sufficiently weak, each industry converges to the high production
technique almost surely from economy-wide low production technique initial conditions.


        One can associate w1=1 with the equilibrium which would emerge if all firms
chose their production levels cooperatively. If production through technique 1 is
sufficiently higher for w=l versus any other configuration, then wzrt     emerges   as the
cooperative equilibrium after one period, as firms and industries will all choose technique
1 at t = 1 in order to achieve the productivity spillovers. Consequently, incompleteness
of markets lowers the mean and increases the variance of industry and aggregate output
along the inefficient equilibrium path, as technique choices fluctuate over time. When
industries fail to coordinate, production decisions become dependent on idiosyncratic
productivity shocks. Observe that the volatility associated with the inefficient
equilibrium is caused by fundamentals. Simulations in Durlauf [1991(a)] show that
aggregate output can obey a wide range of Alt processes, depending on the values of the
transition probabilities.


ILL Path dependence and economy-wide shocks

        7One can also show that lint       Prob(u.'t = 1   = 9) = 0, the economy almost
surely fails to converge to the high päiction equilibrium.

                                           12
         Now consider the role of the economy-wide shocks E• By affecting many
industries simultaneously, these shocks act in a way analogous to changing the initial
conditions of the economy. Path dependence occurs as one realization of 4 pcnnanently
changes the equilibrium in the absence of future offsetting shocks. In order to illustrate
path dependence, it is necessary to restrict both the way in which the aggregate shocks
interact with the industry production decisions as well as the structure of the aggregate
shocks themselves.
        First, we assume that sufficiently unfavorable aggregate productivity draws make
the choke of technique 1 unlikely whereas sufficiently favorable draws ensure the use of
the technique. This means that particular aggregate productivity realizations can have
very powerful aggregate output effects.


Assumptioll 5. Impact of economy-wide shocks on technique choice


There exist numbers a and 6, a < 0 c   b,   with Pro b(1   a)   and Prob(.   6)   both nonzero,
such that


A. Prob(a;1 =        E a,         = 1 ViE Ak,,)

B. Prob(w1 = 1 Le b,        w_1 =0 VjE A&,) = 1.

            To understand our final assumption, it is useful to express 4 (which by
Assumption 2.C is Markov) as


                                       = g(E1...1)+p,,                                      (8)

 of this type is necessary if an extreme draw of fr is to have lasting effects; Assumption 6
 provides a simple sufficient condition.

If >0 then s(C1) 0; if4 0 then g() S

         When Assumptions 5 and 6 hold, economy-wide shocks can have an indefinite
effect on real activity.


Theorem 4. Path dependence due to economy-wide shocks


Let t = 0 V t> T and errx S                  The economy erhibits path dependence as the
realization of ET affects the limiting technique choice probabilities for all industries.


A. lim Prob(WIT+ = ii E <a) <1.

B.
     lim Prob(WIT÷. = iJ eT 6) = 1.

        This result shows how economy-wide shocks and consequently aggregate
fluctuations can be persistent. Persistence occurs when economy-wide shocks have the
effect of introducing new initial conditions in an economy with multiple equilibria. For
example, once many sectors simultaneously decline due to an adverse economy-wide
shock, productivity enhancing complementarities are lost until a subsequent favorable
economy-wide shock restores them.
        Several interpretations beyond productivity can be applied to the economy-wide
        8For example, this definition is fulfilled if   e=      +     p 0.

shocks. Interpreting e as a proxy for the financial sector, the model indicates how the
breakdown of financial institutions, such as occurred during the Depression, can cause
indefinite output loss. Alternatively, Durlauf [1991(a)] shows how       can represent the
cost of production inputs provided by leading sectors such as transportation or steel. In
this case, the growth of leading sectors improves the relative profitability of high
production, which can lead to a takeoff in growth as the economy shifts across equilibria.
        Fluctuations between the high and low equilibria will be triggered by movements
in the economy-wide shocks. The properties of          will determine whether the long run
behavior of aggregate output exhibits multiple equilibria in the following sense. When
the events ( a) and ( b) are recurrent, i.e. 4 enters•e.ach of the scts (—oo,a) and
(6,oo) infinitely often, then long run forecasts of the economy are unaffected by history in
the sense that any sample path history of the economy will, with probability 1, be
reversed by some future realization of the economy-wide shock.
        Conversely, if the event (     0)   is nonrecurrent, then the economy-wide shocks
will have permanent effects since the events (5 C a)   and (
                                                         &) will, with probability 1,
occur only a finite number of times. By Theorem 2, in the absence of economy-wide
shocks in all periods, the long run behavior of the economy can depend on initial
conditions. Further, so long as Prob(e1 a), Prob(.1 1'), Pro6(( =         0   ct_i Ca) and
Froô(.5t = o i 4_4 6) are all nonzero, then two different sample path realizations of the
same economy can converge to different average levels of output, as either high or low
production initial conditions may precede the period when each   becomes 0. This
specific example illustrates the more general proposition that models where initial
conditions matter may be thought of as path dependent models with special assumptions
on the distributions of certain variables. Theorem 5 summarizes these ideas.

Either equilibrium described in Theorem 3 can emerge.


IV. Time series properties of aggregate output


        In this section, we simulate the aggregate economy to see what sort of patterns
emerge in aggregate output fluctuations. We simulate economies based on the interaction
range Aii={i—1,i,i+l}. In each simulation, we construct a finite approximation to the
infinite economy consisting of 500 industries. Output per period by each industry is
normalized to equal 0 or 1. A {O,1} support for output may be justified by generalizing
Assumption 2 to model the two techniques as


                               = P if ic,t—1 k1(1,_11e1_1)
                               = 0 otherwise.

                               =   P2   if K1_1 K2('i111,e1_1)

                                             16
                                = 0 otherwise.                                          (11)


and then normalizing output.9 In this specification, each firm produces a fixed output
level for each technique, Y1 or '21 given a fixed capital input of Rj((1 —1C—1) or
K2(t,1,_1,C_1) respectively. Under the specification, the productivity shocks act to affect
capital input requirements rather than output.
        In constructing the simulations, it is necessary to place some restrictions on the
conditional production probabilities. First, we assume that the economy-wide shock        is
a Markov process with state space {—1,O,1) and transition matrix P.
        We equate the values —1 with the event (       a) and 1 with the event ( b) as
described in Section III. We correspondingly define the two conditional probabilities


                               = II "1,t_i'' I e tS,1, 4 = —i) =                        (12)


and


                       Frob(w11 =   ii w1, _1' 5€ Ak,,, ( = 1) = 1.                     (13)


        Finally, we reduce the number of relevant transition probability parameters to 3
when the economy-widc shock equals 0 by assuming that the associated conditional
probabilities obey


                     Prob(W1 = 1 IEw—1,_1 = 3,            = 0) = 1

                     Prob(w111 =   I IEw1_,,,_1 = 2,      = 0) =

order to preserve the structure of the conditional probability measures of the two
techniques as described in Sections H and III.

This structure can be interpreted as saying each local cornplement.arity has the same
effect on the production function. Simulations of this structure have shown that the
model is nonergodic when all transition probabilities are below .45.
        These restrictions specify the transition probabilities for all possible technique
choice histories. By varying P and 0, one can affect the time series properties of the
economy. For each simulation, we start with = Q and allow the economy to run for
2000 periods. In each case, a time series is computed for aggregate output. Each
regression was was constructed by using the last 1000 observations for all 500 industries.
        Our first set of simulations examines the behavior of the economy when the
transition probabilities obey

and     = .4,   e   = .35, 03 = .3. This specification has two important features. First,
economy-wide shocks are highly correlated. Second, the e             values   are such that the
economy possesses multiple equilibria when the economy-wide shocks equal 0. A sample
path realization of 80 industries over 80 periods is shown in Figure 1. As the Figure
indicates, the economy exhibits two separate regimes with substantially different levels of
mean activity and output volatility.10 Notice that even in periods of low aggregate

       10Durlauf [1991(a)] shows that aggregate output under the inefficient equilibrium
obeys V = .18+.49Y...1+.07Y_2+c1 when the economy-wide shocks are always 0.

output, some groups of industries experience periods of boom. This occurs due to the
interactions of the spontaneous production probability e3 with the productivity
spillovers. This feature illustrates how the model captures heterogeneity in industry
behavior during periods of economic decline. Aggregate output in this economy obeys


                                       = .15 + .77Y_1 + c.                          (16)

which means that the economy-wide shocks exhibit little persistence.       In this case,
aggregate output follows


                                       = .42 + .38Y.1 + Ct.                         (18)


The main difference between the two economies is that the degree of output persistence is
greatly reduced when the economy-wide shocks approach white noise. The AR coefficient
for aggregate output is reduced from .77 to .38. As Figure 2 shows, the economy shifts
between the two regimes quite frequently.
        Finally, Figure 3 illustrates the economy when the aggregate shocks are
uncorrelatcd yet tend to be concentrated around zero, i.e.

 In this case, aggregate output is described by

a process which exhibits substantial persistence. This equation best illustrates how the
incomplete markets structure acts as a propagation mechanism as white noise
productivity shocks lead to substantial autoregression in the aggregate output process.11
         Our next three simulations consider the behavior of the economy when only one
limiting equilibrium exists. This is done by setting 01 = .7, 02 = .65, 03 = .6. Figure 4
illustrates the behavior of a time series cross-section for the transition matrix P1. In this
case, the aggregate output equation is


                                         = .21 + .75Y1 + c.                             (21)

        For the transition matrix P2, aggregate output follows


                                         = .64 +             + Cr                       (22)


A realization of this economy may be seen in Figure 5.
        Finally, the P3 transition matrix generates the aggregate output equation


        11Recalling our earlier discussion, if the expected payoff from cooperation is high
enough, then the complete markets equilibrium is = V t, even in the presence of
aggregate shocks, which means that the complete markets equilibrium will exhibit no
volatility.

As before, substantial pcrsistence can be generated by white noise shocks interacting with
the dynamic complementarities. A sample realization appears in Figure 6.
         One interesting feature of Figures 4 to 6 is the evolution towards the high
equilibrium after negative productivity shocks. As the Figures indicate. (and the model
analytically implies for these parameter values), the percentage of industries choosing low
production gradually declines after = —1 realizations. This behavior suggests a reason
why business cycles may exhibit sharp rapid declines in output during recessions and
gradual periods of recovery. When the high production equilibrium is stable, aggregate
output will gradually adjust towards the equilibrium after negative economy-wide shocks.
On the other hand, when there are two equilibria, there is no tendency for the economy to
correct itself after large output declines. Consequently, our model implies a relationship
between the number of equilibria and the degree of asymmetry of the business cycle.


V. Summary and conclusions


         This paper has explored how economies can exhibit multiple equilibria and
output persistence as a consequence of dynamic coordination failure. These features arise
when strong technological complementarities interact with incomplete markets. Low
production initial conditions prevent an economy from realizing local technological
spillovers.   Further, economy-wide shocks can generate indefinite movements in total
output as local productivity feedbacks induced by complementarities emerge or disappear.
The model exhibits both path dependence of shocks as well as a mechanism for reversals
of booms and downturns.
         One application of these ideas is to explore whether output behavior during the
Depression and World War H can be described as movements across equilibria. Most
analyses of output behavior during the 1930's and 1940's have interpreted the Depression


                                           21
and recovery as the consequence of two large offsetting shocks rather than a result of one
shock which interacted with some sort of self-correcting mechanism in the aggregate
economy. The idea that the Depression was not self-correcting, yet was overcome by a
large aggregate demand shock is compatible with the model in this paper, when multiple
equilibria are present. An important empirical extension of the current paper is the
identification of complementarities in the time series patterns of industrial production
which are sufficiently strong to be consistent with our model. This approach is pursued
in Cooper and Durlauf [1991].

 Technical Appeiidix


 Proof of Theorem 1


       If a firm were constrained to use technique 1 each period, standard Euler
equation arguments (see Brock and Mirman [1972]) imply that an optimal capital
sequence {K1 j is implicitly defined by

                      ir1((1 E) = mzz         13f1(K1,                    1,        (A. 1)
                                      1,1,1

whereas   if the firm were constrained to use technique 2 each period, an optimal capital
sequence would obey


                                  =   mat 13f2(K2        , g')i, g,4)K2 i,t        (A.2)
                                        2,i,t

By our assumptions, 1((11,e,) and ir2(ii1,e,) are measurable functions of the
productivity shocks.
          Let   = 1 with probability 1 if ri((1e,) > ir2(?,1,E,), w1 = 1 with
probability .A((1,q,,4) if          = r3(t1,e,), and w = 0 with probability I if
         C ,r2(q,4).    This says that if one technique generates higher one period
profits than the other, it is chosen with certainty, whereas if the techniques generate
identical profits, technique 1 is chosen according to a time invariant function of the
productivity shocks. Any such rule generates a sequence of technique choices which are
consistent with the solution to a representative firm's maximization problem. Since all
firms within an industry are identical, we can conclude that w1 is a measurable function
of (,       and   e, We can rewrite




                                                23

      Conditioning w1,1 on           means that the terms C,rE((,e I
         I ff) and e—E(e I a_1) can be integrated out in (A.3), which
immediately yields Theorem 1, given the restrictions on the conditional probability
measures of (,        and    in Assumption 2.


Proof of Theorem 2


        Dobrushin [1968) provides conditions for proving the existence of a joint
probability measure which is consistent with a given set of conditional measures. We
verify Theorem 1 by proving the existence of a joint measure over the random vectors
     = {c1,,ii11,4,,wj. Observe that the random vectors        can be indexed by 2; we
let t/. =                                               denote the joint realizations of
the random vectors at each and      = {bo,tPi,...,tPt) denote the history of the random
vectors up to t.
        The first condition for showing the existence of a joint measure is to show that

conditional probabilities can be consistently defined over all finite combinations of *1'   r
To see this, specify any initial conditions *110. Given the specification of a stochastic
process for , and the conditional probability structure specified in Assumption 2 for (1,1
and q, one can compute the conditional probabilities for any %b as well as for any

finite set in 'P1. Repeating this procedure, it is possible to assign probabilities for any
finite set in W. Letting t*oo, this means that all conditional probabilities over finite
sets can be consistently defined.
         Second, we need to verify that for any finite set S and any 6 > 0, there exists a
finite set of elements, r(S, 6), S 1'(S, 6), such that



                                            24
                            I Prob(S r)—Prob(Sl W—S) I 6.                                     (A.4)

This condition immediately holds for the probability structure we have examined.
Consider the case S=b where the range of interactions is Ak j• Choose the surrounding
set   1' as



                  F = {øp,q such iha 0< p—il k+I, 0< IrtI k-i-I).

Let r' be any set of elements such that P n 1' = F' fl                  4'-   ft is clear, given the
localized Ak, conditional probability structure for    and      , and the fact that   is a
common element of all elements of t,b, that the conditional probability of any P, given F,
is equal to the conditional probability given F and


                               Prob(F' I            = Prob(F'   I)                            (A.5)


Since this is true for all sets F', it is also true for t,—F—&1 , he.

                                                                                              (A.8)

which shows that (A.4) holds for S=#,1. This argument generalizes to any finite set 5,
which proves that a joint measure exists over W and hence over {co,c±?i,...'aJ.


Proof of Theorem 3


        This Theorem is proven in Durlauf (1991(a)].


Proof of Theorem 4


        Theorem 4 is proved if we can show that for any vector w,


                 PrOb(WT+l     '&I e a, Pt = 0 V      1> T, rr
              Prob(ti1     I   =       =0   V t, Of' = Qk,,' ep         = err)    (A.10)

and


                Prob(T+jwIEr>o,proy1>T, erf'cek,)>
              Prob(w1    'I    = 1 = 0 V 1, ekE = k,l' o?z = °rr).                (A.11)

To see that eqs. (A.10) and (A.11) are sufficient to verify the Theorem, observe that
those inequalities imply, given 1) Assumption 4.A, which shows that the conditional
probability


                           Frob(WIT+. = I 'do = 'd       =0 V                     (A.12)



                                            26
is weakly increasing in i,    2)   Assumption 5 which bounds the conditional probability of
high production at t if E, 5 a or 4 6, and 3) Assumption 6, which restricts the
evolution of the aggregate shock after T, that


                               = lE' s a,       t = o Vt> 7', errs k,i) S

and


                 Proh(wjr÷. =      l14         6, t = 0 Vt> 7', e, <Gki)?
                      =      = J,             = 0 V 1> 7', i'7t=    erft= erJ)         (A.14)

V s>0. Second, note that Theorem S shows that if erfts Qk,,


      limPro6(i1r+5 = 1             =     E = 0 Vt>       7', err= k,I' eryr= err')>

which combined with (A.12) and (A.13) would verify Theorem 4.
        (A.11) is immediate since both probabilities in the weak inequality equal 1 under
our assumptions. To see that (A.10) holds, observe that


                 Prob(G,.T÷jwjEr<a, p=0Vt> T,errcek,) S
             Pro6(cr÷j       "21 ''T   = 1'     5 a,   p, = 0 V t> T, er?t< k,i)       (A.16)


Observe further that 1) by Assumption LA, Pro6(w7.i = 1         = 1' 4r 5 a, /2 = 0 V
t> 7', eçc k.l) 5 Q,, V i, and 2) by Assumption 2.D, the variables
WI,T+I_E(W,T+i I 'T = ! ET 5 a, = 0 V 1> T, err S Q,,) are independent across
all i. On the other hand, 1) by eq. (7), Frob(w11 = I "2o = I = 0 V t, err= k,l'


                                                 27
e?t =            =        and 2) by Assumption 2.D, the variables w1,1—E(w1,1 Iwo =
   = o 'u' i, e' = ek 1          = err') are independent across all i. Given Assumption
6, it therefore follows that




             Prob(w1   w = 0, 4 = 0 V t, err = k,l' 0gt7r = efl.                      (A.17)


Eqs. (A.15) and (A.16) imply eq. (A.1O), which completes the proof.


Proof of Theorem 5


        Part A of the Theorem follows immediately from the definition of a recurrent
Markov process. If the events (4 C    a) and (4      6) each occur infinitely often, then the
impact of any sample path realization of the economy up to I on forecasts of the level of
output at H-s will become zero with probability 1 if the forecast horizon s is sufficiently
large. To verify Part B, observe that if the event (4 0) is nonrecurrent, then 0 must
be an absorbing state for 4. Consequently, either of the equilibria characterized in
Theorem 3 can emerge if both (4 a) and (4 ii) are possible candidates to be the last
event before 4   becomes   zero. if Prob(41    Prob(41 6), Prob(4 = 0 I _1 a) and
                                               a),
Prob(4 = 0 I 4—.i 6) are all nonzero, then either equilibrium can emerge with positive
probability. Further, for large enough T, 4T+. = 0 with probability 1 V a> 0, which
means that the last nonzero 4 will permanently affect conditional long run forecasts.
