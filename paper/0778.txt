                  The Effects of Incomes Policies on the Frequency
                              and Size of Wage Changes


                                     ABSTRACT


     Along with house rents, wages have frequently been described as the
ttstickiestu prices in the economy, rarely adjusted more than once a year.
Because of this stickiness (which arises from the transactions costs in-
volved   in changing wages) ,distinction exists between the adjustment of
                                a

wages and the size of that adjustment. This distinction has important
implications for empirical investigations of the determinants of aggregate
money wage changes because the equations fitted in these studies are almost
invariably plagued with aggregation bias unless the non-synchronous pattern
of wage settlements in different sectors of the economy is taken into account.
This is a particularly relevant issue when evaluating the effectiveness
ofincomes policies since some policies have operated by postponing the
implementation of new wage settlements (in which case they are directed
towards the occurrence of the event) while other policies have taken the
form of specifying a permissible ceiling on wage increases (in which case
they are designed to affect the extent of occurrence of the event, but
not its occurrence). One purpose of this paper is to reevaluate the ef-
fectiveness of incomes policies by making use of information from one
industry both on the frequency of wage settlements and on the size of wage
changes when a settlement takes place. Our empirical work leads us to
conjecture whether the apparent "statistical significance" reported by
researchers with respect to the performance of variables in models of
aggregate wage changes reflects primarily the effects of these variables
on the probability of wages being adjusted rather than the effects on the
magnitude of wage changes conditional upon wages being adjusted.

I.     Introduction

       Theoretical models accounting for variations in the rate of wage or

price inflation rarely take explicit account of the costs of altering

money wages or prices1 and yet these models are often evaluated in terms

of their correspondence with data that presumably reflect the existence of

such costs. At least until the more inflationary experiences of the

1970's, the normal situation in British and American manufacturing

industry was for wage rates to be adjusted no more frequently than once a

year even when there were indications of substantial inflationary

pressures. The recognition of this point has induced economists to

incorporate in some fashion the varying time pattern of wage settlements

into their fitted models of wage inflation, but all have taken this

pattern as exogenously determined.2 By contrast, this paper considers the

determinants of the probability of a new wage settlement in addition to

the determinants of the size of the wage change conditional upon a new

settlement taking place. This distinction between the occurrence of an

event and the extent of the occurrence has been investigated in the

literature on the demand for durable goods (e.g., Cragg [1971]), on labor

force participation and hours of work (e.g., Heckinan [1974]) and on the

choice of transport modes (e.g., Domencich and McFadden [1979]), but with

few exceptions it has been neglected in empirical work on wage inflation.3

       Yet the distinction Is an important one with immediate relevance to

the evaluation of the effects of incomes policies on the course of wage

inflation. The typical procedure in this literature is to regress some

aggregate index of wage changes on dummy variables that indicate the

presence or absence of incomes policies. But this procedure does not make

full use of information about the form of these incomes policies. That

is, incomes policies have sometimes taken the form of specifying a

permissible ceiling on wage increases in which case they are designed to

affect the extent of occurrence of the event, but not the occurrence of

the event. On other occasions, incomes policies have operated by

postponing the implementation of new wage settlements in which case they

are directed towards the occurrence of the event. One purpose of this

paper is to reevaluate the effectiveness of incomes policies by making use

of information both on the frequency of wage settlements and on the size

of wage changes when a settlement takes place.

       Where the time pattern of wage settlements differs across sectors

of the economy and where no account is taken of this non-synchronous

pattern, then aggregate quarterly wage change equations will be plagued

with aggregation bias. That is, under these circumstances, the

coefficients of these aggregate wage change equations should not be

expected to display any stability with respect to the addition or deletion
                                      -3-




of observations. This is by no means a novel point4 yet its Implications

appear not to have been fully realized because the unproductive search for

plausible and stable aggregate wage change equations continues unabated.

A more appropriate strategy is to investigate the determinants of wage

settlements and wage changes in individual sectors of the economy and this

paper illustrates this strategy for the British coal industry. The task

of extending the analysis to other industries will be addressed on another

occasi on.




II.     Conceptual Framework

        Collective bargaining agreements in the British industrial

relations system are not legally binding contracts so that, unlike the

unionized sector in the United States, the interval between wage

settlements is not predetermined by the most receftt agreement. On the

contrary, negotiations toward a new wage settlement may be initiated in

any quarter. If there were no costs to negotiating and implementing new

wage agreements, then a new wage settlement would occur whenever the

determinants of wage changes called for a new wage level. In fact, it has

been argued that the transactions costs of negotiating and executing a new

wage contract are by no means negligible nor should such costs be assumed

to be unchanged over time. These costs include the prior determination by

each party of the bargaining posture to be adopted, the resources consumed

in conducting negotiations between the two parties, the expenses borne by

each party in the event of a strike, and the administrative costs of
                                     -4-




changing payroll records. Rees' [1970] statement of the nature of these

transactions costs in the labor market is particularly compelling:

        "Except in hyper-inflations, employers generally seem
        to behave as though the costs of changing wages were
        very substantial. When faced with labor shortages,
        they frequently lower hiring standards, raise
        expenditures on recruitment, and contract-out work
        before raising wages.... [E]very change in wages
        tends to raise questions of internal equity that can
        be very troublesome to solve. Even if it is decided
        to raise all wages uniformly, it must be decided
        whether this is to be by a uniform percentage or a
        uniform amount, and whether the increase is to extend
        all the way up the structure of wages and salaries or
        only part way. The problems are not unlike those
        faced by the United States Congress in separating
        problems of the level of income tax from issues of
        tax reform. Although we know very little about the
        exact nature of the costs of making wagechanges, we
        can infer that they exist. Wages are, next to house
        rents, the stickiest general class of prices in the
        economy, seldom adjusted more frequently than once a
        year. This stickiness may be reinforced by unionism
        and collective bargaining, but it was present long
        before unions arrived" (p. 234).

       In fact, during the period from the first quarter of 1948 (1948 I)

to the last quarter of 1975 (1975 IV), the coal miners' nationally

negotiated wage rates were changed in only 24 of the 112 quarters. Wage

rates were not changed each year: five years witnessed no change in wage

rates (in 1948, 1949, 1952, 1959, and 1972) and there was an occasion on

which wages were adjusted in successive quarters and another occasion on

which eleven quarters separated wage changes. Even during the

inflationary 1970's (until 1975 IV), wage rates in coal mining were

renegotiated on only five occasions. A stylized representation of the

situation is given in Figure 1 where the vertical axis measures the

proportionate change in wage rates (Aw) and where X on the

horizontal axis in some relevant exogenous variable that exerts a positive

effect on w. The argument here is that, for values of             between

    and 2' wage rates are completely unresponsive so that the

relationship between X and nonzero values of w is only observed for

values of X   greater   than      and less than       Of course, neither

    nor       need be unchanged over all observations. The relationship

between w and X for values of X greater than X1 may look like

e1e2 in Figure 1 according to which at          the change in wage rates is a

value (w1) that just offsets the unit costs of making adjustments or it

may look like X1e3 according to which infinitessirnal values of w are

feasible.5 The purported downward stickiness of wages implies that X

has to assume much larger absolute values for any downward movement in

wage rates to be observed (i.e., OX2 > OX1) and/or that, for nonzero
                                      -6-




observed values of w, the partial derivative of w with respect to X

is   less in the south-west quadrant of the graph than in the north—east

quadrant. The distinction between these two hypotheses in the literature

on "downward wage rigidity" is rarely made, let alone tested.

        The presence of these transactions costs calls for statistical

methods that discriminate between (i) the effects of a variable on the

probability that wages will change and (ii) conditional on wages changing,

the effects of that same variable on the magnitude of the wage change. It

is not appropriate to measure these second effects by applying con-

ventional least—squares to the nonzero observations on tw since, in this

circumstance, the composition of the sample is being chosen on the basis

of the values of the left—hand variable (that is, observations with zero

values for w are being discarded) so that the conditional expectation

of the error term is not zero. Nor is it appropriate to pool the limit

(i.e., w = 0)    observations with the nonlimit (i.e., w 0)

observations and estimate a least—squares regression over the entire

sample. The gist of the bias that results in this event is illustrated by

Figure 2 where the crosses indicate the observations describing the "true"

relationship between an exogenous variable X and Aw and where the

dashed line is the (biased) least—squares relationship estimated over all

observations.6

        Thus, consider the familiar situation in which in an attempt to

reduce inflation the government appeals to the parties involved in

collective bargaining to display "restraint" in their wage negotiations.

wage restraint takes the form of a least-squares regression of an index of

wage changes on a dummy variable that takes the value of unity when such a

policy is in effect and of zero otherwise.   In the presence of trans-

actions costs in adjusting wages, this procedure does not provide an

unbiased estimator of the effect of the incomes policy on the probability

of wages being adjusted in any quarter nor of the effect of the incomes

policy on the size of the wage change conditional on a wage settlement

taking place. Moreover, the size and sign of the bias of the effect of

the incomes policy depend upon the relationship between the dumniy variable

and all the right-hand side variables and, therefore, is likely to vary

from study to study according to the particular regressors appearing in

the regression and to the period of fit. Consequently, it comes as no

surprise that the literature has reached little agreement on quantifying

the impact of incomes policies on wage inflation.7

       To address these sample selection problems, an estimation procedure

proposed by Heckman [1979] has been applied: first a probit equation is

estimated over the entire 112 quarters from 1948 I to 1975 IV to determine

the probability of wages changing in the coal mining industry; then from

this estimated probit equation the reciprocal of the Mills' ratio, M (the

ratio of the ordinate of the estimated standard normal to the estimated

tail area of the distribution), is constructed; and, finally, M so

constructed is entered into a least—squares regression of tw on a set of

regressors estimated over the 24 quarters when wage rates actually

increased.8 Provided the equation disturbances are normally distributed,

the ordinary least—squares estimator of the wage change equation that

contains M is consistent, but it is not fully efficient since no account

is taken of the complicated error structure.




III.   Empirical Results

       This section reports an analysis of the determinants of the

frequency of wage changes and of the magnitude of wage changes in the

British coal industry from 1948 to 1975. The wage series used in the

empirical analysis is that determined by the national agreements between

the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers and it

covers all manual workers in the coal mining industry. As is well known,

the actual earnings of coal miners differed from these nationally

negotiated rates, particularly so for piece—rate workers. Nevertheless,

for most workers in this industry, the largest changes in the level of
                                        -9-




their earninqs were associated with the re-negotiation of their wage rates

by the national agreements. Naturally, as with other collective

bargaining agreements, the re-negotiation of wage rates constituted only

one class of issues settled by these national agreements. For instance,

changes in the structure of pay accompanying the 1955 National Day Wage

Agreement and the 1966 National Power Loading Agreement were inextricably

linked with decisions concerning the overall level of wages. Therefore,

by focusing on the determinants of changes in the level of wage rates, we

necessarily provide an incomplete analysis of the frequency of wage

settlements in this industry.8



       A. The Frequency of Wage Settlements

       The probit equation estimated to determine the conditional

probability of a wage change taking place in the coal industry is as

follows:


           prob. (twt > 0) = N[a0+ aiApt + a2Axt +          +           +

                                 +                          +

where precise definitions of the variables are given in Table 1 and where

N denotes the standard cumulative normal distribution function. This

equation contains the variables most often used to account for wage

changes at the aggregate level (namely, the percentage change in retail

prices (tpt), the unemployment rate (1) and the incomes policy

variables (the It's)) and it has been augmented with two industry—

 specific variables, the percentage change in coal prices (act) and the

percentage change in coal output per man—shift (x).       All percentage

change variables have been measured between the current quarter t and

the quarter when wages were last altered. Given the absence of a reliable

 series on the expected rate of price inflation, we have followed the

procedure of expressing the expected rate by a distributed lag function of

the actual rate of price inflation (Ap).    Seasonal dummy variables

 (the Sit's) have been included to remove any systematic seasonal pattern

in wage settlement dates while the presence of the dichotomous variable

    10 and of the interaction between the unemployment rate and

permits the effect of movements in unemployment on wage settlements to

differ before and after the apparent shift in the unemployment-vacancy

relationship in the mid—196O's.'

       Inferences concerning the effects of incomes policies on the course

of wage inflation are drawn from dichotomous variables indicating whether

or not an incomes policy Is in effect. The use of dichotomous variables

to measure the effects of incomes policies is customary and it is also

customary to lament the inadequacies of the procedure. This conventional

practice is modified here by the use of three dichotomous variables that

distinguish the effects of different forms of incomes policies: the

variable I identifies quarters when a wage "freeze" was in effect and

ostensibly all wage increases were prohibited; the variable 12

identifies quarters when a "twelve month rule" was instituted under which

the time between wage settlements was mandated to be no less than one

year; and the variable 13 identifies quarters when wage ceilings were in
                                      -12—




effect, that Is, quarters when the government declared wage increases to

be no greater than a certain specified level. If the wage freeze achieves

its stated purpose, then I will reduce the probability of wages

changing, while        will operate in a similar fashion unless the period

between wage negotiations would have been no less than twelve months in

the absence of this incomes policy. A policy of imposing ceilings on wage

increases is designed to affect the magnitude of the wage change and not

the frequency of wage settlements.

         The appendix to Fallick and Elliott [1981] was used to determine

which incomes policies were operative in each quarter. The variable

takes the value of unity from 1948 I to 1951 II, from 1961 III to 1962 I,

from 1966 III to 1967 II, and from 1972 IV to 1973 I; 12 takes the value

of unity from 1967 III to 1970 IV and from 1973 II to 1975 II; and 13

takes the value of unity from 1956 I to 1956 IV, from 1962 II to 1963 I,

from 1965 II to 1966 II, and from 1975 III to 1975 IV. Of course, the

identification of particular types of incomes policy is fraught with

difficulties and it is important to determine whether the results are

sensitive to the classification of the quarters with particular incomes

policies. For this reason, the consequences of a second classification of

incomes policies were examined and the results from this are reported

below.

         Estimates of the probit index parameters of equation (1) are given

in column (1) of Table 2 with estimated partial derivatives of the

probability of wage change function evaluated at sample means given in

column (jl).12 Thus the greater the Increase in retail prices (hp)

since the previous wage settlement, th higher the probability of wages

changing in the current quarter.   In particular, at sample means, a small

increase in p above its average value raises the probability of a new

wage agreement by 6.6% and this estimate is highly significant by

conventional criteria. Increases in labor productivity raise the

probability of a new wage settlement although this effect would not be

judged as significantly greater than zero by the usual standards. By

these same criteria, no significant association exists between movements

in coal prices and in the frequency of wage settlements. On a con-

ventional likelihood ratio test, the hypothesis that the probability of a

wage increase is independent of movements in unemployment (that is, a

joint test of a4 and        cannot be rejected at conventional levels of

significance. Other things equal, seasonal variations in wage settlements

appear to be of negligable importance. Of the three incomes policy dummy

variables only the coefficient on that pertaining to the wage freeze, I,

appears to be significantly less than zero: the results suggest that, at

the mean values of the variables, the imposition of a wage freeze reduces

the probability of a wage settlement in coal mining by almost 24%.

       A number of variations on this equation specification yielded

results that differed in no substantive sense from those reported in

column (i) of Table 2. For instance, instrumental variables were found

for the rate of change of coal prices,14 but treating Ac as endogenous

in this way did not materially affect the results. The same was true when

the unemployment rate was measured as an average over four quarters

instead of its one-quarter value used in the estimates in column (i).

Some researchers (e.g., Henry [1981]) have allowed for the possibility of

an acceleration in the rate of wage inflation in the period following the

relaxation of an incomes policy and this "catch-up" feature was

investigated in these data by constructing dummy variables for those

periods when an incomes policy was dropped and was not replaced by another

form of incomes policy. In fact, the probability of a wage settlement

exhibited no significant association with this "catch-up" variable.

       Finally, equation (1) was modified to allow for a different

classification of incomes policies, a classification that turns on whether

the incomes policies have been "voluntary" on the one hand or "statutory"

(or "compulsory") on the other hand. The dichotomous variable '4t takes

the value of unity in those quarters in which a "voluntary" incomes policy

was in operation and of zero otherwise while the variable         takes the

value of unity in those quarters in which a "statutory" or "compulsory"

incomes policy was in effect and of zero otherwise. The categorization of

incomes policies into these two forms follows Parkin and Sumner ([1978]

Table 1.1): 14t takes the value of unity from 1948 I to 1951 II, from

1956 I to 1956 IV, from 1961 III to 1963 I, from 1965 II to 1966 II, and

from 1974 II to 1975 III; and      takes the value of unity from 1966 III

to 1970 IV, from 1972 IV to 1974 I, and in 1975 IV. The estimates listed

in column (iv) of Table 2 are the maximum likelihood results from fitting

equation (1) after replacing the three incomes policy variables I, 12,

and 13 with the two variables 14 and 15. The corresponding estimated

partial derivatives of the probability of wage change function evaluated

at sample means is given in column (v). The probit estimated coefficient
                                           -16-




on 15 is clearly insignificantly different from zero by conventional

criteria while that on 14 is significantly less than zero and it

suggests that, at the mean values of the variables, a voluntary incomes

policy reduces the probability of a wage settlement in coal mining by

almost 18%.    In other words, these results given no support to the often—
stated belief that a statutory incomes policy is more effective in
reducing the frequency      of wage settlements than a voluntary incomes

policy.



          B. The Size of Wage Changes
          Consider now the second stage equation accounting for the size of
the wage change in coal mining conditional upon a new settlement being

negotiated. This condition is satisfied in only 24 of the 112 quarters

from 1948 I to 1975 IV so a relatively small number of observations are

available to account for the magnitude of wage increases. The least-

squares fitted equation is

concerning the determinants of the magnitude of wage increases. Two of

the incomes policy dummy   variables   have negative coefficients, but the

confidence intervals span a wide area in terms of their economic

implications. The consequences of ignoring the censoring of the left-hand

variable are given by the estimates in column (ii) of Table 3 which omit

the Mills' ratio variable, M. The point estimates change noticeably

although, once again, the standard errors accompanying these coefficients

do not permit confident inferences. Columns (iii) and (iv) of Table 3

replace the three incomes policy dummy variables I, 12, and 13 with

14 (denoting a "voluntary" incomes policy) and 15 (denoting a

"statutory" or "compulsory" incomes policy). The Mills' ratio variable,

M, in column (iii) is formed from the probit estimates in column (iv) of

Table 2. Once again, it is difficult to derive confident inferences

although on a conventional t-test the coefficient on the statutory incomes

policy variable, 15, does appear to be significantly less than zero. Even

if variables such as the seasonal dummy variables, coal price changes, and

productivity changes are arbitrarily excluded from these least—squares

equations or if coal price changes are treated as an endogenous variable,

the resulting parameter estimates on the remaining variables do not differ

appreciably from those given in Table 3. Surely these results must be

interpreted as being very discouraging with respect to our knowledge of

the determinants of the magnitude of wage changes in the coal industry.

IV.    Conclusions
       Since the transactions costs of adjusting wages have been largely

neglected in the literature on wage inflation, insufficient attention has

been directed to the distinction between the frequency of wage settlements

on the one hand and the magnitude of wage changes negotiated by these

settlements on the other hand. Government policy-makers have been acutely

aware of this distinction, however, and have directed their incomes

policies at one time towards reducing the occurrence of wage settlements

and at other times towards reducing the size of wage increases. This

paper has presented estimates of the effectiveness of these incomes

policies both on the frequency of wage settlements and on the size of wage

increases in the coal mining industry. An analysis of a single industry

avoids the aggregation bias that plagues much of the research on wage

inflation. Reasonably precise estimates were derived of the effect of

various variables on the frequency of wage settlements, but no such

precise estimates were obtained for the size of wage changes. This leads

naturally to the conjecture that the apparent "statistical significance"

reported by researchers with respect to the performance of variables in

models of aggregate wage changes reflects primarily the effects of these

variables on the probability of wages being adjusted rather than the

effects on the magnitude of wage changes conditional upon wages being

adjusted. As for the implications of the incomes policy variables, a wage

freeze appears to have a large and significant negative effect on the

probability of the occurrence of a new wage settlement. The effects of a

voluntary and a statutory incomes policy are different: the frequency of
                                    -20--




wage settlements appears to be affected more by a voluntary incomes policy

while the magnitude of wage changes seems to be responsive to a statutory

incomes policy.

    Among the rare exceptions are Barro [1972] and Sheshinski and Weiss
     [1977].

 2 For instance, Rowley and Wilton [1973] address the temporal aggregation
    problem when an equal number of settlements each period are assumed to
    take place. Or Ashenfelter and Pencavel [1975] and Smith and Wilton
    [1978] augment conventional equations of quarterly wage inflation with
    a variable measuring the fraction of workers receiving new wage
    settlements.

3 The main exceptions include work by Coutts, Tarling, and Wilkinson
    [1976] and Elliott and Dean [1978].

    It is recognized in Dicks—Miréaux and Dow's [1959] seminal paper and in
    Black and Kelejian [1972]. Evidence on aggregation bias s contained
    in Rowley and Wilton [1974]. Work with individual contract data is
    presented in Christofides, Swindinsky, and Wilton [1980], Hamermesh
    [1970], and Riddell [1979].

5 This second specification is Rosett's [1959] model of friction.

6 In fact, in the British coal mining industry, from 1948 to 1975
    nationally negotiated wage rates never fell so all the nonlimit
    observations on w were positive values.

    For instance, Parkin [1978] finds "no evidence at all either from the
    studies of the determinants of inflation or from more direct studies
    that wage and price controls materially affect the rate of inflation"
    (p. 49) while Henry [1981] claims, "Here the outstanding feature is the
    significant effects for incomes policy generally observed, whatever the
    basic model of inflation used" (p. 42, emphasis in original).
    Blackaby's [1978] survey of incomes policy concludes, "In sum, if we
    suppose that over this period there was a variety of forces tending to
    produce a rising., trend in the increase in money earnings, then the
    experience of the late 1960's and early 1970's is consonant with the
    view that the two incomes policies during that period were successful,
    so long as they were in force, in holding back this process" (p. 392).
8                is
    Thus, if Q      the predicted value of the index from a fitted probit
    on the determinants of a wage change taking place and if N is jhe
    standard cumulative normal distribution function, then Mt =
    See Heckman [1979] for further details.                      N'(Qt)/N(Qt).

    The adjustment of wage rates by decisions reached at the national
    agreements was clearly prompted in the 1950's by movements in pay
    differentials between time-rate workers and piece-rate workers.

     However, a continuous, quarterly, series on the earnings of these two
     types of workers is not available. More information on industrial
     relations in the coal industry is contained in McCormick [1979].

10 The date from which D takes the value of unity (the fourth quarter
   of 1966) is associated with the introduction of earnings—related
   supplements to unemployment compensation.

     The national unemployment rate was used in these equations in
     preference to unemployment in the coal industry for several reasons.
     First, voluntary separations from the industry were "considerably
     affected by fluctuations in the general level of demand for labor"
     (McCormick [1979]. p. 106) which is often indexed by the aggregate
     unemployment rate. Second, when a contraction in the coal industry's
     labor force was required after 1957, this was accomplished primarily
     through early retirements and through quits for other jobs and these
     individuals frequently escaped registration as unemployed. Third, it
     is by no means clear how to interpret movements in an industry's
     unemployment rate when labor supply curves to an industry are highly
     elastic.

12 The effect of a variable X on the probability is derived by
   multiplying the coefficient of the index, Q, by the normal density
   N'(Q) at the evaluation point; that is,
      prob./3X = (dN/dQ)(aQ/u) = N'(Q)(Q/aX). At the sample mean values
   of the variables, the standard normal density is .228 for the estimates
   in column (1). As is evident from a comparison of the entries in
   column (ii) with those in column (iii), the ordinary least-squares
   estimates and the probit estimates of equation (1) imply very similar
   partial derivatives of the probability of wage change function.
13
     In other estimates, the incomes policy dumr' variable I was
     interacted with Ap, x, U, D,and (U.D) to test the hypothesis that
     the whole relationship between the probability of wages changing and
     these variables alters when a "wage freeze" is in effect. A
     conventional likelihood ratio test fails to reject the null hypothesis.

14 The instrumental variables consisted of the percentage change in the
   price of gas and electricity, the percentage change in the price of
   construction inputs, and the percentage change in an index of consumer
   total expenditure. The source for these three variables in the Monthly
   Digest of Statistics.
