                                         ABSTRACT

We provide an empirical and theoretical analysis of the Greek Crisis of 2010. We first benchmark
the crisis against all episodes of sudden stops, sovereign debt crises, and lending boom/busts in
emerging and advanced economies since 1980. The decline in Greece’s output, especially
investment, is deeper and more persistent than in almost any crisis on record over that period. We
then propose a stylized macro-finance model to understand what happened. We find that a severe
macroeconomic adjustment was inevitable given the size of the fiscal imbalance; yet a sizable
share of the crisis was also the consequence of the sudden stop that started in late 2009. Our
model suggests that the size of the initial macro/financial imbalances can account for much of the
depth of the crisis. When we simulate an emerging market sudden stop with initial debt levels
(government, private, and external) of an advanced economy, we obtain a Greek crisis. Finally, in
recent years, the lack of recovery appears driven by elevated levels of non-performing loans and
strong price rigidities in product markets.

1     Introduction and Motivation

The economic crisis that Greece has been experiencing from 2008 onwards has been particularly severe.

Real GDP per capita stood at approximately B
                                           C22,600 in 2008, and dropped to B
                                                                           C17,000 by 2014, a

decline of 24.8%.1 The unemployment rate was 7.8% in 2008, and rose to 26.6% in 2014. The entire

Greek banking system became insolvent during the crisis, and a large-scale recapitalization took place

in 2013. In 2012, Greece became the first OECD member country to default on its sovereign debt, and

that default was the largest in world history. Greece received financial assistance from other Eurozone

(EZ) countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the size of this bailout package was

also the largest in history.

    The implications of the Greek crisis extended well beyond Greece. The bailout package that Greece

received was large partly because of fears of contagion to other countries in the EZ and to their banking

systems. Moreover, at various stages during the crisis, the continued membership of Greece in the EZ

was put in doubt. This tested the strength and the limits of the currency union, and of the European

project more generally.

    This paper provides an ‘interim’ report on the Greek crisis (‘interim’ in the sense that the crisis

is still unfolding). We proceed in three steps. First, we describe the main macroeconomic dynamics

that Greece experienced before and during the crisis. Second, we put these dynamics in perspective

by benchmarking the Greek crisis against all episodes of sudden stops, sovereign debt crises, and

lending boom/busts in emerging and advanced economies since 1980. Third, we develop a DSGE

model designed to capture many of the relevant features of the Greek crisis and help us identify its

main drivers.

    The global financial crisis that began in 2007 in the United States hit Greece through three inter-

linked shocks. The first shock was a sovereign debt crisis: investors began to perceive the debt of the

Greek government as unsustainable, and were no longer willing to finance the government deficit. The

second shock was a banking crisis: Greek banks had difficulty financing themselves in the interbank

market, and their solvency was put in doubt because of projected losses to the value of their assets.

The third shock was a sudden stop: foreign investors were no longer willing to lend to Greece as a

whole (government, banks, and firms), and so the country could not finance its current account deficit.

    To many observers, that last shock was a startling development. After all, the very existence of a

common currency, and therefore of an automatic provision of liquidity against good collateral through
    1 GDP   per capita comes from Eurostat and is expressed in 2010 Euros.



                                                           2
its common central bank, was supposed to insulate member countries against a sudden reversal of

private capital of the kind experienced routinely by Emerging Market economies (EM). Just like a

sudden stop on California or Texas could not happen since Federal Reserve funding would substitute

instantly and automatically for private capital, the common view was a sudden stop could not happen

to Greece or Portugal since European Central Bank (ECB) funding would substitute instantly and

automatically for private capital.2 The belief that sudden stops were a thing of the past may have

in turn contributed to the emergence of mounting internal and external imbalances, in Greece and

elsewhere in the EZ (Blanchard and Giavazzi (2002)). Yet, at the onset of the crisis, Greece and other

EZ members did experience a classic sudden stop. The built-in defense mechanisms of the EZ were

activated and the ECB provided much needed funding to the Greek economy. How much, then, did

this sudden stop contribute to the subsequent meltdown and through what channels? And what was

the contribution of other factors? These are among the questions that we seek to address in this paper.

   The first main result that emerges from our macro-benchmarking exercise is that Greece’s drop in

output (a 25% decline in real GDP per capita between 2008 and 2013) was significantly more severe

and protracted than during the average crisis. This applies to the sample of countries that experienced

sudden stops; to the sample that experienced sovereign defaults; to the sample that experienced lending

booms and busts; and even to the sample that experienced all three shocks combined (we call these

episodes “Trifectas”). The collapse in investment (75% decline between 2008 and 2013) was even more

severe. Importantly, we find that the difference in output dynamics is not driven by the exchange-rate

regime. Countries whose currency remains pegged experience a larger output drop on average than

countries with floating rates. But unlike these countries, whose output rebounds after a few years,

Greece’s output continued to drop, to a significantly lower level.

   One possible explanation for the severity of Greece’s crisis is the high level of debt—government,

private, and external—at the onset of the crisis. Greece’s government debt stood at 103.1% of output

in 2007, its net foreign assets at -99.9% of output, and its private-sector debt at 92.4% of output. On

the former two measures, Greece fared worse than Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, the four other

major EZ countries hit by the crisis. Greece fared worse than those countries also on its government

deficit and current-account deficit, which stood at 6.5% and 15.9% of output, respectively, in 2007.

And debt levels in Greece were more than twice as large than in the average of the emerging-market
  2 Ingram  (1973) was among the first to articulate the view that sudden stops could not happen in a currency union,
with the corollary that there was no need to monitor external imbalances. Against this view, Garber (1999) argued that
the European payment system (Target) at the core of the European Monetary Union could itself propagate a speculative
attack.

economies which account for most of the crisis episodes in our sample.

   To identify the role of debt, as well as of other factors such as the sudden stop of private capital,

in driving the severity of the Greek crisis, we turn to our DSGE model. The model is designed to

capture in a simple and stylized manner the three types of shocks that hit Greece. It also captures

a rich set of interdependencies between the shocks. The model features a government, two types of

consumers, firms, and banks. The government can borrow, raise taxes, spend, and possibly default

on its debt. Consumers differ in their subjective discount rate. Impatient consumers are those who

borrow in equilibrium, subject to a debt limit. Firms can borrow and invest, and face sticky wages

and prices. Consumers and firms can borrow from banks and can default on their debts. The rates at

which the government, consumers, and firms can borrow depend on the probability with which these

entities can default and on the losses given default. In turn, the expected costs of default (probability

times losses) depend on the ratio of debt to income.

   In the model, a sovereign risk shock increases the government’s funding costs. The government

responds by increasing taxes and reducing expenditures, which exerts a contractionary effect on the

economy. In turn, the decline in output increases the expected costs of default on private-sector

loans, causing funding costs for consumers and firms to rise and investment to drop. Conversely, a

sudden stop increases directly the rate at which consumers and firms can borrow, causing investment,

consumption and output to decline. The decline in fiscal revenues pushes up sovereign yields and has

an adverse impact on public debt dynamics. Hence, in our model, sovereign risks and private sector

risks are intertwined and shocks to one sector of the economy can affect funding costs and default rates

throughout all sectors.

   We estimate the model using Bayesian methods and annual data on government revenue and spend-

ing, household debt, non-performing loans in the private sector, borrowing rates for the government

and the corporate sector, as well as price and wage inflation. The model features eight stochastic

shocks in each year, identical to the number of variables that we use in the estimation. We find that

the model does an excellent job of matching additional variables such as output, investment, and the

current account (which the model was not asked to replicate). We then perform two tasks with the

model. First, we decompose the movements in output, investment, and other key variables into the

contribution of each type of shock. This helps us determine which shocks were the most important

in driving the crisis dynamics. Second, we use the model to perform a number of “counterfactuals” to

identify the role played by different aspects of the institutional environment. We examine, in particu-



                                                   4
lar, how the dynamics of output and investment would have been different if debt levels in Greece were

set at the average of emerging-market economies; if banks’ funding costs had not increased during the

crisis, as a possible effect of a European banking union; if the Greek government had followed a more

virtuous fiscal path in the years preceding the crisis; and if prices and wages had been more flexible.

    As in Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’, our model indicates that many forces

contributed to the ‘murder’ of the Greek economy. Yet a few factors stand out. First and most

importantly, given the size of the fiscal imbalances, a substantial fiscal correction was inevitable.

According to our estimates, fiscal consolidation accounted for approximately 50% of the output drop

from peak to trough. Much of the remainder is explained by the increase in funding costs for the private

sector (“sudden stop” in our model) and the sovereign (“sovereign risk shock”). The combination of the

two shocks accounted for an additional 40% of the output drop from peak to trough, with the sudden

stop driving more than half of the effect.

    Lastly, our estimates indicate that markup shocks in product markets and a surge in non-performing

loans contributed significantly to the lack of recovery in 2014 and 2015: in the the absence of these

shocks, output in 2014-15 would have recovered approximately 35% of its peak-to-trough drop. These

findings indicate that the external dimension of the crisis may slowly be fading, and that the forces

holding back the Greek economy are now largely domestic and microeconomic: the recovery will entail

cleaning up non-performing loans, and facilitating the adjustment of prices relative to wages. The

lack of a sufficient price adjustment may have been due to limited competition in goods and services

markets, as well as to a rise in firms’ costs stemming from factors such as the uncertainty about EZ

exit and the taxation of key inputs.

    The effects of the shocks described above were made larger by high leverage and low price flexibility.

Our counterfactual exercises allow us to examine more directly the effects of these factors. We find

that if the levels of government, private, and external debt in Greece had been comparable to those in

the average of the emerging-market economies (so smaller by about half), the peak-to-trough decline

in output would have been smaller by about a third. And the same conclusion holds if the prices and

wages had been twice as flexible.



2     The Greek Economy Before and During the Crisis.

This section describes the dynamics of key macroeconomic variables in Greece before and during

the crisis. We focus on the behavior of output and investment, as well as on the accumulation of

                                                    5
debt—government, private, and external. We also describe the three shocks through which the global

financial crisis affected Greece (sudden stop, sovereign debt crisis, and banking crisis) as well as their

interrelationships. This sets the stage for the empirical exercise in Section 3, and motivates some of

the modeling choices and analysis in Sections 4-6.

   As of 1980, Greek GDP per capita was above that of Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. During the

1980s Greece experienced relative stagnation, and was overtaken by Ireland and Spain. Greece grew

faster during the period 1996-2000 and especially from 2001, when it entered the Eurozone (EZ), until

2008. By 2008, Greece had almost caught up with Spain.

   Motivated by Figure 1, we divide the period 1996-2014 into three sub-periods: the period 1996-

2000, during which Greece experienced a boom in anticipation of EZ entry; the period 2001-2008 during

which the boom continued with Greece inside the EZ; and the crisis period 2009-2014. In the tables

constructed in the rest of this section, we report averages of macroeconomic variables for the three

sub-periods. In some of the tables we also compare with the year 1995, which we take as indicative of

Table 1:     Investment in Greece and other EZ crisis countries, 1995-2014, as percentage of
GDP. The data come from AMECO. Investment is measured by the series “Gross fixed capital formation:
total economy,” and does not include inventories. Residential investment is measured by “Gross fixed capital
formation: dwellings;” corporate investment by “Gross fixed capital formation: private sector” minus residential
investment; and public investment by “Gross fixed capital formation: government.”


   Investment. Table 1 reports the level of investment in Greece during the periods 1996-2000, 2001-

2008, and 2009-2014, and compares with 1995. The table also decomposes investment into corporate,

residential, and public, and compares with Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Greece experienced

the second-largest increase in corporate investment from 1995 to 1996-2000, after Portugal. Corporate

investment remained at that elevated level during 2001-2008. Thus, EZ entry and its anticipation was

associated with a significant rise in corporate investment in Greece. That rise, however, occurred from

a low base, and corporate investment remained significantly lower than in the other countries.

   Unlike Ireland and Spain, Greece did not experience a significant increase in residential investment

from 1995 to 1996-2008. Residential investment was already high in 1995, however, and the real-estate

boom in Ireland and Spain only meant that residential investment in those countries caught up with

and exceeded somewhat that in Greece.



   Net Foreign Assets. The fast growth of Greek GDP per capita during the period 1996-2008 was

associated with an increase in external indebtedness. Figure 2 plots net foreign assets (NFA) from
  3 An average during the period 1980-1995 would have been more informative of the state of the Greek economy before

EZ entry. We use only the year 1995 because data before 1995 are not available or precise enough.

1980 onwards, as percentage of GDP. NFA for Greece were negative throughout that period. They

were a relatively small fraction of GDP in absolute value until the mid-1990s, and they subsequently

declined to a much more negative fraction. Greece’s NFA position deteriorated at a comparable rate

to Portugal’s and Spain’s, while Ireland experienced a more abrupt deterioration. The behavior of

Greece’s NFA from the mid-1990s onwards is indicative of large current account deficits. Table 2

reports the level of the current account in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain during the

periods 1996-2000, 2001-2008, and 2009-2014, and compares with 1995. The table decomposes the

current account into (i) net exports and (ii) the sum of net current transfers and net primary income.

Table 2: The current account in Greece and other EZ crisis countries 1995-2014, as percentage
of GDP. The data come from AMECO. Net exports are measured by the series “Net exports of goods and
services;" net current transfers by “Net current transfers from the rest of the world;" and net primary income
by “Net primary income from the rest of the world." The current account surplus is the sum of the three series.


   Greece’s current account deteriorated from 1995 to 1996-2000, and deteriorated further during

2001-2008. The deterioration from 1996-2000 to 2001-2008 was particularly severe: 6.0% of GDP,

larger than in the other countries. During 2001-2008, Greece was running an average current account



                                                        8
deficit of 11.7% of GDP, also larger than in the other countries.

    The deterioration of Greece’s current account from 1995 onwards was primarily driven by a decline

in net current transfers and net primary income. Net current transfers to Greece declined partly

because of the drop in EU subsidies, especially after the 2005 EU enlargement, as funds were re-

directed to new entrants that were poorer than Greece. Net primary income declined also because

workers’ remittances became smaller as Greece became a net immigration country, and because of

growing interest payments on Greece’s rising external debt. Greece’s trade balance also deteriorated,

through that period, reaching -10.6 percent of GDP during the period 2001-2008.

    The increase in Greece’s current account deficit from 1995 to 1996-2000 was associated with an

increase in corporate investment and hence in productive capacity. Indeed, the current account deficit

increased by 2.9% of GDP, corporate investment increased by 2.1%, and public investment by 0.4%.

The increase in the current account deficit from 1996-2000 to 2001-2008, however, was associated

with an increase in consumption. Indeed, the current account deficit increased by 6.0% of GDP, total

saving declined by 6.7%, and corporate investment dropped slightly. The decline in total saving from

1996-2000 to 2001-2008 was primarily driven by private saving, which declined by 4.3% of GDP.4

    Government Debt. Figure 3 plots government debt from 1980 onwards, as percentage of GDP.

As of 1980, government debt in Greece was 21.4% of GDP, lower than in all other countries except for

Spain. Debt rose sharply during the 1980s, and by 1993 it had reached 94.4% of GDP, a level larger

than in all other countries except for Italy. A combination of fiscal tightening to meet the criteria

for EZ entry, and sharply lower interest rates in anticipation of that entry, helped stabilize and even

reduce slightly the ratio of debt to GDP—to 88.5% in 1999. Budget discipline became looser after EZ

entry, and especially after 2007. As a consequence, debt to GDP increased—to 103.1% in 2007 and

126.8% in 2009—despite the fast growth in GDP during the period 2001-2008.



    While debt to GDP increased only mildly from 1999 to 2007, there was a sharp increase in the

amount of the debt held by foreign entities, and a consequent decrease in the amount held domestically.

That trend was due mainly to the decline in private saving. Figure 4 plots gross government external

debt for Greece, and compares with the same series for Portugal and Spain, and with Greece’s NFA.5
    4 The fact that in the years immediately preceding and following EZ entry poorer members of the union –like Greece–

would run large current account deficits was not a surprise. Rather, it is precisely what theory suggests should happen
when countries catch-up and converge, as argued by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2002) in an influential paper that examined
the experience of Greece and Portugal. That paper too noted that Greece did not experience an investment boom
following EZ entry and that the decline in saving was mostly driven by private saving.

Gross government external debt for Greece essentially coincides with the negative of NFA. By contrast,

gross government external debt for Portugal and Spain is significantly lower than the negative of those

countries’ NFA (which are not plotted but are similar to Greece’s from Figure 2). Figure 4 thus

indicates that Greece’s current account deficit essentially financed government borrowing.6

EU average. The figure shows that Greece’s public finances improved in the run-up to EZ entry, but

worsened steadily post-entry. The pre-entry improvement was similar to that in Italy and the EU

average. Unlike in Greece, however, the latter series remained relatively stable post-entry and until

the crisis.

   Banks and Credit. From the mid-1990s and until the crisis, Greece experienced a boom in

private credit. An extensive program of financial liberalization that took place in the late 1980s and

the 1990s paved the way for the credit boom. It was also fueled by easier access to foreign capital

following EZ entry (and the anticipation of it). Figure 6 plots bank loans to the non-financial private

sector for Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, as percentage of GDP.



   Private-sector loans to GDP were significantly lower in Greece than in the other countries before

EZ entry: they stood at 34.1% of GDP in 1998, compared to 60.8% in Italy, 74.6% in Spain, 80.31%

in Portugal, and 82.8% in Ireland. Loans to GDP grew faster in Greece than in any other country,

however, after EZ entry. As of 2008, they stood at 103.0%, a ratio smaller than Ireland’s, Portugal’s,

and Spain’s, but larger than Italy’s.

   To finance their increasing lending activity, Greek banks became more reliant on wholesale funding

through the interbank market. Figure 7 plots gross external debt for Greek banks, and compares with

        the BoG series, except for an increasing divergence during the period 2004-2009, which leads
        to a discontinuity between 2009 and 2010 in the ECB series. The divergence is likely due
        to a change in loan classification by the BoG, which has not been incorporated in the ECB

Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Gross external debt of banks consists mainly of interbank loans. Gross

external debt of Greek banks increased from 12.3% of GDP in 1999 to 46.2% of GDP in 2008. As in

the case of private-sector loans to GDP, the growth rate was higher than in the other countries, and

the 2008 level was smaller than Portugal’s, and Spain’s, but larger than Italy’s.

2.2    Crisis

The Three Shocks. The global financial crisis that began in 2007 found Greece in a highly vulnerable

position. As of 2007, Greece’s current account deficit had reached 15.9% of GDP, NFA stood at -99.9%,

government deficit at 6.5%, and government debt at 103.1%. On all four measures, Greece fared worse

than Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Greece’s banking system was also vulnerable. While the ratio

of private-sector loans to GDP in Greece was lower than in Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, the exposure

of Greek banks to their sovereign was larger than in those countries.

   Greece was hit by three interdependent shocks during the crisis. The first shock was a sovereign

debt crisis: investors began to perceive the debt of the Greek government as unsustainable, and were

no longer willing to finance the government deficit. The second shock was a banking crisis: Greek

banks had difficulty financing themselves, and their solvency was put in doubt because of projected

losses to the value of their assets. The third shock was a sudden stop: foreign investors were no longer

willing to lend to Greece as a whole (government, banks, and firms), and so the country could not

finance its current account deficit, nor roll over its maturing gross liabilities.

   The three shocks were interlinked. The banking crisis made the government’s fiscal problems worse.

This was because the government had to inject equity capital into the banks, and had to provide them

with guarantees so that they could borrow in the interbank market. Moreover, because banks had to

curtail their lending, the economy slowed down and the government’s tax revenues declined. These

channels were at play starting from the Fall of 2008, when Greek banks faced significant difficulties

financing themselves in the interbank market. The Greek government passed a law in December 2008

that provided support to the banks, in the form of guarantees and equity capital.

   Conversely, the sovereign crisis made the banks’ liquidity and solvency problems worse. This was

because concerns about default risk by the Greek government reduced the value of the Greek banks’

government-bond portfolio, and this put the banks’ solvency in doubt. Moreover, the government had

to engage in significant fiscal tightening, and the ensuing recession meant that firms and households had

difficulty repaying their loans, adding to the banks’ solvency problems. Finally, the guarantees given

by the government to Greek banks diminished in value. That applied both to the guarantees intended

to help the banks borrow in the interbank market, and to the government-supplied deposit insurance.

Hence, banks had more difficulties financing themselves, and their liquidity problems worsened. These

channels were at play starting from September 2009, when investors began to perceive the debt of the

Greek government as unsustainable.


                                                     13
   Both the sovereign and the banking crises were closely linked to the sudden stop. Indeed, most of

government debt was held by foreign investors: out of government debt equal to 103.1% of GDP in

2007, the debt held by foreign investors was 76.1% of GDP. Greek financial firms had also significant

foreign debt: their gross external debt was 41.8% of GDP in 2007. Since the Greek government and

Greek banks intermediated most of the flow of foreign capital to Greece, the withdrawal of foreign

capital meant that both sectors’ access to funds was seriously impaired.

   Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were hit by some or all of the same shocks. The shocks’ effects

were more severe in the case of Greece, however, given the country’s larger vulnerability.7

Assistance to the Sovereign, and Sovereign Default. In May 2010, Greece agreed to follow an

adjustment program financed and monitored by European institutions and the IMF. Under the terms

of the agreement, Greece received a loan so as to avoid a default on its private creditors and reduce

its government deficit more smoothly. In exchange, it had to engage in significant fiscal tightening

and implement a battery of structural reforms. The agreed loan amount was 110bn Euros, or 44% of

Greece’s 2010 GDP. Out of that amount, 80bn came from other EZ countries and the remaining 30bn

from the IMF. The first adjustment program was rolled over into a second, agreed in February 2012.

A third program began in August 2015.

   In March 2012, Greece agreed a debt restructuring with its private creditors. Under the terms of

this Private Sector Involvement (PSI), privately-held government debt with face value 199.2bn Euros

was replaced by debt with face value 92.1bn. Greece was the only EZ country to default on its creditors.

Assistance to the Banks, Recapitalizations, and Capital Controls. In addition to the loans

made to the Greek government under the adjustment programs, assistance was provided to Greece

through ECB loans to its banking system. These loans were administered either directly from the

ECB, with a low interest rate and stringent collateral requirements, or indirectly via the Bank of

Greece (BoG) as emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), with a higher interest rate and less stringent

collateral requirements. ECB loans were necessary to address the liquidity problems of Greek banks.

They rose from 48bn Euros in January 2010 to a maximum of 158bn Euros in February 2012, then

dropped to a minimum of 45bn Euros in November 2014, and then rose again to a maximum of 122bn

in September 2015. ECB loans were at their maxima around times when there was a high perceived

risk of Greece exiting the EZ (Grexit). The risk of Grexit was high around the double election of

May and June 2012, and during the first half of 2015 after a new Greek government opposed to the
  7 Ireland and Spain had significantly lower levels of public debt. Italy had much lower levels of net external debt.

Portugal was in a position somewhat similar to Greece, although with smaller government debt and deficits.

adjustment programs had been elected in January 2015.

   Greek banks went through a series of recapitalizations. Losses on the banks’ government-bond

portfolio reduced the capital of all banks and rendered most of the large ones insolvent. Some of the

banks were resolved, and their deposits and some of the loans were transferred to the four largest

banks. The latter were recapitalized. The resolution and recapitalization process was completed in

July 2013, and involved 38.9bn Euros of public funds, which were loaned to Greece. An additional

3.1bn Euros were raised by private investors. That first, large-scale recapitalization was followed by a

second in April and May 2014, when the banks raised 8.3bn Euros, solely from private investors. A

third recapitalization took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. The total amount that was raised then

was 13.7bn Euros, of which 8bn Euros was raised from private sources via new investment and debt-

equity conversions. The second and third recapitalizations were made necessary because of increased

projected losses on banks’ loans to the private sector.

Macroeconomic developments. We finally review the macroeconomic developments during the

crisis period 2009-2014, following a roughly similar order as for the pre-crisis period. Greek GDP per

capita declined sharply during the crisis, as shown in Figure 1. The decline was 25.8% between 2008

and 2014. It was much sharper than in Ireland (6.1%), Italy (10.3%), Portugal (7.8%), and Spain

(9.6%).

   The decline in GDP was accompanied by a large decline in investment. The latter decline can be

seen in Table 1 by comparing the crisis period with the pre-crisis one. It can be seen more sharply

by comparing investment in 2014 to that in 2008. Investment in 2014 was less than half of its 2008

value, having dropped by 12.2% of GDP. Both the relative and the absolute declines were larger than

in Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The level of investment in 2014 was also significantly lower than

in the other countries.

   During the crisis, Greece reduced and almost eliminated its current account deficit. That deficit

stood at 2.2% of GDP in 2014, down from 16.5% in 2008. The adjustment occurred entirely through

a drop in investment. Total saving did not change: government saving increased as a result of the

fiscal tightening that took place during the crisis, but that effect was offset by a decline in private

saving. Private saving in Greece declined between 2008 and 2014, while they increased in Ireland,

Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Conversely, government saving increased in Greece during the same period,

while they declined in the other countries. Thus, the austerity undergone by Greece during the crisis

was more severe than in the other countries.



                                                   15
    During the crisis, public debt to GDP followed explosive dynamics, rising from 103.1% in 2007

and 126.8% in 2009 to 177.1% in 2014. The increase resulted from the deficits ran during the crisis

and from the drop in GDP. The debt restructuring agreed in 2012 countered these effects somewhat.8

Greece eliminated its primary budget deficit in 2014—it ran a primary surplus of 0.4% in that year.

    The ratio of private-sector loans to GDP declined slowly during the crisis. As Figure 6 shows, it

stood at almost the same level as Portugal’s and Spain’s in 2014, and above Ireland’s and Italy’s. The

slow decline of private-sector loans to GDP in Greece is due to the sharp decline in GDP and the

relatively slow pace of resolving non-performing loans.



3     Benchmarking the Greek Crisis.

The previous section argued that Greece experienced three quasi simultaneous and interlinked shocks:

a sudden stop, with the abrupt withdrawal of private foreign capital starting in 2009; a sovereign debt

crisis, with rapidly deteriorating fiscal accounts in 2008 and 2009, culminating in a sovereign default

in 2012; and a banking crisis with the bursting of a boom in credit to the private non-financial sector

in 2008 and 2009. This section provides a systematic comparison between Greece and other countries

experiencing each type (and sometimes combinations) of similar shocks.


3.1     The Incidence of Crisis

We begin by identifying episodes of sudden stops, sovereign defaults and lending booms/busts.

    Sudden stops. Starting with the work of Dornbusch and Werner (1994), Calvo et al. (2006), Adalet

and Eichengreen (2007) and many others, an abundant literature has explored the macroeconomic

consequences of a sudden reversal in foreign lending. Calvo et al. (2006), in particular, compiled a

list of 33 sudden stop episodes between 1980 and 2004 for a sample of 31 emerging markets. In the

authors’ classification, a sudden stop is identified by the combination of (a) a reversal in capital flows,

(b) an increase in emerging market bond spreads, capturing times of global stress on financial markets,

and (c) a large drop in domestic output. Mendoza (2010) adopts a similar classification, while Korinek
   8 The figures for Greek government debt during the crisis overstate the value of the debt, especially when Greece is

compared to other high-debt countries such as Italy and Portugal. This is because Greek debt is computed in nominal
terms, by adding the principal (face value) payments that are due in all future years, rather than by adding all principal
and coupon payments after discounting them at appropriate market rates. This overstates the value of the debt because
assistance loans by the EZ during the crisis came with long maturities and below market interest rates. In particular, the
average interest rate on Greek debt is smaller than for Italy and Portugal. For estimates of Greek debt in present-value
terms see, for example, Schumacher and Weder di Mauro (2015).




                                                           16
and Mendoza (2014) extend the Calvo et al. (2006) sample to 2012 and to advanced economies.9 As

in these earlier papers, we define the year t of a sudden stop episode as the year of a sharp reduction

in foreign lending that coincides with a large decline in output.10 With this criterion, we identify 49

sudden stop events, 36 for emerging market economies and 13 for advanced economies (see Table 3).

    Sovereign defaults. We identify sovereign debt crisis as in Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012). The

year t of a sovereign debt crisis corresponds to the year identified with a default on domestic or external

public debt, as tabulated by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), Cantor and Packer (1995); Chambers (2011);

Moody’s (2009); Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2007).11 Since 1980, we record 64 default episodes in

emerging market economies, and one in an advanced economy: Greece in 2012.

    Lending booms/busts. Credit boom episodes are defined as in Gourinchas et al. (2001), from

the deviation of the ratio of credit to the non-financial sector to output from its trend.12 A lending

boom episode is recorded when this cyclical deviation exceeds a given boom threshold. The year t of

the lending boom then coincides with the year in which the maximum (positive) deviation of credit

to GDP occurs. Our calculations identify 114 lending boom episodes, 96 of which in emerging market

economies.

    Finally, we identify ‘Trifecta’ episodes: sovereign defaults that coincide with a lending boom and

a sudden stop.13 We find nine such crises for emerging markets, including well-known episodes such as

Mexico in 1982, Chile and Uruguay in 1983, Indonesia and Russia in 1998, Ecuador in 1999, Argentina

and Turkey in 2001 and Uruguay again in 2003. Again, Greece is the only advanced economy to have

experienced a ‘Trifecta’ crisis in our sample.

    Table 3 reports the incidence of each type of crisis for advanced and emerging market economies.

It illustrates the relative prevalence of sovereign defaults, lending booms and ‘Trifecta’ crises among

emerging economies. By contrast, sudden stops are roughly distributed in proportion to the number

of countries in each group in our sample.

    We compare each type of episode to the Greek crisis. For the purpose of this exercise, we consider

that the Greek episode begins in 2010.14
   9 Like Calvo et al. (2006), Korinek and Mendoza (2014) focus on ‘systemic’ sudden stops that occur in times of turmoil
on global bond markets.
  10 The appendix provides additional details. In short, we identify large output drops when the peak-to-trough cumu-

lated output decline in a recession exceeds the median cumulated output decline within group (advanced or emerging
markets). A sudden stop occurs when this large output drop overlaps a capital flow reversal episode, defined as a
year-on-year decline in net capital inflows that is more than two standard deviations away from the country mean.
  11 See Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) for details.
  12 See details in the appendix.
  13 Technically, we record a ‘Trifecta’ episode when the sovereign default event toccurs during a lending boom episode

and during a sudden stop episode.
  14 Different dimensions of the Greek crisis unfolded at different times. According to our dating procedure, the lending

each type of episode is identified are in the appendix.


3.2     The data.

We construct a database of macro variables for a large sample of advanced and emerging economies be-

tween 1980 and 2014.15 The sample contains 22 advanced economies (including Greece) and 57 emerg-

ing market economies, distributed across six broad regions. The list of emerging market economies

includes all countries classified as emerging according to leading outlets and are therefore reasonably

well integrated into global bond markets.16

    In the spirit of a large literature in international macroeconomics, we examine the behavior of key

macroeconomic variables around the three types of shocks discussed above : sudden stops, sovereign

debt crises, and lending boom/busts episodes, as well as Trifecta crises.17 Our event study considers

the response of eight macroeconomic variables: output, consumption, investment, exports and imports

of goods and services, the current account, credit to the non-financial sector, and public debt. The

data is collected from the World Bank’s Development Indicators, the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) estimates of total (domestic and external) gross public debt

for a large number of countries.18 In addition to these macroeconomic variables, we use Reinhart and

Rogoff (2004) and Ilzetzki et al. (2010) de facto exchange rate regime classification and sort countries

into ‘pegs’ or ‘floats’ based on the exchange rate regime in the year preceding the episode. Further,

we split ‘pegs’ into ‘de-peggers’, i.e. countries that abandon their peg within two years of the shock,

and ‘strict peggers’ who maintain their peg for at least two years. This will allow us to contrast

boom peaked in 2008, the sovereign default occurred in 2012 and the collapse in output during the sudden stop episode
occurred in 2013. Nevertheless 2010 is a natural starting point since specific concerns about the Greek economy arose
first in late 2009. The 5-yr spread between Greece and Germany was 120bp in September 2009, but climbed to 277bp
by January 2010, before reaching 680bp by April of that year.
   15 We choose to begin in 1980 because of data availability and also because this period marks a phase of growing

international financial integration, especially for emerging market economies.
   16 Our list includes all countries listed as emerging economies in either J.P. Morgan’s EMBIG index, the FTSE’s Group

of Advanced or Secondary Emerging Markets, the MSCI-Barra classification of Emerging or Frontier economies and the
Dow Jones list of Emerging Market Economies. We add to these countries Israel, Hong-Kong and Singapore, all countries
that are now often included in the group of advanced economies but belong to the group of emerging market economies
for most of the sample. The list of countries in our sample is included in the appendix.
   17 See Eichengreen et al. (1995) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) for seminal contributions.
   18 Detailed sources for each variable are provided in the appendix.

the macroeconomic response of countries based on their post-shock exchange rate regime. This is

an important consideration given the argument -often heard- that the main constraint on the Greek

economy is its lack of nominal exchange rate flexibility (for instance see Krugman (2012)).


3.3     Findings

Figure 8 reports the output response to a typical sudden stop across the 48 episodes (excluding Greece).

It measures output per capita, relative to its pre-crisis level at t-2, in 100-log points, so that a value of

x indicates that output per capita is ex/100 times pre-crisis output. The figure also includes point-wise

one-sided 10% confidence intervals (the greyed area), as well as the trajectory of Greek output (in red

with bullets) during the 2010 episode. As expected, since our definition of sudden stops requires a large

output drop, the mean response indicates a sharp decline in output, marginally significant, close to 10%

below its peak in the year of the sudden stop, followed by a gradual recovery. By year t+2, output has

typically recovered to its pre-crisis level and continues to expand. Two facts are relevant here. First,

Greece experienced a strikingly worse output decline. By 2013, i.e. t + 3, Greek output per capita was

25% below it pre-crisis level (e−0.29 = 0.75), significantly below the average response and showing few

signs of recovery. Second, unlike the typical sudden stop, Greece’s output path was ‘backloaded.’ The

initial recession in 2009 and 2010 (t − 1 and t) is similar to a typical sudden stop episode and milder

than the subsequent decline in Greek output. By contrast, typical episodes are ‘front loaded’ with a

more pronounced ‘V’ shape.19 This is not surprising if we consider that Greece’s sudden stop was of a

particular nature. As discussed in the previous section, the sudden withdrawal of foreign lending was

accommodated initially via ECB lending against collateral, and after 2010 via official assistance from

the IMF and the European Union. Hence there was no sharp immediate downturn, as is typical when

countries experience sudden loss of market access.

Claim 1. The Greek crisis was significantly more severe, persistent and backloaded than the typical

sudden stop.

    Figure 9 reports a similar analysis for the consumption and investment ratios to output. As for

output, each variable is expressed in 100-log points, relative to its value at t-2, i.e. at the beginning of

the episode. Equivalently, this figure reports the growth differential between consumption or investment
  19 By dating the Greek crisis in 2010 instead of later – see fn. 14– it may appear as if we mechanically make the Greek

output collapse more protracted compared to other episodes where the output collapse may have started before t − 2.
This is not a concern: the median duration of output collapses in our sample of sudden stops is 1.5 years for advanced
economies and 1 year for emerging market economies. Only two output collapses last for six years or longer: Bosnia
between 2008 and 2014 (six years) and Ukraine between 1992 and 1999 (seven years). Hence our choice of 2010 as the
crisis year for Greece does not affect the results.

and output since t − 2. The left panel reports the consumption-to-output ratio. In a typical sudden

stop, consumption mostly moves in line with output. Instead, Greek consumption grew modestly

faster than output, although not significantly so. The right panel reports the investment-to-output

ratio. Greek investment collapsed dramatically, much more so than in a typical sudden stop. By 2013,

i.e. t + 3 , the investment-to-output ratio was less than half of its pre-crisis level (e−0.76 = 0.47),

while a typical sudden stop sees a decline of 20% to 30%. Given the decline in output per capita

documented in Figure 8, real investment per capita collapsed by almost two-thirds between 2008 and

2013 (0.75 × 0.47 = 0.35).

Claim 2. The collapse in Greek aggregate investment in this crisis was unprecedented in its persistence

and magnitude, in comparison to the typical sudden stop.

   A sudden withdrawal of foreign capital is only one of the shocks that Greece experienced since 2009

and one might be concerned that the previous comparison might be too unfavorable to Greece. For

instance, like Greece in 2010, Argentina in 2001, Chile in 1983 or Indonesia in 1998, among others,

experienced a simultaneous drying-up of foreign capital, a sovereign default and a collapse in lending,

i.e. a ‘Trifecta’ shock. These episodes are amongst the worst documented economic crises in postwar

history, often accompanied by a banking crisis, and unprecedented levels of economic hardship and

political turmoil. In light of the economic and political dislocation associated with it, one would

expect the Greek crisis to be on a comparable scale. To investigate this, Figure 10 reports the average

output response to each of the following shocks: a sovereign default, a lending boom/bust, as well as

the ‘Trifecta’ shock that consists of these two shocks occurring during a sudden stop episode. As an

additional point of comparison, the figure also includes the average output response for Ireland, Italy,

Portugal and Spain, i.e. the other peripheral countries most affected by the Eurozone crisis (under

the label ‘IIPS’). Finally, the graph also includes 10% point-wise one-sided confidence intervals for the

‘Trifecta’ shocks.

   The figure illustrates how much of an outlier the Greek crisis truly was. While output per capita

initially declined in line with that of a ‘Trifecta’ crisis, by 2011 (i.e. t + 1), output had declined

significantly more and kept falling. By contrast, in a typical ‘Trifecta’ crisis, output is back to its pre-

crisis level by t + 3. The figure allows us to make a number of additional points. First, ‘Trifecta’ crises

are more severe than a typical default crisis, although the differences are small and often insignificant.

Second following a lending boom, output keeps growing. This is because many lending booms in our

sample are not always followed by an economic downturn or crisis, as noted also by Gourinchas et al.

(2001) and Ranciere et al. (2008). Lastly, the trajectory for the ‘IIPS’ countries illustrates that, in

Claim 3. The collapse in Greek output per capita has been significantly more severe and more persistent

than the typical ‘Trifecta’ crisis.

   Figure 11 makes the same point even more vividly. The panel on the left reports the output

trajectory for all countries that experienced a sudden stop in our sample. The panel on the right

presents similar results for all ‘Trifecta’ episodes. Both panels also report the Greek 2010 episode. As

is clear from both figures, Greece’s economic performance is cumulatively much worse than all episodes

from the last 35 years, including crises such as Argentina in 2001, or Uruguay in 1983, with the single

exception of the United Arab Emirates crisis of 2009.20

de-facto exchange rate regime from Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and Ilzetzki et al. (2010). We use this

data to construct an indicator of the exchange rate regime in the year of the shock and the preceding

year (peg/float). We further subdivide pegs based on whether countries maintain their peg for at

of a real estate bubble, and the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices in the immediate aftermath of the Global

least two years after the crisis (strict peggers) or abandoned it (de-peggers).21 Figure 12 contrasts the

output response following an emerging market sudden stop for de-peggers, strict peggers and floaters,

together with that of Greece and of the IIPS countries. The figure also includes 10% point-wise one-

sided confidence intervals for strict peggers. Unsurprisingly, we find that strict peggers experience a

worse adjustment than de-peggers, who in turn perform worse than floaters: by t + 4, output is still

4% below its pre-crisis level for strict peggers, while it is 3% (resp. 8%) above trend for de-peggers

(resp. floaters): a more flexible exchange rate regime is associated with a less severe and less persistent

crisis. Greece’s experience is very singular in that respect as well: its output loss is much larger and

significantly more persistent than for countries that maintained their exchange rate. By contrast, the

experience of the ‘IIPS’ countries is more in line with that of ‘strict peggers’, albeit less severe in 2010

and 2011 (t and t + 1).

    There are two ways to think about this result. One possible interpretation is that the severity of the

Greek crisis cannot be attributed entirely to the strictures of the common currency, since it significantly

underperformed other ‘strict fixers.’ This would direct our attention towards other features of the Greek

economy than just the exchange rate regime. This is not the only interpretation. Clearly, countries can

and often choose their exchange rate regime in response to the economic environment. Therefore, the

sample of ‘strict fixers’ may consist precisely of countries who stand to lose relatively less from keeping

the exchange rate pegged in the aftermath of a sudden stop. This could be the case in particular if these

countries were experiencing a relatively modest decline in output. To investigate this question further,

Figure 13 reports the data for strict fixers, alongside that for Estonia, Latvia and Greece. Both Latvia

and Estonia experienced severe recessions following their 2009 sudden stop episode. Estonia’s output

per capita declined by 19% between 2007 and 2009, while that of Latvia declined by 17% between 2007

and 2010. Nevertheless, both countries chose to maintain their peg to the euro and ‘doubled down’

by subsequently adopting the common currency, in January 2011 for Estonia and January 2014 for

Latvia. Overall, both countries have an experience similar to that of the full sample of strict peggers.

Yet, it could hardly be argued that the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange rate were small for

either country. Instead, their decision to carry forward and adopt the Euro can be related to historical

and geo-strategic reasons, in particular the desire to anchor their country firmly in the West. Both

countries, therefore, adopted the euro despite the large short run costs associated with doing so: the

comparison of their trajectory with Greece’s is unlikely to suffer from a strong selection bias. It is
  21 We classify countries into peggers and floaters based on the ‘fine classification’ of Ilzetzki et al. (2010). Peggers have

an index smaller than 9. The sample consists of 20 floats, 10 strict peggers, 15 de-peggers and 2 others.

therefore interesting that the experience of Greece appears significantly worse than either country.22

Claim 4. The Greek crisis was significantly more severe than the typical emerging market sudden stop,

even for countries such as Latvia or Estonia that maintained a fixed exchange rate in the aftermath of

a sudden stop with large output collapse.

    Figure 14 reports credit to the non financial sector (left panel) and public debt (right panel), relative

to output. The credit-to-output ratio is measured in deviation from an hp-filter trend, while the debt-

to-output ratio is measured relative to the country mean. Each variable is expressed in percent of GDP.

The left panel reports 10% one-sided point-wise confidence bands for lending boom/bust episodes, while

the right panel reports similar confidence bands for ‘Trifecta’ episodes since these episodes witness the

largest increase in public debt. Starting with the credit-to-output ratio, we see that the initial leverage

was high, but not as high as in typical lending boom episodes, around 10% of GDP. The ratio of credit

to GDP was gradually reduced, although at a more measured pace than in typical episodes. Overall,
  22 There are, of course, other differences between the Baltic countries and Greece and we want to acknowledge the

limits of the comparison. For instance, price and wages adjusted more rapidly in Latvia than in Greece. Blanchard et al.
(2013), in a case study of the Latvia boom, bust and recovery, argue that internal devaluation worked fast in part due
to nominal wage cuts, but also to rapid productivity increases that fueled a solid supply response. We explore in section
6 what would have happened in Greece with more rapid price and wage adjustment.

the contraction in credit to the economy is similar to what is observed in other countries. Confidence

bands are quite large.

   Turning to public debt, we observe an elevated level of public debt even before the crisis (18% of

GDP above mean in 2008), increasing rapidly and remaining significantly more elevated than in other

episodes. We can see on the graph the effect of the 2012 debt restructuring (in t + 2), reducing the

debt-to-output ratio from 80% to 60% of GDP above its mean, but followed by a subsequent worsening,

in part due to the collapse in economic activity in 2013 and 2014. Compared to ‘Trifecta’ or other

episodes, levels of public debt remain extraordinarily high and it is clear from this figure that efforts

to bring public debt back to sustainable levels have failed.

Claim 5. Domestic leverage in Greece was similar to other lending boom/bust episodes and evolved

similarly. By contrast, public debt to output remained extremely elevated. Efforts to reduce the public

debt burden mostly failed, despite a substantial debt restructuring in 2012.

Figure 15: Net Exports and Real Exchange Rate The left panel reports the ratio of net exports on
goods and services to output, in deviation from country mean, in percent of GDP. The right panel reports the
multilateral real exchange rate, in percentage deviation from a country mean. Both panels report the typical
response over each type of episode, together with Greece in 2010. One-sided point-wise confidence intervals
for Trifecta episodes. See the appendix for data sources.


(trade balance) illustrates the gradual but large improvement of the Greek trade balance between 2008

and 2014, in excess of 10% of GDP, compared to the typical sudden stop episode. Unlike typical sudden

stops, where loss of market access forces the trade balance and current account to improve overnight,

the overall improvement in Greece was spread out gradually. The cumulated improvement in the trade

balance in a typical sudden stop represents 6.2% of output, 5% of which occur in the year of the sudden

stop itself. As discussed in the previous section, financial assistance and access to the liquidity facilities

of the European Central Bank allowed Greece to spread out a massive and necessary adjustment in

its trade balance. The right panel indicates that most of this adjustment occurred without major

movements in the real exchange rate. Like other countries experiencing a sudden stop, Greece’s real

exchange rate was initially over-appreciated by about 13 percent. Yet, while the real exchange rate

depreciates by 10% in the aftermath of a typical sudden stop (and a massive 35% following a ‘Trifecta’),

Greece’s real exchange rate only depreciated by 4.5 percent between 2008 and 2014.23

Claim 6. The adjustment of external balances occurred more gradually but was nevertheless very

significant in size. The improvement in external accounts occurred despite any significant movement

in the real exchange rate.
  23 As pointed out to us by M. Obstfeld, the fall in spending required by the unavoidable fiscal consolidation required

a large real depreciation, in order to maintain equilibrium on the market for non-traded goods. Absent an adjustment
in the real exchange rate, the improvement in external balances must be associated with an output decline. See Corden
and Neary (1982).

4     Model

This section presents a stylized model of a small open economy in a currency union, with rich macro-

financial linkages. The model is designed to shed light on two sets of issues. First, we want a realistic

enough model that allows us to understand which shocks were responsible for the performance of the

Greek economy, both before and during of the crisis. Second, we want to use the model to perform

some simple counterfactual exercises. To achieve these objectives, the model needs to remain stylized.

In particular, while we introduce many macro-finance features, we abstract from a full micro-founded

model of the banking sector that would put excessive constraints on the data. The model features

eight exogenous stochastic processes. They are labelled ζ’s and each is assumed to follow an AR(1)

process of the form:

                                              ζti = ρi ζt−1
                                                        i
                                                            + σ i εit ,                                  (1)

                                                        
where the persistence and volatility parameters ρi , σ i are estimated from the data, and the innova-

tions εit are i.i.d. with mean zero and unit variance, and i = {dg, spend, ..} is the name of the shock.

We next specify the government, households, non-financial firms and the financial sector.


4.1    Government

Budget constraint. The government imposes a flat tax on income, spends Gt on goods and services
                                     g
and makes social transfers Tt . Let B$,t−1 be the face value (in units of the common currency) of the

debt issued at time t − 1 and due at time t. The nominal budget constraint of the government,

conditional on not defaulting, is

                                 g
                                B$,t                                     g
                                       + τt PH,t Yt = PH,t (Gt + Tt ) + B$,t−1 ,                         (2)
                                 Rtg

where PH,t is the price index of home goods (so PH,t Yt is nominal GDP), τt is a time-varying tax rate,

and Rtg is the gross interest rate on sovereign debt. It will be convenient to work with real variables.
                                             g
                                            B$,t
We define real government debt Btg ≡        PH,t .   We can then re-write the budget constraint (conditional

on not defaulting) as
                                                                  g
                                        Btg                      Bt−1
                                            + τt Yt = G t + Tt +      ,                                  (3)
                                        Rtg                      ΠHt

              PH,t
where ΠH
       t ≡   PH,t−1    is the domestic (i.e. PPI) inflation rate from t − 1 to t. This formula makes clear

that unexpected inflation at time t lowers the real debt burden. We use this convention for all other


                                                         28
nominal assets.


Sovereign default. Sovereign risk plays an important role in the Greek crisis.24 We do not model

an optimal default decision by the government. Instead, we introduce a default shock ε̃dg
                                                                                       t and assume
                                        Bg      
                                dg
that the default happens when ε̃t < F Πt−1 H ; Yt . We assume that the function F is increasing in the
                                                     t
                     g
real debt burden    Bt−1 /ΠH
                         and decreasing in real GDP Yt . For instance, F could simply be the ratio
                           t
                                               h     i                g            
                                                                        Bt
of debt to GDP. The expected default rate is Et d˜t+1 = Pr ε̃dg
                                                             t+1 < F ΠH ; Yt+1 | It , where It
                                                                                         t+1

is the information set of investors at time t. Notice that the distribution of ε̃dg
                                                                                 t+1 can be time varying.

What matters most in our model, however, are expected credit losses, which take into account the

probability of default and expected loss given default. Upon default, government debt is reduced by

some haircut and we let dgt denote expected credit losses. In our quantitative analysis, we adopt the

following log-linear specification for expected credit losses at time t + 1:

                                           g
                                          B                                        
                                dgt = d¯g          bgt − Et [yt+1 ] − Et πt+1 + ζtdg ,
                                                                         h 
                                                                                                                   (4)
                                          Y

        Bg
where   Y    is the average debt-to-GDP ratio, d¯g is a sensitivity parameter, and lowercase variables (e.g.,

bgt ) represent log deviations from steady state values. The sovereign risk shock ζtdg follows an AR(1) as

postulated in equation (1), with persistence ρdg and volatility σ dg . Equation (4) states that expected

default losses increase with the level of debt, decrease with the inflation rate –since the latter reduces

the real debt burden, and increase with the sovereign default shock ζtdg . We will use data on sovereign

yields to estimate the parameters d¯g , ρdg , σ dg . The rate paid by the government on its debt is then
                                  

(in log deviations)

                                                         rtg = rt + dgt ,


where rt is the international interest rate.


Fiscal policy. The government’s spending policy and its social transfer policy are represented by

the same rule

                                  gt = Fl gt−1 − Fn nt − Fr rtg − Fb bgt + ζtspend ,                               (5)


where gt is the log-deviation of spending, and nt , rtg , and bgt are log-deviations of employment Nt ,

government credit risk spread Rtg , and government debt Btg from their steady-state values, Fl , Fn , Fr ,
  24 The literature on sovereign risk is large and we can only refer the reader to the classic contribution of Arellano

(2008) and the recent survey by Aguiar and Amador (2014).



                                                               29
and Fb are fixed parameters, and ζtspend is a spending shock that follows equation (1) with persistence

ρspend and volatility σ spend .25 We have the same rule for transfers tt . We allow spending itself to

be auto-regressive (with Fl > 0) to capture the fact that government programs are often scheduled of

several years. This fiscal rule implies that the fiscal authorities respond to an increase in sovereign debt

by tightening expenditures and reducing social transfers. The term Fn captures automatic stabilizers:

as the economy deteriorates, fiscal transfers and spending tends to increase. This formulation allows

government expenditures and transfers to change both because of macro and financial channels, and

also because of spending shocks. Lastly, we specify the following process for the tax rate:


                                                          τt = τ̄ + ζttax ,


where ζ tax follows equation (1) with persistence ρtax and volatility σ tax and τ̄ is calibrated to the

steady state.


4.2     Households

Household debt dynamics play an important role during the Great Recession so we need to introduce

borrowers and savers in the model. Households are heterogeneous in their time preferences, as in Eg-

gertsson and Krugman (2012) and Martin and Philippon (2014).26 There are two types of households:

a measure 1 − χ of patient households indexed by i = s (who will be savers in equilibrium), and a

measure χ of impatient households indexed by i = b (who will be borrowers in equilibrium). These

households have identical preferences over goods and hours worked, but differ in their discount factors:

we assume that βs > βb . Household i maximizes expected lifetime utility

                                              ∞                 1−γ       1+φ !

where Ci,t is a bundle of home and foreign goods, defined as in Gali and Monacelli (2008) by

                                                                       h

   25 The rate that enters (3) is not necessarily the same as the one in (5) because debt is long term and only a fraction

is refinanced every period. During the crisis, Greek debt was refinanced by official creditors at low rates, in (3), while
the secondary market rate was high. This secondary rate is the one that enters (5).
   26 There are two types of models with heterogeneity: models where types are transient, as in Bewley models or

Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2010); and models where types are permanent, as in Campbell and Mankiw (1989), Mankiw
(2000), Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), and Martin and Philippon (2014). Midrigan and Philippon (2010) propose an
hybrid model that includes precautionary savings but is simple enough to incorporate in a standard macro model.


                                                                 30
where h is the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods and $ is the degree of

openness of the economy. As usual, the home consumer price index (CPI) is

                                 Pt ≡ (1 − $) PH,t  + $PF,t       .


Household default. Households borrow at the rate Rth and can default on their debts. Let dht

be the credit loss rate on household loans. Default is a loss for the banks and a positive transfer

to borrowers, similar to the financial shock described in Iacoviello (2015). The borrower s’ budget

constraint, following the same convention as with the government, is

                                                PH,t Bth

                                                                               + PH,t Ttb .
                                                                  
                                                                                                         (6)
                                                 Rth

where (1 − τt )Wt Ntb denotes after tax labor income, Rth the gross interest rate faced by borrowers, Bth

is the real face value of the household debt issued at t and due at t + 1, and Ttb the transfers received

by borrowers. Borrowers are subject to the following borrowing limit:

                                                            B̄th
                                                  Bth <          .
                                                             χ

In our notations, Bth is a per-capita measure while B̄th denotes the aggregate lending capacity of the

financial sector to households. We later derive this lending limit from the lender’s problem, and we

anticipate the result that only impatient households borrow in equilibrium. The credit loss rate is

assumed to follow the process:



                                       dht = −d¯hy yt + d¯hb bht + ζtdh ,                                (7)


where ζtdh follows (1) with persistence ρdh and volatility σ dh . Equation (7) states that the credit loss

rate on household loans increases with their debt level, decreases with output, and increases with a

household default shock ζ dh . We will use data on non-performing loans to estimate d¯hy , d¯hb , ρdh , σdh .
                                                                                   

Note that dht are realized credit losses at time t, unlike dgt which is an expected loss that may of may

not materialize at t + 1.

   The savers’ budget constraint is


                      Pt Cst = (1 − τt ) Wt Nts + R̃t PH,t−1 St−1 − PH,t St + PH,t Tts ,                 (8)


                                                       31
where R̃t is the nominal after-tax gross return on savings PH,t−1 St−1 at time t and Tts denotes real

transfers to savers. This return is a complex object since savers are residual claimants: in equilibrium,

they hold shares of firms and of banks, but also deposits, government bonds and potentially foreign

assets. Notice however, that in equation (3) we have assumed a uniform tax rate on aggregate income,

and this is what matters in the end. The savers’ Euler equation is

                                              Cst     Πt+1

where Πt+1 = Pt+1 /Pt denotes the gross CPI inflation rate from t to t + 1. Finally, in the aggregate,

we have

                                       Ct    = χCbt + (1 − χ) Cst .


Nominal Wage Rigidity We assume a standard model of wage stickiness, with a representative

union setting wages à la Calvo. The wage equations are standard and satisfy:


                            πtw          w
                                  = βEt πt+1 − λw (wt − γct − ϕnt ) + ζtw ,

                             πt   =    (1 − $) πth + $πtf ,

                            wt    = wt−1 + πtw − πth ,


where πtw denotes wage inflation, wt is the real wage in terms of the CPI (ln(Wt /Pt ) ), ζtw is a wage-

markup shock that follows (1) with persistence ρw and volatility σ w . πt denotes CPI inflation, πth is

home inflation, πtf is foreign inflation, and λw is derived from the Calvo wage setting process. The

first equation is a forward looking wage Phillips curve. Wage inflation depends on expected future

wage inflation, on the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure, and on the wage

markup shock ζ w .


4.3    Non Financial Firms

We separate firms into goods producing and capital producing firms in order to simplify the derivation

of the price setting equation on the one hand, and the investment/Q equation on the other hand.

4.3.1     Capital Producing Firms

Capital firms convert consumption goods into capital through investment, and rent this capital to

goods producing firms for a rental rate Zk,t . The capital stock evolves according to

4.3.2    Goods Producing Firms

Goods producing firms produce differentiated varieties of a domestic good using capital and labor.

The production function for a producer of good j is


                                                                  α       1−α
                                             Yt (j) = AKt (j) Nt (j)            ,


where labor costs wage A is aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). We focus here on the case

where TFP is constant because the model is simpler to present and fits the data quite well. Goods

producing firms are subject to a financial friction that requires them to pay part of their operating costs

in advance, before production is undertaken as in Christiano et al. (2005) or Jermann and Quadrini

(2012).27 Let ψsk denote the fraction of input cost that needs to be financed by working capital loans.

Profits are given by

                                  Profitst = Revenuest − Costst 1 + ψsk Rtk − 1 .
                                                                              


Standard cost minimization yields an expression for the nominal marginal cost,

                                                                  α      1−α

Notice that the working capital friction can be represented by an incremental marginal cost for the

firm. This will be an important property, as it allows financial frictions to pass through to inflation.

Differentiated goods producers solve a standard Calvo problem, given factor demands. Given real
                         MC$ t
marginal cost MCt ≡      PH,t ,   we can write the (log-linear) Phillips Curve as


                                           πh,t = λp mct + βEt πh,t+1 + ζtπh ,


where λp is derived from the Calvo price setting process, β is the discount factor of savers, and the

(log) real marginal cost is

                                          ψsk Rk
                           mct =                     rk + αzk,t + (1 − α) (wt + $tott ) .
                                     1 + ψsk (Rk − 1) t
   27 The assumption that this loan is intra-period is made for simplicity. The fact that the loan is made by the bank

allows for financial shocks to pass through to the production sector, with the added advantages that: (i) we do not need
to keep track of an extra state variable, and (ii) we avoid any complications arising from the interaction of two dynamic
frictions: nominal rigidities and financial frictions. If debt were inter-temporal, we would have to keep track of the joint
distribution of prices and debt, as firms with different preset prices would produce different quantities and thus borrow
different amounts. Intra-period loans allow us to introduce a financial friction that is static from the firm’s point of view.



                                                             34
ζtπh is an AR(1) price markup shock that satisfies equation (1) with persistence ρπh and volatility

σ πh . Notice that marginal costs are deflated in terms of the price of home produced goods, hence the
                                                                                Pt
terms-of-trade adjustment for the real wage, which reflects the term           PH,t .   Finally, we have the usual

static optimality condition for labor demand:

                                                   =                   .

4.4    Banks, Sudden Stop, and Funding Cost

A fully specified model of banking intermediation as in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) is beyond the scope

of this paper. Moreover, the financial sector data necessary to estimate the restrictions of such a model,

such as the balance sheet of banks and its components are not available (see Faria-e-Castro (2016) for

a more ambitious estimation). There is, however, one fundamental insight from the models of banking

intermediation that is theoretically straightforward and, as we show later, empirically relevant. At the

heart of many banking models is a capital requirement of the type

                                                           Btk   Bth
                                                                      

where Vtbank is the franchise value of the banking sector and Btk and Bth denote the outstanding loans

to the corporate non-financial and household sectors respectively, both measured at the end of period

t. This equation assumes that there is no capital requirement for sovereign exposure, as was the case

in Europe at the time. Equation (13) says that bank equity Vtbank must cover a fraction κ of the total

credit exposure to firms and to households. The second important equation is the current account of

the banking sector:



                            ΠH,t+1 Et+1 = 1 − dkt+1 Btk + 1 − dht+1 Bth − Dt .
                                                                  
                                                                                                             (14)


Equation (14) states that nominal bank earnings ΠH,t+1 Et+1 consist of repayment from firms and

households net of default losses, minus the repayment of banks’ liabilities Dt . Finally, bank value

solves a Bellman equation

where σ is an exogenous exit rate, Λt+1 is the pricing kernel of savers, and dividends Divt are assumed

to be a fixed fraction of earnings Et . This captures the assumption that banks cannot raise equity

very quickly, and it implies that capital losses lead to tighter lending constraints, as least in the short

run.

   Equations (13), (14) and (15) capture the fundamental credit channel in the economy. Credit losses

reduce banks’ earnings (14), lower bank value (15) and tighten capital requirement (13). This leads to

an increase in the economy’s funding cost. All else equal, this channel is stronger the higher is bank

leverage. We capture this idea in two steps. First, we model the banks’ (log) funding cost rtd as


                                       rtd = rt + ζtr + ξ d LEt dpt+1 ,
                                                                    



where L is bank leverage (assets over equity capital) in steady state, ξ d is a sensitivity parameter to

be estimated, dpt+1 measures losses on private credit portfolio (households and firms’ loans), and ζtr is

a ‘sudden stop’ shock that increases funding costs to banks. ζ r satisfies equation (1) with persistence

ρr and volatility σ r . Since we only have data on total non-performing loans, we will assume that loss

rates on households’ and firms’ credit are identical: dht = dkt ≡ dpt .

   Second we assume that banks’ funding costs are passed on to banks’ customers (with a constant

margin that drops out in logs), therefore


                                                rtk   = rtd .


Note that in our notations above, rtk is the funding cost of firms, which enters directly the Q equations

(10) and (11). For households, we had defined rth as the interest rate on loans, gross of expected losses,

that enters the budget constraint (6). If we were to quote an interest rate for corporate loans, it would
                
be rtd + Et dkt+1 , and the expected return would be rtd . With our assumptions, the sudden stop shock

is an increase in the country’s funding cost above and beyond what can be explained by domestic

intermediation spreads.

assets of the country (in units of domestic goods). By definition, N F A evolves as

As is common in the literature, we make a technical assumption to ensure stationarity of NFA.28 We

assume that there is a (small) price impact of N F A on the country’s borrowing (or saving) rate

Household Debt. Banks lend to domestic households. We assume that borrowers are impatient

enough to hit their borrowing limits, so



                                                         χBth = B̄th .


The basic model does not pin down a unique borrowing rate Rth . As long as Rth > Rtd , banks are willing

  29 To    see why simply pick some Rh ∈ βs−1 , βb−1 . Given this rate and the other parameters, there is a unique steady
state for bank equity, bank size, etc. Hence there is a unique value for B h . Now, as long as interest payments do not
violate the non-negativity constraint on consumption (which never happens for reasonable values), then     this level of
B h also satisfies the households’ problem since for them B h is a constraint. This shows that any Rh ∈ βs−1 , βb−1     is
potentially an equilibrium, corresponding to different values of B h .

Interest Rates and Funding Costs in the Model. There are four interest rates in the model, so

it is useful to summarize them here. First of all, there is the baseline interest rate rt that enters the

NFA and the Euler equation of savers. Above and beyond this rate there are spreads and expected

losses, so that


                            rtd   = rt + ζtr + ξ d LEt dpt+1
                                                            


                            dpt   = −d¯y yt + d¯b bt−1 + ζtdef

                           rth    = rtd + Et dpt+1
                                                  

   Notice our assumptions here. First, domestic savers do not earn higher expected returns when

there is a sudden stop. They earn r, which remains essentially constant and equal to the rate in the

eurozone. Second, the banks are sensitive to the sudden stop and to credit losses. The sudden stop

ζtr enters the economy via the banks, which then pass it on to their customers. Non-performing loans

dpt+1 hurt banks and increase the funding costs of all private agents. We only have data on total

non-performing loans, so we do not model separately firm and household defaults. We assume that

they move together and we estimate only one equation for dpt . The shock ζtdef captures the evolution

of NPLs that is not predicted by macroeconomic fundamentals.

   Fourth, the government is not necessarily affected by the same sudden stop as the private sector.

The shock ζtdg raises the cost of funds for the government. It captures pessimism by investors about the

creditworthiness of the government, whether or not this pessimism is borne out in equilibrium. There

are many reasons why ζtdg and ζtr are different, but let us just mention two. First as we discussed, the

ECB provided funding to Greek banks both directly and indirectly via Emergency Liquidity Assistance,


                                                        38
insulating them from sovereign risk, in particular during the sovereign debt restructuring. Second

government debt is now largely held by official creditors, rather than domestic banks, attenuating the

link between sovereign and banking risks.

    Finally, while the two shocks ζ r and ζ dg are conceptually distinct, the model features important

feedback loops between the sovereign and the banks. This ‘doom loop’ has been extensively discussed

in policy circles and analyzed in stylized models (see Brunnermeier et al. (2016) and Farhi and Tirole

(2016)). The impact of banks on the sovereign is always present via general equilibrium effects and

tax revenues. If banks experience a sudden stop, the economy contracts and credit risk, both private

and sovereign, increases. Conversely, if sovereign risk increases, the worsening of economic outcomes

increases default in the private sector, affecting bank values. Hence, our model features rich and

complex interactions between the financial and public sectors.



5     Estimation

In this section, we describe the estimation of the model. We combine the Kalman Filter with Bayesian

techniques, which allow us to recover estimates for the structural shocks that affected Greece during

the 2000’s. These estimated shocks can then be used to conduct counterfactual exercises.


5.1     Data, Observables and Calibration

The sample is annual, from 1999 to 2015. Figure 16 shows the eight series that we feed into the model,

all measured in log deviations from steady-state. For interest rates and inflation, we also take the

difference from the Eurozone average series.

    The model features as many shocks as observables, which are described in Table 4.30 In addition, we

allow for measurement error to domestic inflation, wage inflation, and the measure of non-performing

loans since these variables are quite noisy and or measured imprecisely. Specifically, we assume that

we observe x̃t , where

                                                   x̃t = xt + εerror
                                                               t


and εerror
     t     is a measurement error term.31 For household debt, we take as a proxy the series for total
  30 We treat the sovereign spread as a secondary market price that contains information about sovereign risk. On the

other hand, it does not enter the government budget constraint since Greece did not refinance its stock of debt at that
price. In the budget constraint we scale down the spread by a factor of 5 so that it is in line with the data.
  31 In practice, as we will see, domestic inflation deviates most from the model in 2010. According to the Bank of Greece,

that year saw a surge in inflation due to a significant rise in oil prices and an increase in indirect taxes, in particular
VAT.

credit to the private non financial sector for Greece.

   We use a combination of calibration and estimation. We calibrate parameters that affect steady

state variables. Most of the calibrated parameters take standard values for small open economies and

are reported in Tables 10, 11 and 12 in the appendix.

   We estimate the remaining “dynamic” parameters using standard Bayesian estimation techniques

following An and Schorfheide (2007).32 We estimate a total of 25 parameters: the persistence and

volatility of the eight structural shocks, the variance of the three measurement errors, as well as six

other dynamic parameters: the elasticity of expected sovereign default losses with respect to debt to

GDP, the elasticities of private default with respect to GDP and debt, the persistence of the household
  32 The “dynamic” parameters are those parameters that are not required to compute the steady state and that only

affect the dynamics of the model, such as the pass-through elasticities and the persistence as well as the standard
deviation of the exogenous shocks (ρi , σ i ).




                                                                       40
credit equation, the elasticity of household credit with respect to the cost of funds, and the pass-

through of future default to current lending rates. The estimation results, along with our choice of

priors, are described in Table 14 in the Appendix.


5.2      Results

Smoothed Variables The smoothed shocks are reported in Figure 32 in the Appendix. We also

use the Kalman Filter to extract the sequences implied by the model for the remaining endogenous

variables. This provides a good way of gauging the fit of the model. We present the most important

series in Figure 17, where we plot the data and model-implied paths for GDP, Corporate Investment,

PPI Inflation and Current Account-to-GDP ratio.

    The main point to take away from Figure 17 is that the model’s predictions for output and invest-

ment are good, even though we did not use any data on output or investment in the estimation. This

means that our fiscal and financial multipliers are consistent with the data. For domestic price infla-

tion, whose measurement is imperfect, we plot the observed raw data series against the model-based

series that filters out the noise.33 For wage inflation, on the other hand, measurement errors appear

small.

    Figures 18-21 are the first main findings of the model. In each case, the black line is the smoothed

value of the corresponding endogenous variable, in percent deviations from steady state. Each colored

bar represents the contribution of a corresponding shock and its lagged values to the predicted value

of the corresponding variable at each point in time.34


GDP The GDP series in Figure 18 shows how our model interprets the Greek crisis. Around 2000,

credit demand is high and credit risk is low, so households borrow and consume. During that period,

government spending increases more than predicted by our fiscal rule, as captured by the positive

spending shocks. This is the same finding as in Martin and Philippon (2014). This massive fiscal

expansion explains most of the output gap, which is around +15% in 2007. The recessionary shocks

arrive in sequence. The model finds that the sudden stop starts in 2009 and remains very significant
  33 As discussed earlier, the model implies that domestic inflation starts declining as early as 2008. In the data, we

observe a spike in domestic inflation in 2009 and 2010, most likely due to the impact of oil prices (not modeled) and
changes in the VAT rate (not modeled).
  34 Knowledge of the structural shocks and the structural matrices that describe the law of motion for the endogenous

variables as functions of the states allows us to estimate the contribution of each shock to the observed behavior of
each variable in the model. This can be done for any endogenous variable, observed or not. Note that the plotted
contributions of the shocks do not need to add up to the value of the variable due to initial conditions estimated by the
Kalman filter.

until 2013, depressing output by 5% to 10%. It is important to keep in mind that this is a decomposition

with respect to shocks, not propagation mechanisms. For example, the sudden stop shock appears first

in the funding cost of the private sector. But its effects propagate via several mechanisms: lower credit,

lower demand, more private and sovereign default risk, etc. The effect of all of these mechanisms is

aggregated into the bar corresponding to the sudden stop shock (green bar).


Role of Government Spending It is important to understand how exactly the model interprets

fiscal policy shocks. We feed in actual government spending in our calibration, and since the model

implies significant fiscal multipliers (around 1.5), fiscal dynamics “accounts” for much of GDP dynamics.

But that is not how the model computes the contribution of each shock. The model seeks to understand

               why government spending moves using the fiscal rule (5). Government default risk increases in 2011

               and especially in 2012, the year of the sovereign default. From 2010 to 2012, there is no autonomous

               negative spending shock. In other words, the observed path of government spending can be explained

               by our fiscal rule, given the increase in funding costs.35 In reality, spending was largely determined by

               official financing. Under the 2010 program, the Greek government received 110 billion Euros. Another

               130 billion Euros became available as part of the 2012 program and debt restructuring. What the

               model says is that the size of the program (and the implied path of spending and taxes) was consistent

               with a fiscal rule such as (5).

                  Autonomous (negative) spending shocks emerge in 2013 and to a lesser extent 2014 because

               sovereign spreads decrease and spending does not increase (or even decrease). This coincides with

               the implementation of the 2012 IMF and Eurogroup program.

                  Figure 19 reports the decomposition for government debt (left panel) and its yield (right panel).

               Both variables are part of the estimation. We see that the accumulation of government debt is mostly

               the consequence of past spending decisions. Fiscal expansions do not increase debt much in the short

               run because GDP and revenues increase. In the long run however they increase debt. The debt
                 35 Remember that we do not assume that the Greek government actually borrowed at these rates. In equation (3) the

               cash flows are much more stable.

              predicted path for sovereign debt (left panel) and the yield on sovereign debt (right panel) into the contribution of each
              of the eight shocks.


              accumulation after the crisis in Figure 19 is mostly due to spending shocks that happened before the

              crisis. The yield on sovereign debt is also mostly affected by the fiscal shock, and also by by sovereign

              risk. We observe a sharp decline in sovereign risk following the 2012 debt restructuring.


              Markups and Non-performing loans Finally, starting in 2013, two important factors dragging

              down the Greek economy are the rise in non-performing loans, and the increase in price markups. As

              in Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’, the boom and bust in Greek output per capita

              cannot be attributed to a single cause: over time, different shocks played a role. This decomposition

              also indicates that, by 2015, the external drags on the Greek economy due to the sudden stop and the

              sovereign debt crisis have subsided. What remains are mostly domestic factors: some fiscal austerity,

              mounting losses on private loans, and the relative lack of adjustment in Greek prices relative to wages.

                  Investment (figure 18, right panel) is mostly affected by the increase in funding costs due to the

              sudden stop in 2009-2013. In 2014 and 2015, investment remains subdued largely because of private

              sector credit risk, fiscal austerity and especially price markup shocks.

                  Figure 20 reports both expected private defaults (left panel) and the funding cost of the private

              sector (right panel). Both variables are also perfectly predicted by the model, by construction. Private

              Figure 20: Decomposition of Private Default and Funding Cost.                              Note: The figure reports the
              decomposition of the predicted path for household credit losses (left panel) and the borrowing rate (right panel) into the
              contribution of each of the eight shocks.


              credit losses were low early in the sample because of low private default risk, and the strong stimulus

              coming from government spending. After 2007, private credit losses mount rapidly, mostly as a con-

              sequence of macro dynamics. The increase in funding costs due to the sudden stop, the collapse in

              credit demand, fiscal austerity and the increase in private default risk all contribute to raise private

              credit losses. The right panel illustrates that the main driver of private sector cost of funds was the

              sudden stop.36

                  Figure 21 reports government spending (left panel) and revenues (right panel). Government spend-

              ing is largely autonomous in the boom, a finding consistent with Martin and Philippon (2014). In

              the bust, it is explained by the funding constraint, and then by restrictions consistent with the

              IMF/Eurogroup program. Government revenues are dominated by macro dynamics. While tax shocks

              move from negative to positive, revenues decline overall due to the sudden stop and its effect on output

              and investment, the impact of spending cuts on output, and mounting non-performing loans.

                  Finally, Figure 22 decomposes domestic price (left panel) and wage inflation (right panel). Fiscal

              austerity, private sector default and wage compression (negative wage markup shocks) contribute to
                36 As in the case of sovereign yields, one may argue that the borrowing rate for Small and Medium Enterprises may not

              have been allocative at that time. However, recall that Greek banks could obtain liquidity at the ECB and the Bank of
              Greece against eligible collateral. Hence the supply of loanable funds to the private sector was presumably not vertical.

              5.3    Impulse Responses

              We next explore the internal mechanics of the model by plotting some impulse response functions,

              estimated at the posterior mean of the parameters. Each impulse response reports the effect of a

              one standard deviation shock on the variables of the model, expressed in percent deviation from their

              steady state. We present here only a few impulse responses. Other figures are in the Appendix.

                 Figure 23 shows the response to a transfer shock, εspend
                                                                    t     . Our model is not Ricardian. An increase in

              government spending raises the consumption of borrowers, as well as output, employment, investment

              and inflation. As the economy expands, non-performing loans decline. Over time, public debt gradually

              increases, which pushes up sovereign yields. The model thus features a significant but temporary effect

              of a fiscal expansion on output, and a long lasting effect on the level of public debt.

                 Figure 24 shows the response to a sovereign risk shock, εdg
                                                                          t . The fiscal rule forces a cut in spending

              that leads to a drop in output, employment and inflation. The decline in output increases private

              credit risk which feeds back into funding costs and curtails investment. Figure 24 (and Figure 33

in the appendix which looks at the response to a private default shock) illustrate the sovereign/bank

interactions: as sovereign risk increases, the funding costs of the private sector are affected. Conversely,

as private default risk increases, sovereign risk increases as well. In our model, these effects work via

general equilibrium effects.

     Finally, Figure 25 shows the response to a sudden stop, εr . An increase in the country’s funding

cost causes corporate investment to decline. Impatient household debt declines as well, and so does

borrower consumption. The decline in consumption and investment drives output, employment and

inflation down. The interest rate on government debt increases because the decline in economic activity

heightens sovereign risks.

Based on our the empirical analysis of section 3 and the analytical results of section 5, we begin with

a ‘low leverage’ counterfactual. In that exercise, we ask what would have happened, through the lens

of our model, if Greece’s external and internal leverage had been similar to that of emerging market


                                                                         49
economies about to experience a sudden stop. This counterfactual is motivated by the evidence from

section 3 that documents the severity and persistence of the Greek crisis when compared to many

other – especially Emerging Market economies crises. In our second counterfactual we ask: what

would Greece have looked like without a “sudden stop” for private capital? Setting εrt = 0 for all t

represents the situation that would have prevailed with a well-functioning European Banking Union.37

The third counterfactual asks what would have happened if Greece had maintained fiscal discipline

before 2007. In that counterfactual, we set εspend
                                             t     = 0 for all t. The fourth counterfactual explores

the role of price markups and sets επh
                                    t = 0 for all t. This is an important exercise since the analytical

decomposition of section 5 indicates that price markup shocks are an important drag on output and

investment in 2014 and 2015. Our last counterfactual considers the role of price and wage stickiness

in the adjustment path of Greece. As discussed in section 3, other countries such as Latvia or Estonia

that maintained their peg in the face of a sudden stop and output collapse experienced a much faster

recovery. We ask how much a lack of price flexibility may be responsible for this outcome. To do this,

we reduce the calibrated price stickiness parameters λp and λw while keeping the sequence of shocks

unchanged.


6.1     Low Leverage Economy

For our first counterfactual exercise, we calibrate the Greek economy to the level of government, private

and banking leverage observed in the typical emerging market economy just prior to a sudden stop.

   Table 5 compares the leverage of Greece to the leverage of other EMs that have experienced a sudden

stop as described in section 3. It is clear that leverage is much higher in Greece along all dimensions

and in particular with respect to sovereign debt. Typically, leverage in EMs prior to sudden stops is

                     K
smoothed shocks ε̂Tk k=1 we recompute the path of the endogenous variables, x̃T .

   Figure 26 reports the path for the actual data (in blue), the smoothed original estimates (in

yellow) and the counterfactual (in orange). In this counterfactual, Greece would have been much more

constrained in the build up phase of the crisis. The smaller size of its government sector would have

prevented it from excessively stimulating its economy, reducing the output gap from +14.1% in 2007

in the smoothed estimates to +9.2% (top left panel). Once the fiscal contraction, sudden stop and

sovereign risk materialize, we find that they would have had a substantially more muted impact on

the economy. For instance, the peak to trough decline in output is now only 22% instead of 33%.

The decline in investment is also more muted, around 64% instead of 77%. Hence some of the excess

drop in investment observed in figure 9 can be attributed to the exceptional leverage of the Greek

economy relative to other emerging economies. Were it not for its elevated exposure levels, Greece

would have experienced a more typical emerging market ‘Trifecta’ crisis. Similarly, limited external

exposure would have reduced the build up in external deficits, to -6.7% of GDP instead of -8.6%, and

consequently imposed a smaller turnaround in the current account (+8% instead of +12.7%).


6.2     No Sudden Stop Shocks

For our second counterfactual exercise, we keep our vector of estimated and calibrated parameters

fixed, Θ̂, and we recompute x̃T based on a new sequence of smoothed shocks. This new sequence is

identical to the one that we estimated, with the exception that we set the private sudden stop shock to

zero, ε̂rt = 0. Figures 27 reports the results with the same convention as the previous counterfactual.

    The absence of a private sudden stop can be interpreted as the outcome in presence of a well-

functioning banking union. With a European level resolution and supervision authority, foreign and

domestic creditors would have no incentive to run. The counterfactual reveals that a banking union

would have had almost no impact on the path of output during the build-up (Figure 27, top left panel).

Recall that the path for output prior to 2007 was largely driven by high credit demand, as well as by



                                                        52
the stimulative effect of expansionary fiscal policies. The eventual consolidation of fiscal accounts was

unavoidable, with or without a private sudden stop. In other words, a banking union would not have

insulated Greece from the consequences of its past unsustainable fiscal policies. However, the sudden

stop did contribute to worsen the output response once the crisis got under way. By 2013, we find that

output would have been higher by 9 percentage points in the absence of sudden stop, although the

difference would have subsequently declined. Much of the effect of the sudden stop was on investment

(top right panel), which would have been higher by 33 percentage points otherwise in 2013.


6.3     Fiscal Discipline

As mentioned already many times, it is perhaps not entirely surprising that Greece would experience

a serious downturn given the size of the needed fiscal consolidation. What would have happened

if instead Greece had followed a virtuous fiscal path since 2000? We consider this counterfactual

by setting ε̃spend
             t     = 0, i.e. assuming away both the fiscal excesses of the 2000-2007 period and the

subsequent required fiscal consolidation. Figure 28 reports the results. Not surprisingly, the crisis

would have been much more muted, especially for output, government spending and net exports.

Output (top left panel) would have declined by around 16% instead of 33% between 2007 and 2013.

Government spending (bottom right panel) would have barely increased between 2000 and 2010, then

declined a modest 8% instead of 34% relative to steady state. Finally the current account would have

started to improve as early as 2006.38


6.4     No Markup Shocks

Next, we consider the relative contribution of price mark-up shocks, by studying the paths of the

variables of the model while turning shocks to domestic inflation ε̂πh
                                                                    t = 0.

    Figure 29 reports the results. The figure suggests that price markup shocks play an important

role in the analysis. Perhaps surprisingly, in the absence of price markup shocks Greece would have

experienced no boom (top left panel) but a bust of a similar magnitude. Most importantly, this

counterfactual reveals that the increase in price markups has become a significant force hindering the

recovery of the Greek economy: without markup shocks, investment would have recovered to 18%
  38 In our model, eliminating fiscal profligacy would not have eliminated the Greek crisis altogether because we are still

keeping the sudden stop and sovereign risk shocks. Our estimates of the benefit of fiscal discipline are only a lower
bound. This is the main difference with Martin and Philippon (2014) who estimate the impact of sovereign debt on
the sudden stop itself. Martin and Philippon (2014) find much larger benefits of fiscal discipline, but their estimation
requires cross-sectional information from different countries and is not feasible here.

of its steady state value (top right panel) by 2015, while output would have rebounded by 11% of

its steady state value since the trough. Interestingly, lower markups would translate into stronger

deflation, which would have adversely affected government debt dynamics, triggering further declines

in government spending (bottom right panel). We infer from this counterfactual analysis that price

dynamics are crucial to the recovery of the Greek’s economy. Recall that in our model marginal costs

include a financial component due to working capital. The increase in price-marginal costs markups

cannot, therefore, be attributed to an increase in financial frictions that raise the non-wage components

of the marginal costs. Instead, our estimates indicate that lack of entry and competition in product

markets, as well as a rise in firms’ costs stemming from factors such as the uncertainty about EZ exit

and higher taxes on key inputs may be responsible for a very sluggish recovery.

6.5    Latvia: Low Price Stickiness

Our final counterfactual aims to explore the role of price and wage rigidities more closely. Ideally, one

would like to analyze how the Greek economy would have performed had it left the Euro and been

able to depreciate its own currency. Yet this is not a counterfactual that we can easily analyze, at

least without auxiliary assumptions. For instance, under a ‘Grexit’ scenario, one needs to specify what

would happen to euro denominated liabilities. Instead, we ask the converse -and easier- question: what

would have happened if prices had been more flexible in Greece? In the limit where prices are perfectly

flexible, the nominal exchange rate regime becomes irrelevant. It is well known also that price and wage

flexibility may work perversely, aggravating Fisherian debt-deflation dynamics either at the zero lower

bound, or under a fixed exchange rate. Nevertheless, the evidence of Latvia and Estonia discussed in

section 3 suggests that countries with more flexible wages and prices may experience shorter recessions.

To investigate these questions, we keep the sequence of shocks fixed, and reduce the calibrated price

stickiness parameters λp and λw , to half of their original values.

    Figure 30 reports the results. The figure indicates that Greece would have avoided a significant

share of the boom bust cycle, with a peak to trough decline in output of 20% instead of 33%. Similarly,

investment would have declined by only 55% instead of 77%. The recovery in output would also have

been sharper, with output in 2015 8 percentage points above the baseline estimates. We conclude

that faster price and wage adjustment would have dampened the boom bust cycle and accelerated the

recovery.



7    Conclusion

In this paper we analyze the macroeconomic dynamics of Greece before and during the crisis that

it has been experiencing since 2008. This is only an interim report since, six years down the road,

the crisis is still playing out, and the Greek economy is still very much on life support. Nevertheless,

we believe that enough time has elapsed to make it possible to provide preliminary answers. We put

Greek macroeconomic dynamics in perspective by comparing with crisis episodes in other countries,


                                                        56
including sudden stops, sovereign defaults, lending booms and busts, and combinations of the above.

We also interpret Greece’s crisis dynamics through the lens of a DSGE model that incorporates key

features of the crisis such as sovereign default and financial frictions. Using the model, we decompose

the movements of macroeconomic variables such as output and investment, into the contributions of

different types of shocks, including fiscal shocks and shocks to the financial sector. We also perform

counterfactuals to examine how factors such as debt levels, fiscal policy, and price rigidities may have

contributed to the severity of the crisis.

   Our main findings are as follows. First, Greece’s drop in output was significantly more severe

and protracted than in the average crisis episode. Second, the unusually large drop in output was

accompanied by an unusually large drop in the investment-to-output ratio. Third, much of the dis-

crepancy can be accounted for by the higher levels of debt—government, private, and foreign—that

Greece entered the crisis with. Fourth, Greece’s output drop at the early stages of the crisis appears to

have been driven mainly by fiscal shocks and by the sudden stop (which raised funding costs). At the

later stages of the crisis, however, the effects of these shocks appear to have subsided, and the shocks

that account for protracted drop in output appear to be the slow resolution of non-performing loans

and price rigidities in product markets. Hence the micro dimension of the crisis may now have taken

precedence over macroeconomic forces.

   While our model captures a rich set of dynamics, it undoubtedly leaves aside many factors that may

prove to be important when the final account will be written. One such factor is the uncertainty about

EZ exit (Grexit). That uncertainty hampered investment and contributed to the liquidity problems of

Greek banks. Retail deposits in Greek banks dropped by about 50% between 2009 and 2015, while they

remained stable or even increased in Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish banks. Hence, uncertainty

about EZ exit seems to have been much larger in Greece than in the other countries. Some of the

effects of Grexit may be ‘relabeled’ under other shocks in our model, such as the sudden stops, but

introducing a more primitive shock may give a more accurate decomposition. Another factor that

relates to the uncertainty is the political response to the crisis: domestic consensus on a strategy to

exit the crisis was lacking in Greece, while it was present to a larger extent in other crisis-hit EZ

countries such as Ireland and Portugal.

A.2     Definition and List of Episodes

We adopt the following definition of episodes:

    1. Sudden Stop: Our sudden stop episodes are constructed by combining an output collapse filter

      and a capital flow reversal filter. To construct the output collapse filter, we first identify all

      cumulated episodes of real GDP decline (Source: annual real GDP growth from International

      Financial Statistics). We define an ‘output collapse’ as in Calvo et al. (2006), when the cumulated

      decline in output exceeds the within group median (AE and EME). To construct the capital flow

  filter, we measures the changes in net capital flows as follows: (a) year on year change in the

  (opposite of the) current account relative to output, ∆4 (−CAt /Yt ) as in Korinek and Mendoza

  (2013), where ∆k xt = xt − xt−k ; (b) year-on-year change in the (opposite of the) current account

  plus change in official reserves, relative to output: ∆4 ((−CAt + ∆RESt )/Yt ). This measure

  attempts to measure private capital flows; (c) year-on-year change in the cumulated change in

  the (opposite of the) current account + change in official reserves, relative to cumulated output,
         ˜ t +∆RES
  ∆4 ((−CA         ˜ t )/Ỹt ) where X̃t = P3 Xt−s . (Source: current account, official reserves and
                                            s=0

  output in US dollars from IFS). For each measure of net capital inflows, an episode is triggered

  when net capital inflows fall more than two standard deviations away from the mean (both mean

  and standard deviation are country specific). Consecutive episodes less than 8 quarters apart

  are merged into a single episode. Finally, a sudden stop occurs in year t when the trough of the

  output collapse (output collapse filter) overlaps with a sudden stop episode, according to any of

  the above definitions.

2. Sovereign Defaults. Sovereign defaults are defined as in Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012),

  based on the tabulations of Reinhart and Rogoff (2009); Cantor and Packer (1995); Chambers

  (2011). The year tof a sovereign debt crisis corresponds to the year identified with a default on

       domestic or external debt in these sources.

    3. Lending Boom/Bust. We define a lending boom/bust episode as in Gourinchas et al. (2001),

       using the deviation of the ratio of credit to the non-financial sector to output from its trend

       (source: bank credit to the non financial sector from BIS; and depository corporations survey,

       claims on the private sector, IFS). The trend is an hp filter with smoothing parameter λ = 1000.

       Define cytT for the trend component of the credit to output ratio cyt . A boom occurs whenever

       cyt > 1.14cytT (boom threshold). The boom begins when cyt > 1.05cytT (limit threshold) and

       ends when that limit threshold is crossed again. Episodes less than 2 years apart are combined.

       The year t of the lending boom is the year in which the maximum deviation from trend is

       achieved, within a given episode.

    4. ‘Trifecta’. Trifecta crises are defined as a sovereign debt crisis that occurs during a sudden stop

       and a lending boom episode. These episodes are marked with a ‘*’ in Table 8.



B      Calibration

This appendix contains more details on the calibration. Table 11 contains the parameters that we

choose to match steady state targets for Greece. Table 12 contains the fiscal rule parameters that we

calibrate rather than estimate.

    The following table describes the steady state of the model for reference. We focus on a zero inflation

steady state, and normalize all price levels to 1, so that there is no distinction between variables in

euros, or real variables deflated by either the CPI or the PPI. We also assume, for simplicity, that

N F A = 0 at the steady state, and that trade is balanced. This is straightforward to generalize,

by appropriately adapting the interest rate equation. Finally, we assume that steady state transfers

from the government to the borrower are such that both agents choose the same amount of labor and

consumption.



C     Estimation

Our priors impose that most estimated parameters be in the [0, 1] interval, with the exception of some

of the elasticities for which we assume Gamma priors.

    Figure 31 plots the priors in orange and the estimated posterior distributions in blue for the dynamic

parameters, with the posterior mode highlighted in black. Our default priors for shock persistence and

variances are Beta distributions with mean 0.85 and variance 0.1, and mean 0.2 and variance 0.1,

respectively. The only exceptions are the spending and household debt shocks, where we lower the

persistence and raise the variance due to the presence of an autoregressive term in the structural

equations for these variables.

    Using the Kalman Smoother at the posterior mode, we can retrieve sequences for the structural

shocks in the model, which are shown in 32. These are obtained by applying the Kalman Smoother

D     Impulse Responses

Figure 33 shows the impulse response to a private default shock, εdef
                                                                  t . The surge in private defaults

increases the private sector funding cost and reduces the spending of impatient households who are

at their borrowing constraint. This adversely affects investment, output and employment. As the

economy enters a recession, sovereign yields increase. Government expenditures are the result of two

offsetting forces: the recession increases spending (automatic stabilizers), but the increase in public

debt triggers some automatic consolidation. The net effect is a mild decline in spending. Net exports

improve as both competitiveness increases (lower domestic inflation), and domestic absorption declines.

    Figure 34 shows the response of the economy to credit demand shock, εbh
                                                                         t . Impatient households

borrow to finance consumption. This initially stimulates output and employment, and inflation, but

crowds out investment as credit risk increases and therefore private funding costs leading to a subse-

quent output decline. The increase in absorption exceeds output, so the current account deteriorates.
