model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy

(CPE).    The data are from Poland for the period 1955—1980, but the

analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPEs as soon as

the appropriate data sets are complete.      This work is based on

previous papers of Portes and Winter (P—W) and Charemza and Quandt

(C—Q).    P—W applied to each of four CPEs a discrete—switching

disequilibrium model with a household demand equation for consumption

goods, a planners' supply equation, and a "mm" condition stating that

the observed quantity transacted is the lesser of the quantities

demanded and supplied.     C-Q considered how an equation for the

adjustment of planned quantities could be integrated into a CPE model

with fixed prices and without the usual price adjustment equation.

They made plan formation endogenous and permitted the resulting plan

variables to enter the equations determining demand and supply.

This paper implements the C—Q proposal in the P—W context.        It uses

a unique new data set of time series for plans for the major

macroeconomic variables in Poland and other CPEs.       The overall

framework is applicable to any large organization which plans economic

variables.

1.    Introduction


      This paper specifies and estimates a four—equation disequilibrium

model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy

(CPE).      The data are from Poland for the period 1955—1980, but the

analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPE5 as soon as

the appropriate data sets are complete.

      The work reported here is based on the previous papers of Portes

and Winter (1980) and Charemza and Quandt (1982), referred to below as

P—W and C—Q.      The former applied to each of four CPE5 a

discrete—switching disequilibrium model with a household demand

equation for consumption goods, a planners' supply equation, and a

"mm" condition stating that the observed quantity transacted is the

lesser of the quantities demanded and supplied.      C—Q considered how

an equation for the adjustment of planned quantities could be

integrated into a CPE model with fixed prices and without the usual

price adjustment equation.       They made plan formation endogenous and

permitted the resulting plan variables to enter the equations

determining demand and supply.      Depending on the precise

specification of the equation determining the plan, the model could

adjust towards market clearing in a manner similar to that of

disequilibrium models with price adjustment equations.

     This paper implements the C—Q proposal in the P—W context.      It

differs from P—W in several respects: (1) the data are extended

beyond 1975, up to 1980; (ii) the main series have been more or less

substantially revised, using new information; (iii) a plan—adjustment

equation determines the published plan for aggregate consumption by

households; (iv) this plan enters the equation for the supply of

consumption goods; (v) the variables constructed by P—W to measure

deviations from plans for exogenous variables (output, investment,

defence expenditure), which proxied the plan series by second—order

quadratic trends, now use published plan data.      The model here

differs from C—Q in having a more general form of plan—adjustment

equation than they propose.

     The work reported here was possible only because we were able to

assemble reliable time series for plans for the major macroeconomic

variables in Poland and other CPEs.      Using this new and unique data

set, our empirical work can now go beyond the question posed by P—W,

which concerned the existence of excess demand in the aggregate

consumption goods markets of CPEs, to a range of important questions

concerning the planning process and macroeconomic disequilibrium: Are

the plans in a CPE properly represented as endogenous, determined by

stable economic relationships rather than political caprice?      How

do plans so determined then influence the planners and the economy?

Do the planners plan for macroeconomic equilibrium (i.e., does the

plan refer to their planned supply or to their intention for the

quantity transacted)? Is the disequilibrium macro framework

appropriate and useful for the analysis of CPEs (see Portes, 1981a)?

There are also interesting theoretical and econometric questions which

arise, some of which will provide material for future work. The

overall framework is applicable to any large organisation which plans

economic variables.


2.      The Simple Disequilibrium Model


     The basic framework of our general model for Poland is taken from

P—W with the modifications indicated above.       Thus the consumption

demand equation is identical to that in P—W, derived directly from the

Houthakker—Taylor savings function:


     CDt = cLiDNFA_i      + c2DYD + cz3YD + u1         (1)



where

     CD = household desired expenditure on consumption goods and
          services

     DNFA = household saving, measured as the change in net financial
          assets of households, NFA, during the period (NFA. is the
          end—of—period net stock of financial assets); DNFAt_i was
          called Si in P—W

     DYD = change in disposable income from the previous to the
          current period

     YD =    disposable   income


        u1   N(O, n )


Although     it has a rather sophisticated theoretical rationale, this
                                               4                                      FLDABK



essentially just makes consumption depend on current and lagged income

and on lagged consumption.t

         The work of Houthakker and Taylor suggests the following a priori

hypotheses:

         —l < a1        —   1/3,   0 <    < 1, a = 1


         The modified supply equation is

                       +                            +            + 6czxi +
CS =                                + 4RNFAt   1        5CZXDt               u2      (2)


where

         CS = planned supply of consumption goods and services

                   =   plan for consumption in current period announced at end
                       of previous period

         (* denotes a plan throughout)

         NNP =    net material product
         D = defence expenditure

         I =   investment expenditure
         C*Z = (C*/NNP*).(NMPNMP*)

         CZXD = [(D/NMP) —          (D*/NNP*)].NMP
         CZXI = [I/NMP)        —
                                   (I*/NMP*)].NMP
         RNFA =    deviation of current NFA from second—order exponential
                   time trend fitted to observed values of NFA

               N(0, a)

         The annual plan for year t is formulated during the last quarter

of year t—l and announced during December of year t—1.                       These

announced plans we denote by C*, NNP*, etc.                      More precisely, C11
is the level of consumption planned for year t and announced at the

t   In   more conventional form,

                       + (a1 —                      —
         C = a2Y                   a2 + c(3)Yi
                                    5                                   FLDABK




end of year t—l.     The volume of consumer goods actually supplied to

the population in year t is CS.         It may differ from the previously

aunounced plan CItl — indeed, equation (2) is a model of how the
planners depart from their previously announced plan               to

take into account unforeseen developments during year t.

     A planned supply function of this form is explained, justified

and estimated in Fortes and Winter (1977, 1980).           The hypothesis is

that consumption goods supply will be determined by the announced

consumption plan and by deviations from plans of output, defence,

investment and consumption, as well as deviations from trend of

household financial assets.     A coefficient       for the lagged values

of CZ was considered in the general model of P—W but the

corresponding term dropped out of their estimates for Poland and

therefore has been excluded here, while their original numbering of

coefficients has been retained to facilitate comparisons.           On the

other hand, in P—W, defence and investment expenditure were

aggregated, wIth a single coefficient $5•         A—priori arguments here

suggest l = 1;     2' $4 > 0; ' <
     In both the demand and supply equations, we expect a priori that

no constant term should appear.         They were tried in initial

estimates, however, and we could not reject the hypothesis that they

were zero.

     The simple disequilibrium model is completed by


     C =   mm                                        (3)
                (CDt, CS)

where C is the quantity observed.

3.   The Plan—Adjustment Equation


     We have worked previously (Portes et al., 1983) with a model of

the form (l)—(3), supplemented with a plan—adjustment equation

specified as

     C*jti = cSiC_iI_2 +          62't—l + cS3Ct 2   + S4RNFAt2

                 + y(CD — CS) + u4                                 (4)



where u4 N(O,).

     We justified this by reference to the discussion of plannerst

behaviour in Gacs and Lacko (1973) and Kornai (1971).

Single—equation models of plan formation involving only previous plans

and realizations are discussed by Yeo (1983).           Different schemes

yield relationships including the first three terms of equation (4),

with differing interpretations of (&, 2' 53).             We added responses

to observed "excess" household liquidity (RNFA) and to excess demand.

We justified the period t excess demand term in (4) with a "planners'

rational expectations" argument, while recognizing that period (t—1)

excess demand might have been preferable, were it not for the

intractable likelihood function which it generates in the complete

model of equations (1) —   (4).
     An alternative approach to the specification of the plan equation

is to construct a model of optimizing behaviour by the planners.            The

full optimizing problem facing the planners of a CPE in drawing up a

macroeconomic plan is extremely complicated.           Planners' preferences

would have to be optimized intertemporally over all macroeconomic

t We assume that the u's are jointly normally distributed,
contemporaneously uncorrelated and serially independent.

aggregates; the constraints would include the planners' own

macroeconomic model and the reaction functions of households,

enterprises, the agricultural sector, and foreign demand and foreign

suppliers.           Here we consider the construction of the supply plan for

consumption for one period ahead.                     The rest of the planning process

is taken as given.                      The verbal interpretation is more natural if we

consider planning in the current period for period (t + 1), so the

left—hand side variable is                                We shall make a number of

simplifying assumptions concerning the information available to the

planners and how they form their expectations.

     We represent the planners' objectives with a quadratic loss

function, defined as follows:


     L =                                                                     (9)

        The first argument of L embodies the steady growth objective,

 sometimes elevated to the status of the "Law of Planned Proportional

 Development.                  Planners give some weight to keeping the plan close

 to a long—run growth path of consumption.                               is the deviation

 of the plan for t+l from this desired long—run growth path, where g is

 the long—run growth rate and p1 and p2 are weights. The supply plan

for next period which corresponds to the long—run growth

path is a "mark up" (by g) of a convex combination of this period's

plan and actual consumption, which will contain new information about

the consumption market to be incorporated into the planners' perceived

optimum growth path.       The planners may disregard that information —

if   p1 =   0,   = 1, it is only the sequence of plans that matters;

     * 0 is a concession to reality, insofar as they cannot implement

their sequence of plans precisely.       An alternative interpretation

might recognize that C is not known with certainty in t, when the

plan is formed, and the planners' best estimate might be a convex

combination of preliminary data on Cw1th the known                    Ideally
                                                        C11.
X1 should be zero, and in a quadratic specification planners will find

both positive and negative values of X1equally costly.

      The cost of a positive or negative deviatton X may be reduced or

increased depending on plan fulfilment in the current period.

X2 is the deviation of actual consumption from plan in period t.


      Then the cost to the planners of a given     will vary with the

sign and size of X2.      Performance relative to plan in the current

period gives the planners additional information about future

performance, and they adjust accordingly the perceived costs of

deviations from the long—run growth path.    If X2>O,    the planners

find that a plan for next period above the growth path is less costly.

Similarly, if the plan in period t was underfulfilled (          ),   then
                                                          X2<0
the planners find a plan below the growth path again more acceptable

than otherwise. On the other hand, when X1 and X2 have opposite signs

this increases the cost of planning above or below the long—run growth

path. The interaction term, X1X2, therefore enters negatively into

                                       The effect of this term is similar to
the loss function, so a2 < 0.

that of making the weights i.i1and u2 a function of plan fulfilment.

     The second main argument of the loss function is future excess

demand for consumption goods.          There is a large literature about the

planners' attitude to excess demand and supply of consumption goods

(e.g., Portes and Winter, 1980, and Portes, 1981a), and we see no

further need to justify the inclusion of this term.                  Again we should

be considering expected excess demand in period t+l, conditional on

information available at period t.               Again for simplicity, we use

actual excess demand here and treat the problem of uncertainty about

     As with the steady growth objective, the costs

i.e., if the plan implies either excess demand or excess supply for

successive periods, the planners' perceived costs increase. If they

 because the repercussions of both excess demand and excess supply

 cumulate from period to period. If excess demand persists households

 accumulate cash balances, their frustration increases and labour

 supply incentives diminish. Similarly, successive periods of excess

 supply entail the accumulation and wastage of unsold stocks.

      Before deriving the first—order conditions, consider the partial

                                                                    —

     We suppose that when constructing the consumption plan, the

planners assume that the NMP plan will be exactly fulfilled. Thus

In section 5, we argue for the restriction = 1, which is accepted by

the data.         Equation (7) then gives a plan equation

a1 > 0), and we also note that                         + 2 = 1, we can simplify equation


(8) to read:
                                     11                                       FLDABK

The consumption plan is thus a linear function of the previous

period's actual consumption, planned consumption and excess demand,

as well as excess demand in the period being planned.                 The

coefficients on C and C sum     to   (l+g).          The coefficients of both

excess demand terms are positive. Equation (9) is of course quite

similar to equation (4) above. The chief difference is the absence

from (9) of the second—order lag in actual consumption which appears

in (4). Following our previous work (see beginning of this Section),

this term has in fact been included in the estimated plan equation.

The persistent insignificance of its coefficient (see below) supports

the approach taken here.

     The plan equation (9) contains terms in excess demand. To

make this operational, it must be embedded in a model of the form of

equations (l)—(3), where current excess demand           is   endogenously

determined.    Two different problems arise.              First, although it is

theoretically possible to derive the likelihood function of this type

of model with lagged dependent variables (Quandt, 1981), it is still

computationally intractable unless u4 is identically zero.                   Thus

only one of the excess demand terms in equation (9) can be included

in the estimated equation.    The other will have to be proxied by an

alternative measure of excess demand.           The second problem concerns

the treatment of planners' expectations of future excess demand.                 We

discuss this below and in Appendix B.

     For estimation, we write the plan equation as
                                                  12                            FLDABK

        C*,41 =

                                               ÷ S3C   i + 54(C)t_CSt)

               + -y(CDt+i_cst÷i) + u4                                    (10)


where
           =
                 (l+g)u2 + a2


           =                  —         > 0,
                 (1+g)p1           a2



           —        > 0, •y    = a3 > 0
               a4

           +        = 1


     Thus we have                 + 2 =   1 + g, from which we get



a2 = ((S1 + 62)1 —            2         If we take a range of hypothetical values


for ji1, we     can identify a2 as well as (a3, a4, g) from the

estimated coefficients of equation (10).

     Note also that long—run stability requires I(St<l (Portes et al.,

1983).     There are several different ways of Interpreting the excess

demand terms in equation (10) so as to make It operational.

Model 1:

     One relatively simple way of incorporating disequilibrium into

the plan formation equation is to take account of liquid asset

holdings of the population. In this model, to maintain comparability

with our previous work, we consider the formation of the plan for year

t at the end of year t—l. We therefore take a lagged version of

equation (10), which is similar to equation (4). The variable

RNFA2 measures            the deviation from trend of net financial assets

at the end of period t—2 or the beginning of period t—1. The planners
                                     13                                FLDABK



know this variable when they formulate the year t plan at the end of

t—l. Our plan formation equation would therefore be

     Ctl =     lC   lit 2
                            + 2tl +              + 4RNFA   2
                                                               + 4t (11)



It is possible to estimate equation (11) together with equations

(l)—(3), and we call this Model I.         It should be noted, however,

that since no current endogenous variables appear on the 1UIS of (11),

simultaneous estimation of the plan equation is unnecessary and will

yield the same results as estimation by OLS.


Model II:

     We prefer to introduce disequilibrium explicitly into our model

in a manner consistent with the optimizing model developed above.

Taking again the formation of the plan for year t at the end of year

t—l we would have


     C:Iti =                +        +
               5lC_lit_2
                                     —
       + y(CD —
                  CS)   + 64(CDt 1        CSi)    u4           (12)



As remarked above, it is computationally infeasible to include both

current and lagged excess demand terms, and we therefore seek proxies

for the lagged excess demand term.          One possible measure of excess

demand in year t—l is the behavior of financial assets held by the

population, and we take the deviation from trend of net financial

assets at the end of year t—2 or beginning of year t—1, RNFAt2•

This gives the equation
                                                14                                FLDABK




           tlt—l

               + y(CD-CS) + S4RNFA        2    + u4             (13)


       We call this Model ha.                 A slightly more general version of

(13) would allow CDt and CS to have unequal effects on

                   and we might enter this term as I1CDt + 2t              We denote
CJi ,
this formulation as Model hib.                 Model ha is a special case of hib

with           =          i, and Model I is a special case of Model ha with
                    12
1 =   0.
       This formulation also has the advantage of nesting Model I inside

Model II.             The inclusion of actual or realized excess demand for

year t, which was queried above, is discussed further in Appendix B.


Models III and IV:


       There are several ways in which the very strong informational

assumptions of Model II regarding (CDt —                      might be relaxed.
                                                       CS)
One possibility would be to replace (CDt —
                                                            CSt) by E 1(CDt —   CS),
the expectation of excess demand in year t, taken with respect to the

information available in year t—1, i.e. the predetermined variables in

the model.               This variant is closer in spirit to the models which

feature in the rational expectations literature.

           =
c*tlt_l         5iC 1Jt2      + 2tl + cS3Ct      2   + 41'At_2 + yEi(CD_CS)

                                                     + u4                  (14)


       In practice, one computes the likelihood function for this

variant by substituting the equations for CDt and CS in

Et_i(CD_CS).                Appendix B considers assumptions which can be made
                                      15                                   FLDABK



about the planners' expectations at time t—1 of the period t variables

in (CDt —            If the planners' expectations of the deviations of
            CS).
NMP, D, etc., from their planned values in year t are taken to be what

subsequently occurred in year t, we have Model III.               If, as might be

more plausible, the planners' expectations of these deviations are set

to zero, we have Model IV.       Both models introduce restrictions

across the parameters of the equations of the full model.

Model V:

     The strong informational requirements of Model I may be relaxed

in another way as well — by shifting the timing of the plan formation

equation one period forward relative to models I —          IV.      That is, we

return to the original timing of the plan equation as the plan for

t+l formed at the end of year t.           We still face the problem of the

excess demand terms, and we seek use RNFAt_i as a proxy for

(CD+i —                 Our equation for Model Va is then
            CS+i).

                                                      —
     C*11 =               ÷ ts2ct +           +           CS)


                           +   S4RNFAt + u            (15)



 In this model, the planners respond to current disequilibrium

 (CD_CS) at the time they are making the plan for t+l. They also

 respond to the deviation from trend of assets at the beginning of

 period t, since this would be known at the beginning of year t.

 This formulation of the model is to some extent more natural in that

 it mimics the recursive nature of the planning process in which the

 announced plan            is determined before CDt and CS. It should

 be noted, however that the equation for                  cannot be estimated
                                       16                               FLDABK



 separately from (1)—(3) because of the presence of the endogenous
                                                                         C
 and CDt_CSt (for details see appendix B).

         Finally, we also allow for the possibility that the planners

 respond in an asymmetric fashion to excess supply and to excess

 demand.        In Va we permit y =   when CDt > CS and y =     when

 CD < CS , and we call this Model Vb.t

4.        The Plan Data


         We believe this to be the first study of the macroeconomic

behaviour of a CPE which includes consistent and comparable

time—series data on plans drawn from original sources.        The data

themselves throw light on the abilities of the planners, events in

Poland, and planning as a process of prediction.

         We have used plan data from the mid—1950s to 1980 on four time

series for this paper: consumption, NMP, gross investment and defence.

All variables are defined in constant zloties.        The data on both

plans and realizations (actuals), together with detailed discussion of

methods and sources, are given in Portes et al. (1983).        Table 1

shows the absolute deviations (in percent) of planned growth rates

from actual growth rates.         Viewed in this way, the planners'

performance varies markedly over the period.        The worst year in

terms of accuracy is 1972, when investment, which was planned to grow

at 9.6%, in fact grew at 23.017g.       Thereafter actual investment was

t Our Model V is a more general version of what C—Q (p. 112) call
"Model 3.     We include in our plan adjustment equation the terms in
both their (4b) and their (4d), and we allow their coefficients to
differ from unity.
                                    17                                  FLDABK




above plan until 1980.      But the planners maintained a fair degree of

control.    The 1978 plan reduced investment by 5.3%.         Actual

investment rose slightly that year but fell in both 1979 and 1980.

     The 1972 plan substantially underpredicted consumption as well.

Then, starting with the plan for 1976, the consumption plans were

underfulfilled for five successive years, with a remarkably large

shortfall in 1978.       The NMP plans, too, were all underfulfilled from

1975 onwards, with a progressive deterioration in the performance

both of the planners and of the economy itself.

     Of the 19 observations 1957—75, 9 consumption plans were

underfulfilled and 10 exceeded; for NMP, 7 and 12 fell in these

respective categories.       Thus there was no clear pattern of excessive

pressure on the economy by the planners (or overoptimism), nor of

underestimating performance.       From 1976 onwards, however, all

consumption and NMP plans were consistently underfulfilled, reflecting

the continuous deterioration of performance (as Mr. Gierek's economic

strategy disintegrated) and the planners' inability to come to grips

with it (Portes, 198lb).       Investment and defence expenditure plans

show quite different pictures.           The former were consistently

overfulfilled during the period (19 out of 24).          The latter were

underfulfilled in all but two of the years 1957—67, overfulfilled in

 all but one thereafter (through 1980)!

      In relation to the mean planned growth rates, the average

 absolute deviations given in Table 1 show a fair degree of planning

 inaccuracy, if the plans are treated as predictions. Perhaps a better

 measure of the predictive power of the planners Is in terms of levels.

 Table 2 gives some comparisons.          If the standard errors of the

 deviations of planned levels from actuals are compared with the
                                     18                                FLDABK




 standard deviations of the residuals from second—order autoregressive

 processes fitted by OLS to the whole sample, we find the planners

 out—perform the time—series regression for investment and defence but

 not for consumption and NMP. Our consumption function [equation (1)]

 estimated by OLS over the whole sample has a standard error of the

 residuals under half that of the AR2 process and a third of the

 "standard error of the plan'.


5.      Results

       The likelihood functions for the models specified in Section 3

are derived in Appendix B. We used the Davidon—Fletcher—Powell

algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, with numerical first

derivatives.

       We tried variants of each of the models discussed.     Model IV

performed poorly, so we do not report estimates from it.

Model lib (unequal ys) gives no significant improvement in the

likelihood over Ila (which is nested in it), whereas Va is rejected

against Vb.       Thus we report results from Models I, ha, III and Vb.

       All the results we give are from estimation with the restriction

     = 1.     Our theory regards C* as the ex ante supply plan, with

equation (2) representing the planners' adjustment of actual supply

away from that plan in response to new data.      The planners may

consciously intend excess demand or excess supply.       The restriction

assumes only that when they announce the plan, that is what they do

intend to offer to get their intended outcome.      The restriction
     = 1 is accepted by the data for the three models cited and for most

other runs.

      The estimates are given in Table 3.     We see immediately that a
                                    19                                FLDABK




likelihood ratio test rejects Model I against ha, in which it is

nested.    On the whole, the correspondence with prior beliefs about

the coefficients is good. The demand equations for Model I

and III satisfied all conditions; those for Models ha and Vb give c

the right sign, but somewhat too small in absolute value (though not

significantly so), and both also make ct slightly but significantly

less than its theoretical value of unity. The long—run savings ratio

implied by the estimates for Model I is 2.1% in an economy growing at

5%.

      The supply equation is less satisfactory; although the

equation's standard error is reasonable, the plan must be doing most

of the work in explaining supply (which is of course not inconsistent

with the deviations of actual from plan shown In Table 1).      The NMP

deviation term is significant only for Models I and III, with the

correct sign.      The defence expenditure term works well in all models.

But both     and      appear to take the wrong sign consistently. We

discuss this below.

      The plan equation performs well.      The second—order lag on

actual consumption, which we included because of previous work by

others and ourselves but does not appear in the theory of Section 3,

also does not appear in the data:          is insignificant throughout.

The signs of other coefficients are as predicted, and the results seem

fairly stable; this equation is probably "best" in Model Vb. Note

that in Model I, the plan equation is decoupled" from the rest of the

model, and results obtained for it by OLS are identical within the

limits of numerical approximation to those shown in Table 3, which

confirms that our optimization programme is working properly. As in
                                       20                              FLDABK



our previous paper, we can calculate what constant growth rate of C

would be consistent with exact realization of plans in the estimated

version of equation (4). The answer ranges from 5.7% p.a. in Model

Vb to 7.4% in Model I, quite close to the observed 6.3% p.a. growth

of actual consumption in 1957—80.

     As noted in Section 3, we can identify the parameters of our loss

function from the estimated plan—adjustment equation.        The presence

of    is a nuisance here, so we re—estimated subject to the

restriction that       =   0, which was accepted for three of the four
models.       With the normalization a1 = 1, we then find a3 not far from

0.5, a4 in the range 1.4—1.9, and —1.8 < a2< —0.7 for 0.25               0.75.

The smallest absolute values for a2 come in Model Va when p is large,

giving higher weight to C than to C1          in defining the path on

which the planners are trying to keep the economy. The growth rate on

that path is implied to lie between 5.7% and 7.2%. The signs of all

these parameters accord with our hypothesis, and the magnitudes seem

reasonable.

     In addition to examining the point estimates, it is useful to

evaluate the model's ability to forecast actual consumption, C.

Ideally forecasts both from within and outside the sample are of

interest.       In an ordinary linear regression model, it is natural to

compare the point estimate of a forecast with its confidence interval.

Some procedures, such as that of Chow, take into account the sampling

errors of the estimated coefficients.        Others, such as that of

Davidson et al. (1978), confine themselves to the ratio of forecast

     In the present models, since the predicted value of C is the

output of a mm. function, it is not straightforward to calculate its

confidence interval.      It appears that the simplest method of

evaluating the standard error of the predicted value of C is by

stochastic simulations (for details see Appendix A).

       Table 4 shows the predictive performance of the disequilibrium

models.      We use Model Vb, estimated through 1978, to give an ex post

forecast for 1979, and Models I, ha, and III, estimated through 1979,

to give an ex post forecast for 1980. In each case, the prediction is

the minimum of the supply and the demand forecasts. For 1979, the

disequilibrium model is less than one standard deviation from the

actual (see the notes to the Table for interpretation of these

standard deviations). Indeed, it is closer (from below) to the actual

than was the plan, the forecast from an AR2 process on C, or that from

an OLS estimate of equation (1), all of which substantially

overpredicted. For 1980, Model I significantly underpredicted, but

Model ha came within two standard deviations and Model III within

one.      This was a creditable showing in view of the extraordinary

circumstances, in which the output plan proved wildly overoptimistic

(though both the AR2 process and equation (1) do as well as

disequilibrium Model III and somewhat better than I and ha.)

       There are various criteria by which we can assign each

observation to an excess demand or excess supply regime. In past

work, we have used the estimated marginal or conditional (on the

observed C) probability        that CDt > CS (Burkett, 1981 showed that

 the marginal and conditional probabilities were very close for Poland

 in the original P—W study).     Here we report in Table 5 the average

 simulated excess demands generated by each model for each year.

 The simulation procedure is described in Appendix A.    The
                                  22                                FLDABK



average excess demand for a given year is in practice positive if and

only if more than 50 of the 100 simulations for that year show excess

demand, but the correlation with the estimated conditional

probabilities is not perfect.t A more discriminating standard is set

by classifying an observation as excess demand or supply only if the

absolute value of the difference between the average simulated demand

and average simulated supply exceeds twice the standard deviation of

the simulated transacted quantity; in practice, this occurred only

when the proportion of cases in the favoured regime exceeded 75%.

     A fairly consistent pattern averaged from applying all these

criteria with the three selected models.    1959, 1961, 1968, 1971—72,

1975, and 1979 were selected as years of clear excess demand. On the

other hand, 1958, 1960, 1962—64, 1967, and 1976—78 appeared to be

periods of excess supply In the consumption goods market. An overall

(though not unambiguous) judgment suggests 1965—66 were also excess

supply years, while 1974 and 1980 were probably excess demand. This

leaves 1957, 1969—70, and 1973 as impossible to classify. The models

themselves do not often disagree, though Vb differs distinctly from

the other three for 1957 and 1965—66, while Models I and III differ

from the other two for 1973—74.

     This pattern Is broadly consistent with the development of the

Polish economy since the mid—1950s, and It is undoubtedly more

plausible than the classification (using estimated probabilities) in

Portes and Winter (1980).    The dominance of excess supply in the

earlier years and excess demand in the 1970s accords with the

dominance of tight money wage control until Gierek replaced Gomulka at

supply shown in 1976—78 may reflect the plannerst efforts to satisfy

consumer pressures after the political explosion of mid—1976, while

tightening up their control of money wages and letting inflation

accelerate to soak up purchasing power.

     The large estimated excess supply in 1978 appears to be the

consequence of a wildly overoptimistic plan,
                                                 which our models do not

scale down sufficiently in response to the considerable shortfall of

NHP from its plan in 1978.    This points out the relative weakness of

the supply equation, which may in part be due to the absence here of

any treatment of foreign trade and borrowing. For example, the

consistently "wrong" sign on 86 was explained in our earlier paper by

a supposed structural change around 1972, when the foreign borrowing

constraint was relaxed.      Then investment need no longer have crowded

out consumption, and indeed the planners might have allowed for some

multiplier effects of investment on consumer demand and accommodated

 them with additional imports.
                                                                  in the

 supply equation must be viewed in the light of the rather large

 positive coefficient on the RNFA term in the plan—adjustment equation.

A sustained departure of NFA from trend will give a total effect on

 supply, acting through C as well as directly, of

These suggest the planners do indeed seek market clearing: in

response to a sustained increase in household NFA, they would increase

the supply of consumption goods by roughly the same amount.

     Judging only by the equation variance, the supply equation

appears to perform better than the demand equation in Models I and

III, whereas we have the converse in Models ha and Vb. This would

suggest that Models I and III would tend to put a higher proportion of

observations on or near the supply curve —   i.e.,   more excess demand in

those models (see P—W, p. 151). Yet in fact the opposite is true,

which may suggest that the classification of observations between

regimes is not merely the consequence of the relative strength of the

specification of the demand and supply equations.


6.   Conclusions


     We believe we have taken substantial steps towards answering the

questions posed in Section 1 and demonstrating the applicability of

the C—Q model.     Estimation has shown that it is both feasible and

informative to use plan data, and to model the regularities in the

process of plan construction.     The plan depends upon planned and

actual consumption and excess demand.     These announced plans are

embodied in a supply function which reflects, in addition, unforeseen

subsequent developments in the economy.      The planners do appear to

try to adjust announced plans and actual supply in order to reduce

excess demand.     The disequilibrium macroeconomic framework, with

fixed prices and planned quantities, can be estimated for centrally

planned economies and seems to provide insight into their behaviour.

The pattern of excess demands revealed by the data appears broadly

consistent with economic events in Poland.

        We   have data sets which permit application of the model to at

least two other countries, and there are various extensions of the

analysis which we shall explore in future work. Moreover, we intend

to apply a similar approach to other macro variables and markets —

e.g.,    investment, the labour market or NMP itself.

Notes

The second—order autoregressive process (AR2) in C and the
consumption function (our CD, estimated by OLS) are estimated on
1957—78 for the 1979 prediction and 1957—79 for the 1980
prediction.    The disequilibrium model prediction for 1979 is
from model Vb run through 1978, while those for 1980 are from
models I, ha and III, respectively, each run through 1979.
The last line is the standard deviation of Cs from the stochastic
simulations (see Appendix A).    Normally,    would compare the
forecast error with the simulated error of the equation; here,
however, we do not have values of the simulated prediction
errors, but we do have the standard error of the transacted
quantity.

             Appendix A: Description of the Stochastic Simulations


       We performed stochastic simulations for several of the models.

The basic steps in these simulations are as follows:

       1) Define the vector 4 =                                  as (CD,CSt,C) for

models I to IV and as (CD,CS,C+i) for model V. We then can

write the structural equations (excluding the nun                      condition)   as


                 Ay w ÷ u                                          (A.1)

where w =
                  (wit,w2,w4)       represents the exogenous and predetermined

variables and their coefficients from the right hand sides of these

equations, u =          (ui,u2,u4)           the corresponding error terms and where

A is a square matrix of coefficients.

       2) For each observation, t =              1,      ..., T and for each simulation i

substitute in A the values of the estimated coefficients and

substitute in w the estimated coefficients of the predetermined and

exogenous variables and the values of these variables for the tth

observation. Note that A and w do not vary across the simulations i.

       3) For each observation t =             1,     ...,   T, and for each simulation
i =   1,   ...    100 generate three independent normal variables with mean

zero and variances a, o, a, where the latter are the estimated

error variances; denote these simulated normal errors by u for

simulation 1.

      4) Obtain simulated solutions                       by solving

                       Al(w + ui)                                  (A.2)

      5) Obtain simulated values of the actual level of consumption

and the simulated forecast error for simulation I from

                 Cs = inin(y8      ,y5   )                         (A.3)

                                         33



     6) Repeat steps 2 through 5 for simulations I = 1, ... 100

     7) For each t =   1,   ... T compute the arithmetic means and

                                    and f across the simulations I.
standard deviations of y ,      C
     It is possible to introduce three sources of random variation in

a stochastic simulation: variations in the estimated coefficients, in

the exogenous variables and in the equation error terms. We have only

introduced variation in the error terms u1 in the work reported here,

but we hope to investigate full stochastic simulations in later work.

Models I and II:

       It is convenient to derive the likelihood function for Model lIb first,

since the results for models I and [Ia then follow as special cases.

      Model [lb can be written

                      =        +                                            (B.l)

              C           mm
                               (CDt,CS)                                     (B.3)

              C11 = z3t        + y1CD + y2CS + U4                           (B.4)

where C1 represents the plan for period t formulated in t—l. For

convenience of notation this is written below as                       .   We   have also

              z1 = ciDNFAt_i + cz2DYD + a3YDti

      We assume that ui, u2 and u4 are serially independent normal variates

with a diagonal covariance matrix. The pdf of CDt, CS, C is immediate from

(B.1) to (B.4):

The pdf of the observable random variables C, C is

It is easy to show by completing the square that the integrals in (B.6) can be

obtained as

Models Involving Expected Excess Demand (III and IV):

        The likelihood functions for the models involving expected excess demand

in the plan adjustment equation can be obtained as follows:

     The structural equations include (B.l), (B.2), (B.3), but the plan

equation is now

where z1, z2, z3, z and z5 are as defined for Model II. For simplicity we

again denote C1_1 by C and Et_i(CD_CS) by Er_i in what follows. Because

Et_i itself depends only on predetermined and exogenous variables, the density

function of the observable random variables is the product of the pdf for a

simple disequilibrium model corresponding to (B.1), (B.2) and (B.3), and the

pdf of the single equation model given by (B.1O):

      It   should be noted that the model does not decouple into two independent

sub—models because in general, Et_i will depend on the parameters in the other

equations, thus introducing cross—equation restrictions.

      The likelihood function in (B.11) cannot be used directly, since we have

not specified how the term Er_i is to be evaluated. Substituting from (B.1)

and (B.2) into the expression for Et_l yields

                                 =                —            —               —              (B.12)

                    E(uit) —     E(u)
where the expectations E are all taken at time t—1.

     We assume that E(ui) = 0 in model III and model IV. This is consistent

with our assumption that the disturbances are serially uncorrelated, which
                                              37




implies that the conditional mean at t—l will equal the unconditional mean.


Model III:

      One very simple assumption is that the z variables in the expression for

     are all known with certainty at time t—1 and are thus effectively

non—random. If we replace each expectation Involving zs with the corresponding
                                                             = 0 we have from (B.12)
realized value, and if we take E(z4tu4) =          z4E(u4)

              E       =   zlt_ z2t (12z4 )z3  t                                  (B.13)
                  1
                              1 + y(i+2z4)

      This   assumes that the planners know the realizations of these variables

when they draw up the plan In period t—1. Since some of these are period t

realizations, this Is a fairly strong assumption.

Model IV:

      An alternative method is to evaluate this expectation based on an

information set more likely to be available to planners at t—1. We proceed as

follows:

      We assume E(uit) = 0 as before. We also assume that the expectations of

the deviations from plan are zero, giving E(z4) = 0 and E(z2) = 4R11FAt_i

which we take to be zero.

      We then have to evaluate the following:

(a) E(zi). This variable consists of current and lagged income and lagged

savings. The logic of our model suggests that we should use the realizations of

lagged income and savings and the plan for income for period t. We have not yet

been able to construct a suitable series of income plans and we therefore make

the assumption that the planners know at time t—l what Income at time t will

be. We therefore assume E(z )       =z
                               it        lt
(b) E(z3): We set this equal to z3 since it is known (or nearly known) at

time t—l.

(c) E(z4z3): This is the correlation between the (proportional) deviation of
                                                  38



NMP from plan and the non—endogenous variables in the plan equation. Since

    is known when the NMP plan is formed, an assumption in the spirit of the

expectations literature would be that deviations from such plans represent

"surprises" which are orthogonal to the information set on which the plan is

based. Thus we assume z3 to be orthogonal to z4

(d) E(z4u4): This is the correlation between the deviation of NMP from plan

and the residual in the consumption plan equation. We will assume this to be

zero. If Is not z4 is essentially an endogenous variable. We recognize that

while there may be no feedback from actual consumption to actual NMP within one

period, consumption plans and NMP plans (like all plans of macro variables)

will be mutually dependent. We could, however, assume a two—stage process

in which the planners plan NMP, investment and defence and then plan

consumption.

        These assumptions give us


               E(CDt—CS) =
                                   zit —   iz3t                   (B.14)
                                     1 +

so that the "reduced form"          plan   equation for model IV would be

Since the determinants of the matrices on the left—hand sides of (B.20) and
(B.21) have the same sign, we can establish that the model is coherent.

From (B.20) and (B..21) we can immediately obtain the pdf's of CDt,CSt and C1.

Completing the square, integrating out CS for (a) and CDt for (b) and adding

    For model Vb, the y's are asymmetric: y =      U   CD > CS and y =
otherwise.   In this case the appropriate terms (corresponding to the two

regimes) contain      and 2 respectively.
