 1.    Introduction

      Ample empirical evidence demonstrates the persistence of deviations from

purchasing power parity (PPP henceforth).1 The last decade of floating

exchange rates has confronted us with a remarkable contrast between the

behavior of goods prices and that of the exchange rate.2 The exchange rate

between the U. S. and its major trade partners tends to behave according to a

random walk, whereas changes in goods prices demonstrate considerable

autocorrelation. These observations,taken together, describe an economy in

which variations in the nominal exchange rate tend to represent short- and

intermediate— run changes in the real exchange rate. Attempts to explain

exchange rate movements have had limited and questionable success.3 Only in

countries with systematic large discrepancies in monetary expansion rates does

one find a tight relationship between exchange rate movements and the

differential between the rates of money supply growth.

      Debate continues, however, on the economic interpretation of these

observations. Do they demonstrate that the PPP doctrine is irrelevant? Do

deviations from PPP follow a random walk?4 Almost any attempt to model

international transmission must use some version of the law of one price, and

the above empirical regularities raise question about the gap between such

regularities and current modeling strategies.

      The purpose of' this paper is to demonstrate that the above observations

regarding the real exchange rate are compatible with a long-run version of

PPP, in which intermediate—run deviations from PPP are explained by a market

structure of monopolistic competition with staggered and unsynchronized price

setting. We take the case for which each pricing decision involves real

cost. Those costs reflect, for example, expensive collection and processing

of information and lead producers to reduce the frequency of their pricing
                                      -2-




decisions. Each decision will therefore involve the pre—setting of the path

of prices for several periods. A producer is facing potential competition

both from foreign traded goods and other domestic producers. We start by

evaluating the optimal pricing strategy for each producer.   NJext, we turn to

the derivations of the rational expectation equilibrium resulting from such a

pricing strategy. This allows us to derive the path of both domestic prices

and relative prices (i.e., the average price of domestic goods relative to

imported goods) and various covariances between exchange rate changes and

goods price changes. The discussion focuses on the relevance of the EPP

doctrine and the nature of the short- and intermediate-run deviations from

relative PPP. The doctrine of relative PPP postulates that in a world of

stable relative prices, exchange rate depreciation should match inflation rate

differentials.5 The paper demonstrates that, in a market characterized by

monopolistic competition and costly pricing decisions, we obtain systematic

deviations from relative PPP in the intermediate run, although in the long run

prices adjust according to the relative PPP doctrine. The effective duration

of the "intermediate run" is shown to depend on the degree of substitutability

of domestic and foreign goods, and the volatility of the exchange rate. Both

of these factors affect the degree of price staggering. A larger degree of

substitutability between domestic and foreign goods would reduce the pre-

setting horizon, and consequently also the degree of price staggering. As a

result, we would approach a flexible pricing equilibrium, where exact relative

PPP would hold all the time. A smaller degree of demestic-foreign goods

substitutability would work in the opposite direction, generating systematic

deviations from PPP.   It is important to note, however, that quite apart from

the degree of goods substitutability, relative PPP is the underlying long-run

pricing rule.

     Section 2 of the paper describes the model. It starts with a formulation

of the producer problem in a flexible price equilibrium. This equilibrium is

used as a benchmark for the equilibrium obtained in the presence of costs of

pricing decisions. The section ends by determining the rational expectation

equilibrium for the case of a stable covarianee structure where pricing

decisions are made in an unsynchronized manner. Section 3 studies the

stochastic properties of prices and deviations from PPP. Section 4 provides

concluding remarks. The Appendix derives the optimal pricing formula and the

pre—setting horizon.

2.         The Model

           Let there be      Z domestic producers, organized in a monopolistic-

competitive manner.6 All of them face the same demand curve and share the

same technology. Demand facing producer k is given by

                                                                     EPa

where E is the exchange rate, P is the price of' importables, and P. is

the price charged by producer j              .   The demand facing producer k reflects

two sources of potential competition: all the other domestic producers (as

reflected in the first term); and foreign goods, priced domestically as

 E P (as reflected in the second term). An alternative presentation of the

demand facing producer k is:

        We assume that the labor input costs P . To simplify presentation, we

neglect both the potential role of traded input in the production process, and

the possibility that labor is paid according to a CPI index, reflecting the

                                                                           *
given foreign price, assumed to be unity (P 1)                                         The only source of

uncertainty is the exchange rate. We neglect the potential role of other

sources of uncertainty (for example, productivity and domestic demand

shocks). The above assumptions can be relaxed without affecting the logic of

the subsequent discussion.

        Consider a hypothetical flexible equilibrium, under which a producer k

sets its price            at the level that would maximize its profits. Let us

denote the flexible equilibrium price by k This equilibrium will be used

as a benchmark for subsequent discussion. Producer k is assumed to take its

competitorst prices as given. To simplify notation, lower-case letters denote

the logarithmic value of the corresponding upper-case variable (i.e., x                                                  log

X). Direct optimization of profits reveals that:

      Several observations are in order. First,                                         and 6 are linked

together by an additive property:

(5)                                     +   (       —       1) b             1




      Thus, in a flexible price equilibrium k diverges from 0 by a weighted

average that corresponds to the exchange rate (weighted by ) and to domestic

producer prices (each weighted by 6) .                  This additive property corresponds to
the homogeneity postulate: an equa-proportion rise in all competitors' prices

raises        at the same rate. Jotice also as

         we find that    1   ,
                                 6 -   o and                 o   .                    corresponds to demand

elasticity with respect to prices of the foreign goods. At the limit of

perfect substitutability we find an exact version of PPP: i.e., a given

change in the domestic price of foreign goods will trigger an equal change in

the price of domestic goods (in a flexible-price equilibrium).

      If all domestic prices are flexible, our assumptions regarding domestic

producers imply that all producers will charge the same price, p .                                     From (4)

we obtain that in such a case:

      We proceed by assuming the presence of gains from pre—setting the price

path for several periods. Those gains represent savings in the costs of

frequent collection and processing of new information. A related discussion,

though in a different context, can be found in Mussa (1981); Rotenberg (1982)

and Sheshinski and Weiss (1977). The main difference between the present

paper and their approach is that they consider the role of the cost of

changing posted prices, whereas the present analysis focuses on the role of

fixed costs related to each pricing decision. As a result, their analysis

resulted in a policy of pre—setting a price for the relevant pricing horizon,

whereas the present paper sets a price path for the pricing cycle. This

difference is relevant for the rational expectation solution in a staggered

pricing equilibrium. In this respect, this paper is related to Fischer

the role of the degree of substitutability between various goods and the

stochastic structure in explaining the nature of the resultant equilibrium.7

      Suppose that, due to the presence of gains from pre-setting the price

path, producers make a pricing decision each n periods. (The economic

determination of n is studied in the Appendix.) At the beginning of each

pricing cycle, a producer will set the price path for the next n periods.

decide the path of (p ,         p1     •..
                                             p11       )    . The Appendix shows tha the

optimal pricing rule is:

      where Et is the expectation operator, conditional on the information

available in period t .         Equation 7 corresponds to a rule that pre—sets
prices at the expected flexible equilibrium path.

      We assume a stable stochastic structure, and unsynchronized price

setting. Thus, at period t we can find n types of domestic producers,

differentiated only by the timing of their last price pre-setting decision.

Assuming a large number of identical domestic producers, we have in each class

of producers Q/n           rn agents.

       We proceed by imposing the following structure:                                      the exchange rate

        To simplify, the exchange rate path is taken to be exogenously given.8

Each producer is assumed to know all present prices, and the structure of the

economy. From equation (7) it follows that if a producer pre-set prices for

period t        j     periods ago, he did so at the expected flexible equilibrium

level. But the flexible equilibrium price at t is p , thus:

                                                                             0

        Invoking the assumption of rational expectations, we can solve the system

defined by (9)—(ll) recursively. By applying the expectation operator

 Et(fli) to (9) we find, (using (11)) that:

The resultant pre—setting rule is now specified by (12') and (14).

       Several observations are in order. A relative PEP pricing rule implies

equality between domestic price changes and the expected changes in the

exchange rate. This holds precisely for the pre-setting of prices n-i

periods ahead, (12'), where the price is set such as to equate the expected

relative price (p-e) at the "non-stochastic" equilibrium, —                              9.   This

implies that                is allowed to adjust fully to expected depreciation. Note

that as the substitutabilty between domestic and foreign goods rises

shorter than n-i ,          we obtain a pricing rule under which deviations from

relative PPP reflect the interaction between the market structure and

inovations in the exchange rate. For example, producers who pre-set the price


for t     n-2 periods ago          ( p2) did it according to (13'). The expected


relative PPP pricing rule would set p2 at                          +                     Thus, actual

3.     The Stochastic Properties of Deviations from PPP

       The previous section has derived the reduced form for average prices and

deviations from PPP. From (17) we see that a current exchange rate

shock () would affect present average prices by                                         .   It   would also affect

future average prices,      j        periods ahead, by                                      (ojn-2) .     Thus,
                                                                                  1-j.b
its net effect on prices would increase over time, at an accelerated rate.

       The covariation of prices and exchange rate depends on the sum of two

components: the first reflects the trend, the second the volatility of the

exchange rate weighted by the elasticity of the contemporaneous price with

respect to the exchange rate, —                       .    Thus, for inflationary countries the
first term will tend to dominate .                        For such countries,                       will be tightly

related to monetary expansion, and we would expect monetary growth to be

tightly correlated with changes in the exchange rate and prices. For

countries with low and similar inflationary trends, the first term in equation

21 will tend to be of lesser importance, and the covariation will depend on
                                           —13—



           For a low degree of substitutability of domestic and foreign goods, and

a longer pricing cycle (a larger n)        ,
                                                  will   tend to be small,implying a

small covariation of prices and exchange rates.

the extent of contract staggering), which is shown to decrease with a2 2

A larger degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods (dcz>o

which implies da>o) ,         as well as a more volatile exchange rate will reduce

the pre.-setting horizon. Thus, we can state the ratio of                  as a function of

the degree of domestic—foreign goods substitutability           (ct)   .   As   a dwindles,

so does           (both da<o and dn>o) ,       implying that relative prices (e -
will   behave as a moving average of a higher order. For a large n we might

find that relative prices could be approximated by a low—order, autoregressive

process, corresponding to the findings reported in Frenkel (198la).

       The elasticity of average prices with respect to the exchange rate plays

a key role in the covariation of the exchange rate and relative prices.               In

the presence of a longer pricing cycle, we find a tighter covariation. As
 a
 —     o    ,
                most of the short-run variations in relative prices can be explained

by variations in the exchange rate.

       As         gets smaller, the observer will tend to reject the PPP

hypothesis. Even for "intermediate" values of —            ,   in   an economy

continuously subject to variations in the exchange rate, PPP would be

frequently (almost always) violated. But as our pricing rule (14)

demonstrates, this observation is fully consistent with a long—run view of

PPp.

14   Concluding Remarks

     The present paper has demonstrated that observable deviations from PEP

can be explained by the presence of optimally staggered prices in a

monopolistic competitive economy. In such an economy, PEP holds as a long

—run proposition.

     Among the limitations of the paper are the assumption of exogenously

given path for the exchange rate, and the lack of a dynamic analysis of the

path that brought the economy into a symmetric staggered pricing

equilibrium. Thfirst limitation can be resolved by adding the money-market

equilibrium condition to the discussion. For example, if we assumed an

exogenously given path for the money supply, we can solve endogenously for the

exchange rate path.10 Resolution of the second limitation seems

challenging. Suppose, for example, that we observe in the present period an

unexpected change in the stochastic structure. We can expect such a change to

trigger a resetting of the price path by some producers. The tendency to

reset the price path should be stronger for those producers that had pre-set

prices most recently. Such an attempt would tend to destroy the initial non-

synchronized equilibrium. An interesting task would be to derive the

equilibrium path that corresponds to such an adjustment.

                                                Appendix



       The purpose of this Appendix is to study the optimal price-setting

rule. This is done in two stages. First, assuming a given pre-setting

horizon (given n) we find the optimal pre-setting rule. Next, we evaluate

the determinats of optimal n .


       a.    The optimal pre—setting rule

       We found in the text that in a flexible equilibrium the optimal price is

            given by (a).    This   solution was arrived at by solving the following

problem:




(Al)                                            Max r(pk)




       where                        r' (P<) =              —   P
                                                PkDk(Pk)               Lk



       If producer k charges Pk instead of k his profits can be

approximated by


(A2)                            r        =
                                             r(k) 2 k

       (A2) corresponds to the second-order Taylor expansion of profits around

        b. The optimal pre-.setting horizon (n)

        We derive optimal n in several steps. First, we derive the expected

loss from pre-setting                  in period t                 .
                                                                       Next, for a given n we measure
the cost of pre-setting prices per cycle as the net present value of expected

losses during the cycle. Finally, we specify the costs of' pricing decisions

to obtain the n.p.v. of profits in our economy. Optimal n is the result of

minimizing this last expression.

        Applying (A3)—(A5) we obtain that expected profits in period t+k

resulting from charging p<k ,               are:

                              k                     -                      -               -     2

        This result is measured in terms of nominal profits in period t+k                              .   We

obtain a real measure by deflating r2 by                                             the price leve. For

        We   denote by Ht+k the loss in real terms:

can apply (114) to obtain a measure of Ht+ in a rational expectation

equilibrium:

                                    •

        Or, alternatively:


                                         a2 2                                          h1

        If a typical producer pre—sets the price path for n periods, the

expected net present value of the loss from pre-setting (in terms of the

beginning of the cycle) is:

                                             n—i

        To derive a measure of expected profits, we should include in our

consideration the role of the cost of pricing decisions. Suppose that each

pricing decision involves cost c               .       To simplify derivation, suppose that in

period zero we start a new pricing cycle. The net present value of profits,

resulting from following a policy of pre-setting the price path every n

periods, is:


(Al4)                      D         -                 {     (n)    +   c}
                                                                                 1

                                                                                       h n

        where b   is   the net present value in a flexible—price equilibrium (i.e.,

where                   for all t        ,   and        co)         .   We       use         as a benchmark. To

obtain net profits, we adjust D by the n.p.v. of costs resulting from pre-

setting the price path (n.p.v. of c                (n))        and the n.p.v. of the cost of

pricing decisions (n.p.v. of c). A strategy of n1 will minimize the n.p.v.

of        (to zero), at a cost of maximizing the n.p.v. of c. Alternatively,

setting the price path for the entire future (n )                                      would maximize the

n.p.v. of 2 (n) ,       minimizing   the n.p.v. of c.                        In general, we will balance

the two costs at the margin, and n is found by maximizing Dn Following

some tedious calculations we find that

Thus, a necessary condition for generating deviations from PPP is a limited

degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods.

Z4•   Empirical evidence (Frenkel (l981b)) has shown that deviations from PPP

      follow an AR(1) process, with an autocorrelation of .9, close enough to

      unity such that one cannot reject the random walk possibility.

      the interest in pre—set pricing models of floating exchange rates.

7.    Our approach is closer to Fischer (1977) than to Taylor (1979), who

      considers a staggered equilibrium that sets one price for the pre-setting

      horizon, which is taken to be exogenously given.

8.    The random walk choice is motivated by the empirical regularities

      observed in the last decade. In principle, the path of the exchange rate

      can be endogenously determined if one adds the money market equilibrium.
