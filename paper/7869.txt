       The central puzzle in international business cycles is that real exchange rates are

volatile and persistent. Ever since the work of Dornbusch (1976), the most popular story

for exchange rate fluctuations is that they result from the interaction of monetary shocks

and sticky prices. To date, however, few researchers have attempted to develop quantitative

general equilibrium models of this story. In this paper, we do that with some success. We

develop a general equilibrium monetary model with sticky prices that builds on the pioneering

work of Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1989) and Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (1995) to investigate

the extent to which monetary shocks can account for the observed volatility and persistence

of real exchange rates. We show that if risk aversion is high and preferences are separable

in leisure, then the model can account for the volatility of real exchange rates. With price-

stickiness of one year, the model also produces real exchange rates that are quite persistent,

but less so than in the data. If monetary shocks are correlated across countries, then the

comovements in aggregates across countries are broadly consistent with those in the data.

Minor discrepancies are that the model generates too much volatility in relative price levels

and employment and too little in investment.

       In constructing our model, we need to choose whether to make real exchange rate

fluctuations arise from deviations from the law of one price for traded goods across countries

or from fluctuations in the relative prices of nontraded to traded goods across countries or

from both. We choose to abstract from nontraded goods; so that, in our model, fluctuations

in real exchange rates arise solely from deviations from the law of one price for traded goods.

This focus is guided by the data. We present evidence that fluctuations in the relative prices

of nontraded to traded goods across countries account for essentially none of the volatility

of real exchange rates. Using data for the United States and an aggregate of Europe (and

our admittedly imperfect measures), we find that less than 2 percent of the variance of real

exchange rates is due to fluctuations in the relative prices of nontraded to traded goods. This

evidence is consistent with studies which document that even at a very disaggregated level,


                                               1
the relative price of traded goods has large and persistent fluctuations. (See, for example,

the work of Engel (1993, 1999) and Knetter (1993).)

       Our model with only traded goods is a version of Svensson and van Wijnbergen’s

(1989) model modified to allow for price discrimination, staggered price-setting, and capital

accumulation. We introduce price-discriminating monopolists in order to get fluctuations

in real exchange rates from fluctuations in the relative price of traded goods. (See the

work of Dornbusch (1987), Krugman (1987), Knetter (1989), Marston (1990), and Goldberg

and Knetter (1997).) We introduce staggered price-setting in order to get persistent real

exchange rates. We introduce capital accumulation in order to generate the relative volatility

of consumption and output observed in the data. In our model, this relative volatility is

closely connected to that for the real exchange rate and output.

       In this benchmark model, the real exchange rate is the ratio of the marginal utilities of

consumption of households in the two countries. Hence, the volatility of real exchange rates

is essentially determined by the risk aversion parameter and the volatility of consumption,

while the persistence of real exchange rates is essentially determined by the persistence of

consumption. More precisely, we show that the volatility of real exchange rates is approx-

imately equal to the product of the risk aversion parameter and the volatility of relative

consumption in the two countries. We show that this calculation implies that a risk aversion

parameter of about 6 will produce the real exchange rate volatility in the data.

       We also show that the persistence of real exchange rates is approximately the autocor-

relation of relative consumption in the two countries. If prices are set for a substantial length

of time, then monetary shocks lead to persistent fluctuations in consumption and, hence, in

real exchange rates. In our quantitative analysis, we assume that prices are set for one year

at a time along the lines of the evidence summarized by Taylor (1999). We find that with

this amount of price-stickiness, real exchange rates are persistent in our model, but somewhat

less so than in the data.


                                               2
       We investigate two variations of the benchmark model designed to increase the persis-

tence of real exchange rates. One variation is to replace the model’s complete international

asset markets with incomplete markets that allow for trade only in an uncontingent nominal

bond. The idea is that with incomplete markets, monetary shocks can lead to wealth redis-

tributions that increase the persistence of real exchange rates. In the other variation of the

benchmark model, markets are complete, but we replace the model’s frictionless labor mar-

kets with sticky wages. The idea is that with sticky wages, nominal marginal costs respond

less to monetary shocks, so prices do too, thereby increasing persistence. While both of these

avenues are conceptually promising, both give quantitatively small eﬀects.

       In our benchmark model, the volatility of real exchange rates depends importantly

on the specification of preferences. Our preferences are additively separable in leisure and a

consumption-money aggregate. If ongoing technological progress occurs only in the market

sector, then the benchmark preferences are inconsistent with balanced growth. We show that

if technological progress occurs in the production of both market goods and leisure services,

then the preferences can be consistent with balanced growth.

       Many researchers have investigated the economic eﬀects of sticky prices. For some

early work in a closed-economy setting, see the studies by Svensson (1986), Blanchard and

Kiyotaki (1987), and Ball and Romer (1989). The international literature on sticky prices

has three branches. The pioneering work laying out the general theoretical framework is by

Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1989) and Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (1995). (See also the recent

work by Corsetti, Pesenti, Roubini, and Tille (1999).) More closely related to our paper

are those by Kollmann (1996) and Betts and Devereux (2000), who consider economies with

price-discriminating monopolists who set prices as in the work of Calvo (1983). Kollmann

considers a semi-small open-economy model without capital in which both prices and wages

are sticky; he shows that the model generates volatile exchange rates. Betts and Devereux

are primarily interested in replicating the vector autoregression evidence on monetary policy


                                              3
shocks and exchange rates. Finally, for some other work on the implications of sticky prices

for monetary policy under fixed exchange rates, see the work of Ohanian and Stockman

(1997).


                                           1. DATA


Here we document properties of measures of bilateral exchange rates between the United

States and individual European countries and a European aggregate. The series are con-

structed from raw data for individual countries collected by the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), much of

which are available from the Data Resources, Inc. data base. The raw data are quarterly and

cover the period from 1972:1 through 1994:4. The data clearly support the notion that real

exchange rates between the United States and Europe are volatile and persistent. We then

demonstrate, using disaggregated price data, that very little–less than 2 percent–of the

volatility in real exchange rates arises from fluctuations in the relative prices of nontraded to

traded goods. This motivates our decision to exclude nontraded goods from the model.


A. Volatility and persistence of exchange rates

Our measure of the U.S. nominal exchange rate et between the United States and Europe is

a trade-weighted average of the bilateral nominal exchange rates with individual European

countries.1 We construct a price index for the European countries, denoted Pt∗ , in an analo-

gous way, using each country’s consumer price index (CPI). The U.S. real exchange rate with

Europe is qt = et Pt∗ /Pt , where Pt is the price index for the United States.

       In Figure 1, we plot the U.S. nominal and real exchange rates with Europe and the

ratio of the CPI for Europe to that for the United States. Our aggregate of Europe consists

of the nine countries for which we could get complete data: Austria, Finland, France, West

Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Clearly, both the

nominal and real exchange rates are highly volatile, especially when compared to the relative

                                                4
price level. The exchange rates are also highly persistent. (For an earlier analysis emphasizing

these features of the data, see Mussa (1986).)

       In Table 1, we present some statistics for exchange rates and CPIs for the United States

and the European aggregate and for the nine individual European countries. (All the data

reported in the table is logged and Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filtered.) The standard deviation

of the real exchange rate between the United States and Europe is 7.81.2 That is about 4.4

times the volatility of U.S. output (which is only 1.76 percent). Clearly, real exchange rates

are very volatile.

       We also see in Table 1 that both nominal and real exchange rates between the United

States and Europe are highly persistent, with autocorrelations of .86 and .83, respectively,

and nominal and real exchange rates are very highly correlated with each other, with a cross-

correlation of .99. The data on the individual countries show that these patterns are also

evident in bilateral comparisons between each European country and the United States.


B. Decomposing real exchange rate fluctuations

In the data, movements in real exchange rates arise from two sources: deviations from the

law of one price for traded goods across countries and movements in the relative prices of

nontraded to traded goods across countries. To investigate the relative magnitudes of these

sources, define the traded goods real exchange rate as qT = ePT∗ /PT where PT and PT∗ are

traded goods price indices in the two countries. Let the nontraded goods relative price be

defined by p = q/qT . To interpret this price, assume the price indices in the two countries

are given by P = (PT )1−α (PN )α and P ∗ = (PT∗ )1−γ (PN∗ )γ , where PN and PN∗ are nontraded

goods price indices, and α and γ are the consumption shares of nontraded goods. Then

the nontraded goods relative price p is equal to (PN∗ /PT∗ )γ /(PN /PT )α , and it depends on the

relative prices of nontraded to traded goods in the two countries. Notice that if the law of

one price holds, then qT is constant and all the variance in q is attributable to the relative



                                                 5
prices of nontraded to traded goods. Here, we follow Engel (1999) and use several measures

of disaggregated price data to construct this decomposition.

       One measure uses disaggregated CPI data.          The Organisation for Economic Co-

operation and Development (OECD) reports price index data in its Main Economic Indi-

cators, where it disaggregates the consumer price index for all items into indices for food, all

goods less food, rent, and services less rent. We construct a price index for traded goods as a

weighted average of the price indices for food and for all goods less food. Since data on expen-

diture shares among traded goods by country are not readily available, we use U.S. weights

obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor (1992) to construct this price index for each

country in Europe which has disaggregated price data. These six countries are Denmark,

France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. For the European aggregate, we

use the trade-weighting procedure described above.

       Figure 2 plots the real exchange rate, q; the traded goods real exchange rate, qT ; and

the nontraded goods relative price, p. This figure shows that virtually none of the movement

in real exchange rates is due to fluctuations in the relative prices of nontraded to traded goods

across countries. The variance of the real exchange rate can be decomposed as var(log q) =

var(log qT ) + var(log p) + 2cov(log qT , log p). In the data, the variance decomposition becomes

(4.29) = (4.89) + (.08) + (−.68). Since the covariance between the two components is nega-

tive, the maximum portion of the variance of real exchange rates attributable to variability

in the nontraded goods relative price is less than 2 percent. (More precisely, the portion is

1.86 percent = (.08/4.29) × 100 percent.)


C. Alternative decompositions

Table 2 gives some additional statistics on relative prices and nominal and real exchange rates

for individual European countries as well as for the aggregate. Here, although there is some

heterogeneity in the individual country statistics, the bilateral comparisons have the same



                                               6
basic patterns as the comparison of aggregates. For our European aggregate, the correlation

between the traded goods real exchange rate and the all-goods real exchange rate is .99. In

other respects, the statistics in this table are similar to those in Table 1.

       These measures provide evidence that the relative price of traded goods varies a great

deal across countries. Since these measures are constructed from broad aggregates, the law of

one price may hold for each traded good; and the volatility of the traded goods real exchange

rate may arise from compositional eﬀects among traded goods. But we doubt that composi-

tion eﬀects account for much of the volatility of real exchange rates: European countries have

consumption baskets similar to that of the United States, and these consumption baskets do

not change much over time.

       The OECD also reports nominal and real consumption expenditures for four categories:

durable goods, semi-durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. We used these data to

construct traded and nontraded goods price indices and found similar results. (For details,

see Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (1998).)

       Our measures of the price of traded goods are clearly imperfect in another way, how-

ever. They measure the price paid by the final user of the goods and, hence, incorporate the

value of intermediate nontraded services, such as distribution and retailing. Thus, if the value

of such nontraded services is volatile, we would expect the real exchange rate for traded goods

to be volatile even if the law of one price held for goods net of the value of the nontraded

services.

       One way to measure the volatility induced by distribution and retailing services is to

examine wholesale price indices (WPIs). These data reflect prices received by producers and

thus do not include many distribution and retailing costs. These price indices do, however,

include the prices of exported goods and exclude the prices of imported goods; thus, they

are imperfect measures of the real exchange rate. We report in Table 3 relative prices and

exchange rates constructed using WPIs. The procedure we use to construct these indices is


                                                7
the same as that for the measures in Tables 1 and 2, but the number of European countries

is diﬀerent; WPI data are available for the 11 countries listed in Table 3. For the European

aggregate relative to the United States, the standard deviation of the real exchange rate

constructed using WPIs is 7.61, fairly close to the 7.81 standard deviation found using CPIs

(Table 1). The closeness of these measures suggests that volatile distribution costs are unlikely

to be a significant source of real exchange rate volatility.


                              2. THE WORLD ECONOMY


Here we develop a two-country model with infinitely lived consumers that we will use to

confront the observations on exchange rates in Europe and the United States. In our model,

competitive final good producers in each country purchase intermediate goods from monop-

olistically competitive intermediate good producers. Each intermediate good producer can

price-discriminate across countries and must set prices in the currency of the local market.

Once prices are set, each intermediate good producer must satisfy the forthcoming demand.

The intermediate good producers set prices in a staggered fashion.

         Specifically, consider a two-country world economy consisting of a home country and

a foreign country. Each country is populated by a large number of identical, infinitely lived

consumers. In each period of time t, the economy experiences one of finitely many events st .

We denote by st = (s0 , . . . , st ) the history of events up through and including period t. The

probability, as of period 0, of any particular history st is π(st ). The initial realization s0 is

given.

         In each period t, the commodities in this economy are labor, a consumption-capital

good, money, a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by i ∈ [0, 1] produced in the home

country, and a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by i ∈ [0, 1] produced in the foreign

country. In this economy, the intermediate goods are combined to form final goods which are

country-specific. All trade between the countries is in intermediate goods that are produced


                                                8
by monopolists who can charge diﬀerent prices in the two countries. We assume that all

intermediate good producers have the exclusive right to sell their own goods in the two

countries. Thus, price diﬀerences in intermediate goods cannot be arbitraged away.

       In terms of notation, goods produced in the home country are subscripted with an H,

while those produced in the foreign country are subscripted with an F. In the home country,

final goods are produced from intermediate goods according to a production function that

where y(st ) is the final good and yH (i, st ) and yF (i, st ) are intermediate goods produced in

the home and foreign countries, respectively. This specification of technology will allow our

model to be consistent with three features of the data. The parameter θ will determine

the markup of price over marginal cost. The parameter ρ, along with θ, will determine the

elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods. And the parameters a1 and a2 ,

together with ρ and θ, will determine the ratio of imports to output.

       Final good producers in our economy behave competitively. In the home country, in

each period t, producers choose inputs yH (i, st ) for i ∈ [0, 1] and yF (i, st ) for i ∈ [0, 1] and

output y(st ) to maximize profits given by

subject to (1), where P (st ) is the price of the final good in period t, PH (i, st−1 ) is the

price of the home intermediate good i in period t, and PF (i, st−1 ) is the price of the foreign

intermediate good i in period t. These prices are in units of the domestic currency. The

intermediate goods prices can, at most, depend on st−1 because producers set prices before

the realization of the period t shocks. Solving the problem in (2) gives the input demand

Thus, in equilibrium, the price of the final good in period t does not depend on the period t

shock.

         The technology for producing each intermediate good i is a standard constant returns

where k(i, st−1 ) and l(i, st ) are the inputs of capital and labor, respectively, and yH (i, st ) and
 ∗
yH (i, st ) are the amounts of this intermediate good used in home and foreign production of

the final good, respectively. The capital used in producing good i is augmented by investment

of final goods x(i, st ) and is subject to adjustment costs. The law of motion for such capital

is given by
                                                                                    Ã                      !

satisfies φ(δ) = 0 and φ0 (δ) = 0.

         Intermediate good producers behave as imperfect competitors. They set prices for

N periods in a staggered way. In particular, in each period t, a fraction 1/N of the home

country producers choose a home currency price PH (i, st−1 ) for the home market and a foreign

                                                                                   10
currency price PH∗ (i, st−1 ) for the foreign market before the realization of the event st . These

prices are set for N periods, so for this group of intermediate good producers, PH (i, st+τ −1 ) =

PH (i, st−1 ) and PH∗ (i, st+τ −1 ) = PH∗ (i, st−1 ) for τ = 0, . . . , N − 1. The intermediate good

producers are indexed so that those with i ∈ [0, 1/N] set new prices in 0, N, 2N , and so on,

while those with i ∈ [1/N, 2/N ] set new prices in 1, N + 1, 2N + 1, and so on, for the N

cohorts of intermediate good producers.

        Consider, for example, producers in a particular cohort, namely i ∈ [0, 1/N ]. These

producers choose prices PH (i, st−1 ), PH∗ (i, st−1 ), inputs of labor l(i, st ), capital k(i, st ), and

producers, yH (i, st ) from (3) and its analogue. In addition, the constraints that prices are set

for N periods are PH (i, st−1 ) = PH (i, s−1 ) for t = 0, . . . , N − 1, and PH (i, st−1 ) = PH (i, sN−1 )

for t = N, . . . , 2N − 1 and so on, with similar constraints for PH∗ (i, st−1 ). Here Q(st ) is the

price of one unit of home currency in st in an abstract unit of account, e(st ) is the nominal

exchange rate, and w(st ) is the real wage. The initial capital stock k(i, s−1 ) is given and is

the same for all producers in this cohort.

function with respect to l. We use similar notation throughout the paper.

        In a symmetric steady state, the real unit costs are equal across firms. Hence, in this

steady state, these formulas reduce to PH (i) = ePH∗ (i) = P v/θ, so that the law of one price

holds for each good and prices are set as a markup (1/θ) over nominal costs P v. Thus, in this

model, all deviations from the law of one price are due to shocks which keep the economy

out of the deterministic steady state.

        In this economy, the markets for state-contingent money claims are complete. We

represent the asset structure by having complete, contingent, one-period nominal bonds de-

nominated in the home currency. We let B(st , st+1 ) denote the home consumers’ holdings of

such a bond purchased in period t and state st with payoﬀs contingent on some particular

state st+1 at t + 1. Let B ∗ (st , st+1 ) denote the foreign consumers’ holdings of this bond. One

unit of this bond pays one unit of the home currency in period t + 1 if the particular state

st+1 occurs and 0 otherwise. Let Q(st+1 |st ) denote the price of this bond in units of the home

currency in period t and state st . Clearly Q(st+1 |st ) = Q(st+1 )/Q(st ). (Notice that also

including bonds denominated in the foreign currency would be redundant.) For notational

simplicity, we assume that claims to the ownership of firms in each country are held by the

residents of that country and cannot be traded.

        In each period t = 0, 1, . . ., consumers choose their period t allocations after the

realization of the event st . Consumers in the home country face the sequence of budget

constraints

the foreign country are denoted with an asterisk.

       Q(st |st−1 ) = βπ(st |st−1 )                                         .
                                            Uc∗ (st−1 ) e(st ) P ∗ (st )

                                                                  13
Substituting for the bond price in this equation from (12) and iterating, we obtain

        Uc (st ) P (s0 )   Uc∗ (st ) e(s0 ) P ∗ (s0 )
                         =                            .
        Uc (s0 ) P (st )   Uc∗ (s0 ) e(st ) P ∗ (st )

Defining the real exchange rate as q(st ) = e(st )P ∗ (st )/P (st ), we obtain

                     Uc∗ (st )
        q(st ) = κ             ,                                                                              (14)
                     Uc (st )

where the constant κ = e(s0 )Uc (s0 )P ∗ (s0 )/Uc∗ (s0 )P (s0 ). We use this relationship between real

exchange rates and marginal rates of substitution in developing intuition for our quantitative

results.

        The money supply processes in the home and foreign countries are given by M (st ) =

µ(st )M (st−1 ) and M ∗ (st ) = µ∗ (st )M ∗ (st−1 ), where µ(st ) and µ∗ (st ) are stochastic processes

and M (s−1 ) and M ∗ (s−1 ) are given. New money balances of the home currency are distributed

to consumers in the home country in a lump-sum fashion by having transfers satisfy T (st ) =

M (st )−M (st−1 ). Likewise, transfers of foreign currency to foreign consumers satisfy T ∗ (st ) =

M ∗ (st ) − M ∗ (st−1 ).

        An equilibrium requires several market-clearing conditions. The resource constraint

in the home country is given by
                              Z    1
            t          t
        y(s ) = c(s ) +                x(i, st ) di
                               0

                                                               R
and the labor market-clearing condition is l(st ) = l(i, st ) di. Similar conditions hold for the

foreign country. The market-clearing condition for contingent bonds is B(st ) + B ∗ (st ) = 0.

        An equilibrium for this economy is a collection of allocations for home consumers

c(st ), l(st ), M (st ), B(st+1 ); allocations for foreign consumers c∗ (st ), l∗ (st ), M ∗ (st ), B ∗ (st+1 );

allocations and prices for home intermediate good producers yH (i, st ), yH
                                                                          ∗
                                                                            (i, st ), l(i, st ), x(i, st ),

and PH (i, st−1 ), PH∗ (i, st−1 ) for i ∈ [0, 1]; allocations and prices for foreign intermediate good

producers yF (i, st ), yF∗ (i, st ), l∗ (i, st ), x∗ (i, st ), and PF (i, st−1 ), PF∗ (i, st−1 ) for i ∈ [0, 1]; and

allocations for home and foreign final good producers y(st ), y ∗ (st ), final good prices P (st ),

                                                          14
P ∗ (st ), real wages w(st ), w∗ (st ), and bond prices Q(st+1 |st ) that satisfy the following five

conditions: (i) the consumer allocations solve the consumers’ problem; (ii) the prices of

intermediate good producers solve their maximization problem; (iii) the final good producers’

allocations solve their problem; (iv) the market-clearing conditions hold; and (v) the money

supply processes and transfers satisfy the specifications above.

       We are interested in a stationary equilibrium and thus restrict the stochastic processes

for the growth rates of the money supplies to be Markovian. To make the economy stationary,

we deflate all nominal variables by the level of the relevant money supply. A stationary

equilibrium for this economy consists of stationary decision rules and pricing rules that are

functions of the state of the economy. The state of the economy when monopolists make their

pricing decisions (that is, before the event st is realized) must record the capital stocks for

a representative monopolist in each cohort in the two countries, the prices set by the other

N − 1 cohorts in the two countries, and the period t − 1 monetary shocks. The shocks from

period t − 1 are needed because they help forecast the shocks in period t. The current shocks

are also included in the state of the economy when the rest of the decisions are made (that is,

after the event st is realized). We compute the equilibrium using standard methods to obtain

linear decision rules (Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000)). For the benchmark preferences

with one-quarter price-stickiness, we checked the accuracy of the linear decision rules against

nonlinear decision rules obtained by the finite element method. (For an introduction to the

finite element method, see McGrattan (1996).)

                                      3. CALIBRATION

Now we must choose values for this benchmark model’s parameters. We report all our choices

in the top panel of Table 4.

       We consider a benchmark utility function of the form
                                                       η 1−σ
                                                µ ¶ η−1  η−1
                          1     η−1            M η              (1 − l)(1−γ)
       U(c, l, M/P ) =          ωc η + (1 − ω)                 +ψ                            (15)
                         1−σ                          P                         1−γ

                                                15
and an intermediate good production function of the form F (k, l) = k α l1−α . Notice that the

utility function is separable between a consumption-money aggregate and leisure.

       Consider first the preference parameters. The discount factor β is set so as to give

an annual real return to capital of 4 percent. The parameters ψ and γ are set so that the

elasticity of labor supply, with marginal utility held constant, is 2 and the time devoted to

work is one-quarter of the total time in the steady state. The literature has a wide range

of estimates for the curvature parameter σ. We set it to 6 and show later that this value is

critical for generating the right volatility in the real exchange rate.

       To obtain η and ω, we draw on the money demand literature. Our model can be

used to price a variety of assets, including a nominal bond which costs one dollar at st and

pays R(st ) dollars in all states st+1 . The first-order condition for this asset can be written as

Um (st ) = Uc (st )[R(st ) − 1]/R(st ). When we use our benchmark specification of utility, the

first-order condition can be rewritten as
                                                      Ã           !
           M (st )           ω           t           R(st ) − 1
       log         = −η log     + log c(s  ) − η log            ,                             (16)
           P (st )          1−ω                       R(st )

which has the form of a standard money demand function with consumption and interest

rates. To obtain η, we ran a quarterly regression from 1960 to 1995 (inclusive) in which

we used M1 for money; the GDP deflator for P ; consumption of durables, nondurables, and

services for c; and the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate for R. Our estimate of the interest

elasticity is η = .39, and the implied value for ω is .94.

       Consider next the final good technology parameters. In our model, the elasticity of

substitution between home goods and foreign goods is 1/(1 − ρ). Studies have estimated

quite a range for this parameter. The most reliable studies seem to indicate that for the

United States the elasticity is between 1 and 2, and values in this range are generally used

in empirical trade models. (See, for example, the survey by Stern, Francis, and Schumacher

(1976).) For an aggregate of Europe, the elasticity seems to be smaller. (See, for example,


                                                16
the discussions of Whalley (1985, Ch. 5) and Deardorﬀ and Stern (1990, Ch. 3).) We follow

the work of Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1994) and use an elasticity of 1.5. To set a1 and
                                                                1
a2 , note that in a symmetric steady state, yH /yF = [a1 /a2 ] 1−ρ . In U.S. data, imports from

Europe are roughly 1.6 percent of GDP. This implies that yH /yF = .984/.016. Together with

our normalization, this gives the values of a1 and a2 .

       For the intermediate good technology parameters, we set the capital share parameter

α = 1/3 and the depreciation rate δ = .021, as is standard in the real business cycle literature.

Based on work of Basu and Fernald (1994,1995), Basu and Kimball (1997), and Basu (1996),

we chose θ = .9, which implies a markup of 11 percent and an elasticity of demand of 10. We

also need to choose the length of price-stickiness N. Taylor (1999) summarizes the empirical

studies on price-setting and concludes that the average length of time between price changes

is about a year. We set N = 4, so that prices are set for four quarters.

       We consider an adjustment function of the form φ(x/k) = b(x/k − δ)2 /2. Notice that

with this specification at the steady state, both the total and marginal costs of adjustment

are 0. Uncertainty about the size of these adjustment costs is high. In all of our experiments,

we choose the parameter b so that the standard deviation of consumption relative to the

standard deviation of output is equal to that in the data. One measure of the adjustment

costs is the resources used up in adjusting capital relative to investment given by φ(x/k)/x.

For our benchmark economy, the resource cost in adjusting capital is .22 percent of investment

when averaged across firms, time, and simulations.

       The details of the monetary rules followed in the United States and Europe are ex-

tensively debated. Here we assume that all the monetary authorities follow a simple rule,

namely, that the growth rate of the money stocks for both areas follows a process of the form

        log µt = ρµ log µt−1 + εµt
                                                                                            (17)
        log µ∗t = ρµ log µ∗t−1 + ε∗µt ,

where (εµ , ε∗µ ) is a normally distributed, mean-zero shock. (Notice that each period now has a

                                               17
continuum of states. Our earlier analysis with a finite number of states extends immediately

to this case.) Each shock has a standard deviation of σ µ , and the shocks have a positive

cross-correlation. The stochastic process for money in the foreign country is the same. We

choose ρµ = .57 from the data by running a regression of the form (17) on quarterly U.S. data

for M1 from 1973 through 1995 (obtained from Citibase). In our experiments, we choose the

standard deviation of these shocks that will give the same volatility for output as in the U.S.

data. We also choose the cross-correlation of these shocks so as to produce a cross-correlation

for outputs that is similar to that in the data. We choose the standard deviation and the

cross-correlation of these shocks in this way because we want to investigate whether a model

in which monetary shocks account for the observed movements in outputs can also account

for the observed movements in exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables.


                                       4. FINDINGS


We report on the H-P—filtered statistics for the data, the benchmark economy, and some

variations on that economy in Tables 5 and 6. The statistics for the data are all computed

with the United States as the home country and the aggregate of Europe as the foreign

country. Thus, all the numbers that refer to GDP, consumption, net exports, and so on are

from U.S. data, while the price ratio, for example, refers to the price index for the United

States relative to that for Europe. Statistics for exchange rates and the price ratio for the

data reported in Table 5 are taken from Table 1 (with the standard deviations normalized

by the standard deviation of U.S. output). Business cycle statistics reported in Table 6 are

based on data reported by the OECD.3

       Overall, we find that the benchmark model generates nominal and real exchange rates

that match the data qualitatively: they are volatile, persistent, and highly cross-correlated.

However, quantitatively, along some dimensions, the model does less well: while its volatility

of exchange rates is about right, it generates too little persistence in exchange rates, too much


                                               18
volatility in the price ratio and employment, and too little volatility in investment.

       In Table 5, we see that in the benchmark model, compared to output, the nominal

exchange rate is 4.84 times as variable and the real exchange rate is 4.88 times as variable.

These values are close to those in the data (4.74 and 4.43). The benchmark model also

produces substantial persistence (autocorrelations) of nominal and real exchange rates (.68

and .63), but this persistence is less than that in the data (.86 and .83).

       The high volatility of real exchange rates comes from our choice of a high curvature

parameter σ, which corresponds to a choice of high risk aversion. To see the connection

between volatility and σ, log-linearize the expression for real exchange rates, (14), to obtain

       q̂ = A(ĉ − ĉ∗ ) + B(m̂ − m̂∗ ) + D(ˆl − ˆl∗ ),                                   (18)

where a caret denotes the deviation from the steady state of the log of the variable and m, m∗

denote real balances. The coeﬃcients A, B, and D are given by

               cUcc       mUcm       lUcl
       A=−          , B=−      , D=−      ,
                Uc         Uc         Uc

evaluated at the steady state. For preferences expressed in the utility function (15), the

coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion A is approximately equal to the curvature parameter

σ = 6, B is unimportant, and D = 0. (The actual values are A = 5.94 and B = .06. Notice

that A is only approximately equal to σ because of the nonseparability between consumption

and money balances.) Thus, for our preferences,

       std(q̂) ∼ std(ĉ − ĉ∗ )
               =σ               .
       std(ŷ)     std(ŷ)

       In Figure 3 we graph the benchmark model’s volatility of the real exchange rates

against the curvature parameter σ, where this volatility is measured as in Table 5. As we

vary σ, we alter the adjustment cost parameter b to keep roughly unchanged the standard

deviation of consumption relative to that of output.4 We see that a curvature parameter of

about 6 is needed to reproduce the data’s volatility of real exchange rates relative to output

                                                    19
(4.43). Note also in Figure 3 that as σ is varied, the autocorrelation of real exchange rates is

essentially unchanged.

       In terms of the persistence of real exchange rates, for our preferences the autocorrela-

tion of real exchange rates can be written as

       corr(q̂, q̂−1 ) ∼
                       = corr(ĉ − ĉ∗ , ĉ−1 − ĉ∗−1 ).

This expression suggests that the autocorrelation of real exchange rates is essentially deter-

mined by the autocorrelation of consumption. In Table 6, we see that the autocorrelation of

consumption in the model is high (.63) but less than that in the data (.85), which mirrors the

feature (from Table 5) that the autocorrelation of real exchange rates is high in the model

but less than that in the data.

       Note that without substantial price-stickiness, neither consumption nor real exchange

rates would have much persistence. To see this, consider Figure 4 in which we graph the

autocorrelation of consumption, the autocorrelations of real and nominal exchange rates,

and the volatility of the price ratio relative to that of output against the number of periods

that prices are held fixed, N. Notice that the autocorrelations of consumption and the real

exchange rate match almost exactly. When N = 1, consumption is negatively autocorrelated,

as is the real exchange rate. As N increases, so do the autocorrelations of consumption and

the real exchange rate. Notice also that as the periods of price-stickiness are increased, the

price ratio responds less to monetary shocks; its volatility declines, and the behavior of the

real exchange rate comes to mirror that of the nominal exchange rate.

       Consider now the rest of the statistics for the benchmark economy in Tables 5 and

6. In Table 5, we see that the price ratio is substantially more volatile in the model (3.15)

than in the data (.74) while real and nominal exchange rates are a little less correlated in

the model (.79) than in the data (.99). Both of these occur because prices move to oﬀset

nominal exchange rate movements more in the model than in the data. We also see that real


                                                           20
exchange rates and output are more correlated in the model than in the data (.51 vs. .10),

while real exchange rates and net exports are only slightly correlated both in the model and

in the data (both .09). It is worth noting that, across countries, there is greater heterogeneity

in the correlations between real exchange rates and various aggregates, like output and net

exports, than for other statistics, like the volatility and persistence of real exchange rates or

the cross-correlation of real and nominal exchange rates.

       In Table 6, we see that investment is only about half as volatile in the model as

in the data (1.71 vs. 3.28), while employment is nearly twice as volatile in the model as

in the data (1.50 vs. .72). Investment is less volatile in the model because when we use

the high curvature parameter of σ = 6, we need to use a relatively high adjustment cost

parameter to make consumption have the right volatility, and with that level of adjustment

costs, investment is not very volatile.

       Employment is more rather than less volatile than output in the model because almost

all of the movement in output comes from variations in the labor input. Specifically, note

that log-deviations in output can be written as ŷ = αk̂ + (1 − α)ˆl. Since investment is only

a small percentage of the capital stock, this stock moves only a small amount at business

cycle frequencies, and we roughly have that std(ŷ) ∼
                                                    = (1 − α)std(ˆl). With α = 1/3, this gives

std(ˆl)/std(ŷ) ∼
                = 1.5. So, in a sticky price model like ours, we should expect employment to

be much more volatile than output. This feature does not arise in real business cycle models

because in them the technology shock accounts for much of the movement in output.5 (A re-

lated feature of sticky price models more generally is that labor productivity is countercyclical

in the model but procyclical in the data.)

       In Table 6, we also see that in the model, the cross-country correlation of output

is similar to that of consumption (.48 vs. .49) while in the data, the cross-correlation of

output is much higher than that of consumption (.52 vs. .27). While the cross-correlation

of consumption is higher in our model than that in the data, the model does much better


                                               21
on this dimension than does the standard real business cycle model (see Backus, Kehoe and

Kydland (1994)). In the real business cycle model the law of one price holds for all traded

goods and the real exchange rate does not vary as much as it does in our model. Since an

equation like (14) holds in both models, the lower variability of real exchange rates in the real

business cycle model leads to a higher correlation of the marginal utilities of consumption and,

thus, to a higher cross country correlation of consumption. A minor discrepancy between the

benchmark model and the data is that in the data, net exports are somewhat countercyclical

(−.37) while in the model they are essentially acyclical (.14 with a standard error of .17).


                              5. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS


Here we examine the findings of our benchmark model by varying assumptions about three

of the model’s features: the export share, the specification of shocks, and the monetary rule.

The sensitivity analysis determines that the initial findings are fairly robust.


A. Export share

We have chosen parameters so that the export share of output is 1.6 percent, which is similar

to the share that the United States has in its bilateral trade with Europe. More open

economies have much larger shares than this. To see what diﬀerence a larger share might

make, we consider a variation of the model with an export share of 15 percent (by adjusting

a1 and a2 accordingly). To put this number in perspective, note that it is similar to the share

that the United States has with the rest of the world.

       In Tables 5 and 6, the columns labeled “High Exports” list the model’s predictions

with the 15 percent share. The increase clearly has had little eﬀect on most of the statistics.

It decreases the volatility of both nominal and real exchange rates only slightly. It worsens

the performance of net exports by making them more procyclical and by slightly lowering

their correlation with real exchange rates. But, overall, there is little change.



                                               22
B. Real shocks

So far the only shocks in the model are monetary shocks. Now we add real shocks of two

types: shocks to technology and to government consumption. Here we primarily want to

examine whether adding these shocks improves the model’s performance on business cycle

statistics. As noted above, employment is too volatile in our model because variation in labor

input is the primary source of variation in output at business cycle frequencies. Adding other

shocks will add other sources of variation in output.

       We allow for country-specific technology shocks which are common across all inter-

mediate good producers. The technology for producing intermediate goods in the home

country and foreign countries is now F (kt , At lt ) and F (kt∗ , A∗t lt∗ ). Here the technology shocks

At and A∗t are common across all intermediate goods and follow a stochastic process given

by log At+1 = ρA log At + εAt+1 and log A∗t+1 = ρA log At + ε∗At+1 , where the technology in-

novations εA and ε∗A have zero means, are serially uncorrelated, and are uncorrelated with

shocks to money and government consumption. We follow Kehoe and Perri (2000) and use

ρA = .95, var(εA ) = var(ε∗A ) = (.007)2 , and corr(εA , ε∗A ) = .25.

       We add government consumption shocks as follows. The final good is now used for

government consumption as well as private consumption and investment. The resource con-

straint for the home country is now
                        Z   1
       yt = ct + gt +           xt (i) di,
                        0


where home government consumption gt follows a stochastic process log gt+1 = (1 − ρg )µg +

ρg log gt + εgt+1 . To obtain estimates for this autoregressive process, we ran a regression with

data on real government purchases for the United States over the period 1947:1 through

1998:4. Our estimates from this regression are as follows: µg = .13, ρg = .97, and var(εg ) =

(.01)2 . We assume that the shock εg is serially uncorrelated and uncorrelated with shocks to

money and technology and to the shock to government consumption in the foreign country.


                                                  23
We model government consumption in the foreign country symmetrically. In each period,

first the technology and government consumption shocks are realized, then prices are set,

and then the monetary shock is realized. (Alternative timing assumptions lead to similar

results.)

       We report the results for this economy in the columns labeled “Real Shocks” in Tables

5 and 6. Again, most of the statistics change little. However, the relative volatility of

employment actually increases slightly (from 1.50 in the benchmark model to 1.58 in the

model with real shocks). To understand this finding note that here the log-deviations in

output are approximately given by ŷ ∼
                                     = (1 − α)(Â + ˆl) so that

       var ˆl ∼     1      var Â 2cov(Â, ˆl)
              =          −        −            .
       var ŷ   (1 − α)2   var ŷ   var ŷ

From this expression we see that introducing technology shocks can increase the variability

of employment if technology shocks and employment are suﬃciently negatively correlated. In

the model, on impact a positive technology shock leads to a fall in employment since firms can

meet the same demand with fewer workers. This feature of the model makes technology shocks

and employment negatively correlated enough to raise the relative volatility of employment.

Government consumption shocks, meanwhile, have a quantitatively insignificant role.


C. Taylor rule

There is a lively debate over the most appropriate way to model monetary policy. A recently

popular way to do so has been with an interest rate rule. Here we discuss how our money

growth rule can be interpreted as an interest rate rule, and we describe the properties of our

model economy under a particular interest rate rule popularized by Taylor (1993).

       Logically, any interest rate rule can be interpreted as a money growth rule and vice

versa. To see this, posit an interest rate rule and work out the equilibrium of the economy.

This equilibrium has a corresponding money growth process associated with it. Clearly, if

one views this money growth process as the policy, then the equilibrium for this economy

                                              24
with this money growth is the same as that for an economy with the interest rate rule. Of

course, if there are multiple equilibria under the interest rule, then for each equilibrium,

there is a diﬀerent money growth process that implements it. The converse also holds. (Of

course, such rules can be represented as either a function of both past endogenous variables

and exogenous shocks or as a function of solely the history of exogenous shocks.) Moreover,

there is empirical evidence in support of our choice for the money growth rule. In particular,

Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1998) have shown with vector autoregression analysis

that a money growth process of the kind considered here is a good approximation to a process

that implements their estimated interest rate rule.

       As a practical matter, however, some simple interest rate rule might be a better

approximation to the policy in the data than is our simple money growth rule. Thus, we

consider the implications of replacing our simple rule for money growth rates with an interest

rate rule similar to those studied by Taylor (1993) and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1998).

       In particular, we assume that nominal interest rates rt are set as a function of lagged

nominal rates, lagged inflation rates, and lagged output according to

       rt = ρr rt−1 + (1 − ρr )(απ π t−1 + αy ln gdpt−1 ) + εrt ,                          (19)

where we have dropped the constant and where π t−1 is the inflation rate from t − 1 to t,

gdpt−1 is real gross domestic product at t − 1, and εrt is a normally distributed, mean-zero

shock. We set ρr = .66, απ = 1.8, and αy = .03. (The numbers are similar to those estimated

by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1998) for a slightly diﬀerent specification.) We choose the

volatility of the shocks to match the volatility of output, and we choose the correlation of the

home shock εrt and the foreign shock to match the cross-correlation of output.

       When we use this Taylor rule in our benchmark model, we are unable to generate

reasonable business cycle behavior. Briefly, for low values of the adjustment cost parameter

the relative volatility of consumption is tiny. For high values of the adjustment cost parameter


                                                  25
the relative volatility of consumption increases but the correlation between consumption and

output is negative. On closer investigation, we found that these features of the model were

driven by the nonseparability of consumption and money balances. Since we do not view this

nonseparability as a crucial feature of our model, we investigate a version with the Taylor

rule and with preferences of the form

       c1−σ    (M/P )1−σ
            +ω           + ψ(1 − l)(1−γ) /(1 − γ).
       1−σ       1−σ

We set the parameters σ, ψ and γ as before. (The parameter ω is not relevant since money

demand is determined residually.) In Tables 5 and 6, we report the results for this exercise

in the columns labeled “Taylor Rule.” This model moves the volatilities of the price ratio

and the exchange rates closer to those in the data. Unfortunately, however, the model’s

nominal and real exchange rates are much less persistent than those in either the data or the

benchmark model.

       Nominal exchange rates are less persistent in the Taylor rule model than in the bench-

mark model because the endogenous policy reaction tends to oﬀset the exogenous shocks. For

example, a negative shock to interest rates in (19) raises the quantity of money and leads in

subsequent periods to a rise in inflation. This rise in inflation leads to an endogenous increase

in interest rates that oﬀsets the initial shock. As a result, interest rates are not very persis-

tent and, hence, neither are movements in consumption or real exchange rates. We confirmed

this intuition by analyzing the properties of the model for higher values of ρr . For example,

when we raised ρr from .66 to .95, the autocorrelations of nominal and real exchange rates

increased from .38 and .40 to .62 and .59, while for ρr = .99, these autocorrelations increased

even further, to .67 and .62.

                           6. INCREASING PERSISTENCE

The primary discrepancy between the benchmark model and the data is that while the model

generates the exchange rate volatility in the data, it does not generate quite the amount of

                                               26
persistence in the data. Two avenues for increasing persistence seem particularly promising:

making markets incomplete and adding labor frictions by making wages sticky. However,

neither change turns out to lead to a significant improvement in the benchmark model’s

persistence performance.

A. Incomplete markets

Theoretically, with incomplete markets, monetary shocks can lead to wealth redistributions

which lead to persistent changes in relative consumption and, hence, to more persistent real

exchange rates. Furthermore, the real exchange rate could potentially be volatile even with

a much smaller value of the curvature parameter. The idea is that with incomplete markets,

the simple static relationship between the real exchange rate and the ratio of the marginal

utilities given in (14) is replaced by one that holds only in expectation.

       The market incompleteness we introduce into the benchmark model is to replace the

complete set of contingent bonds traded across countries by a single uncontingent nominal

bond. This bond is denominated in units of the home currency. The home consumer’s budget

constraint is now

        P (st )c(st ) + M(st ) + Q̄(st )D(st )
                                                                                                  (20)
                               t     t       t           t−1          t−1          t        t
                     ≤ P (s )w(s )l(s ) + M (s                 ) + D(s      ) + Π(s ) + T (s ),
where D is the consumer’s debt. The real value of these bonds D(st )/P (st ) is bounded below.

Here each unit of D(st ) is a claim on one unit of the home currency in all states st+1 that can

occur at t+1, and Q̄(st ) is the corresponding price. The foreign consumer’s budget constraint

is modified similarly.

       The first-order condition for bond-holding in the home country is now given by
                   X                      Uc (st+1 ) P (st )
       Q̄(st ) =          βπ(st+1 |st )                       ,                                   (21)
                   st+1                    Uc (st ) P (st+1 )
while that in the foreign country is
                   X                      Uc∗ (st+1 ) e(st ) P ∗ (st )
       Q̄(st ) =          βπ(st+1 |st )                                   .                       (22)
                   st+1                    Uc∗ (st ) e(st+1 ) P ∗ (st+1 )

                                                               27
Equating (21) and (22) and log-linearizing the resulting equations gives
          h                             i       h                                    i
                                             ∗
       Et Ûct+1 − Ûct + P̂t − P̂t+1 = Et Ûct+1 − Ûct∗ + êt + P̂t∗ − êt+1 − P̂t+1
                                                                                    ∗
                                                                                       ,     (23)

where carets denote log-deviations from a steady state with D = 0. Noting that q̂t = êt +

P̂t∗ − P̂t , we can rewrite (23) as
                             h                                   i
                                 ∗
       Et [q̂t+1 − q̂t ] = Et (Ûct+1 − Ûct+1 ) − (Ûct∗ − Ûct ) .                         (24)

Thus, with incomplete markets, the relation between real exchange rates and marginal utilities

only holds in expected first-diﬀerences.

       In Tables 5 and 6, we report statistics for an incomplete market economy which has the

same parameters as does the benchmark economy, but has the asset structure just discussed.

In the columns labeled “Incomplete Markets,” the statistics in both tables are virtually

identical to those for the benchmark economy with complete markets. Thus, while adding in-

complete markets theoretically could help with both volatility and persistence, quantitatively

it does not.

       The intuition behind this result is that the wealth eﬀects in our model are extremely

small. To see why, consider starting in a steady state in which net claims on foreigners are

zero. For the home country to increase its wealth, it must increase its net exports. The home

country’s net exports are

                 ∗ ∗
       NXt = et PHt yHt − PF t yF t ,                                                        (25)

       ∗
where yHt are the exports of home-produced goods and yF t are the imports of foreign-produced

goods. With sticky prices, a positive monetary shock in the home country leads to a depreci-

ation of the exchange rate et , a rise in domestic use of all intermediate goods, including yF t ,
                                                                           ∗
and essentially no change in foreign use of intermediate goods, including yHt . Since the prices

foreigners pay for home exports are fixed in the foreign currency, the depreciation of the home

currency leads to a rise in export earnings. This rise helps pay for the rise in imports that

                                                      28
comes from increased home demand for foreign goods. Indeed, for a version of our model,

the rise in export earnings turns out to exactly pay for the rise in imports, so that monetary

shocks lead to no wealth redistribution at all.

       Let’s work through the details of such a model. Consider a deterministic version of

the benchmark model without capital, with a utility function of the form

       U (c, l, M/P ) = log c + γ log(1 − l) + φ log M/P

and with prices set for one period (N = 1). Suppose that, starting from a steady state

with zero debt, the home country experiences a onetime unanticipated monetary shock of

1 percent in period 1, and the money supply is constant thereafter. We show that such a

shock leads to the following outcomes. In period 1, net exports are zero, home use of both

home and foreign intermediate goods rises 1 percent, foreign use of intermediate goods is

unaﬀected, and nominal and real exchange rates depreciate 1 percent. In period 2, then, the

economy returns to a new steady state with the same real allocations as in the old steady

state. The domestic price level rises 1 percent, and the nominal exchange rate stays at its

depreciated level, while the real exchange rate returns to its old steady-state level. In order

for these outcomes to constitute an equilibrium, debt at the end of period 1 must be zero or,

equivalently, net exports in period 1 must be zero.

       We prove this claim by showing that our conjectured outcome satisfies the equilibrium

conditions. Note first that if net exports in period 1 are zero, then the economy in the

beginning of period 2 is identical in all respects to that in the beginning of period 1 except

that the money stock is 1 percent higher. Clearly, there is an equilibrium in which all real

variables from period 2 on are identical to those in the original steady state and domestic

prices and the exchange rate rise 1 percent. To see that net exports in period 1 are indeed

zero, consider the three key equilibrium conditions in period 1: the money demand equation,

       M1     φc1
          =        ;                                                                      (26)
       P1   1 − Q1

                                              29
the bond price equation,
                P1 c1
       Q1 = β         ;                                                                  (27)
                P2 c2
and the interest parity equation,

       Q1 = Q∗1 e1 /e2                                                                   (28)

(which must hold from period 1 on).

       We claim that there is an equilibrium in which, in period 1, domestic consumption

rises 1 percent, domestic and foreign bond prices are unchanged, and the nominal exchange

rate rises 1 percent. From the money demand equation (26), we can see that if the bond price

Q1 is unchanged and the money supply M1 rises 1 percent, then consumption c1 must rise 1

percent, since the price P1 is preset. Since c1 and P2 both rise 1 percent and P1 and c2 are

unchanged, we know from (27) that Q1 is also unchanged. Using the analogous equilibrium

conditions for the foreign country, we know that Q∗1 is unchanged. From (28), we then see

that since e2 rises 1 percent, e1 does too. Since intermediate goods prices are preset, a one

percent rise in home consumption of the final good leads to a one percent rise in the home use

of both home and foreign intermediate goods. A contradiction argument can be used to show

that this outcome is the unique equilibrium. (See Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (1998).)

B. Labor market frictions

So far we have considered frictions in goods markets and asset markets and have let labor

markets function perfectly. But we want to try to increase persistence in our benchmark

model, and adding labor market frictions in the form of sticky wages might do that. In

the benchmark model, after a monetary shock, wages immediately rise. This rise in wages

leads intermediate good producers to increase their prices as soon as they can. Thus, the

benchmark model generates little endogenous price-stickiness, that is, price-stickiness beyond

that exogenously imposed. Preset nominal wages might generate some endogenous price-

stickiness and, hence, more persistence in exchange rates.

                                             30
       We extend the benchmark model to include sticky wages by letting labor be diﬀeren-

tiated and having monopolistically competitive unions that set wages in a staggered way for

M periods.

       The final good producers in the model remain as before, while the problems of the

intermediate good producers and the consumers are altered. The only change in technology is

that the labor input l(i, st ) of intermediate good producer i is now a composite of a continuum

of diﬀerentiated labor inputs j ∈ [0, 1] and is produced according to
                       ·Z                     ¸1/ϑ
               t                       t ϑ
       l(i, s ) =           l(i, j, s ) dj              ,                                                       (29)

where l(i, j, st ) denotes the amount of diﬀerentiated labor input j used by intermediate good

producer i in date t. The nominal wage for the jth type of labor in date t is denoted

W (j, st−1 ). The problem of the intermediate good producer is the same as before except that

now we have a sub-problem of determining the cost-minimizing composition of the diﬀerent

types of labor. The term w(st )l(i, st ) in the intermediate good producer’s problem (7) is now

replaced by
                                                      Z
           t           t                                    W (j, st−1 )
       w(s )l(i, s ) =                min                          t
                                                                         l(i, j, st ) dj                        (30)

subject to (29). The solution to this problem is the demand for labor of type j by intermediate

good producer i, namely
                           Ã                  !    1

                   t            W̄ (st )          1−ϑ
       l(i, j, s ) =                                      l(i, st ),
                               W (j, st−1 )

where W̄ (st ) =            W (j, st−1 ) ϑ−1 dj                   is the nominal wage index. Substitution of the de-

mand into (30) implies that the real wage index is given by w(st ) = W̄ (st )/P (st ).

       The consumer side of the labor market can be thought of as being organized into a

continuum of unions indexed by j. Each union consists of all the consumers in the economy

with labor of type j. Each union realizes that it faces a downward-sloping demand for its



                                                                       31
type of labor. The total demand for labor of type j is obtained by integrating across the

demand of the intermediate good producers and is given by
                           Ã                  !    1
                                                        Z

                               W (j, st−1 )

        We assume that a fraction 1/M of unions set their wages in a given period and hold

them fixed for M subsequent periods. The unions are indexed so that those with j ∈ [0, 1/M ]

set new wages in 0, M , 2M , and so on, while those with j ∈ [1/M, 2/M ] set new wages in 1,

M +1, 2M +1, and so on, for the M cohorts of unions. In each period these new wages are set

before the realization of the current money shocks. Notice that the wage-setting arrangement

is analogous to the price-setting arrangement for intermediate good producers.

        The problem of the jth union, for say j ∈ [0, 1/M ], is to maximize

initial debt of the unions so that each union has the same present discounted value of income.

        In this problem, the union chooses the wage and agrees to supply whatever is demanded

at that wage. The first-order conditions are changed from those in the benchmark economy

as follows. The condition for the labor choice (10) is replaced by the condition for nominal

wages

Notice that in a steady state, this condition reduces to W/P = (1/ϑ)(−Ul /Uc ), so that

real wages are set as a markup over the marginal rate of substitution between labor and

                                                                       32
consumption. The conditions (11) and (12) are now indexed by j. These conditions, together

with our assumption on initial debt, imply that Uc (j, st ) and Um (j, st ) are equated across

unions.

       The new parameters in the model are the number of periods of wage-setting M and the

markup parameter ϑ. Following Taylor’s (1999) discussion of the evidence, we set M = 4.

We set ϑ = .87 so that the markup is about 15 percent. This markup is consistent with

estimates of the markup of union wages over non-union wages. (See Lewis 1986.)

       In Tables 5 and 6, in the columns labeled “Sticky Wages,” we see that the sticky

wage model slightly improves on the benchmark model. The sticky wage model decreases the

volatility of the price ratio (from 3.15 to 2.56) and increases the volatility of real exchange

rates (from 4.88 to 5.04). (With these changes, the volatility in the data can be matched

with a slightly lower value of the curvature parameter σ, if so desired.) The sticky wage

model also slightly increases the persistence of real exchange rates (from .63 to .68) and the

cross-correlation of real and nominal exchange rates (from .79 to .87). The business cycle

statistics remain basically unchanged, except for the correlation of real exchange rates with

both GDP and net exports, which worsen.


                         7. PREFERENCE SPECIFICATION


One problem arises with the benchmark model when productivity grows in the market sector

but not in the nonmarket sector: preferences of the form (15) are inconsistent with balanced

growth. Here we discuss this problem as well as two potential solutions to it.

       To derive our benchmark model’s implications for growth paths, we suppress uncer-

tainty and add labor-augmenting technical change zt , so that the technology for each interme-

diate good producer is given by F (kt , zt lt ), where zt grows at a constant rate z. We say that

an economy is on a balanced growth path if output, consumption, real balances, the capital

stock, and wages all grow at rate z, while labor and interest rates are constant. Inspecting


                                               33
consumers’ first-order conditions in the benchmark model, (10)—(12), we see that for the

economy to have a balanced growth path, three homotheticity conditions must be satisfied:

Ult /Uct must be homogeneous of degree one in ct and mt when lt is held fixed; Umt /Uct must

be homogeneous of degree zero in ct and mt when lt is held fixed; and Uct+1 /Uct must be

homogeneous of degree zero in ct and mt , with ct+1 = (1 + z)ct and mt+1 = (1 + z)mt , when

lt is held fixed.

       The preferences in our benchmark model violate the first condition, that Ult /Uct must

be homogeneous of degree one (except when σ = 1). Thus, in the benchmark economy, a

balanced growth path does not exist. To get some feel for how far the economy is from a

balanced growth path, suppose that consumption, real balances, and wages grow 2 percent

a year. Then, with our benchmark parameter values, we easily see that leisure grows 7.5

percent per year. If leisure is initially three-quarters of the time endowment, then within four

years, leisure uses up the entire time endowment and labor supply is zero.

       This violation may initially seem troublesome because the economy becomes unbal-

anced even at business cycle frequencies. We may be able to mitigate the eﬀect, however,

once we understand where the violation comes from.


A. Technical progress in nonmarket activities

The feature of the benchmark model that leads to this violation is that technical progress

raises the productivity of time allocated to market activities but not that of time allocated to

nonmarket activities. In the spirit of Becker (1993), suppose that technical progress does raise

the productivity of time allocated to nonmarket activities, so that an input of (1 − lt ) units

of time outside the market produces zt (1 − lt ) units of leisure services. With this formulation,

we can easily show that

           Ult                 ψ(1 + z)(1−γ)t (1 − lt )−γ
       −       =           ·                             ¸ η−1

                                                                       .
           Uct        −1
                      η

                                                   η−1

If ct and mt grow at the same rate as zt and if lt is a constant, then

           Ult    (1 + z)(1−γ)t
       −       =κ               ,
           Uct     (1 + z)−σt

where κ is a constant. Along a balanced growth path, wages grow at the same rate as zt , so

that in order for the economy to have a balanced growth path, it must have σ = γ.

       The parameter γ, together with the fraction of time allocated to the market, determines

the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. If the fraction of time allocated to the market is one-

quarter, then this labor supply elasticity is 3/γ. The balanced growth restriction σ = γ

thus connects the labor supply elasticity to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in

consumption.

       In our earlier experiments, when we varied σ, we left γ unchanged. We have also done

experiments in which as we vary σ, we change γ, so that the balanced growth restriction

holds. We found that imposing this balanced growth restriction makes little diﬀerence to our

results. Note that with σ = γ = 6, the implied labor supply elasticity is 1/2, which is within

the wide range of estimates of the labor supply elasticity.


B. Nonseparable preferences

Thus, one way of dealing with the issue of unbalanced growth is to add technical progress

in nonmarket activities. Another way, of course, is to use preferences that lead to balanced

growth with technical progress only in the market sector. Such preferences, however, do not

generate volatile real exchange rates.

       A typical specification of such preferences is
                         "µ                                    ¶    η               #1−σ
                                 η−1                     η−1       η−1
                                                                                ξ
       U(c, l, M/P ) =      ωc    η    + (1 − ω)(M/P )    η              (1 − l)           /(1 − σ).

It is easy to verify that these preferences satisfy the three homotheticity conditions for bal-

anced growth. We set the parameters η, σ, and ω as in the benchmark model. We set

ξ = 2.25, as is typical in the business cycle literature (for example, Chari, Christiano, and


                                                   35
Kehoe (1991)), and we display the resulting statistics in the columns labeled “Nonseparable

Preferences” in Tables 5 and 6. Unfortunately, these preferences do not generate volatile

exchange rates: real exchange rates now vary hardly at all.

       We can get some intuition for why these preferences do not generate more volatility

by examining the expression for log-linearized real exchange rates (18). With nonseparable

preferences, the coeﬃcients are A = 5.94, B = .06, and D = −3.78. Thus, an increase in the

money growth rate in the home country increases both consumption and employment in that

country. The increase in consumption decreases the marginal utility of home consumption

and, hence, leads to a depreciation in the real exchange rate. With nonseparable labor and

the curvature parameter σ > 1, the increase in employment decreases the marginal utility of

home consumption and partially oﬀsets the real exchange rate depreciation. This oﬀsetting

eﬀect of employment increases with σ; hence, increasing the curvature σ does not substantially

increase the volatility of real exchange rates.


                                     8. CONCLUSION


The central puzzle in international business cycles is the large and persistent fluctuations in

real exchange rates. In this paper, we have taken a step toward solving that puzzle. We

have developed a general equilibrium sticky price model which can generate fluctuations in

real exchange rates that are appropriately volatile and quite persistent, though not quite

persistent enough. We have found that for monetary shocks to generate these data, the

model needs to have separable preferences, high risk aversion, and price-stickiness of at least

one year. We have also found that if monetary shocks are correlated across countries, then

the comovements in aggregates across countries in the model are broadly consistent with

those in the data.

       The main failing of our model is that it does not generate enough persistence in real

exchange rates. As we have seen, this is primarily because the model does not generate enough


                                                  36
persistence in consumption. One avenue to generate more persistence in consumption is to

include habit persistence or consumption durability in preferences. Unfortunately, this avenue

typically leads to less volatile consumption and, hence, less volatile exchange rates. We need

to find ways to increase the persistence of consumption without decreasing its volatility.

       We have seen that without substantial price-stickiness, real exchange rates are not

persistent. We have assumed that prices are exogenously fixed for one year. While this

assumption generates movements in prices that are consistent with the evidence in Taylor

(1999, it is somewhat unappealing to simply assume that firms cannot change their prices

for a year. A major challenge in this line of research is to find a mechanism that generates

substantial amounts of endogenous price-stickiness from small frictions. By this, we mean a

mechanism that leads firms to optimally choose not to change prices much even when they

can freely do so. To be successful, such a mechanism must be consistent with microeconomic

data on firms’ pricing decisions and must generate business cycles of the kind seen in the

data. One avenue worth exploring is to depart from the simple monopolistic competition

setup and allow for richer strategic interactions among firms.

       Minor failings of the model are that it produces too much volatility in relative price

levels and employment and too little in investment. Modifications to strategic interactions

among firms may reduce the volatility of relative price levels. In terms of employment, the

labor input may be mismeasured due to considerations like labor-hoarding, so that measured

employment fluctuates much less than the true labor input. In terms of investment, recall

that we chose the adjustment cost parameter to match the relative volatility of consumption.

Adding other sources of variation in consumption might let us simultaneously match the

volatilities of consumption and investment in the data.

          In particular, our constructed index is et =   i∈I   ω i eit /ei0 , where eit is the exchange
rate for country i in period t, ei0 is the exchange rate for country i in the first quarter of
1972, and the weight ω i is the time series average of the ratio of the dollar value of exports
plus imports between country i and the United States to the total dollar value of all exports
plus imports between the European countries included in set I and the United States. The
countries (trade weights) included in our dataset are: Austria (1.0), Belgium (7.5), Denmark
(1.7), Finland (1.0), France (12.4), West Germany (23.3), Italy (10.6), Netherlands (9.7),
Norway (2.0), Spain (4.7), Switzerland (5.1), and the United Kingdom (20.9).
      2
          Our real exchange rate measure is substantially more volatile than another measure
of the real exchange rate between the United States and the rest of the world. The IMF’s
International Financial Statistics reports that the eﬀective real exchange rate for the United
States, based on weights derived from the multilateral exchange rate model (MERM), has
a standard deviation of 5.43. The autocorrelation of this MERM exchange rate is .85. The
MERM measure is less volatile presumably because shocks aﬀecting bilateral exchange rates
are not perfectly correlated across countries, and the MERM measure averages across more
countries than our measure does.
      3
          Our series for the foreign country are aggregates for the nine European countries in
Table 1. For each country, we obtain output, consumption, and investment in 1990 local
currency units. We convert these series into dollars using the OECD’s 1990 purchasing power
parity exchange rate and add the results to obtain our aggregates for Europe. Exports and
imports are reported in U.S. dollars. Since employment data for Austria are not available,
employment for Europe is the sum of the employment in the eight remaining countries.
      4
          If we keep the adjustment cost parameter unchanged, then as we increase σ, the relative
volatility of consumption and output decreases somewhat. Hence, the volatility of the real
exchange rate increases with σ, but at a somewhat slower rate. For example, with b held
fixed, the volatility of the real exchange rate at σ = 1.01 and 10 is 1.20 and 6.58, while when
b is adjusted, these volatilities are .82 and 8.42.
      5
          One extension that might help sticky price models in this dimension is to have cyclical
variations in the intensity that measured capital and labor are worked.

  NOTE: The statistics are based on logged and H-P filtered data. For each economy the standard deviation of monetary shocks are chosen so that the standard
  deviation of GDP is the same as in the data, namely, 1.76 percent. Numbers in parentheses are standard deviations of the statistic across 100 simulations.
  a See Table 4 for specifications of the variations of the benchmark economy.

  b Except for the standard deviations relative to GDP, the statistics in the data column are taken directly from Table 1. The standard deviations relative to
  GDP are the standard deviations in Table 1 divided by the standard deviation of U.S. GDP, which is 1.76 percent.
  c The standard deviations of the variables are divided by the standard deviation of GDP.

  NOTE: Notes a and c of Table 5 also apply here. With the exception of net exports, the standard deviation of each variable is divided by the standard deviation
  of output. Throughout the table we measure net exports as the H-P-filtered ratio of real net exports to real gross domestic product. Thus, the standard deviation
  of net exports is simply the standard deviation of this ratio.
  a With the exception of net exports, the standard deviations and autocorrelations in the data column are based on logged and H-P-filtered U.S. quarterly data
  for the period 1972:1—1994:4. The cross-correlations between domestic and foreign variables are based on the U.S. and an aggregate of Europe.
