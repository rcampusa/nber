The US as the "Demander of Last Resort" and its Implications on China's Current Account

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the degree to which current account patterns are explained by the variables suggested
by the literature, and reflects on possible future patterns. We start with panel regressions explaining
the current account of 69 countries during 1981-2006. We identify an asymmetric effect of the US
as the "demander of last resort:" a 1% increase in the lagged US current account deficit is associated
with 0.5% increase of current account surpluses of countries running surpluses, but with insignificant
changes of current account deficits of countries running deficits. Overall, the panel regressions account
for not more than 2/3 of the variation. We apply the regression results to assess China’s current account
over the next six years, projecting a large drop in its account/GDP surpluses.

1.        Introduction
          The literature dealing with global imbalances focused attention on the enigma of the
“poor” financing the “rich,” as exemplified by the patterns of China’s and US current account
balances during the 1990s and the early 2000s.1 The onset of the subprime crisis, its
deflationary impact on the US, and the resultant recessionary pressure facing other countries
suggests the unsustainability of the previous patterns.2 We evaluate this conjecture in panel
regressions that accounts for the US role as a “demander of last resort,” controlling for other
variables suggested by the literature. As China would be a key player in the adjustment of
global imbalances, we also assess the degree to which Chinese current account patterns are
accounted for by our panel regressions, and project possible future Chinese current account
paths.
          The variables suggested by the literature include economic performance [like
GDP/Capita growth and levels, etc.], economic structure and openness [trade openness and
composition of exports, financial openness and external wealth, etc.], demographic [age
dependence], exchange rate regimes and liquidity, sudden stops history, and others [see the
World Economic Outlook, WEO (2008) for further discussion and detailed references]. As
the US played the pivotal role as the “demander of last resort” during recent decades, it makes
sense to add lagged US current account deficits to the list of variables explaining current
account patterns of other countries.3 We identify a large but asymmetric effect of the US role
as the demander of last resort: a 1% increase in the lagged US current account deficit is
associated with 0.5% increase of current account surpluses of countries running surpluses, but
with insignificant changes of current account deficits of countries running deficits. We

    Aizenman and Yi (2008) report that during recent years the US current account deficits
accented well above half of the global current account deficits.

control for all these variables in panel regressions of 69 countries during 1981-2006. Overall,
not more than 2/3 of the variation is accounted for by regressions that include fixed effects,
and China’s fixed effect coefficient is insignificant. Ranked by their economic impact on
China’s current accounts (% of GDP), the most important variable is the lagged US current
account deficit, followed by its own GDP growth, trade openness, bank credits/GDP, age
dependency, net foreign assets/GDP, financial openness, and commodity exports/GDP.
          We apply the regression analysis to project the future patterns of China’s current
account under two extreme scenarios. The first case is where all the conditioning variables
would be impacted by one standard deviation shocks during the next six years in ways that
would increase China’s current account surplus; as would be if a global and domestic boom
were to take place. The second scenario is the opposite –all the conditioning variables would
be impacted by one standard deviation shocks in ways that would decrease China’s current
account surplus; as would be the case if a global and domestic recession were to take place.
These two scenarios provide us with a band of plausible future paths. We compare the
resultant band with the latest WEO’s forecast of Chinese future current account, inferring that
the WEO’s projections may be overly optimistic, forecasting the continuation of high current
account surpluses. We conclude with a discussion of these results.


2.        Data and Estimation
          Our data on current account balances and macroeconomic factors cover 1981-2006.
Most of the data (details documented in Appendix A) are taken from the World Development
Indicators, the International Investment Positions, the External Wealth of Nations, and the
World Economic Outlook, supplemented with Chinn and Ito (2006)’s capital account
openness index, Shambaugh (2004)’s pegged exchange rate indicators, and our own
calculated deviation from PPP implied by the penn effects [see also Aizenman (2008)] and
sudden-stop indicators.4 The net foreign asset data are available for a limited number of

    For the literature supporting the effects of these macroeconomic factors on the current
accounts, see Cavallo and Frankel (forthcoming) for sudden-stop indicators; Helliwell (2004),
Higgins (1998), De-Santis and Lührmann (2006), and Taylor (2002) for the effect of aging on
current accounts; Chamon and Prasad (2007) for the impact of age dependency and saving of


                                                 2
countries. In addition, we include countries with at least ten annual observations to allow for
subsequent division of the whole sample into sub-periods. After pooling all the relevant
variables, we have 69 countries (of which 21 are OECD, tabulated in Appendix B).
          Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the constructed sample for our estimation.
Following the literature, we use these standard macroeconomic factors to estimate


                    CABit = X it′ −1β + C i − φCABUSA,t −1 + εit ;C i ≡ {c1,..., c69 }             (1)


where CABit is the current account balances of country (as % GDP) i at time t, and Xit-1 is a
vector of macroeconomic factors, and C i ≡ {c1,..., c63 } is a vector of country fixed effects.

We include the US current account deficits (as % GDP) variable since the US acted frequently
as the demander of the ‘last resort.’ Another frequently cited notion is that due to the growing
size of China, the size of the US current account deficits may impact Chinese ability to run
surpluses [see also Aizenman and Sun (2008)].


2.1       Baseline results and alternative specifications
          Table 2 presents our baseline results. The estimation explains about 54 to 66 percent
of the current account variation from 1981-2006. The variables appearing robust across the
specifications can be categorized as those affecting current account surpluses in the following
ways:
          •       Positively -- net foreign assets to GDP,5 sudden stops of capital inflows, US
                  current account deficits, trade to GDP.
          •       Negatively -- growth of GDP, age dependency, commodity exports to GDP,
                  bank credits to GDP, capital account openness.



households in China; and Chinn and Prasad (2003), Chinn and Ito (2007), Aguiar and
Gopinath (2007), and Gruber and Kamin (2007) for standard determinants of the current
accounts.
5
    The net foreign asset position at time t is the initial position plus the cumulative current
account and cumulative net capital gains on cross-border positions.


                                                    3
        The last two columns of Table 2 show that the impacts of these macroeconomic
factors differ between countries running current account deficits (specification [4a]) and
countries running surpluses (specification [4b]). Essentially, the effects of the US current
account deficits are important only to the countries running surpluses. In addition, the impact
of net foreign assets, age dependency, commodity exports, bank credits are statistically
significant only in the deficit countries.
        We also experimented with other specifications, with and without country fixed
effects and excluding lagged US current account deficits. The estimates reported in Table 3
confirm the effects and signs of the standard macroeconomic determinants of our baseline
specification. Overall, the estimates are stable across country groups and sample periods, as
presented in Table 4. The negative impact of age dependency is larger in the OECD during
1981-1994, but has become more important on the developing countries for 1995-2006. The
negative effects of bank credits are larger in the OECD, whereas the negative effect of capital
account openness is more significant in the developing countries and during 1995-2006. The
positive effects of net foreign assets are larger in the developing countries and during 1995-
2006. The effects of sudden stops are more significant in the developing countries, and
during 1995-2006. The positive effect of trade openness is larger for OECD countries. The
positive effects of US current account deficits are larger on developing countries and during
1981-1994.


2.2     China’s current account surpluses
        We now focus on China. Figures 1-a and 1-b plot Chinese predicted current account
balances based on our preferred specification [4] in Table 2 and alternative specifications in
Table 3, respectively. The actual values are mostly larger than predicted by our estimation
without the country fix effects (though the fit improves by adding country fixed effects),
suggesting that for one or several of the conditioning variables, a significant part of China’s
current accounts remains unexplained throughout most of the period. This also implies
potentially the need to have non-linear effects, or that there is a unique, time persistent,
Chinese effect, not captured by the conditioning variables. To answer this question, we
proceed in two steps.




                                                 4
       First, we plot in Figure 2 the country fixed effects from the baseline specification [4]
in Table 2. Though China’s country fixed effect is positive, it is small and statistically
insignificant. During 1981-2006, industrial countries including Switzerland, Japan, and
Norway registered significantly large average country fixed effects. Developing countries
with positive and larger country fixed effects than China include Egypt, Chile, Venezuela,
Syria, Bolivia, and India.
       Second, we examine the relative importance of the various conditioning variables in
accounting the current account variation. Figure 3 presents the effects of +1s.d change of
macroeconomic factors. Based on the coefficient estimates from specification [4] in Table 2,
the effects are calculated by multiplying the regression coefficient by the one standard
deviation of the variable for each country group. For instance, the coefficient estimate of
NFA/GDP is 0.024; one standard deviation of NFA/GDP for Developing countries excluding
China is 63.929; the economic significance of +1 s.d. change of NFA/GDP on the current
account surpluses of Developing countries excluding China is 0.024x63.929=1.534. For each
of the macroeconomic factors, we can see in Figure 3 that their economic impact on the
current accounts of China tend to be smaller than on the current accounts of other developing
countries and the OECD. Interestingly, the size of the US current account deficits has
equivalent impact on the ability to run the current account surpluses of China as well as other
country groups. Ranked by their economic significance (in absolute term) on China’s current
accounts (% of GDP), the most important variable is the US current account deficits (+.68%),
followed by GDP growth (-.67%), trade openness (+.57%), bank credits/GDP (-.27%), age
dependency (-.24%), net foreign assets/GDP (+.20%), financial openness (-.07%), and
commodity exports/GDP (-.06%).


2.3    Possible adjustments
       Figure 4 plots China’s current account balances during 1984-2006, and our projections
of the “good” and “bad” scenarios for the years 2007-2013, supplemented by the IMF’s
World Economic Outlook (October 2008) forecast. Based on the estimation results [4] and
the projection of each macroeconomic factors xi using ARMA(1,2) from the Chinese data
1984 to 2006, the line with marker ‘+’ plots the “good 1 s.d. scenario,” where each of the
conditioning variables gets a 1 s.d. shock that will increase current account surplus [if the



                                                5
impact of a variable xi on the current account balance is +, then the shock to xi is + 1 s.d., if
the impact of xi on the current account balance is negative, then the shock to xi is - 1 s.d.].
The second scenario is the opposite, the “bad 1 s.d scenario,” where each of the conditioning
variables gets a 1 s.d. shock that will reduce current account surplus. In essence, we set t =
2006; in the “good scenario” we assume that during t+ 1, t+2, t+3, ..., t+7, each year 1 s.d.
“good shocks” will materialize. Similarly, in the “bad 1 s.d. scenario” we assume that in each
of the subsequent years, 1 s.d. “bad currant account shocks” will materialize. For the “bad 1
s.d. scenario,” we find that China’s current accounts to GDP will be between 1-2% surpluses.
In contrast, in the “good 1 s.d. scenario,” China’s current account surpluses will fluctuate
around 8-9%, which is about 2% lower that the estimates by IMF’s World Economic Outlook
(October 2008). For both the good and bad scenarios, China’s current account surpluses are
expected to decline over the 2007-13 periods.
          What is the impact of halving the US deficit? The US deficit was about 731 billion
USD in 2007 (about 5.3% of US 2007 GDP). Based on the preferred specification [4b] in
Table 2 using 1981-2006 data, the coefficient estimate of the US current account deficits is .5,
statistically significant at 1 percent level. This implies that halving the present US current
account deficits/GDP will translate into about a (2.65 % x .5) = 1.3% reduction of China’s
current account surpluses.6 Using our estimates, we can evaluate the combined effect of 1%
US current account deficit reduction on the balances of all the countries running current
account surpluses. We apply specification [4b], Table 2, and estimate the aggregate current
account adjustment as a result of ‘a 1% reduction of US current account deficit to GDP.’ The


6
    It turned out that the Dickey-Fuller test cannot reject the null hypothesis that China’s and US
current accounts/GDP contain a unit root over the sample period; both series are I(1). The
residual series from fitting the Chinese series on the US series are not stationary. This may
reflect the low power of the test, suggesting that the relationship between the US and China
current account balances to GDP cannot be explained by a simple cointegration, in isolation
of other conditioning macroeconomic factors. It is also consistent with the conjecture that
CA/GDP ratio follows a unit-root process if its value stays within a certain range, but reverts
to its long-run equilibrium when the CA/GDP ratio exceeds some threshold values [see Ju and
Wei (2007b)].


                                                  6
absolute level of the ‘US deficit drops equivalent to 1% of US GDP’ is about 138 billion
USD. This adjustment would induce a drop of current account surpluses of China by 35
billion USD, developing countries excluding China by 58.7 billion USD, and OECD countries
by 71 billion USD, which sum up to a drop of total global surpluses by about 165 billion
USD.7


3.         Concluding remarks
           Our analysis confirms the importance of lagged US current account deficits in
explaining the current account patterns of other countries. Our projections of the current
account of China in the next six years suggest a range of current account/GDP surplus
bounded between 8-9% on the high end, and 1-2% on the low end. In contrast, the latest
World Economic Outlook (WEO) is in the range of 10-11%, well above our projections.
While we are unable to comment directly on the IMF approach that provided this relative high
projection, the deflationary pressure triggered by the US financial crises suggests that the
WEO’s (October 2008) forecast may be off the mark, possibly because it ignores the global
recession impact of the present crisis, and the pivotal role of the US as the “demander of last
resort.”
           Indeed, one may argue that even in the absence of the recent financial crises, the
anomaly of large countries growing much faster than the global mean, while running large
and growing current account surpluses, leads to instability. This may follow from the global
adding-up property, where the sum of all current accounts is zero (up to statistical
discrepancies). The above anomaly can continue only as long as the deficit countries that
grow, on average, at a much lower rate than China, will accommodate China by the needed
increase in their current account deficit/GDP. The US played this role of “demander of last
resort” during 1990-2005, providing the needed accommodation to Chinese surpluses. The


7
    Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) and Curcuru et al. (2008) note that owing to
mismeasurement of net financial inflows, the US current account deficit could have been
overestimated by as much as 0.6% per year. The mismeasurement in financial flows and
merchandise trade could be even more important to China. A more complete investigation
into this issue is beyond the scope of our study.


                                                  7
recent financial crisis may hasten the unwinding of the current account enigma, initiating
recessionary pressure that induces the unwinding of US current account deficits. This
conjecture is in line with Aizenman and Yi (2008), who report that during 1966-2005,
excluding the US, the length of current account deficit spells is negatively related to the
relative size of the countries’ GDP. While one may argue that the EU would replace the US
as a “demander of last resort,” there are no signs pointing in that direction. EU’s aggregate
current account (as % of GDP) was, on average, close to zero during 1990-2005, possibly
reflecting political economy factors that constrained the EU’s external borrowing. Short of
changing these factors, the case for the emergence of new “demanders of last resort,”
mitigating the drop of China’s current account surpluses, remains dubious. Consequently, one
expects that China’s future current account surpluses may be constrained by the global
adjustment, reducing them well below the 10% benchmark.

Table 2: Baseline Results of Current Account Balances to GDP and Macroeconomic Factors
This table reports the baseline estimation of CABit                = Xit′ −1β + C i − φCABUSA,t −1 + εit ;C i ≡ {c1,..., c69 } ; where CABit is the current account balances
to GDP of country i at time t, Xit is a vector of macroeconomic factors as outlined in the Appendix A, and Ci is a vector of country fixed effects. The regressions
are OLS with country indicators (fixed effects). Constant term and country indicators are not reported. Standard errors are in parentheses. *** (**,*) signifies
statistical significant at 1 (5,10) percent.

Figure 3: Economic Significance of +1 s.d. Change on Current Account Surpluses (% of GDP)
This figure presents the effects of +1s.d change of macroeconomic factors. Based on the coefficient
estimates from specification [4] in table 2, the effects are calculated by multiplying each of the coefficients
by a 1 standard deviation of the variable for each country group. For instance, the coefficient estimate of
NFA/GDP is 0.024; one standard deviation of NFA/GDP for Developing countries excluding China is
63.929; the economic significant of +1 s.d. change of NFA/GDP on the current account surpluses of
Developing countries excluding China is 0.024x63.929=1.534.

Figure 4: Projection of China’s Current Account Balances, 2007 – 2013
This figure plots the actual and projected current account balances (% of GDP) for China for years 2007 to
2013. Based on the baseline results [4] and the projection of each xi from ARMA(1,2) using the actual data
from 1984 to 2006. The line with marker ‘+’ plots a best 1 s.d. scenario, where each of the conditioning
variable gets a 1 s.d. shock that will increase current account surplus [if the impact of a variable xi on the
current account balance is +, then the shock to xi is + 1 s.d., if the impact of xi on the current account
balance is negative, then the shock to xi is -1 s.d.]. The second measure is the opposite, the "worst 1 s.d
scenario," giving the configurations of the xi with the 1 s.d. shocks that will minimize the current account
balance.
