We investigate empirically the extent to which government consumption substitutes for private
consumption in nine East Asia countries. Panel cointegrating regression uncovers a significantly
positive elasticity of substitution between government and private consumption, implying on average
government and private consumption are substitutes in East Asia. Country-by-country analysis,
however, reveals diversity in the substitutability estimates. The four North East countries – China,
Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea – tend to share similar and moderate values of the substitution
elasticity. For the five ASEAN countries studied in this paper, the relationship between private and
government consumption vary substantially, both in the sign and magnitude of the elasticity of
substitution. Private and government consumption in Malaysia and Thailand are strong substitutes,
but they are found to be complements in Indonesia and Singapore. In between is the Philippines
which has a near zero elasticity of substitution.

1. Introduction

       An important issue in the design of fiscal policy is the substitutability between

government and private consumption. If the private sector derives utility from

government–provided goods and services and regards private and government

consumption as close substitutes, an increase in government consumption will be offset

by a corresponding decrease in private consumption, rendering the size of the fiscal

multiplier relatively small and even potentially negative. On the other hand, if private and

government consumption are complements, an expansionary fiscal policy will be

relatively effective in stimulating aggregate demand as private consumption will

reinforce the initial fiscal impulse. While it is easy to give examples of individual private

and government goods that are substitutes or complements, it is an empirical question

whether aggregate private and government consumption are substitutes or complements

for a particular economy during certain period. The purpose of this paper is to empirically

study the substitutability issue for nine East Asian countries – the four northeast countries:

China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea, and the five southeast ASEAN countries:

Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

       Traditional macroeconomic models assume that government consumption works

through its impact on private consumption through wealth effect or interest rate effect.

Private consumption is crowded out either because the consumers may feel poorer as a

result of negative wealth effect or they may be induced to postpone consumption in

response to deficit–financed government spending. Bailey (1971) and Barro (1981) first

suggest incorporating government consumption into the representative agent decision

problem, making the public sector part of the general equilibrium system. The idea is that




                                              1
many government goods are to some extent substitutes for private consumption goods.

Moreover, government purchases may also serve as useful inputs to the private

production function so that government consumption can be productive. This is in

contrast to the traditional models in which government consumption are regarded as

purely wasteful or unrelated to private consumption or production. In recent theoretical

literature, the interaction between government and private consumption has been assigned

a central role in the study of fiscal policy, in both the neoclassical real business cycle

fashion (e.g. Aiyagari et al. (1992) and Baxter and King (1993)) and the new Keynesian

fashion with monopolistic competition, increasing returns, and nominal rigidities (e.g.

Devereux et al. (1996) and Ganelli (2003)). However, depending on their assumptions

about market structure and technology, these models can predict totally different reaction

of private consumption in response to government spending shocks.

       On the empirical front, a large literature has been developed to estimate the

relationship between government and private consumption. Kormendi (1983) and

Aschauer (1985) are representative of the earlier approach that relies on estimating a

consumption function. Karras (1994), Ni (1995), Evans and Karras (1996), and Fiorito

and Kollintzas (2004) are some of the more recent contributions along this approach. Ni’s

paper also provides a useful survey of the literature. The empirical analysis in this paper

follows Amano and Wirjanto (1997, 1998) who make use of the cointegration approach

of Ogaki (1992) and Ogaki and Park (1997) to estimate the preference parameter that

governs the relationship between government and private consumption. The idea is to

exploit the long–run restriction imposed by the intraperiod first–order condition that




                                               2
characterizes the optimal choice of private and government consumption. Ho (2001),

Chiu (2001), and Okubo (2003) are some recent contributions along the same line.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical

model in detail. We provide a structural interpretation to the cointegrating regression

model by deriving it as an equilibrium condition. Section 3 provides a brief description of

government expenditures in East Asia. The data and empirical results are presented in

section 4. Section 5 concludes.



2. The empirical model



        The empirical work in this paper centers around a cointegrating regression that

relates the logarithm of private and government consumption ratio, Ct / Gt , to the

logarithm of their relative price Pt g / Pt c :




(1)                       ln(C t / Gt ) = α + β ln( Pt g / Pt c ) + ut




where ln(Ct / Gt ) and ln( Pt g / Pt c ) are both difference–stationary I(1) processes, and ut is

a stationary I(0) process. Formal statistical evidence for the cointegration property will be

provided below. The slope parameter β is the elasticity of substitution between private

and government consumption. A positive (negative) β means that the two goods are

substitutes (complements). One attractive feature of cointegrating regression is that the

slope parameters can be estimated consistently without the assumption that the regressors




                                                      3
are econometrically exogenous. In eq. (1), for example, β can still be estimated

consistently even though there may be stationary omitted variables or measurement errors.

        So far eq. (1) is treated as a pure statistical relationship between the consumption

ratio of private and government goods and their relative prices. It is possible to provide

the equation a structural interpretation by deriving it as an equilibrium condition,

following the ideas of Ogaki (1992), Ogaki and Park (1997), and Ogaki and Reinhart

(1998). Assume that the representative consumer values two goods, private and

government, according to an expected life–time utility function subject to stationary

preference shocks:



                                    ∞
(2)                    U = Et [           δ j u (Ct + j *)]
                                   j =0




where



(3)                    Ct * = [φε t Ct1−(1/ σ ) + (1 − φ )ν t Gt1−(1/ σ ) ]1/[1− (1/ σ )]



(ε t ,ν t ) are random preference shocks which are assumed to be strictly stationary, have

unit mean and finite variances. The stationarity assumption amounts to say preferences

are stable in the long run. The period utility function is assumed to possess the usual

                        '< 0. (φ , σ ) are preference parameters which characterize the
properties u '> 0 and u '

representative agent’s utility function: φ is the relative weight assigned to private goods

and σ is the substitution parameter which measures the curvature of the indifference



                                                          4
curves. Given time–separability of the utility function, the optimal consumption bundle

will have to satisfy the equality between marginal rate of substitution and relative price:



                           ∂U / ∂Gt ν t (1 − φ )Gt −1/ σ Pt g
(4)                                 ≡                   = c
                           ∂U / ∂Ct      ε tφ Ct −1/ σ   Pt



Taking logarithm and rearranging yields



(5)              ln(Ct / Gt ) = −σ ln[(1 − φ ) / φ ] + σ ln( Pt g / Pt c ) − σ ln(ν t / ε t )



Stable preferences implies that the residual term, −σ ln(ν t / ε t ), is stationary and hence eq.

(5) should be a cointegrating regression, provided that log consumption ratio, ln(Ct / Gt ),

and log price ratio, ln( Pt g / Pt c ), are both I(1) processes. In other words, the stable

preferences assumption, together with the consumer optimality condition in eq. (4),

imposes a cointegration restriction on the movements of the log consumption ratio and

the log price ratio series. Eq. (5) provides a structural interpretation to eq. (1) which can

be regarded as the reduced form equation with parameters and residuals related to their

structural counterpart via the relationships



(6)              α = −σ ln[(1 − φ ) / φ ], β = σ , ut = −σ ln(ν t / ε t )



        Notice that eq. (5) is a theoretical demand equation, whereas eq. (1) is an

empirical equation describing the equilibrium quantities and prices. Just like the classical


                                                        5
supply–and–demand simultaneous equation model, interpreting eq. (1) as the demand

equation requires identification assumption. In general, to identify the demand equation,

we need variability from the supply side and the demand side should be relatively stable.

Since the supply side has to do with production which is subject to technological

improvement, it is reasonable to expect the quantity supplied series should be highly

persistent which can be modeled as a stochastic trend. The demand side, on the other

hand, has to do with taste and it is reasonable to expect preference shocks are relatively

stable in comparison with technological shocks. In the context of demand analysis, Ogaki

(1992) has shown formally that the assumptions of stable preferences and a stochastic

trend in the quantity supplied are sufficient to ensure identification of a cointegrating

demand equation like eq. (1).

       In the theoretical analyses of Bailey (1971) and Barro (1981), followed by the

empirical work of Kormendi (1983), Aschauer (1985), Evans and Karras (1996), among

many others, the effective consumption is specified as a weighted average of private and

government consumption:



(7)                    Ct * = Ct + θ Gt



In this setup each unit of government goods is equivalent to units of private goods,

irrespective of the current consumption level of the two goods. In other words, the

indifference curves for the two goods are linear which corresponds to the extreme case of

σ = +∞ in the CES aggregator function in eq. (3). Clearly this is an empirically

restrictive assumption, albeit a convenient one for analytical tractability.



                                              6
3. Government expenditures in East Asia



       Table 1 reports a summary of the government expenditures by economic type (in

percentage of GDP) for the Asian countries studied in this paper, together with the

corresponding figures for the United States for comparison. The data source is World

Bank (2004) which in turn is based on the primitive data in the IMF Government

Financial Statistics Yearbook. Total government outlays comprise of government

purchase of goods and services, wages and salaries for government employees, public

capital investment, transfer payments, and interest payments of outstanding government

debts. In terms of total outlays, the governments of the Asian countries are comparable in

size to that of the United States, except for the Malaysia government which stands out as

the outlier of the group. The pattern of government expenditures among the Asian

countries is more heterogeneous. Japan and Korea seem to differ from the rest of the

Asian countries and their government expenditure patterns are broadly comparable to that

of the United States. The governments of Hong Kong and the five ASAEN countries, on

the other hand, spend relatively more on goods and services and on government

employee payroll. Table 1 also reveals that the Asian governments devote considerable

amount of resources on capital investments, presumably most are on public infrastructure

and, for the five ASEAN countries, also on national enterprises. This is in sharp contrast

to the United States in which public investment is only 1% of GDP. Among the heavy

public investors, the Indonesian government stands out as the largest by devoting 6.9% of

GDP to public investment, followed by Thailand (6.5%), Singapore (5.0%), and Malaysia

(4.8%). Another noteworthy component is transfer payments. The transfer payments of




                                             7
the Asian governments are all relatively low comparing with the corresponding US figure

of 12.3%, with Japan and Korea register the highest government transfers in the 8 to 9 %

range and Thailand reports the lowest transfers of only 1.3% of GDP. Clearly the low

transfers in the ASEAN countries and Hong Kong reflect the relatively under–developed

social security system and other formal welfare schemes.

4. Empirical results



       We use annual data for 1960–2002 from the World Development Indicators

(World Bank, 2004) whenever possible to ensure cross–country compatibility. Missing or

erroneous entries are reconstructed from local sources. Private and government

consumption are taken to be the relevant expenditure series from the National Income and

Product Accounts (NIPA). The consumption ratio, Ct / Gt , is calculated from the constant

price private and government consumption series. The two price series, Pt g and Pt c , are

simply the respective implicit price deflators constructed by dividing the nominal series

by the constant price counterpart.

                                     Insert Table 2 here




                                              8
        We begin by examining the time series properties of the log consumption ratio

series, ln(Ct / Gt ), and the log price ratio series, ln( Pt g / Pt c ). Figure 1 depicts the two

series for all nine Asian countries. The strong persistency and co-movements of the two

series are clearly discernable from the plots, giving an initial impression that they are

likely to be I(1) and cointegrated. Table 2 reports formal panel unit root test results. It is

well known that unit root tests have low power and the problem may be even worse for

our application as we have short time series. To better utilize sample information, we

pool the nine countries’ data to perform panel unit root tests, which have been shown to

be more powerful than the individual time series version. All three panel unit root tests

draw the same conclusion: the unit root null hypothesis is not rejected for the level series

but is strongly rejected for the first–differenced series. This shows that the log

consumption ratio and the log price ratio series are indeed I(1). Moreover, the asymmetry

of the p–values for the level series in the IPS test and the ADF-Fisher chi-square test

suggest that log consumption ratio is the less integrated series – in the sense that it has a

weaker random walk component – than the log price ratio. This has important

implications to the specification of the cointegrating regression. It is well known that

cointegrating regression is not invariant to normalization choice –– deciding which

variable to put on the left hand side as the regressand – and different choices may imply

different estimates for the same parameter. For example, instead of running regression eq.

(1), we could have run the reverse regression with the log price ratio normalized as the

regressand to obtain an estimate of (1/ β ). In finite sample the estimates from the direct

and reverse regressions may be far from being reciprocal to each other and they can also

have drastically different statistical properties. According to Ng and Perron (1997), in the



                                                   9
context of cointegrating regression, it is preferable to put the less integrated series as the

regressand and the more integrated series as the regressor. Applying the Ng–Perron rule,

this means that designating the log consumption ratio series as the regressand as in eq. (1)

is indeed the right choice.



                                         Insert Table 3 here



        Table 3 reports panel estimation results for eq. (1) with country specific fixed

effects. The cointegration property of eq. (1) is confirmed by the two panel cointegration

tests: the null hypothesis of no cointegration is decisively rejected by Kao’s (1999) ADF

test but the null of cointegration cannot be rejected according to the McCoskey and Kao

(1998) LM test. Turning to the elasticity of substitution between private and government

consumption –– the coefficient of ln( Pt g / Pt c ) –– it can be seen that the estimates are all

significantly positive, ranging between 0.57 and 1.05 with small standard errors, and

varying across different estimation methods and sample periods. The empirical results

suggest that on average private and government consumption in East Asia are substitutes

with an elasticity of substitution midway between 0.5 and 1.

       We also estimate an unrestricted version of eq. (1) as a simple specification check:



(8)                     ln(C t / Gt ) = α + β1 ln( Pt g ) + β 2 ln( Pt c ) + ut



Eq. (1) is a restricted version of eq. (8) with β1 + β 2 = 0. Estimates of β1 and β 2 that are

similar in magnitude but opposite in sign provide evidence in favor of the restriction and



                                                   10
hence eq. (1). As can be seen from Table 3, the pattern of the parameter estimates is in

general supportive of eq. (1); and the evidence is especially strong when all nine Asian

countries are included in the sample for the period 1978–2002 (Panel B). According to

the fully efficient DOLS estimates, government and private consumption in East Asia

during 1978-2002 have a substantial degree of substitutability with an elasticity of

substitution around 1, implying a Cobb-Douglas aggregator function for eq. (3).

       From a policy perspective, the panel estimate may not be of much practical

relevance, as it tells us little about any individual country. Table 4 therefore reports

cointegrating regression results for the nine Asian countries individually. We also report

the corresponding results for the United States for comparison. To check robustness, we

try three different estimation methods which are all asymptotically efficient procedures

for estimating cointegration regressions. The three methods are Phillips and Hansen

(1990) fully modified ordinary least square (FM-OLS), Park (1992) canonical

cointegrating regression (CCR), and Stock and Watson (1993) dynamic ordinary least

squares (DOLS). In general the parameter estimates are stable across the three estimation

methods. Comparing the DOLS estimates of the elasticity of substitution across countries,

Malaysia and Thailand come up with the highest values of 1.66 and 1.51, respectively,

which are comparable to the value of 1.5 of the United States. On the other extreme are

Indonesia and Singapore for which the negative elasticities of substitution of –0.92 and

–1.76, respectively, imply that private and government consumption are strong

complements. The four North East Asian countries, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea,

share a moderate elasticity of substitution ranging from 0.41 in Hong Kong to 0.65 in

China. The Philippines, on the other hand, has a numerically small and statistically




                                              11
insignificant elasticity of substitution of 0.07, indicating little substitution in private and

government consumption.



                                      Insert Table 4 here



        Indonesia and Thailand provide an interesting case of contrast. The estimated

elasticity of substitution between private and government consumption is –0.92 for

Indonesia and 1.51 for Thailand. Government consumption is a strong substitute to

private consumption in Thailand, implying that a fiscal contraction that makes

government goods relatively more expensive will induce substantial expansion in private

consumption, thereby offsetting or even outweighing the negative impact of the fiscal

contraction on aggregate demand. The Indonesian government consumption, in contrast,

is a strong complement to private consumption, implying that a fiscal contraction that

makes government goods relatively more expensive will generate a large negative income

effect that outweighs the substitution effect, leading to a concomitant contraction in

private consumption expenditure that further depresses aggregate demand. These

predictions about the two economies’ reaction to fiscal austerity seem to be consistent

with what have been observed during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.



                                          Insert Table 5 here



        What explains the cross-country diversity in the substitution between private and

government consumption? In their international study, Evans and Karras (1996) find a




                                               12
statistically significant negative relationship between the share of government

expenditure that goes to national defense and the degree of substitutability between

private and government consumption. The idea is that the higher is the defense share, the

higher is the public goods component in government consumption which reduces its

ability to substitute for private consumption. In Table 5 we collect together for the nine

East Asia countries their national defense expenditure shares, education expenditure

shares, and estimated elasticities of substitution between private and government

consumption. The entries are sorted by the substitution elasticities for ease of comparison.

Apparently neither the education share nor the defense share can explain the empirical

pattern of the substitution elasticities for all nine countries. However, the correlation

between the defense shares and substitution elasticities is –0.24, confirming the empirical

findings of Evans and Karras (1996). The strong complementarity between private and

government consumption in Singapore seems to be testimonial to the Evans–Karras story,

in view of the favorable international ratings of the Singaporean education system and

other infrastructure, and the government’s well documented role in the country’s

economic success (e.g. Low (1998) and Krause et al. (1987)). The case of Indonesia may

appear to be defiant of the Evans–Karras explanation: the expenditures on education and

defense are only moderate and yet private and government consumption appear to be

complements, according to the negative sign of the substitution elasticity. One potential

explanation is the well known fact that the Indonesian government heavily subsidies the

private sector including fuel, electricity, fertilizer and other basic goods, and these

subsidies are complementary to other goods in the private consumption bundle; see for

example Hill (1996, 1999) and World Bank (2006). When the Indonesian government




                                              13
adjusts these subsidies in tandem with the overall government spending, this will generate

the observed co–movements of private and government consumption that gives rise to the

estimated negative elasticity of substitution.



5. Conclusion



       In this paper we have estimated the degree of substitution between private and

government consumption in nine East Asia countries. On average there is substantial

substitutability between private and government consumption, implying there will be

direct crowding out of private consumption by government consumption. Such direct

crowding out effect will reinforce the conventional interest rate and wealth effect

crowding out channels to make fiscal policy relatively ineffective in East Asia. We also

find that the substitutability between private and government consumption varies among

the Asian countries. Government and private consumption turn out to be complements in

Indonesia and Singapore, but they are substitutes in other Asian countries with different

degrees of substitutability. There is no obvious quantitative variable that can explain each

country’s empirical estimates, although the share of government expenditure that goes to

education and national defense seems to be negatively correlated with substitutability.

Future study on this issue will need a more careful examination of each country’s

institutional details – one will have to understand what sort of government services those

public consumption figures represent – before further conclusion can be drawn.
