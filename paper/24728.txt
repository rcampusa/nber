When Work Moves: Job Suburbanization and Black Employment

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper presents evidence that job suburbanization caused significant declines in black
employment from 1970 to 2000. I document that, conditional on detailed job characteristics,
blacks are less likely than whites to work in suburban establishments, and this spatial segregation
is stable over time despite widespread decentralization of population and jobs. This stable
segregation suggests job suburbanization may have increased black-white labor market
inequality. Exploiting variation across metropolitan areas, I find that job suburbanization is
associated with substantial declines in black employment rates relative to white employment
rates. Evidence from nationally planned highway infrastructure corroborates a causal
interpretation.

1     Introduction
Over the last 60 years in the United States, the unemployment rate among black working age
adults has roughly doubled the national unemployment rate (Fairlie and Sundstrom, 1999). Large
disparities remain conditional on education and AFQT scores (Ritter and Taylor, 2011). The
spatial mismatch hypothesis, introduced by Kain (1968) and further popularized by Wilson (1987)
and Wilson (1996), attributes racial disparities in employment rates in part to spatial frictions in
the labor and housing markets. Black households tend to live relatively far from work opportunities,
reducing their access to gainful employment, and this distance has increased over recent decades.
In particular, firms and white households relocated from central cities to suburban rings at an
accelerated pace following World War II.1 By contrast, black households, who faced discrimination
in housing and mortgage markets, remain concentrated in central cities. As a result, blacks tend
to live further away from the portions of metropolitan areas experiencing substantial job growth,
depressing their labor market outcomes.
    There is suggestive evidence for spatial mismatch in aggregate data. Table 1 documents employ-
ment rates and share living in the central city for black and white working-age, non-institutionalized
males in 14 large metropolitan areas from 1930 to 2000.2 Blacks live in the central city at higher
rates, and the black-white difference in this share increases sharply up to 1970, plateauing since. Up
to 1970, employment rates are similar within-race for those living in the central city and suburbs.
After 1970, a large gap emerges for blacks, with employment rates about 10 percentage points
higher in the suburbs in 1980 and 13 percentage points higher by 2000.3 Hence, while job growth
relocates to the suburbs following World War II, blacks remain concentrated in the central city,
and blacks living in the central city appear to be increasingly worse off than those living in the
suburbs.
    It remains unclear whether job suburbanization and the decline of black employment over this
period are causally linked, however. Though researchers have posited several explanations for why
work has decentralized, including improvements in transportation technology and infrastructure,
land costs, and the suburbanization of workers (Glaeser and Kahn, 2001), the process of job sub-
urbanization is not well understood. Job suburbanization may be associated with changes in labor
demand and supply that would generate changes in the racial composition of the workforce even
in the absence of suburbanization. Moreover, even if firms began to locate in the suburbs due to
exogenous factors, it is not clear what implications this would have for the racial composition of
the workforce. While the segregation of black households in the central city has been a persistent
feature of US metropolitan areas (Cutler et al., 1999), workers may respond to the changing ge-
ography of work by changing jobs, altering their commute, or moving to a different neighborhood.
   1
     In 1960, 61% of metropolitan area jobs were located in the central city; by 2000, the central city share declined
to 34% (Baum-Snow, 2014).
   2
     I limit to these 14 metropolitan areas because they are consistently identified in Census and Current Population
Survey microdata. I use the Census definition of central cities throughout, which are generally the largest places in
a metropolitan statistical area.
   3
     In addition, incarceration rates are significantly higher for those living in the central city (Wilson, 1987).

      ‘Working-age’ is defined as ages 24 to 64.
      The 14 metropolitan areas are: Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo-Niagara Falls, Chicago, Detroit, Houston,
      Los Angeles-Long Beach, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San
      Francisco-Oakland, Washington, DC. I limit to these 14 metropolitan areas because they are consistently
      identified in Census and Current Population Survey microdata.


These response margins may be sufficient for job suburbanization to have little effect on who works.
   In this paper I present novel evidence that job suburbanization caused significant declines in
black employment from 1970 to 2000. I do so in two parts.
   First, using establishment-level administrative data from the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, I document that blacks are substantially less likely than whites to work in suburban
establishments. In particular, conditional on job characteristics, the black share of employees in
metropolitan area establishments is decreasing in an establishment’s distance from the central busi-
ness district. Remarkably, this spatial segregation is stable over time despite widespread movement
of population and jobs to the suburbs. I also provide additional evidence that this spatial segre-
gation reflects at least in part the causal effect of job location on racial composition. I document
that the relationship between job location and racial composition holds within firms that operate
multiple establishments within a metropolitan area. I also find that establishments that relocate
from the central city to the suburbs experience sharp coincident declines in the black share of their
employees, despite no detectable changes in their occupational composition.
   This persistent spatial segregation suggests job suburbanization may have reduced black em-
ployment rates. Cross-sectional estimates suggest that job suburbanization decreased the black
share of the workforce by 3.7% each decade. However, suburbanization may be offset by worker
re-sorting across workplaces or related to other important changes in labor demand or supply. This
motivates the second half of the analysis, which exploits variation across metropolitan statistical
areas in suburbanization rates using Census data.
   Using a synthetic panel and a differences-in-differences research design, I find that job sub-
urbanization is associated with substantial declines in black employment rates relative to white
employment rates. For every 10% decline in the fraction of MSA jobs located in the central city

                                                      3
over this period, black employment rates declined by 1.3 to 1.9%, while white employment rates
increased by a (statistically insignificant) 0.3 to 0.4%. This relationship holds within observable
skill groups, and estimates are similar for men and women. Relative earnings declined by 1.2 to
2.3%, though these estimates are less stable across specifications. Conversely, job suburbanization
is unrelated to or weakly related to other substantive structural changes in the labor market, such
as job growth or changes in industry or occupation mix that would predict changes in black relative
employment rates.
      To further address the potential endogeneity of job suburbanization—in particular, changes
in the spatial distribution of work driven by unobserved labor supply shocks that are unevenly
distributed across blacks and whites—I instrument for job suburbanization using variation in na-
tionally planned interstate highway construction across MSAs as identified in Baum-Snow (2007).
These highways were planned in the 1940’s and 1950’s and primarily designed to link far away places
rather than facilitate local commuting or economic development. Hence, their assignment across
MSAs should be exogenous to residual labor supply shocks from 1970 to 2000. While highways
have a variety of effects on the labor market that may potentially violate the exclusion restriction,
I argue that they are unrelated to labor demand and supply shocks that would disproportionately
affect black workers, the most concerning omitted variables.
      Highway-based IV estimates are comparable to OLS estimates, corroborating a causal interpre-
tation. Moreover, I find that highways cause residential suburbanization of white households but
not black households, consistent with the premise that black households faced significant additional
barriers to suburban residence.
      I conclude that job suburbanization was an important determinant of black-white labor market
inequality from 1970 to 2000. The estimates imply that job suburbanization can explain the
majority of the relative decline in black male employment over this period.
      While this paper provides novel evidence on spatial segregation in the labor market and the
causal effect of workplace location on the racial composition of employees, it is largely silent on
why space matters. Blacks may be less likely to work in the suburbs due to commuting costs, job
search costs, or employer preferences. Interestingly, the labor market is substantially less spatially
segregated than the housing market, so commuting flows do offset residential segregation to some
degree. However, while blacks are residentially less concentrated in central city neighborhoods then
they were in 1970, this movement has not been sufficient to noticeably alter the spatial segregation
of the labor market. Blacks may not move to the suburbs to offset any commuting or search costs
because of suburban housing prices, discrimination in housing or mortgage markets, or preferences.
Distinguishing between these mechanisms is an important area for future research.
      An extensive literature sets out to test the spatial mismatch hypothesis, typically by relating
labor market outcomes to measures of job accessibility in a cross-section (see Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist
(1998) for a review of the older literature).4 Most recent work in this literature finds some support
  4
    Three notable exceptions are Mouw (2000) and Weinberg et al. (2004). Mouw (2000) estimates the relationship
between changes in job density and neighborhood-level employment rates in Chicago and Detroit from 1980 to 1990.
Weinberg et al. (2004) exploit individual moves across neighborhoods using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey


                                                       4
for spatial mismatch, though there has been considerable debate about its empirical importance
(Ellwood, 1986). Results tend to be sensitive to how job accessibility is measured (Raphael, 1998).5
More importantly, results from this literature are made difficult to interpret by the endogeneity of
household and firm location. Residents who are less productive may sort into neighborhoods that
are farther from work opportunities, where rents are typically lower.6 Similarly, firms may choose
to locate in neighborhoods with residents who are more productive. In this paper, I take a more
“reduced form” approach–rather than attempt to estimate the effects of work proximity per se, I
estimate the effects of job suburbanization at the local labor market level.
    Andersson et al. (2018) is an important and recent contribution to this literature. The authors
use matched employer-employee data from 2000 to 2005 in 9 large metropolitan areas to study the
relationship between job accessibility and jobless duration among workers displaced during mass
layoffs. They document compelling evidence that, among similar job searchers, search duration is
decreasing in job accessibility. By contrast to the current paper, Andersson et al. (2018) do not
study how job accessibility contributes to racial differences in labor market outcomes, or the effects
of job suburbanization more generally. I view the approaches of Andersson et al. (2018) and the
current paper as complimentary.
    A smaller literature examines how a work establishment’s location influences the racial composi-
tion of its employees. This research has found that location appears to be an important determinant
of employee composition. However, prior work has been limited to relatively small samples–cross-
sectional studies of a few thousand firms in a handful of metropolitan areas (Holzer and Ihlanfeldt,
1996), or case studies of individual plant relocations (Zax and Kain, 1996; Fernandez, 2008). By
contrast, the administrative data used here cover hundreds of thousands of establishments for
several decades, including thousands of relocation episodes.
    Though focused on spatial mismatch, this paper also relates to work on residential segregation
and neighborhood effects, particularly given the potential connection between suburbanization and
neighborhood composition. Cutler and Glaeser (1997) and Ananat (2011) argue that residential
segregation leads to worse labor market and social outcomes for black Americans. However, as in
the existing spatial mismatch literature, these papers cannot convincingly estimate the effect of
segregation on individuals because people choose which city to live in. The neighborhood effects
literature surmounts this problem by exploiting the random or quasi-random assignment of house-
holds to neighborhoods. Notable papers in this literature include Oreopoulos (2003), Jacob (2004),
and work on the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program (e.g. Ludwig et al., 2013), which offered
randomly selected families living in high-poverty housing projects vouchers to move to neighbor-
hoods with lower poverty rates. Ludwig et al. (2013) find that the MTO program had no detectable
of Youth. Both papers find evidence of spatial mismatch.
   5
     For example, previous researchers have used the local job density, local job growth, and the average commuting
times of local workers as measures of job accessibility. Hellerstein et al. (2008) argue that accessibility measures
should be race-specific; for example, the density of jobs into which blacks are hired is a more relevant accessibility
metric for blacks than job density per se.
   6
     Alternatively, if spatial frictions are relevant, residents who find it difficult to obtain work may sort into neigh-
borhoods with higher employment density.



                                                            5
effect on the economic outcomes of adult participants, though Quiqley and Raphael (2008) argue
that MTO had only small effects on the degree of spatial mismatch faced by families.
        By contrast, this paper studies the effects of a changing city–in particular, the changing location
of employers–on the distribution of labor market outcomes among the populace. I find that job
suburbanization has a substantial impact on black-white labor market inequality. While in the
context of this study it is not possible to convincingly disentangle the effect of job suburbanization
from that of residential suburbanization–and hence, changes in residential segregation–I provide
novel evidence that changes in job location are an important causal channel that can explain the
relationship between job suburbanization and black employment entirely.


2        Data
In this paper I use two types of data: individual level and city level Census data; and establishment
level data from EEO-1 forms.

2.1        Census Data
I use Census data to measure various labor market characteristics and job suburbanization. I use
Census data from 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. I focus on these Census years for two reasons.
First, the second wave of the Great Migration, a period when a substantial share of Southern
black households moved to other regions of the country, ends around 1970. Analysis of Census
data from earlier than 1970 would be complicated by the large and potentially endogenous black
migration flows over this period. Second, MSA is not identified in the publicly available 1960
Census microdata.
        To measure labor market characteristics, I use Integrated Public Use Microdata (IPUMS) Cen-
sus data (Ruggles et al., 2010). The 1970 Census data is a 2% national sample, while the remaining
years are 5% national samples. I restrict the analysis to the 58 consistently identified MSAs with
the largest black populations as defined in 1970.7 These cities are listed in Appendix Table A1.
        To measure job suburbanization, I use various Census data products. Measuring the spatial
distribution of work consistently across years is complicated by the fact that central city defini-
tions change significantly with the 1990 Census. In particular, many cities that are defined as
suburbs in 1980 are classified as central cities in 1990. These changes make it difficult to construct
consistent measures of job suburbanization after 1980 using only Census IPUMS data. Instead, I
combine IPUMS data with tabulations from the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP)
to measure the spatial distribution of work in 1990 and 2000.8 The CTPP data include tabulations
    7
     Unfortunately, after 1970, many MSAs are only partially identified in the Integrated Public Use Microdata
(IPUMS) Census data. That is, some MSA residents are not identified as MSA residents in the data. These residents
tend to live in (suburban) areas that straddle MSA boundaries, so the representativeness of the black population
(who tend to reside in central cities) should be less affected. Nevertheless, I restrict to MSAs where no more than
15% of the estimated MSA population is omitted in 1980, 1990, or 2000.
   8
     This follows Baum-Snow (2014), who uses the CTPP from 2000 to measure commuting flows between suburbs
and central cities.


                                                        6
reporting the total number of individuals working at various levels of geography. I divide those
totals into central cities and suburbs using 1970 Census definitions for central cities. For 1970 and
1980, I use Census IPUMS data. In the Census microdata, I measure the spatial distribution of
work using the Census indicator for whether an individual works in the central city or outside the
central city (suburbs) of an MSA. Note that, while I hold the set of municipalities defined as central
cities constant, I follow Census definitions of central city and MSA geographies, which evolve over
time in some cases.

2.2     EEO-1 Form Data
For some of the analyses below, I use a unique set of establishment-level panel data. These data,
known as EEO-1 form data, are collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) and cover the years 1971-2000. As part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, firms meeting
certain size requirements are required to complete EEO-1 forms annually and submit them to the
EEOC. Firms are required to report their overall racial, ethnic, and gender composition and the
racial, ethnic, and gender composition of each of their establishments meeting size requirements,
disaggregated by 9 major occupation groups.9 Employers are instructed to base demographic
classifications on worker self-identification or visual inspection, where the former is the preferred
method.10 Before 1982, all firms with 50 or more employees were required to submit EEO-1 forms.
In 1982, the firm size cutoff was adjusted up to 100. For the analysis, I drop all establishments
that would not meet the post-1982 criteria. Firms are required to file a separate report for each
establishment with at least 50 employees and the company headquarters. Establishments are con-
sistently identified with firm and establishment identifiers. I observe each establishment’s location
and industry. I present summary statistics for the EEO-1 data covering the same 58 MSAs in
Appendix Table A3. For most of the analysis using EEO-1 data, I restrict to establishments that
I am able to geocode using street address, zip code, or city.11 Results are very similar if I restrict
to establishments that I am able to geocode using street address.12


3       Job Suburbanization in the United States
To analyze the effects of job suburbanization using variation across MSAs, I first need a measure
of job suburbanization that can be applied consistently across MSAs with differing initial spatial
distributions of work. I also require a measure that can be calculated using available Census data. I
    9
     The 9 occupation categories consist of: officials and managers, professionals, technicians, sales workers, adminis-
trative support workers, craft workers, operatives, laborers/helpers, and service workers.
  10
     There is no distinction between race and ethnicity in the data; in particular, Hispanic workers are classified as a
distinct, non-overlapping group.
  11
     For establishments that I am only able to geocode using zip code or city, I assign the coordinates of the centroid
for that zip code or city.
  12
     Due to the size requirements, establishments in the EEO-1 data are not representative of all U.S. establishments.
Unsurprisingly, industries that tend to have large establishments, e.g. manufacturing, are overrepresented, while
industries that tend to have small establishments, e.g. services, are underrepresented. Overall, the EEO-1 data
account for about 40% of total employment (Robinson et al., 2005).


                                                           7
focus on the proportional change in the number of central city jobs due to the change in the spatial
distribution of work, what I term the share effect. The number of central city jobs may change
because the whole MSA is growing or shrinking—the scale effect— or via the share effect. More
concretely, let Tt denote the number of jobs in an MSA at time t (t = 70, 80, 90, 00); let πtcc denote
the fraction of MSA jobs located in the central city; and let Ttcc denote the number of central city
jobs. The change in the log of the number of central city jobs can be decomposed as follows:

                           log Ttcc
                                 1
                                    − log Ttcc
                                            0
                                               = log(πtcc1 Tt1 ) − log(πtcc0 Tt0 )
                                                = [log πtcc1 − log πtcc0 ] + [log Tt1 − log Tt0 ].
                                                  |          {z         } |           {z        }
                                                        share effect             scale effect


Hence, I measure job suburbanization using ∆t1 ,t0 log π cc = log πtcc1 − log πtcc0 . In each decade, the
fraction of work in the central city (π cc ) decreases by an average of about 10% across MSAs.
However, this average masks substantial heterogeneity across MSAs; the standard deviation is
about 10% over each decade. I report job suburbanization for all MSAs included in the analysis in
Appendix Table A1 and Appendix Table A2.

3.1     Spatial Segregation in the Labor Market
In this section I assess whether, conditional on job characteristics, blacks are less likely to work
in the suburbs than whites. I also assess how the relationship between job location and racial
composition has changed over time.
    I use EEO-1 data to measure how the racial composition of workplaces varies with workplace
location. The granularity of the EEO-1 data allow for a finer measure of location than an indicator
for central city status. Ideally, I would measure location effects on racial composition for very
disaggregated areas within metropolitan areas (e.g., Census tracts), adjusting for establishment
characteristics. Unfortunately, there are not enough establishments in the EEO-1 data to do this
effectively. Instead, I parameterize the effect of location, focusing on an establishment’s distance
from the corresponding central business district (CBD) of the central city.13
    To facilitate comparisons across MSAs, I first normalize each establishment’s black share of
employees by the black share of employees for all establishments in the MSA that year. I refer to
this measure as an establishment’s normalized black share. Hence, in an MSA where 15% of the
workforce is black, a 0.10 increase in an establishment’s normalized black share is a 1.5 percentage
point increase in the establishment’s black share of employees.
    In Panel A of Figure 1 I plot the relationship between distance from CBD and normalized
black share from 1971-1975 and 1996-2000. These plots are non-parametric, local polynomials with
Epanechnikov kernels of bandwidth 1.25. In both periods, there is a sharp negative relationship
between distance from CBD and normalized black share. For every 10-mile increase in the distance
   13
      The Census Bureau defines a CBD as “an area of very high land valuation characterized by a high concentration
of retail businesses, service businesses, offices, theaters, and hotels, and by a very high traffic flow.” I use the latitude
and longitude of each CBD as measured in Holian and Kahn (2012).


                                                             8
from the CBD, an establishment’s normalized black share is about 0.25 lower. Remarkably, this
relationship has changed little from 1971 to 2000. By contrast, the analogous slope for the racial
makeup of residential neighborhoods, depicted in Panel B of Figure 1, is substantially steeper, but
flattens significantly over this period.14 Hence, while worker commuting patterns generally mute the
translation of residential segregation into workplace segregation, the spatial segregation of the labor
market remained roughly constant over this period despite significant residential desegregation.
    This slope is also roughly unchanged after adjusting for establishment industry, occupation
composition, and size. To adjust for these job characteristics, I estimate the following model:

                    norm. black sharejt = τm(j)i(j)t + βdistanceCBD
                                                                jt  + γ ln xjt + ǫjt                            (1)

where j indexes establishments, i(·) indexes industries, m(·) indexes MSAs, and τm(j),i(j),t are MSA
by industry by year fixed effects. I also try replacing the MSA by industry by year fixed effects
with MSA by firm by year fixed effects. Under this specification, β is identified from variation
in establishment location in the same MSA and year within the same firm. I weight observations
by establishment size. I also estimate analogous models where the observations at the job-level
(establishment by occupation), where I include MSA by industry by occupation by year fixed
effects (or firm by occupation by year fixed effects) and weight observations by job cell size. In all
models, I cluster standard errors at the establishment level.
    Slope estimates are presented in Table 2. Establishment-level estimates are presented in Panel
A; job-level estimates are presented in Panel B. In column (1) I pool all years of data and include
MSA by industry by year fixed effects. The estimated coefficient, -0.0256, implies that for every
10-mile increase in its distance from the CBD, an establishment’s normalized black share decreases
by 0.256. Column (2) includes MSA by firm by year fixed effects, and the coefficient increases in
magnitude to -0.0283. In columns (3)-(5) I estimate (1) by decade, including MSA by industry by
year fixed effects. The estimates are stable across time periods. The analogous estimates in Panel
B are similar, though slightly larger in magnitude. Controlling for fine job characteristics, blacks
are less likely to work in the suburbs than whites, and this relationship between location and racial
composition is stable over time. Given these coefficients the changing location of work alone would
predict about a 3.7% decline in the black share of the workforce each decade.
    The cross-sectional relationship between distance from CBD and normalized black share sug-
gests that spatial frictions play a significant role in determining where people work. However, it may
be the case that jobs located further from the CBD differ in important unobserved ways so that,
independent of location, those jobs would be less likely to be filled by black workers. These may in-
clude characteristics of the work itself or employer preferences over workers. To provide additional
evidence that spatial frictions play a significant role in the racial composition of an establishment’s
workforce, I estimate the effects of establishment relocations on the black share of employees. The
advantage of studying establishment relocations is that job characteristics and local labor market
  14
     This is consistent with Cutler et al. (1999), who document significant declines in residential segregation from
1970 to 2000 as measured by the dissimilarity and isolation indices.

conditions are (approximately) fixed before and after the relocation. As long as relocations are not
associated with other types of restructuring that alters the racial mix of employees–an assumption
I revisit below–any change in the racial composition of employees following the move should be due
to the location of the establishment.
       This empirical strategy follows previous work, Zax and Kain (1996) and Fernandez (2008). Both
papers are case studies of single manufacturing plants that relocate from central cities (Detroit in
Zax and Kain (1996); Milwaukee in Fernandez (2008)) to neighboring suburbs, and study how plant
employees respond to those relocations. In both papers, the authors use worker-level personnel
data and estimate models for the decision to quit the job, and the decision to move to a new
address. My approach here differs from prior work in several important ways. First, I have data
on over one thousand establishment relocations spanning 1972 to 2000. With data on significantly
more relocations, I can make more general statements about the effects of relocation. Moreover,
while prior work has relied on before and after snapshots, I use yearly panel data, which allows
for a more credible event study research design. Unfortunately, while Zax and Kain (1996) and
Fernandez (2008) use worker-level data, I only have access to establishment-level data on workforce
composition. Hence, I cannot measure how worker decisions depend on worker-specific changes in
commuting time. Instead, I will look at how the composition of the entire establishment changes
with relocation.
       I restrict the analysis to establishments that move from a central city to a suburb within a
given MSA, and whose distance from the central business district of the central city increases by at
least 5 miles. In Table A3 column (5) I present descriptive statistics for relocating establishments
that form my estimation sample and, for comparison, central city establishments with consistent
addresses that that do not relocate in column (4).
       I estimate event study regression models of the form:

                                                                          b

where τi is the year the establishment relocates. I normalize the value of θ−1 = 0. The sequence of
θj can be interpreted as the difference in establishment black share from the year prior to relocation
  14
    Zax and Kain (1996) find that white employees whose commutes lengthened due to the relocation were more likely
to move, but no more likely to quit, than white employees whose commute shortened. By contrast, black employees
whose commutes lengthened were more likely to both move and quit. Fernandez (2008) finds that black employees
were less responsive on the move margin than white employees, and similarly responsive on the quit margin.

and j periods thereafter. Note that the end points pool the end point years (a or b) and years
further from relocation (< a or > b). For estimation, I set a = −6 and b = 6. In estimating (2) I use
only data from relocating establishments. Hence, identification derives from the differential timing
of relocation across establishments. The identifying assumption is that, if not for the differential
timing of relocation across establishments, they would be on parallel trends.
      I plot the θ coefficients in Figure 2. The pattern is stark. Prior to relocation, establishments
exhibit little evidence of pre-trends, though their normalized black share drops by about 0.03 from
three years prior to the move to one year prior. This slight drop may reflect a trend that would
continue even in the absence of relocation if, for example, relocating employers are already shedding
black employees. It may also reflect workers anticipating the future move or miscoded relocation
years. In the year of relocation, normalized black share drops sharply by 0.12. Hence, even if
relocating employers would have reduced their number of black employees if they had not relocated,
this pattern indicates that relocation alone causes a decline in the black share of employees. This
decrease continues following the move so that 6 years after the move, the normalized black share
has dropped by more than 0.21. On average, movers had a normalized black share of 0.86 in the
year prior to the move. In the Appendix, I also show that the change in the racial composition
of employees at relocating establishments is not driven by coincident changes in the occupational
composition of employees at those establishments. Blacks are substantially less likely to work the
same job following its relocation to the suburbs.
      For the sake of comparison, I also plot the predicted drop in normalized black share, where the
prediction is based on the moving establishment’s MSA and change in distance from the CBD. In
particular, I estimate a variant of (1), allowing the β coefficient to vary by MSA, and then use the
estimated model to predict the normalized black share for all establishments in the data based on
MSA and distance from CBD alone.
      These predicted declines are significantly larger than the observed declines. This discrepancy
may reflect some combination of the following: (1) the causal effect of location is heterogenous
and relocating establishments are atypical15 ; (2) the β coefficients from equation (1) are not the
causal effect of establishment location; (3) the effect of establishment location is not the same as
the effect of an establishment relocation. The effects may not coincide if, for example, central city
residents are more aware of job opportunities at establishments that have relocated to the suburbs
than establishments that have only located in the suburbs. Nonetheless, the effect of relocation is
substantial.
      Black workers are less likely to work further away from the CBD. This is at least in part
due to spatial frictions. Over time, establishments tend to locate further away from the CBD. If
working patterns across MSA locations persist, the changing spatial distribution of work suggests
that black employment will decline. However, black workers may adjust their behavior in response.
For example, they may alter their commuting patterns or move to neighborhoods further from the

      That is, τm(j)i(j)t and ln xjt are set to zero.

      For example, relocating establishments have relatively low black shares even prior to relocation.

Notes: This figure plots event study coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (dotted) estimated using model (2)
where the outcome variable is the establishment’s normalized black share of employees. The models are estimated
using all establishments that relocate from the central city to the suburbs and whose distance from the central
business district increases by at least 5 miles. The coefficient for the year prior to the event (θ−1 ) is normalized to
zero. Estimated models include Census division by year fixed effects and log establishment size as controls. Standard
errors are clustered at the establishment level. The purple line depicts predicted changes in the normalized black share
of workers based on the MSA-specific cross-sectional relationship between establishment normalized black share and
distance from the central business district. See section 3.1 for further details on the construction of these predictions.

construction of this slope.



CBD. I examine whether the MSA-level relationship between an establishment’s distance from the
CBD and the black share of its employees changes in response to job suburbanization.
       Given that the distance-black share slope has changed so little from 1971 to 2000, a period
that saw substantial job suburbanization, it seems unlikely that job suburbanization flattened this
relationship. However, this aggregate stagnancy may mask across-MSA heterogeneity. I measure
a separate distance-black share slope for each MSA as in equation (1). I estimate this slope
separately using data from 1971-1975 and 1996-2000. I then plot the change in this slope against
job suburbanization from 1970 to 2000 as measured in Census data and defined in section 3.16 The
mean slopes in the early and late periods, weighted by 1971 employment, are -0.031 and -0.030
with standard deviation 0.016 in both periods.
       I present the results in Figure 3. There are two aspects to note. First, there is little within-MSA
change in distance-black share slopes. Second, there is little evidence that job suburbanization is
associated with increases in the distance-black share slope across MSAs. In fact, the correlation
is positive (0.20) and marginally significant at the 10% level. Hence, while black employment in
the suburbs does increase over this period, black workers remain similarly less likely to work in the
suburbs despite widespread job suburbanization.

       Results are similar if I use job suburbanization as measured in the EEO-1 data.




                                                                                   15
4         Job Suburbanization and Black Employment Rates
I have documented that conditional on job characteristics, blacks are ex-ante less likely than whites
to work in suburbs, and this segregation persists despite widespread job suburbanization. This
suggest that job suburbanization may reduce black labor market opportunities and increase racial
labor market inequality. In this section, I exploit variation across MSAs to estimate the local labor
market level relationship between job suburbanization and black employment rates.
         In analyzing labor market outcomes, I restrict attention to men and women between the ages
of 24 and 63 who are non-Hispanic white or black. To measure employment I use an indicator
for whether an individual is currently labor market ‘active’, meaning employed or in school.17
In practice, this measure reflects employment because only a small fraction of individuals in my
sample report being in school and this does not differ significantly by race. For this reason, I refer
to ‘active’ and ‘employed’ interchangeably.
         Combining Integrated Public Use Microdata (IPUMS) (Ruggles et al., 2010) from each Census,
I construct a synthetic panel by collapsing individuals into cells and merging cells across years.
The 1970 Census data is a 2% national sample, while the remaining years are 5% national samples.
I group individuals by MSA of residence, gender, race, education, and cohort. I exclude the
institutionalized because individuals in that population may not be residing in their relevant labor
market. This may attenuate the relevant estimates below given that incarceration rates began to
increase substantially in the mid-1970’s and a large share of black adults was incarcerated, though
the cohorts I focus on will have largely ‘aged-out’ of criminal activity by 1980 (Western and Pettit,
2000). Patterns for women should be less susceptible to this issue. I divide the sample into 3
education groups: less than high school graduate, high school graduate, and college graduate. I
also divide the sample into cohorts, those who are the following ages in 1970: 24-33, 34-43, and
44-53.18 I group by cohort rather than age because the intention is to follow the same group of
individuals from decade to decade.19 Of course, the composition of cells may change from decade
to decade due to migration. I explore the role migration plays in the analysis in section 4.3.
         Summary statistics on the demographics and labor market outcomes for the synthetic cohorts
are presented in Table 3. Black men are less active in the labor market than white men in 1970 and
experience larger proportional declines in employment in the short run and long run. By contrast,
black women are more active in the labor market than white women in 1970. However, the white
women experience larger increases in employment rates over time.
    17
     Results are similar if I use weeks worked as the employment measure.
    18
     This corresponds to individuals born in: 1936-1945; 1946-1955; 1956-1965.
  19
     Moreover, there are important changes in the educational opportunities children face over this period, and these
changes vary across MSAs and by race. In particular, following the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court
decision of 1954, many large urban school districts were mandated to desegregate under federal court order. These
court orders had substantial effects on school segregation and black educational attainment (Guryan, 2004). In
addition, while many blacks in older cohorts residing outside of the South were educated in the South, this is less
true for younger cohorts. Hence, even within a given MSA, there is wide variation in education experiences across
cohorts, particularly for blacks.

4.1       Empirical Strategy
I test the spatial mismatch hypothesis by estimating the relationship between job suburbanization
and black-white inequality in employment rates, exploiting variation across MSAs. In particular, I
test whether black cohorts experience larger declines in employments rates relative to comparable
white cohorts in MSAs that experience more job suburbanization. I estimate linear differences-in-
differences models of the following form:
                                    X
                          ∆Ymg =       αg + β∆ log(πmcc          t0
                                                        ) + f (Ymg  )γ
                                              ! B                                                           (3)
                                                          cc          t0
                                    + Iblack × β ∆ log(πm    ) + f (Ymg  )γ B + ǫmg

where αg are group level fixed effects and Iblack is an indicator for a cell of black individuals.
Y is either the log share of a cell that is employed20 , or log average annual earnings. In some
specifications I do not condition on baseline employment (earnings), but in others I specify f (·) as
a quadratic function. I include a control for a polynomial in baseline Y because employment or
earnings growth may depend nonlinearly on baseline employment or earnings.21 The coefficient β
has the following interpretation: a 10% decline in the fraction of MSA jobs located in the central
city is associated with at .10 × β% decline in cell employment. The coefficient β B reflects the
relative decline for black cells.
       Before describing the baseline results, I explore how job suburbanization relates to other baseline
cell-level and MSA-level characteristics.
       One concern with my empirical strategy is that job suburbanization may occur in areas where
employment is already declining, particularly for black workers. Though the 1960 Census does not
identify MSA, for half the respondents in the 1970 Census, I can observe their employment status
in 1965. To measure pre-trends by cell, I use the change in employment rates by cell, assigning
individuals to MSAs using their residence in 1970. I estimate models of the form
                                              X
           ∆P RE log (Employment Rate) =          αg + β∆ log(πm
                                                               cc
                                                                  ) + β B Iblack × ∆ log(πm
                                                                                          cc
                                                                                             ) + ǫmg         (4)

I estimate separate models for job suburbanization occurring over the short run (1970 to 1980)
and long run (1970 to 2000). The results are provided in Table 4 Panel A. I find that cells that
experienced more job suburbanization from 1970 to 1980 had somewhat lower employment growth
from 1965 to 1970. For suburbanization occurring from 1970 to 2000, the magnitude is even smaller
and statistically insignificant. Importantly, the differences in trends between black and white cells
is statistically insignificant in both cases and have opposite sign. Hence, black employment does
not appear to be on a differential trend in suburbanizing MSAs.
       A second concern is that job suburbanization is associated with other covariates that may
  19
      Groups are combinations of cohort, education, sex, and race.
  20
      Results are very similar if I use share levels as the outcome of interest.
   21
      For example, because the cell employment rate is capped at 1, cells with high baseline employment have very
little potential for growth relative to cells with lower baseline employment.

where Wm is a vector of cell-level and MSA-level covariates. I relate these correlates to short
run and long run subsequent job suburbanization. I relate job suburbanization to the following
baseline cell-level characteristics: log fraction active, log earnings. I also include the following
baseline MSA-level characteristics: fraction of jobs in the central city, black share of population,
racial residential segregation, violent crime rate, and property crime rate. To measure I use the
dissimilarity index constructed in Cutler et al. (1999). Data on reported crimes come from the FBI’s
Uniform Crime Reports. The UCR reports crimes per 100,000 for 7 types of offenses: murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. I divide these 7 offenses
into two categories, violent and property crimes, and sum within these categories. I standardize
the MSA-level covariates to have mean zero and standard deviation one across MSAs.
   From 1970 to 1980, I find residential segregation to be a significant predictor of job suburbaniza-
tion across cells. Baseline employment rates are a marginal predictor. Notably, these relationships
do not differ significantly for black cells. From 1970 to 2000, baseline residential segregation and the
fraction black of the population are significant predictors of job suburbanization. This is consistent
with research suggesting that black in-migration to central cities was a major cause of ‘white flight’
(Boustan, 2010). The baseline fraction of jobs located in the central city is a marginal predictor.

4.2   Baseline Estimates
In estimating (3), I restrict the analysis to cells with at least 25 observations, and weight cells by
their size. This leaves 1607 cells in 1970 over 58 MSAs. I cluster standard errors at the MSA level.
I estimate separate models for three periods: 1970 to 1980, 1970 to 1990, and 1970 to 2000. Table
5 provides these baseline estimates. In the top panel, the outcome is log employment rate. In the
bottom panel, the outcome is log average income. All columns other than (1), (4), and (7) include
controls for second order polynomial in baseline employment or earnings.
   Across specifications and periods, changes in the spatial distribution of work have little associa-
tion with white employment rates. The coefficient is generally small in magnitude and statistically
indistinguishable from zero at the 10% level. By contrast, job suburbanization is associated with
declines in black employment, and the relationship is highly statistically significant across specifica-
tions. Over the 1970’s, the β B coefficient of 0.25 to 0.29 implies that a 10% decline in the fraction
of MSA jobs located in the central city—about the mean level experienced over this period—is
associated with about a 2.5% to 2.9% decline in black cell fraction employed, relative to white
employment. The estimates for annual earnings have the same sign, but the coefficient is more
dependent on the inclusion of baseline earnings as a control.
   From 1970 to 1990, a 10% decline in the fraction of jobs located in the central city is associated

with a 1.8% to 2.3% decrease in black relative employment. Over the full period, a 10% decline in
the fraction of jobs located in the central city is associated with a 1.6% to 2.3% decrease in black
relative employment. The latter relationship is estimated using a single cohort of workers: those
who were 25-34 in 1970, and 55-64 in 2000. Figure 4 displays this relationship graphically, plotting
∆m log(π cc ) against changes in log black and white employment rates for all individuals in these
cohorts pooled by MSA. For black workers, there is a clear, positive relationship; for white workers,
there is no relationship.
    Given that the average value for ∆ log(π cc ) is about -0.1 for each decade, the observed job
suburbanization predicts a 1.6% to 2.3% decrease in black employment. This is 43-62% of the decline
predicted by the changing location of work alone, as described in section 3.1. This suggests that
blacks were able to make adjustments to partially offset the potential effects of job suburbanization.
    I examine heterogeneity in the baseline estimates by education and gender. These estimates are
presented in Table 6. I focus on the 1970-2000 period. All models include a quadratic in baseline
employment or earnings. For employment, the β B coefficient is largest for high school dropouts, but
also present for high school and college graduates. The coefficient is somewhat larger for women
than men, though the difference is not statistically significant. This is striking given that men
and women tend to work in very different industries and occupations over this period, and further
supports the claim that the measured effects of suburbanization are not driven by changes in job
composition. For earnings, the relationship is present for women but not men.

4.3    Endogenous Migration
Due to data limitations, I conduct the main analysis using a synthetic panel rather than a true
panel of individuals. For the same reason that residential sorting is a concern for any cross-sectional
analysis, the endogenous migration of households to and from MSAs may introduce a compositional
bias in the synthetic panel analysis. The productivity of migrants to and from an MSA may vary
systematically with job suburbanization, so that the correlation between job suburbanization and
employment growth may in part reflect the changing composition of cells rather than within-person
changes. For example, productive black households may move out of an MSA following widespread
suburbanization, leaving less productive black households behind. While this type of endogenous
migration would suggest that the spatial distribution of work is relevant for labor market outcomes,
it complicates the interpretation of the coefficient estimates.
    In assessing the role of migration, I focus on the 1970-1980 period, where job suburbanization
appears to have its largest effect.22 I utilize the fact that the 1980 Census identifies an individual’s
place of residence and employment status in 1975 for half the sample. Hence, I observe a true panel
of a large subsample of individuals over this 5-year period. I estimate models analogous to (3),
except over a 5-year period, and compare the results when using a synthetic panel to results using
a true panel. I construct the synthetic panel by assigning individuals to MSAs separately by where
   22
      While data limitations prevent me from studying migration at the same level of detail over the full period, I do
find that changes in cell size from 1970 to 2000 are unrelated to job suburbanization.

they live in 1975 and where they live in 1980. To form the true panel, I assign individuals to MSAs
based only on where they live in 1975.
   Unfortunately, I cannot observe the spatial distribution of work in 1975. Instead, I halve
the same measure of job suburbanization from over the 10-year period. Note that, even under
random migration, the coefficients in the true panel analysis may be attenuated for the same
reason that attrition attenuates coefficient estimates. Households that move are mechanically less
‘exposed’ to job suburbanization in their assigned MSA than households that do not move. Under
random migration, given that about 15% of individuals change MSAs over this period, and assuming
coefficients of zero for moving households, this attrition would predict that the coefficients in the
true panel analysis is about 85% as large as the coefficients in the synthetic panel analysis.
   I present estimates from the 5-year analysis in Table 7. In columns (1) and (2) the outcome
is ∆ log (Fraction Employed). In column (1) the analysis is conducted using a true panel; column
(2) is estimated using a synthetic panel. In general, the coefficients do not differ substantially. As
                                                                          cc ) × black is about
would roughly be predicted by random migration, the coefficient on ∆ log(πm
15% smaller in magnitude under the true panel, and statistically significant using either the true
or synthetic panel.
   In addition, I test directly for selective migration by examining whether job suburbanization
predicts migration flows and the composition of migrants. For migration flows I look at the fraction


                                                      25
of a cell that emigrates out of the original MSA. Column (3) presents coefficient estimates from
this exercise. To examine the composition of emigrants, I look at how the 1975 employment rate
of a cell would change if the eventual migrants were excluded (I label this as ∆M (emp)). Column
(4) presents coefficient estimates from this exercise. While job suburbanization predicts a small,
marginally significant decrease in emigration for white cells, it is uncorrelated with changes in the
composition of cells due to emigration.

4.4   Job Suburbanization and Composition
The spatial distribution of jobs shifted towards the suburban ring while the structure of the US labor
market was changing in other important ways. From World War II to the late 1970s, the relative
supply of college-educated workers rose substantially (Autor et al., 2008). The manufacturing
share of employment has declined consistently since World War II. Since 1980, there has been a
pronounced increase in wage inequality and job polarization–employment and wage gains in low and
high skilled occupations relative to middle skill occupations–both of which have been attributed
by many researchers to technological change (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Job suburbanization
may have occurred as part of a joint process with these and other fundamental changes in the
labor market, which would complicate teasing out the causal implications of suburbanization. In
this section, I explore whether job suburbanization is associated with changes in the types of work
performed in the labor market.
   To evaluate the importance of sector shifts associated with job suburbanization, I test whether
MSAs that experience greater job suburbanization also experience relative growth in the sectors
that disproportionately employed whites or blacks in 1970. For each MSA by major industry pair, I
estimate the share of workers in 1970 that are black. I then predict the black share of the workforce
in subsequent decades by taking a weighted average of these 1970 black shares, weighting by the
share of workers in each major industry and MSA in that decade.
   Figure 5 plots changes in log π cc from 1970 to 1980 (Panel A) and 1970 to 2000 (Panel B) against
predicted changes in the black share of the workforce. In both cases, the relationship is statistically
insignificant at the 5% level. Moreover, the sign flips from negative from 1970 to 1980 to positive
from 1970 to 2000. Again, the results are similar if I group by occupation rather than industry.
Job suburbanization is not associated with quantitatively important sector shifts. I document this
finding in more detail in the Appendix.
   Overall, there is little discernible relationship between job suburbanization and changes in job
composition across MSAs over this period. This suggests the baseline results in 4.2 are not driven
by changes in job composition. I confirm this directly as a robustness check. In Appendix Table A6,
I add control for changes in job composition to equation (3). In particular, I control for predicted
changes in the black share of the workforce based on changes in industry or occupation composition,
as constructed in section 4.4. Indeed, including these controls does not materially affect the results.
Moreover, the fact that job suburbanization is unrelated to overall skill upgrading suggests that the
results in Table 5 are a within-skill group phenomenon. Appendix Table A5 confirms this. The β B

4.5     Highways as Source of Variation
Unobserved shocks to the productivity of black workers could induce firms to migrate and produce
black employment declines, even in the absence of a spatial mismatch mechanism. For example,
the emergence of crack cocaine markets in the 1980’s and 1990’s could potentially explain both
the deterioration of some black communities and the relocation of employers from the central city
(Evans et al., 2016).
   To test whether the observed relationship between job suburbanization and declines in black
relative employment is driven entirely by such productivity shocks, I require an instrument for job
suburbanization that is plausibly orthogonal to such shocks. More generally, the ideal instrument
would satisfy an exclusion restriction: it would only (potentially) affect black employment by
changing the spatial distribution of work.
   To instrument for job suburbanization, I exploit a previously used source of variation in sub-
urbanization: the interstate highway system (Baum-Snow, 2007; Michaels, 2008). This instrument
is imperfect: research has documented that highways have a variety of effects on the labor mar-
ket, which I describe in section 4.5.1, and it is possible that they affect black relative employment
through channels other than the spatial distribution of work. However, I argue that they are ex-
ogenous to labor demand and supply shocks that would disproportionately affect black workers,
the most concerning omitted variables. I also study the reduced form effects of highways on black
relative employment.

4.5.1    Prior Research

Baum-Snow (2007) documents that the U.S. interstate highway system played an important role
in post-war residential suburbanization. With nearly all construction occurring between 1956 and
1980, the interstate highway system would ultimately span over 40,000 miles. The highway system
was originally designed to connect major metropolitan areas, serve U.S. national defense, and
connect major routes in Canada and Mexico. Using plausibly exogenous variation in highway
construction across MSAs, Baum-Snow (2007) finds that one new highway passing through a central
city reduces its population from 1950 to 1990 by about 18%. These effects are substantial: they
imply that the interstate highway system accounts for about 1/3 of the decline in central city
population relative to total MSA growth over this period. Using the same identification strategy,
Baum-Snow (2014) finds that highways also caused substantial job suburbanization.
   Highways can potentially increase suburbanization through several mechanisms. First, they
decrease transportation costs for both firms and households. For firms, highways make physical
proximity to other transportation hubs (e.g. ports and rail stations) and upstream or downstream
firms less important, allowing them to take advantage of cheaper land and other suburban amenities.
Michaels (2008) argues that, as highway construction was nearing completion, trucks became the

                                                 28
primary mode of shipping goods within the United States. For households, highways reduce the
costs of commuting to central work and access to other central city amenities from a suburban
residence. These direct effects on transportation costs may also have feedback effects. By increasing
the number of firms and households in the suburbs, they make these areas more attractive for
other firms and households. Firms may follow suburbanizing workers and achieve agglomeration
economies in the suburbs.
   In addition, interstate highways had other important effects on local economies. Michaels (2008)
shows that highways increased trade for exposed rural counties and raised the relative demand for
skilled manufacturing workers in skill-abundant rural counties while reducing it elsewhere. Duran-
ton et al. (2014) find that highways lead cities to increase the weight of their exports and specialize
in sectors producing heavy goods. Duraton and Turner (2012) find that interstate highways increase
MSA growth from 1983 to 2003.
   Building the interstate highway system also forced the destruction of neighborhoods and dis-
placement of households, particularly in central cities. There is evidence that black households
faced a disproportionate share of displacements, and that local planners exploited interstate con-
struction as an opportunity to eliminate poor, “blighted”, and often black communities (Rose and
Mohl, 2012). This suggests another channel through which the interstate highways system may
affect black relative employment rates, potentially violating the exclusion restriction. However,
more than 90% of interstate-central city intersections in the MSAs I study were already built by
1970. Hence, the effects of neighborhood clearances should already be reflected in baseline labor
market outcomes. For the analysis below, my measure of MSA highway exposure is the stock of
interstate highway rays emanating from the central city in 1970.

4.5.2   Background: The Federal Highway Act of 1944

A potential concern with exploiting variation derived from the interstate highway system is that
highway assignment may be determined endogenously. As Baum-Snow (2007) notes, the interstate
highway system was likely in part designed to facilitate local commuting and local economic devel-
opment in particular regions. The highway system might have also been designed accounting for
productivity shocks to black workers in the 1970’s, though this seems less plausible. Still, actual
highway construction across MSAs may be related to counterfactual MSA-level outcomes. To deal
with this, I instrument for realized highway construction using the 1947 federal interstate highway
plan as in Baum-Snow (2007) and other work.
   In 1937, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration began to plan an interstate highway system.
In their recommended highway plan, the National Interregional Highway committee considered the
distribution of population, manufacturing activity, agricultural production, the location of post-
World War II employment, a strategic highway network drawn up by the War Department in 1941,
the location of military and naval establishments, and interregional traffic demand, in that order.
This led to the Federal Highway Act of 1944, which instructed the roads commissioner to develop an
initial plan for a national interstate highway system. As specified by the legislation, the highways


                                                  29
in the planned system were to be “... so located as to connect by routes as direct as practicable,
the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers, to serve the national defense, and to
connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in the Dominion of Canada
and the Republic of Mexico...” (as cited in Baum-Snow, 2007). Importantly, the legislation makes
no mention of local commuting or local economic development. The final plan produced under this
Act, approved in 1947, is presented in Appendix Figure A3.
       Major funding for the interstate highway system began with the Federal Highway Acts of 1956.
The 1956 Interstate Highway Act expanded the 1947 plan and committed the federal government
to pay 90 percent of the cost of construction. In particular, the 1956 plan incorporated additional
highways that were designed for local purposes like commuting and development. Therefore, in
some specifications I instrument for actual highway rays using highway rays planned in 1947. The
first stage t-statistic is in excess of 5.

4.5.3       Empirical Strategy and Results

To begin, I explore the relationship between highways and several key outcomes: job suburbaniza-
tion, residential suburbanization, and job composition. In all subsequent analyses, my measure of
highway exposure is the number of interstate highway rays emanating from the central city in 1970.
To determine the relationship between highways and job suburbanization, I estimate specifications
of the following form, where again coefficients can differ by race:
                                X
                      ∆Ymg =       αg + γ1 rays1970
                                                m   + γ2 radiusm + f (emp1970 )mg + Xm γ3
                                          !                                                       (6)
                                + Iblack × γ1B rays1970
                                                   m    + γ2B radiusm + +Xm γ3B + ǫmg

where rays1970
          m    denotes the number highway rays emanating from the central city of MSA m in 1970
and radiusm is the radius of the central city, a key control in the analysis of Baum-Snow (2007).
Intuitively, one must control for central city radius because it determines the extent to which sprawl
is reflected in suburbanization measures, and highways are more likely to travel through central
cities that are physically larger. Note that the average number of central city highway rays in 1970,
weighted by the sample population size, is 3.9; the unweighted average is 3.23
       As in Table 4, I begin by relating highways to pre-period changes in employment rates and
baseline cell and MSA characteristics. The results are presented in Appendix Table A7. There is
no relationship between an MSA’s highway stock in 1970 and cell-level changes in employment rates
from 1965 to 1970. Notably, highway assignment has little relationship with an MSA’s racial com-
position in 1970. Similarly, Baum-Snow (2007) finds that planned and actual highway construction
has little relationship with an MSA’s racial composition in 1950.
       Table 8 Panel A presents estimates of (6) where the outcome is ∆m log(π cc ). I find that the
stock of highways in 1970 predicts job suburbanization thereafter. In odd specifications I use actual
interstate highway rays constructed as the explanatory variable of interest; in even specifications I
  23
       Note that if a highway passes through a central city, this counts as 2 rays.

instrument for highways constructed using highway rays included in the 1947 plan. In all columns,
t0 is 1970, while t1 is 1980 in columns (1) and (2), 1990 in columns (3) and (4), and 2000 in columns
(5) and (6). In the baseline OLS specification, one highway ray emanating from the central city
is associated with a 3.5%, 5.8%, and 7.2% decrease in the fraction of MSA jobs located in the
central city by 1980, 1990, and 2000. When I instrument for highways, the point estimates increase
somewhat, particular when weighting by black population, though they are less precise.
       In the Appendix, I show that highway rays predict the suburbanization of white households, but
not black households. Each ray leads to a 4.7%, 8.2%, and 10.2% decline in the central city share
of the white population by 1980, 1990, and 2000. By contrast, highways lead to only a negligible
decline in the central city share of the black population. This disparity is consistent with a central
premise of the spatial mismatch hypothesis: black households faced significant additional barriers
to suburban residence over this period. Highway rays also increase subsequent segregation, with
each ray predicting an increase of 0.01, 0.045, and 0.053 point increase in a city’s dissimilarity index
by 1980, 1990, and 2000. Finally, I show highways predict only negligible changes in local industry
mix and predicted changes in the black share of the workforce as measured in section 4.4.
       Finally, I estimate the reduced form effect of highways on black relative employment and earn-
ings. I estimate specifications of the same form as (6), where Y is now log employment rate or log
earnings.
       I present estimates in Table 8 Panel B and Panel C. Odd specifications are OLS models, while
I instrument for highways in even specifications. All specifications include a quadratic in baseline
employment. The pattern of coefficients is consistent across specifications and outcomes. While
highways predict increases in the employment rates and earnings of whites, consistent with Duraton
and Turner (2012), they predict relative decreases in these labor market outcomes for blacks. For
the employment outcomes, the magnitudes of the coefficients are stable across specifications. In
the OLS models, each additional highway ray predicts a 1% increase in white employment rates,
but about 2% relative decline in black employment. Coefficients from the IV models are similar.
Strikingly, while a racial gap in employment rates emerges from 1970 to 1980, the gap remains
roughly constant through 2000. As in section 4.2, the magnitude of the coefficients in the earnings

       Highway construction causes job suburbanization and increases the gap in employment rates
between white workers and black workers. In Table 8 I also include IV estimates for β and β B ,
where I instrument for job suburbanization using highway rays or planned rays. In specifications
corresponding to columns (1), (3), (5), and (6), the first stage (Panel A of Table 8) Angrist-Pischke
F-statistics exceed 10, allaying concerns over weak identification in these models (Angrist and
Pischke, 2009).24 Columns (5) and (6) indicate that, for every 10% decrease in the fraction of jobs
located in the central city induced by highways from 1970 to 2000, black employment rates decline
by 2.4 to 2.5% relative to white employment rates. While job suburbanization might not be the

only mechanism through which highways affect relative employment rates, labor supply shocks are
unlikely to be an alternative and changes in labor demand are also unlikely to be a significant
channel. Yet the relationship between job suburbanization and black employment suggested here
is comparable to the baseline estimates from section 4.2. This corroborates a causal interpretation
of the relationship between job suburbanization and black employment.


5     Discussion
For several decades, spatial mismatch has been a commonly cited cause of persistently high black
unemployment. I describe the process of job suburbanization and estimate its effects on racial
labor market inequality. Exploiting variation in suburbanization across local labor markets from
1970 to 2000, I find that, conditional on job characteristics, blacks are ex-ante less likely than
whites to work in suburbs, and this segregation persists despite widespread job suburbanization.
Using synthetic panel methods, I find that for every 10% decrease in the fraction of MSA jobs
located in the central city, black relative employment rates declined by 1.6-2.3%. This relationship
holds within observable skill groups, and for both men and women. Relative earnings declined by
1.2 to 2.3%, though these estimates are less stable. Conversely, job suburbanization is unrelated
to other significant structural changes in the labor market that would predict changes in black
relative employment rates. Instrumenting for suburbanization using central city intersections with
the interstate highway system yields similar estimates, corroborating a causal interpretation.
     To evaluate the importance of job suburbanization in producing labor market inequality over this
period, I use the estimated coefficients to examine the overall contribution of job suburbanization
to realized changes in relative employment rates among working age men. From 1970 to 2000, the
proportion of black men ages 24-64 living in the MSAs analyzed here that were employed or in
school decreased from 0.822 to 0.684. For white men, the proportion decreased from 0.913 to 0.863.
Hence, the employment rate for black men declined by 11.3% more than the employment rate for
white men. Given that the fraction of MSA jobs located in the central city declined by 29 log points
for the average black adult, a β B estimate of 1.6 to 2.3 implies that job suburbanization decreased
the black active share by about 4.8-6.9% relative to the white active share over this period, or
42-61% of the overall relative decline.

A      Appendix (For Online Publication)
A.1     Establishment Relocations and Occupational Composition
While the sharp pattern in Figure 2 suggests that relocation causes a decline in the black share of
employees, it is possible that change in the racial composition of employees are driven by coincident
changes within the establishment rather than the relocation per se. In particular, the types of work
performed at an establishment may change following relocation in a way that would affect the racial
composition of employees. In the appendix, I apply an event study research design analogous to (2)
where the outcome is the share of an establishment’s employees in a given occupation. Following
Acemoglu and Autor (2011), I divide the occupation groups defined in the EEO-1 data into three
skill groups: high, middle, and low. I label officials and managers, professionals, and technicians as
“high skill”; sales workers, administrative support workers, craft workers, and operatives as “middle
skill”; and laborers/helpers and service workers as “low skill.” I plot the θ coefficients in Figure A1.
While there appears to be a slight increase in the share of workers in high skill occupations following
relocation, the magnitude is small–at most 1 percentage point–and statistically indistinguishable
from zero in most years following relocation.

A.2     Job Suburbanization and Sector Composition
First, I test whether MSAs that experienced greater job suburbanization also realized differential
growth. Figure A2 plots changes in log π cc from 1970 to 1980 (Panel A) and 1970 to 2000 (Panel B)
against changes in log total MSA employment, and a line depicting the estimated linear relationship
from a regression weighted by each MSA’s total population in 1970. There is little discernible
relationship between suburbanization and growth. The correlation is 0.003 from 1970 to 1980 and
-0.068 from 1970 to 2000 and statistically insignificant at the 10% level in both cases.
    Second, I investigate whether MSAs that experienced greater job suburbanization also experi-
enced sector shifts that differed from other MSAs. For example, I examine whether manufacturing
shrank substantially more in high suburbanization MSAs. To do this, I estimate models of the form
                                                              X
                  ∆log(employment)im = αi + αm +                     βj ∆log(π cc )m × 1(g(i)=j) + ǫim              (A.7)
                                                                 j


where i indexes industries (or occupations) and m indexes MSAs, so that (employment)im is total
employment in sector i in MSA m. αi and αm are sector and MSA fixed effects, while 1(g(i)=j)
is an indicator for industry i belonging to major industry category j.25 Hence, the βj coefficients
reflect the extent that industries in group j differentially grow or shrink in MSAs with high values
of log(π cc ) (low suburbanization). As a parsimonious way of describing the additional explanatory
  25
     The major industry categories I use are: (1) agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) mining; (3) construction;
(4) nondurable goods manufacturing; (5) durable goods manufacturing; (6) transportation, communications, and
other public utilities; (7) wholesale trade; (8) retail trade; (9) finance, insurance, and real estate; (10) business and
repair services; (11) personal, entertainment, and recreation services; (12) profession services, health; (13) professional
services, education; (14) professional services, other; and (15) public administration.

power of job suburbanization, I report the adjusted R2 from regressions of the form of equation
(A.7) with a varying set of controls. The results are presented in Panel A of Table A4. In columns
(1)-(4) the changes are over 1970 to 1980; in columns (5)-(8) the changes are over 1970 to 2000.
Even columns include job suburbanization as an explanatory variable. While the βj coefficients are
typically jointly significant, job suburbanization has very little additional explanatory power for
sector shifts within MSAs. The inclusion of ∆ log(π cc ) interactions leaves the adjusted R2 virtually
unchanged. The results are similar if I group by occupation rather than industry.

A.3    Highways, Residential Suburbanization, and Sector Composition
To determine the relationship between highways and residential suburbanization and segregation,
I estimate MSA-level regressions rather than group-level regressions. I do this because I cannot
observe whether individuals live in the central city in the 1970 Census. Instead, I use population
data from the County and City Data Books (CCDB), which report decennial Census data aggre-
gated to counties and cities of at least 25000 inhabitants. For the household suburbanization and
segregation analysis, I estimate specifications of the following form:

                                ∆Ym = δ1 rays1970
                                             m    + δ2 radiuscc
                                                             m + ǫm                              (A.8)

                            cc , where π cc is the fraction of an MSA’s population living in the
where Y denotes either log πres         res
central city, or the dissimilarity index. I estimate this model for the whole population and separately
by race when the outcome is household suburbanization.
   I present estimates in Appendix Table A8. Again, actual interstate highway rays constructed is
the explanatory variable in odd columns, while highway rays are instrumented using planned rays
in even columns. Highway rays predict the suburbanization of white households, but not black
households. This disparity is consistent with a central premise of the spatial mismatch hypothesis:
black households faced significant additional barriers to suburban residence over this period. Each
ray predicts a 4.7%, 8.2%, and 10.2% decline in the central city share of the white population
by 1980, 1990, and 2000. By contrast, highways predict only a negligible decline in the black
population. The effects are more negative when I instrument for highway construction, though
the effect on the black central city population remains statistically insignificant. This is consistent
with the premise that black households faced significant additional barriers to suburban residence.
Highway rays increase subsequent segregation, with each ray predicting an increase of 0.010, 0.045,
and 0.053 point increase in a city’s dissimilarity index.
   In Appendix Table A9 the outcome is predicted changes in the black share of the workforce,
as constructed in section 4.4. When using industry weights, there is little relationship between
highways and predicted changes in the black share of the workforce. When using occupation
weights, a slight, negative relationship emerges in 1980’s. This effect is marginally significant in
OLS specifications, though the magnitude is substantially smaller than the employment effects
documented in Table 8. The employment effects also first emerge earlier in the 1970-1980 period.

Notes: These figures plot event study coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (dotted) estimated using model (2)
for different outcome variables. The models are estimated using all establishments that relocate from the central
city to the suburbs and whose distance from the central business district increases by at least 5 miles. In Panel
A the outcome is the fraction of establishment jobs that are high skill occupations; in Panel B the outcome is the
fraction of establishment jobs that are middle skill occupations. The coefficient for the year prior to the event (θ−1 )
is normalized to zero. Estimated models include Census division by year fixed effects and log establishment size as
controls. Standard errors are clustered at the establishment level.

 Notes: Table displays estimates of equation (A.8) where the outcome is predicted changes in the black
 share of the workforce. Predictions for the black share of the workforce are constructed based on the racial
 composition of different industries (Panel A) or occupations (Panel B) in different MSAs in 1970, and
 changes in each MSA’s industry or occupation composition over time. See section 4.4 for further details.
 All models include controls for central city radius.
