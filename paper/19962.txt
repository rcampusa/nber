German-Jewish Emigres and U.S. Invention

                                            ABSTRACT

Historical accounts suggest that Jewish émigrés from Nazi Germany revolutionized U.S. science. To
analyze the émigrés’ effects on chemical innovation in the U.S. we compare changes in patenting by
U.S. inventors in research fields of émigrés with fields of other German chemists. Patenting by U.S.
inventors increased by 31 percent in émigré fields. Regressions that instrument for émigré fields with
pre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists confirm a substantial increase in U.S. invention. Inventor-
level data indicate that émigrés encouraged innovation by attracting new researchers to their fields,
rather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent inventors.

Historical accounts suggest that German Jewish scientists who fled from Nazi Germany
revolutionized U.S. innovation. By 1944, more than 133,000 German Jewish émigrés found
refuge in the United States. Most of them were urban white-collar workers; one fifth were
university graduates. The National Refugee Service listed roughly 900 lawyers, 2,000
physicians, 1,500 writers, 1,500 musicians, and 2,400 academics (Sachar 1992, p. 495-496;
Möller 1984, p. 1). In physics, émigrés such as Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, Edward Teller,
John von Neumann, and Hans Bethe formed the core of the Manhattan project that developed
the atomic bomb. In chemistry, émigrés such as Otto Meyerhof (Nobel Prize 1922), Otto
Stern (Nobel Prize 1943), Otto Loewi (Nobel Prize 1936), Max Bergmann, Carl Neuberg, and
Kasimir Fajans
    “soon effected hardly less than a revolution…their work on the structures of proteins and
    amino acids, on metabolic pathways and genetics, almost immediately propelled the
    United States to world leadership in the chemistry of life” (Sachar 1992, p. 749).

       Alternative accounts, however, indicate that the émigrés’ contributions may have been
limited as a result of administrative hurdles and anti-Semitism. Jewish scientists met with a
“Kafkaesque gridlock of seeking affidavits from relatives in America, visas from less-than-
friendly United States consuls” (Sachar 1992, p. 495). 1 Once they were in the United States,
a rising wave of anti-Semitism made it difficult for them to find employment; in “the hungry
1930s, antisemitism (sic) was a fact of life among American universities as in other sectors of
the U.S. economy” (Sachar 1992, p. 498). 2
       This paper presents the first systematic empirical analysis of the effects of German
Jewish émigrés on U.S. innovation. Analyses of present-day immigrants to the United States,
which exploit geographic variation in the exposure to immigrants, yield ambiguous results.
State-level variation of contemporary data indicates that college-educated immigrants may
encourage patenting among natives (Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle 2010). Analyses at the city-
level, however, suggest no significant effect (Kerr and Lincoln 2010).
       A significant challenge to analyses of geographic variation is that immigrants may
choose to live in more innovative regions, so that estimates may overstate immigrants’ effects


1
  With the outbreak of the war, refugees became subject to stringent affidavit requirements, including guarantees
of substantial cash deposits in American banks. Barely 10 percent of Jews on waiting lists were able to qualify.
In 1940, Washington further tightened its visa policy to avoid infiltration by “enemy agents” (Sachar 1992, p.
533).
2
  When émigré scholars eventually managed to find positions, their transition was not easy: “In the Germanic
tradition, they often appeared aloof and condescending, a style unfamiliar to the more democratic atmosphere of
American campus life” (Sachar 1992, p. 499).


                                                                                                                1
on innovation. To address this problem, Kerr and Lincoln (2010) instrument for the number
of immigrants per city by interacting variation in national grants of H1-B visas with city level
demand for immigrant workers. In an alternative approach, Borjas and Doran (2012) examine
effects of Soviet mathematicians on the research output of incumbent U.S. mathematicians by
comparing changes in publications by U.S. mathematicians for fields in which Soviet émigrés
were active with other fields. Their analysis suggests that incumbent U.S. mathematicians
published less after Soviet mathematicians arrived in the United States, possibly because
émigré and U.S. mathematicians competed for journal space and other resources, which were
fixed in the short run.
         Our analysis extends existing empirical tests by examining total changes in U.S.
research output, as well as changes for incumbents (which are the focus of Borjas and Doran
2012) and entrants to the fields of émigrés. Taking advantage of the fact that patents are a
good measure of innovation in chemistry, because chemical innovations are exceptionally
suitable to patent protection (e.g., Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2002; Moser 2012), we focus on
changes in chemical inventions. By comparison, the contributions of émigré physicists
(including those who worked on the Manhattan Project) are difficult to capture empirically
because they produced knowledge that was often classified and rarely patented. 3
         Difference-in-differences regressions compare changes in U.S. patenting by U.S.
inventors in research fields of German Jewish émigrés with changes in U.S. patenting by U.S.
inventors in fields of other German chemists. This approach allows us to control for a
potential increase in U.S. invention in fields where German chemists, who had dominated
chemical research in the early 20th century, were active inventors. Research fields are
measured at the level of 166 United States Patent Office (USPTO) technology classes that
include at least one patent by an academic chemist from Germany or Austria between 1920
and 1970. Baseline estimates indicate that the arrival of German Jewish émigrés led to a 31
percent increase in innovation after 1933 in the research fields of émigrés.


3
  Even for chemistry our analysis is limited to patented inventions, and many innovations, which benefitted from
the arrival of the émigrés may not have been patented. Moser (2005, 2012) addresses this challenge by
collecting data on innovations with and without patents from catalogues for international technology fairs
between 1851 and 1915. These data indicate that the share of chemical innovations that occurred inside the
patent system increased substantially in response to improvements in analytic methods, which reduced the
effectiveness of secrecy as an alternative mechanism to protect intellectual property and made it easier to codify
chemical inventions (Moser 2012). For the late 20th century, inventor surveys indicate that chemicals and
pharmaceuticals are the only industries in which inventors consider patents to be the most effective mechanism
to protect intellectual property (e.g. Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2002).



                                                                                                                2
        Baseline estimates may be biased if the United States attracted more productive
scientists or if the émigrés were more likely to work in research fields in which U.S. inventors
would become more productive. 4 Historical evidence, however, suggests that émigrés to the
United States may have been negatively selected, because Britain, which was geographically
and culturally closer to the German university system, was the first refuge for many émigrés
(Ambrose 2001, p.215), and established universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, were
keen to offer employment to the most prominent dismissed German scientists. 5
        Historical accounts also suggest that selection into research fields may have been
negative because anti-Semitism in the United States restricted access to the most promising
fields. For example, the U.S. chemical firm Du Pont rejected the “father” of modern
biochemistry Carl Neuberg, because he “looked” too Jewish (Sachar 1992, p. 495).
According to Hounshell (1988, pp. 295-296) hiring practices in Du Pont’s Chemical
Department “were flawed in one important respect: A strong strain of anti-Semitism and
sexism prevailed.…” More generally, Deichmann (1999, p. 3) explains that “biochemists and
physical chemists were accepted at American universities, whereas organic chemists were
not.”
        To examine whether OLS regressions over- or under-estimate the émigrés’ effects, we
implement an instrumental variable analysis, which exploits the dismissal of Jewish scientists
by the Nazi government. On April 7, 1933 only 67 days after the Nazis assumed power in
Germany, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service required that “Civil
servants who are not of Aryan descent are to be placed in retirement” (Gesetz §3).
   “At a stroke, every Jew in Germany employed by the government or by state-sponsored
   local institutions was ordered to be dismissed from his or her post. From university
   professor to local postmistress, they all had to go…Prominence and reputation shielded no
   one, as over 1,200 Jewish academics were summarily dismissed” (Ambrose 2001, p. 20).

After the annexation of Austria in 1938, dismissals were extended to Austrian universities, so
that the term “German scientists” in this paper includes chemists from both countries.



4
  More generally, a Roy model of migration implies that more productive immigrants move to locations where
returns to skills exceed returns in their home country (Borjas 1987).
5
  Arnold Weissberger, for example, moved to Rochester only after he could not secure a university position in
Britain and was deemed “unsuitable for industry.” Another prominent scientist who worked with Weissberger at
Kodak, Gertrud Kornfeld, had studied photochemistry and reaction kinetics as a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Berlin in 1933. Kornfeld first tried to find a position in England, and when this failed moved to
Vienna on a fellowship of the American Association of University Women and from there to the United States
(Deichman 2005, p. 585-586).


                                                                                                             3
        IV regressions use the pre-1933 fields of dismissed chemists as an instrument for the
fields of émigrés to the United States. Pre-1933 research fields were determined before the
Nazis' rise to power and did not depend on expectations about the types of research that
would become productive in the United States after 1933. Consistent with historical accounts
of negative selection, IV estimates imply a 71 percent increase in patenting, which implies
that OLS estimates under-, rather than overestimate the true effects of the émigrés on U.S.
invention.
        Results are robust to a broad range of alternative specifications, including count data
models, regressions with citation-weighted patents as a quality-adjusted measure of patenting,
and alternative definitions of the post-period. The most significant decline in the estimated
effects occurs when we control for class-specific linear pre-trends in patenting.
        In the second part of the analysis, we investigate the mechanism by which the
émigrés’ arrival encouraged innovation in the United States, using a new data set on the
patent histories of all U.S. inventors in the 166 classes of chemical invention. 6 This analysis
indicates that the arrival of the émigrés encouraged U.S. invention by helping to attract
domestic inventors to the research fields of émigrés, rather than by increasing the productivity
of incumbent U.S. inventors. Moreover, data on the prior patent histories of entrants indicate
that the majority of entrants to the fields of émigrés had never patented in the 166 classes in
our data before, suggesting that the émigrés’ arrival affected an overall increase in invention,
rather than a shift across fields.
        The data also indicate that the effects of the émigrés on U.S. invention may have been
amplified and made more persistent through the networks of their co-inventors, which we
identify from patent documents. Analyses of contemporary data indicate that researchers in
the life sciences benefitted greatly from collaborations with prominent scientists (Azoulay,
Graff Zivin, and Wang 2010). In the case of German Jewish émigrés, co-inventors of émigrés
became active patentees in the fields of émigrés especially after 1940, and continued
patenting through the 1950s. These patterns suggest that a natural delay in the transmission
of knowledge from émigré professors to their U.S. collaborators influenced the timing of the
increase in U.S. invention. In addition to co-inventors of the émigré professors, co-inventors
of co-inventors of the émigrés also substantially increased their inventive activity in émigré



6
 This new data set covers inventors on U.S. patents between 1920 and 1970. For more recent U.S. patent issues,
between 1975 and 2010, Lai et al. (2011) have created data on inventor identity and networks of co-inventors.


                                                                                                            4
fields after 1933, and remained substantially more productive throughout the 1950s and
1960s.
         Finally, in interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind that we only
observe a small, albeit exceptionally prominent segment of the total flow of German Jewish
immigrants to the United States. As a first step towards investigating the effects of this
broader flow, we document the research activities of a group of more junior German chemists,
who had not yet become professors at German universities. Patent data indicate that these
more junior scientists were active in the research fields of émigré professors, suggesting that
the fields of émigré professors are a useful proxy for the fields of a broader movement of
German Jewish émigrés.


I. THE DATA
      To perform this analysis, we have collected new data sets to measure aggregate changes
in U.S. patenting across research fields and to investigate changes in research output at the
level of individual U.S. inventors. The first data set measures changes in U.S. patents per
year across research fields that were differentially affected by the arrival of German Jewish
chemists; these data include 1,365,689 U.S. patents by U.S inventors between 1920 and 1970.
Research fields are measured at the level of 166 United States Patent Office (USPTO)
technology classes; 60 of these classes include patented inventions by German Jewish
émigrés to the United States. The second data set captures changes in patenting for individual
U.S. inventors across research fields with varying levels of exposure to the arrival of the
German Jewish émigrés; these data allow us to examine changes in the productivity of
incumbent U.S. inventors and measure changes in entry across research fields.


A. Émigré and other chemistry professors at German and Austrian universities
      To capture all 535 chemistry professors and postdoctoral fellows (privatdozent) at
German and Austrian universities, we use data from faculty directories in the Kalender der
Deutschen Universitäten und Hochschulen 1932/33, 1933, and Kürschners Deutscher
Gelehrtenkalender, 1931. Names of dismissed professors were drawn from the List of
Displaced German Scholars (1937), which the U.K.-based Emergency Alliance of German




                                                                                                  5
Scholars Abroad created to help dismissed scientists find employment abroad. 7 The List
includes German chemistry professors, such as
    BERL, Dr. Ernst, o. Professor; b. 77. (English.) 1916/19: Privatdozent, Technische
    Hochschule, Vienna; 1919.33: O. Prof. Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt; since 1934:
    Research Prof. Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh. Spec.: Inorganic Chem.;
    Organic Chem.; Technology; Heavy Chemicals and Derivatives; Cellulose. Perm.

Additional data from Deichmann (2001), Strauss et al. (1983), and Kröner (1983) allow us to
identify chemists who were dismissed from Austrian universities after the annexation of
Austria in 1938, and chemists who had died before the List was published in 1937.
      Overall, ninety-three chemists, 17.4 percent of all German and Austrian professors in
chemistry, were dismissed between 1933 and 1941. Eighty-seven percent of dismissed
chemists were Jewish (Deichmann 2001); most of the remaining dismissed had a Jewish
spouse. A small number of scientists who “based on their previous political activities cannot
guarantee that they have always unreservedly supported the national state,” (Gesetz §4), were
dismissed as well. 8
        To identify German Jewish émigrés to the United States, we have collected the
employment histories for all dismissed scholars, as well as their birth and death years from
the International Biographical Dictionary of Central European Émigrés 1933 - 1945 (Strauss
et. al. 1983), and from obituaries in the New York Times. We count any dismissed scholar
who was professionally active in the United States as a German Jewish émigré to the United
States; this yields a total of 26 émigrés. 9 Biographical information confirms anecdotal
evidence that émigrés to the United States were younger than other dismissed scholars. In
1933, the average émigré chemist was 45.4 years old, compared to 49.2 years for other
dismissed professors.


B. U.S. patents of émigré and other German professors (1920-1970)
      To identify the research fields of all German chemistry professors, we collect the U.S.


7
  Waldinger (2010, 2012, 2013) has used these data to measure the effects of dismissals on German universities.
Dismissals had negative effects on Ph.D. student outcomes (Waldinger, 2010). Departments with dismissals
also experienced large and persistent declines in research output (Waldinger 2013). This decline was driven by a
fall in the quality of hires and not by localized productivity spillovers (Waldinger, 2012).
8
  Jewish professors who had been civil servants since 1914, fought in World War I, or lost a father or son in the
war, were exempt in 1933, but were dismissed after 1935.
9
  Of the remaining dismissed German chemists, 26 became professionally active in the United Kingdom, 6 in
Latin America, 5, each in Palestine and Turkey, 4, each in Scandinavia and Switzerland, 3, each in France and
Canada, and 2 in Belgium and the Netherlands.


                                                                                                               6
patents that were issued to each of the 535 German chemistry professors between 1920 and
1970 by searching USPTO patent documents through Google Patents
(www.patents.google.com). For example, a search for “Arnold Weissberger” yields
     USPTO 2,350,127, issued on May 30, 1944, application filed September 26, 1940,
     Inventors: Henry Dudley Porter and Arnold Weissberger, Rochester N.Y., Assignors to
     Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester N.Y., for a “method of forming sulphonic acid
     chlorides of couplers groups.”

For each patent we compare the description of the invention, the date of the patent application
and the location of the patentee with the employment histories and the life span of the German
chemist to ensure that the patent is a match. 10
         This process yields a total of 946 U.S. patents between 1920 and 1970, including 282
patents by 43 dismissed German chemists and 157 patents by 13 German Jewish émigrés to
the United States. Until 1932, émigrés patented few inventions in the United States, with an
average of 0.46 patents per year between 1920 and 1932 (Figure 1). After 1933, émigrés to
the United States began to patent more in the United States. U.S. patents of émigrés increase
from less than 5 per year until 1940, to roughly 10 patents per year until the early 1950s; in
terms of application years, this implies an increase in patenting around 1937. Émigrés began
to patent less in the mid 1950s, when the average émigré was approaching retirement. By
comparison, U.S. patents of other (non-émigré) German chemists began to increase in the
1920s, reaching more than 40 patents per year in 1934. U.S. patents by other German
chemists declined after the United States entered World War II on December 11, 1941, and
remained low in the immediate aftermath of the war, but recovered in the late 1950s.


[FIGURE 1 approximately here]


       U.S. patents by dismissed German chemists increased from 7 per year between the mid
1920s and 1942 to 10 and above in the 1940s; similar to U.S. patents of émigré chemists, U.S.
patents by dismissed chemists began to decline in the mid 1950s, when dismissed professors
were roughly 70 years old (Figure 1).


10
   A search for common names like Hermann Fischer (a lecturer at the University of Berlin in 1933) yields
patents by other inventors, which we eliminate by examining each patent. Hermann was the 6th most popular
first name when Fischer was born and Fischer is the 4th most common last name in Germany today (Duden, 2000
and www.beliebte-vornamen.de). Only eight dismissed professors have both a first and last name that is among
the top 50 most common German names.


                                                                                                          7
C. Matching patents with USPTO classes
       To measure the effects of the immigrant chemists across fields of U.S. invention, we use
the U.S. patents of German chemists to identify their research fields, measured at the level of
main classes within the USPTO system of classifying inventions. For example, Ernst Berl’s
patent 2,000,815 on May 7, 1935, was assigned to class 205
     ”Electrolysis: Processes, Compositions Used Therein, and Methods of Preparing the
     Compositions”11

       The U.S. patents of German chemists span 166 USPTO classes, including 60 classes
that include at least one patent by an émigré and 106 control classes that include patents by
other German chemists, but not the émigrés. Forty-nine USPTO classes include pre-1933
patents by at least one dismissed chemist; we use these classes to instrument for the 60 classes
that include patents by at least one émigré (Table 1).


D. U.S. patents by U.S. inventors per class and year
       To measure changes in U.S invention across research fields that were differentially
affected by the arrival of German Jewish émigrés, we collect all U.S. patents in the 166
classes with patents by German chemists between 1920 and 1970 from the USPTO database
U.S. Patent Master Classification File. 12 To separate U.S. inventors from foreign inventors,
we develop an algorithm to search for the inventors’ country of origin in the full text of all
U.S. patents that were issued between 1920 and 1970; we access text files of these patents
through Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Text (1920-1979). 13
       The dependent variable measures the number of U.S. patents that are issued to U.S.
inventors in a given class and year. To measure the émigrés’ effect on U.S. inventors net of
changes in the émigrés’ own patenting activity we exclude patents by émigrés from counts of
domestic U.S. patents. Issue dates are available directly from the USPTO. 14 For the 946 U.S.
patents of German and Austrian chemists, we also examine the full text of each patent

11
   Class 205 is the primary class for this patent; 51 percent of patents are also assigned to a cross-reference class.
We include both types of classes, but results are robust to limiting the sample to primary classes. See Lampe
and Moser (2012) for additional detail on patenting in cross-reference subclasses as a measure of innovation.

   To assess measurement error as a result of OCR, we compare our search results with nationality data in the
NBER patent data for years between 1963 and 1970, which are covered by both data sets (the NBER patent data
is available at http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~bhhall). This comparison suggests that measurement error is relatively
small. For example, 98 percent of patents that we assign to U.K. inventors are U.K. inventors in the NBER data.

patents are issued 3.3 years after the application, with a standard deviation of 2.0 years.


E. Individual level patent histories for U.S. patentees
       To examine the mechanism by which the arrival of émigré scientists may have
increased U.S invention, we collect a new data set to measure changes in the number of active
U.S. inventors across fields and over time, and document their patent histories in the fields of
German chemists. These data include unique identifiers for 964,526 inventors that are listed
on the 1,365,689 U.S. patents issued in the research fields of German chemists between 1920
and 1970, as well as information on the timing of their entry into patenting. This section
presents a brief summary of the data collection; the data appendix includes a more detailed
description.
       First, we develop an algorithm to extract strings of data, which contain the names of the
patentees, for all 1,365,689 U.S. patents issued between 1920 and 1970 in the 166 classes
with patents by German academic chemists. This algorithm uses regular expressions to
identify strings that are more likely to contain the inventor’s name. 15
       Then we clean the inventor data by correcting more than 3,300 common OCR errors
and removing more than 1,100 sub-strings that do not contain inventor names. For example,
a common mistake in current OCR software is to misread letters, such as “H” as “I-I,” or to
misspell names, such as “William” as “Williax.” We correct these misspellings by comparing
the original images of patent documents with the information that is listed in Google’s OCR
data, and create an algorithm that corrects these mistakes; this algorithm removes more than
3,300 common mistakes. We then append the algorithm to remove phrases (sub-strings) in
Google’s OCR data that the algorithm mistakenly assigns to names. For example,
misspellings of the term “United States Patent Office” may be counted as part of a name by
mistake. We examine the records for such misspellings and append the algorithm to remove
1,100 common errors of this type. We create another algorithm to separate co-inventors that
are listed together on a patent document. This algorithm uses first names as an indicator for
the beginning of the name of a separate inventor. It performs an automatic search for 3,439
common first names as listed in the U.S. Census of 1920 and in the U.S. Social Security

  The full text of patents is available in Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Text
1920-1979). Regular expressions are a mechanism to automatically identify strings of text, using patterns of
characters and words. See Aho (1990) for a detailed discussion of regular expressions.


                                                                                                               9
Records between 1900 and 1999 (see data appendix).
      Finally, we create unique inventor identifiers to track the patenting history of U.S.
inventors, using Levenshtein distances to define when two names are different enough to be
counted as separate inventors. 16 Levenshtein distances measure the minimum number of
insertions, deletions, or substitutions that are necessary to make two strings of characters
identical. This allows us to address minor remaining spelling errors, such as writing “Arnold
Weissberger” with a missing r as “Arnold Weissberge.” To allow for the fact that more
letters can be misspelled in longer names, we calculate a normalized Levenshtein distance by
dividing the number of necessary changes by the total number of letters in an inventor name.
For example, the absolute Levensthtein distance for the two spellings of Weissberger is one -
because one character has to be inserted to create a complete match - and the normalized
measure is 1/18, one letter has to be changed relative to 18 letters in the first name plus the
last name, plus one space. A match is defined as a character with a normalized Levensthein
measure below 0.2. We will use these data in section III, to investigate the mechanism by
which the German Jewish émigrés may have influenced U.S. innovation. In section II,
immediately below, we investigate whether the émigrés caused a significant increase in U.S.
innovation.


II. EFFECTS OF ÉMIGRÉS ON DOMESTIC INVENTION IN THE UNITED STATES
      In the first step of the analysis we compare changes in patenting by U.S. inventors in
research fields of German Jewish émigrés with changes in patenting in fields of other German
chemists. Summary statistics suggest a significant increase in U.S patenting in fields that
include at least one patent by an émigré. In USPTO classes with émigré patents, patents by
U.S. inventors nearly double after 1933, from 149.3 to 287.3 per class and year (Table 1,
column 2). By comparison, in USPTO classes with patents by other German chemists,
patents by U.S. inventors increase substantially less, from 218.4 to 248.6 per class and year
(Table 1, column 3).

Data on U.S. patents per field and year indicate a disproportionate increase in U.S. invention

after 1933 in research fields of émigrés compared with fields of other German chemists
(Figure 2A). Lower patent counts in émigré fields before 1933 are consistent with historical
accounts, which suggest that U.S. universities were more likely to accept German Jewish
émigrés in fields where U.S invention was weak (Deichman 1999, p. 3). Separating fields of
émigrés according to the number of émigré patents shows that fields with more émigré
patents experienced a larger increase in U.S. invention after 1933 (Figure 2B). The following
paragraphs present OLS and IV regressions to systematically investigate these changes.


[FIGURES 2A and 2B approximately here]


A. OLS estimates of changes in patents by U.S. inventors
       Baseline OLS regressions estimate
(1) Patents by U.S. inventorsc,t = α0 +ß émigré classc ⋅ postt + γ’ Xc,t +δt +fc +εc,t

where the dependent variable counts U.S. patents by domestic inventors in technology class c
and year t between 1920 and 1970. The indicator variable émigré classc equals 1 if
technology class c includes at least one patent between 1920 and 1970 by a German Jewish
émigré to the United States; the indicator variable postt equals 1 starting with the year when
dismissals first occurred in Germany (1933) and in Austria (1938). 17 USPTO technology
classes that include patents by other Germany chemists but not the émigrés form the control
group.
         The vector Xc,t includes three controls for variation in patenting at the level of research
fields and years. First, the variable # of foreign patents measures the total number of U.S.
patents in class c and year t by foreign inventors from countries that did not receive any
dismissed chemists. This helps control for unobservable factors, such as scientific
breakthroughs, that may have increased patenting by U.S. inventors independently of the
arrival of the émigrés. Second, the variable class age measures the number of years that have
passed since the first patent was issued in technology class c and its square; this helps control
for variation in the speed of invention across the life cycle of a technology. Third, the
indicator variable patent pools distinguishes technology classes in which competing firms


17
   As discussed above, Jewish professors were dismissed from Austrian universities after the annexation of
Austria in 1938. Thus, the indicator variable post equals 1 for years after 1932 for classes with patents by
émigrés from Germany and after 1937 for classes with patents by émigrés from Austria (but not Germany).



                                                                                                               11
agreed to pool their patents; it controls for a potential decline in innovation as a result of the
formation of a patent pool (Lampe and Moser 2012). 18 Year fixed effects δ control for
unobservable variation in patenting over time that is common across technologies, and class
fixed effects f control for unobservable variation in patenting across technologies that is
constant over time. 19
         OLS estimates imply that the arrival of émigré chemists increased U.S patenting by a
minimum of 31 percent. In classes that include at least one émigré patent, domestic inventors
produced 105.2 additional patents per year after 1933, compared with classes that include at
least one patent by another German chemist (Table 2, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
Controlling for the # of foreign patents reduces the estimated effect to 91.7 additional patents
per year; controlling for class age reduces the estimate to 84.8, and controlling for patent
pools further reduces the estimate to 75.4 (Table 2, columns 2-4, significant at 1 percent).
Compared with a mean of 240.9 patents per class and year in classes with patents by other
German chemists, the most conservative estimate of 75.4 implies a 31 percent increase in
domestic patenting.


[TABLE 2 approximately here]


         Additional specifications use variation in the count of émigré patents across USPTO
classes to measure the intensity of exposure to the émigrés:

(2) Patents by U.S. inventorsc,t = α0 +ß # émigré patentsc ⋅ postt + γ’ Xc,t + δt + fc + εc,t




18
   New Deal policies, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act (1933-35), which exempted the majority of
U.S. industries from antitrust regulation, created a favorable environment for pools and other types of
cooperative agreements in the 1930s. Patent data for 20 industries that formed pools between 1930 and 1938
suggest that the creation of a pool led to a decline in innovation, which was particularly pronounced if the pool
combined firms that had competed to improve substitute technologies before the pool had formed (Lampe and
Moser 2012).
19
   Results are robust to additional controls for research fields in which domestic invention benefitted from the
ability to access foreign-owned invention as a result of the Trading-with-the-Enemy Act (TWEA). After World
War I, domestic invention (measured by the number of U.S. patents by domestic inventors) increased by 20
percent in USPTO subclasses of chemical inventions in which the TWEA allowed U.S. firms to produce enemy-
owned inventions (Moser and Voena 2012).



                                                                                                              12
where # émigré patentsc measures the number of émigré patents between 1920 and 1970 in
class c. Estimates of these regressions imply an increase in U.S invention by 4 patents per
year for each additional émigré patent (Table 2, column 8, significant at 5 percent). 20
         Specifications that separately estimate effects according to the number of émigré
patents confirm that émigré fields with more patents by émigrés experienced a larger increase
in U.S. invention after 1933. 21 In classes with one patent by an émigré, U.S. inventors
patented 16.6 additional inventions per class and year after 1933 compared with fields by
other German chemists, but the effect is not statistically significant (Appendix Table A1,
column 2). In classes with two patents by émigrés, U.S. inventors patented 95.4 additional
inventions (Appendix Table A1, column 2, significant at 1 percent). In classes with three or
more patents by émigrés, U.S. inventors patented 129.6 additional inventions (Appendix
Table A1, column 2, significant at 1 percent).


B. Annual coefficients for years before and after 1933
         To investigate the timing of the increase in U.S. invention, we estimate the difference-
in-differences coefficient ßt separately for each year, allowing it to be different from zero
before 1933.

 (3) Patents by U.S. inventorsc,t = α0 + ∑1970
                                          𝑡𝑡=1920 ß𝑡𝑡 é𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚é 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 + γ’ Xc,t + δt + fc +


                                                       εc,t

where the variable yeart represents an indicator variable for each year between 1920 and
1970, and 1932 is the excluded category.
         Estimates of annual coefficients indicate that the observed increase in patenting cannot
be explained by differential pre-trends. Annual coefficients are close to zero before 1933 and
increase to the highest level in the 1950s and early 1960s (Figure 3). 22


         [FIGURE 3 approximately here]


20
   Results are robust to alternative definitions of the post-period, including specifications that define post to
begin in 1936 (reported below).
21
   Among 60 émigré classes, 24 classes include 1 émigré patent, 10 classes include 2 émigré patents, and 26
classes include three or more émigré patents.
22
   Figure 3 is the regression analog of Figure 2A, which plots the difference between average patents per year in
classes with and without émigré patents (Figure 2A). Differences between the two figures are driven primarily
by the inclusion of class fixed effects.


                                                                                                               13
        These results, which are consistent with a protracted adjustment process (Sachar
1992), indicate that unobservable factors that preceded the arrival of the émigrés are unlikely
to have been the driving force behind the increase in U.S. patenting. An additional set of
regressions controls for class-specific linear pre-trends in patenting:


 (4) Patents by U.S. inventorsc,t = α0 + ∑1970
                                           𝜏𝜏=1933 ß𝜏𝜏 é𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚é 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ⋅ 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝜏𝜏 +ηc⋅ t + γ’ Xc,t +
                                          δt + fc +υc,t

where we allow time trends t to differ for each of the 166 classes ηc (by including the
interaction term ηc⋅ t), and the variable yearτ represents an indicator variable for each year
between 1933 and 1970) Controlling for linear pre-trends leaves the point estimates
substantially unchanged but makes them less precise over time, so that many of the annual
coefficients are no longer statistically significant (Figure A1). An F-test statistic of 3.26,
however, rejects the joint hypothesis that all annual coefficients are equal to zero with a p-
value below 0.0001.


C. Pre-1933 fields of dismissed as an instrument – First stage
        Baseline OLS estimates may, however, be biased, if the United States attracted the
most productive émigrés, or if émigré scientists were attracted to more productive fields once
they had arrived in the United States. In fact, patent data indicate that USPTO classes with
émigré patents were on average four years younger than classes without émigré patents. In
1932, 84.6 years had passed since the first patent grant in the average émigré class, compared
with 88.7 years for other classes. A test for the equality of means rejects equality with a p-
value of 0.085 (Table 1, columns 2 and 3). Invention in younger research fields may have
increased independently of the émigrés.
        To address endogeneity, we use the pre-1933 patents of dismissed chemists to
instrument for the 1920-1970 patents of émigrés to the United States. This approach exploits
the fact that the research decisions of German Jewish chemists prior to their dismissal are
unlikely to have depended on their expectations about the types of research that would
become more productive in the United States after 1933.
        To examine whether the pre-1933 patents of dismissed chemists are a valid
instrument, we compare pre-1933 characteristics of classes with and without pre-1933 patents
of dismissed chemists. First, dismissed chemists may have worked in younger fields that



                                                                                                            14
experienced a more rapid increase in patenting after 1933. The data, however, reveal no
statistically significant differences for classes with and without pre-1933 patents of dismissed
chemists (at an average age of 87.4 years compared with 87.3 in 1932, with a p-value of 0.929
for the equality of means test, Table 1, columns 4 and 5). A related concern is that dismissed
chemists may have worked in more productive fields before 1933. To investigate this issue,
we compare counts of U.S. patents by foreign inventors in classes with and without pre-1932
patents of dismissed chemists. This comparison also reveals no significant differences. If
anything, classes with pre-1933 patents of dismissed chemists attracted slightly fewer foreign
patentees until 1933, but this difference is not statistically significant (with 0.70 versus 1.01
U.S. patents by foreign inventors and a p-value of 0.216).
       First-stage regressions estimate:

(5) Émigré classc ⋅ postt = ζ0 +φ pre-1933 dismissed classc ⋅ postt + θ’ Xc,t + λt + µc + υc,t

A coefficient of 0.339 for the variable pre-1933 dismissed classc ⋅ postt and an F-statistic on
the excluded instrument of 18.25 (Table 3, column 2) confirms that pre-1933 fields of
dismissed chemists are a strong predictor for fields of émigrés. An analogous first-stage
regression uses the number of pre-1933 patents by dismissed chemists in class c as an
instrument for the number of patents by émigrés in class c. For this regression, the coefficient
is 1.303, and the F-statistic on the instrument is 8.99 (Table 3, column 4).


[TABLE 3 approximately here]


D. Reduced form estimates for pre-1933 fields of dismissed chemists
       Similar to data for patents per year in émigré fields, data for fields with pre-1933
patents by dismissed chemists also indicate a disproportionate increase after 1933 in U.S.
invention (Figure 4); by the mid 1950s, U.S. inventors produced more patents in fields with
pre-1933 patents by dismissed German Jewish chemists.


[FIGURE 4 approximately here]


       To analyze whether patenting by U.S. inventors in pre-1933 fields of dismissed
chemists increased after 1933 compared with fields of other German chemists we estimate the
reduced form:


                                                                                                    15
 (6) Patents by U.S. inventorsc,t = α0 +ß pre-1933 dismissed classc ⋅ postt + γ’ Xc,t + δt + fc +
                                                         εc,t

where the indicator variable pre-1933 dismissed classc equals 1 for technology classes c that
include at least one pre-1933 patent by a dismissed German chemist.
         In USPTO technology classes that include at least one pre-1933 patent by a dismissed
chemist, U.S inventors produce 57.8 additional patents per year after 1933 (Table 3, column
6, significant at 1 percent). Compared with an average of 240.9 patents per class and year
between 1920 and 1970 in fields of other (non-émigré) German chemists, this implies a 24
percent increase in domestic patenting. Analogous reduced form estimates imply that U.S
inventors produced 22.3 additional patents per class and year for each additional patent by
dismissed German chemists (Table 3, column 8, significant at 1 percent).
         Specifications that separately estimate effects according to the number of pre-1933
patents by dismissed chemists confirm that fields with more pre-1933 patents by dismissed
chemists experienced a larger increase in U.S. invention after 1933. 23 In classes with one
pre-1933 patent by a dismissed chemist, U.S. inventors patented an additional 28.6 inventions
per class and year after 1933 compared with fields by other German chemists, but the effect is
not statistically significant (Appendix Table A1, column 4). In classes with two pre-1933
patents by dismissed chemists, U.S. inventors patented an additional 97.3 inventions
(Appendix Table A1, column 4, significant at 1 percent). In classes with three or more pre-
1933 patents by dismissed chemists, U.S. inventors patented an additional 98.1 inventions
(Appendix Table A1, column 4, significant at 1 percent).
         To investigate the sensitivity of the reduced form results to differential pre-trends we
estimate an additional set of regressions that control for linear class-specific pre-trends:


                                       𝜏𝜏=1933 ß𝜏𝜏 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 − 1933 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ⋅ 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝜏𝜏 + ηc t

Time-varying estimates with linear pre-trends track estimates without pre-trends albeit at a
lower level and with standard errors that increase as we move away from the pre-period
(Figure A2), suggesting that the baseline estimates may overestimate the true effects of



23
  Among 48 classes with pre-1933 patents by dismissed chemists, 27 classes include 1 pre-1933 patent by a
dismissed chemist, 9 classes include 2 pre-1933 patents by a dismissed chemist, and 12 classes include three or
more pre-1933 patents by a dismissed chemist.


                                                                                                                   16
immigration. An F-test statistic of 2.37 rejects the joint hypothesis that all coefficients are
equal to zero with a p-value equal to 0.0001.


E. Instrumental variables estimates
       IV regressions that use pre-1933 dismissed classc as an instrument for émigré classc
imply that U.S. inventors produce 170.1 additional patents per class and year in fields of
émigrés compared with fields of other German chemists (Table 4, column 2, significant at 1
percent). Compared with a mean of 240.9 patents per class and year between 1920 and 1970
in fields of other German chemists, this implies an increase in U.S. patenting of 71 percent.


[TABLE 4 approximately here]


       IV regressions proxy for the effects of knowledge that dismissed German chemists
had acquired in Germany and brought to the United States. More precisely, the local average
treatment effect of the IV regressions (LATE, Imbens and Angrist 1994), estimates the
increase in patenting by U.S. inventors for classes in which émigrés to the United States
patented because dismissed chemists had patented in the same classes before 1933. In
addition to the fact that the IV estimates a LATE, some of the difference between the OLS
and IV estimates may reflect measurement error, which attenuates the OLS estimates. The
large difference between OLS and IV estimates is also consistent with historical accounts of
negative selection at the level of individual scientists and fields (e.g., Deichmann 1999).
       Regressions that use the number of pre-1933 patents by dismissed chemists as an
instrument for the number of émigré patents indicate that U.S. inventors produced 17.1
additional patents per year for each additional émigré patent (Table 4, column 4, significant at
5 percent).


F. Robustness checks
       Results are robust to a broad range of alternative specifications, including count data
models, regressions with citation-weighted patents as a quality-adjusted measure of patenting,
and alternative definitions of the post-period.
       The first robustness check estimates the main specifications as Poisson regressions
with conditional fixed effects to address the count data characteristic of patents. They yield
comparable or larger estimates than OLS. Poisson estimates for the difference-in-differences


                                                                                                  17
estimator émigré classc ⋅ postt imply a 44 percent increase in U.S. patenting in fields of
émigrés (Appendix Table A2, column 1, significant at 1 percent), compared with 31 percent
in OLS. For each additional émigré patent, U.S. patenting increased by 6 percent (Appendix
Table A2, column 2, not statistically significant).
         Poisson estimates for the reduced form imply a 49 percent increase in U.S. patenting
in pre-1933 research fields of dismissed chemists (Appendix Table A2, column 3, significant
at 1 percent). For each additional pre-1933 patent of a dismissed chemist, domestic patenting
increased by 39 percent (Appendix Table A2, column 4, significant at 1 percent).
         An additional test accounts for differences in the quality of patents using data from
Lampe and Moser (2012) on counts of later patents that cite each patent as relevant prior art. 24
In this test, the dependent variable citation-weighted patents by U.S. inventorsc,t measures the
number of times a patent issued in year t and class c was cited in patents issued between 1921

         OLS estimates imply an increase of 211.8 citation-weighted patents per class and year
after 1933 in research fields of émigrés (Appendix Table A2, column 5, significant at 1
percent). Compared with a mean of 616.2 citation-weighted patents per class and year in the
control, this implies a 34 percent increase, slightly above the baseline estimate of 31 percent
for raw patents. For each additional patent by an émigré, U.S. inventors produce 12.7
additional citation-weighted patents after 1933 (Appendix Table A2, column 6, significant at
1 percent).
         Instrumental variable regressions indicate that U.S. inventors produced an additional
412.2 citation-weighted patents per year after 1933 in classes with émigré patents (Appendix
Table A2, column 7, significant at 10 percent). Compared with a mean of 616.2 citation-
weighted patents per class and year in the control group, this implies a 67 percent increase.
Analogous regressions, which measure the number of émigré patents, indicate that U.S.



24
  Citations are the standard approach to control for the quality of patented inventions. For example, Trajtenberg
(1990) documented that citations are correlated with the estimated social surplus that 456 improvements in CAT
scanners created over time. Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2000) show that citation-weighted patent stocks are
more highly correlated with market value (measured by Tobin’s q) than patent stocks. Moser, Ohmstedt, and
Rhode (2013) find that citations are positively correlated with the size of patented improvements in hybrid corn.


                                                                                                              18
inventors produced 50.5 additional citation-weighted patents after 1933 (Appendix Table A2,
column 8, significant at 10 percent).
         In the baseline, we define the post period to begin in 1933 to exploit the exogenous
timing of dismissals. Émigrés, however, may have become active in the United States with
some delay; to address this issue, we check that the estimates are not driven by an increase in
U.S. patenting that occurs too early to reflect an effect of the émigrés. To perform this test,
we re-estimate the main specifications with alternative definitions of the post period,
beginning in 1936 and 1940. 25
         OLS estimates, in which the post period begins in 1936, indicate that U.S. inventors
produced 74.9 additional patents per year after 1936 in fields of émigrés compared with fields
of other German chemists (Appendix Table A3, column 1, significant at 1 percent).
Analogous IV estimates imply that U.S. inventors produced 152.2 additional patents per year
after 1936 (Appendix Table A3, column 5, significant at 5 percent). Thus, both OLS and IV
estimates are similar to the main estimates, suggesting that the results are not driven by the
definition of the post period. Equivalent analyses in which post begins in 1940 confirm these
findings. 26


III. INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISM USING INVENTOR-LEVEL DATA
         To investigate the mechanism by which the arrival of German Jewish émigrés
increased U.S. innovation, we perform additional tests using a new inventor-level data set of
changes in U.S. patenting. Specifically, we examine changes in the productivity of incumbent
U.S. inventors, as well as changes in entry by new patentees across fields of chemistry. We
also investigate networks of co-inventors, which may have amplified the effects of German
Jewish émigrés, and document the arrival of other German chemists, which indicates that the
emigration of German chemistry professors was part of a broader movement of scientists to
the United States.


A. Effects on incumbent U.S. inventors


25
   For classes treated by Austrian émigrés only, the post period begins with the annexation of Austria in 1938,
and in 1940 for the second robustness check.
26
   Defining the post period to begin in 1940, the OLS coefficient on émigré class⋅ postt is 73.160 with a standard
error of 18.908 (and p-value<0.001). The IV coefficient is 131.836 with a standard error of 57.652 (p-
value=0.023). The OLS coefficient on # émigré patents⋅ postt is 3.991 with a standard error of 1.956 (p-
value=0.043). The IV coefficient is equal to 17.136 with a standard error equal to 6.909 (p-value=0.014).


                                                                                                               19
        To investigate the émigrés’ effects on incumbent U.S. inventors we examine changes
in patenting for 210,410 U.S. inventors that had patented at least one invention before 1933 in
a research field of German chemists.
        Summary statistics indicate a decline in patenting for incumbent inventors regardless
of their exposure to the arrival of the émigrés. Since 75 percent of incumbent inventors only
had one patent, the probability of patenting drops mechanically after 1933, but there is no
significant difference for incumbents that were more or less exposed to the émigrés.
Incumbent inventors who patented the majority of their inventions in émigré fields patented at
least one invention per year with a probability of 0.015 after 1933 compared with 0.097
before 1933 (Table 5, column 4). By comparison incumbent inventors who patented mostly
in fields of other German chemists patented at least one invention per year with a probability
of 0.013 after 1933 compared with 0.098 before 1933 (Table 5, column 2).


[TABLE 5 approximately here]


        OLS and IV regressions estimate the differential effects of the émigrés on incumbent
inventors, depending on the share of the incumbent’s patents in research fields of émigrés:


(9) Patentingi,t = α +ß share of patents in émigré classesi ⋅ Postt + γ’ Zi,t + δt + fi + εi,t

where the dependent variable equals 1 if the incumbent U.S. inventor i patented at least one
invention in year t, and 0 otherwise. The coefficient ß measures the change in the probability
of patenting after 1933 for inventors who have a higher share of their patents in fields of
émigrés. The variable Zi,t controls for variation in productivity over the life cycle of an
inventor; specifically, we control for changes in productivity relative to the year of an
inventor’s first patent, by measuring how many years the inventor is still away from his first
patent, and how many years have passed since the inventors’ first patent. Both variables enter
linearly and as a quadratic. The variable fi represents a full set of fixed effects for each of the
210,410 incumbent U.S. inventors to control for characteristics of the inventors (e.g. their
inherent ability) that do not vary over time. Year fixed effects δt control for changes in the
probability of patenting over time (e.g. as a result of changes in patent policies or industry-
level productivity shocks) that influence all inventors. Standard errors are clustered at the
level of the class that includes the majority of the incumbent inventor’s patents.



                                                                                                  20
         OLS estimates indicate that incumbent inventors who had a 10 percent larger share of
their patents in émigré classes became 0.07 percentage points less likely to patent an
invention after 1932 (Table 6, column 2, significant at 1 percent). Regressions without
controls for productivity across the inventor’s patenting career imply an increase of 0.02
percentage points (Table 6, column 1, significant at 5 percent). 27


[TABLE 6 approximately here]


         Instrumental variable regressions use the share of an inventor’s pre-1933 patents in
fields with pre-1933 patents of dismissed chemists (interacted with a post-dismissal dummy)
as an instrument for the share of the inventor’s overall patents in research fields of émigrés
(interacted with a post-dismissal dummy). Thus, first stage regressions estimate:

(10) Share in émigré classesi ⋅ postt =φ pre-1933 share in classes with pre-1933 patents of
dismissedi ⋅ postt + θ’ Zi,t +λt + µi + υi,t.

         A coefficient of 0.402 for the variable pre-1933 share in classes with pre-1933 patents
of dismissedi ⋅ postt and an F-statistic on the excluded instrument of 21.65 in the first stage
regression (Table 7, column 2, significant at 1 percent) confirm that an inventor’s pre-1933
share in pre-1933 classes of dismissed chemists is a good predictor for the inventor’s share in
émigré classes.


[TABLE 7 approximately here]


         Reduced form estimates indicate that researchers who have an additional 10 percent of
their pre-1933 patents in pre-1933 fields of dismissed chemists were 0.09 percentage points
less likely to patent after 1933 (Table 7, column 4, significant at 1 percent). Instrumental
variable estimates imply that chemists who had an additional 10 percent of their patents in
fields of émigrés were 0.22 percentage points less likely to patent after 1933 (Table 6, column




27
  Only 0.5 percent of inventors receive more than 1 patent in a given year, 3.0 percent receive 1 patent, and 96.5
percent receive no patents. Reflecting this data structure, estimates of the intensive margin are similar to
estimates of the extensive margin (Appendix Table A4).



                                                                                                               21
4, significant at 1 percent), confirming that effects on incumbent inventors cannot explain the
observed overall increase in patenting.
        We also examine raw data on changes in inventive output after 1933 for three groups
of inventors that were more or less exposed to the arrival of the émigrés (Figure 5). 28 Since
incumbent inventors are defined as inventors who have produced at least 1 patent before
1933, and 75 percent of incumbents only have 1 patent, patent counts drop mechanically after
1933. Comparing the probability of patenting for incumbents who were differentially
exposed to the arrival of émigrés, however, indicates no differential change in patenting.
There is no noticeable difference in the probability of patenting after 1933 for incumbents
with more than half of their patents in fields of émigrés compared with incumbents with fewer
than half of their patents in fields of émigrés (Figure 5). Equivalent comparisons for
incumbents with different shares of their pre-1933 patents in pre-1933 fields of dismissed
German chemists (Figure 6) also indicate no differential change. 29


[FIGURES 5 and 6 approximately here]


        In sum, the data indicate that knowledge spillovers from the émigrés to incumbent
inventors are unlikely to have been the driving factor behind the substantial increase in U.S
patenting after 1933 in research fields of émigrés. These results are consistent with evidence
from publications data, which suggest that incumbent U.S. mathematicians did not benefit
from the arrival of Soviet émigrés (Borjas and Doran 2012). 30


B. Effects on entry into research fields of émigrés
        An alternative mechanism, by which the arrival of highly skilled émigrés may have
encouraged innovation, is by encouraging U.S scientists to switch into fields of émigrés or by


28
   As a group, incumbent inventors with 50 percent of their patents in émigré fields are more productive, by
construction, than inventors with either fewer or more than 50 percent of their patents in émigré fields, because
the group of inventors with 50 percent of their patents is restricted to inventors with at least two patents.
29
   Analogous comparisons for alternative divisions of the sample (e.g., 25% in émigré fields versus 75% in
émigré fields) confirm these results.
30
   Borjas and Doran (2012) find that the arrival of Soviet mathematicians who emigrated to the United States
after the collapse of the Soviet Union crowded out publications in top journals by incumbent U.S.
mathematicians. For chemistry, physics, and mathematics, Waldinger (2012) shows that there was no significant
effect of the dismissals of Jewish professors on publications by other German professors who stayed in
Germany, even though the dismissals had significant negative effects on Ph.D. students in mathematics
(Waldinger 2010).



                                                                                                              22
attracting a new group of U.S scientists to the fields of émigrés. 31 To investigate this
mechanism, we use a researcher’s first patent in a USPTO class to measure the researcher’s
year of entry into a new field, and compare changes in the rate of entry after 1933 for fields of
émigrés and fields of other German chemists. To distinguish entry by new inventors from
entry by inventors who had already been active in other fields of chemistry, we also separate
entrants with and without prior patents in the 166 research fields in our data.
        Summary statistics indicate a substantial increase in entry by domestic U.S. scientists
to fields of émigrés after 1932. Until 1932, 116.1 U.S. researchers per class and year entered
the fields of émigrés, compared with 175.1 U.S. researchers in fields of other German
chemists. After 1933, 179.3 U.S. researchers per class and year entered the fields of émigrés,
compared with 162.8 in fields of other German chemists (Table 8, columns 2 and 3, Panel A
and Figure 7). Similarly, the data indicate a substantial increase in entry by U.S. scientists
who had never patented in any of the 166 classes before. Until 1932, 92.0 new U.S.
researchers per class and year entered the fields of émigrés, compared with 143.8 new
researchers in fields of other German chemists. After 1932, 112.1 new researchers per class
and year entered the fields of émigrés, compared with 109.0 in fields of other German
chemists (Table 8, columns 2 and 3, panel B).


[FIGURE 7 approximately here]
[TABLE 8 approximately here]


        To investigate changes in entry by U.S. patentees, OLS regressions estimate

(11) Entryc,t = α0 +ß émigré classc ⋅ postt + γ’ Xc,t + δt + fc + εc,t

where the dependent variable counts new researchers per class and year, measured by a
researcher’s first patent in class c. As above, émigré classc ⋅ postt equals 1 after the dismissals
for class c if it includes at least one patent by an émigré; the vector Xc,t includes controls for
variation in patenting at the level of classes and years, as defined for equation (1); δt are year
fixed effects and fc are class fixed effects.
        OLS estimates indicate that an additional 58.2 U.S. researchers entered the fields of
émigrés per class and year after the dismissals (Table 9, column 2, significant at 1 percent).


 Borjas and Doran (2013) document that U.S. mathematicians switched away from the research fields of Soviet
31

mathematicians to avoid direct competition.


                                                                                                        23
Compared with an average of 165.9 entrants to fields of other German chemists, this implies
35 percent additional entrants for fields of émigrés.


[TABLE 9 approximately here]


         Separating entry of new inventors from entry of inventors who had already been active
in other fields of chemistry, we find that new inventors accounted for three quarters of
additional entrants into émigré fields after the dismissals. Estimates for the dependent
variable entrants into patenting indicate that the number of new patentees in émigré classes -
without prior patents in any of the 166 classes - increased by 44.0 entrants per class and year
(Table 9, column 4, significant at 1 percent).
         We perform a more detailed analysis which separates entrants into research fields of
émigrés who had previously patented in other fields into three groups: inventors with prior
patents in other émigré classes only, inventors with prior patents in non-émigré classes only,
and inventors with prior patents in both other émigré classes and non-émigré classes. The
majority of entrants who had previously patented in other fields had patented in both non-
émigré classes and other émigré classes before they began to patent in an émigré class
(Appendix Figure A3, Panel A). Relatively few entrants had either patented exclusively in
other émigré classes or in non-émigré classes, suggesting that non-émigré classes are an
appropriate control. 32
         To further examine whether classes with patents by non-émigré German chemists are
a good control, we compare patterns of switching between émigré and non-émigré classes.
Controlling for the total number of pre-1933 patents, nearly the same numbers of patentees
switched from émigré into non-émigré classes and from non-émigré into émigré classes.
Most importantly, there is no evidence for a differential change after 1933 (Appendix Figure
A4).
          To address the potential concern that entry into research fields of émigrés may be
endogenous, we use the pre-1933 research fields of dismissed chemists as an instrument for
the fields of émigrés. By construction, first stage regressions for this specification are
identical to first stage regression for the baseline, and confirm that the pre-1933 fields of


32
  The corresponding analysis for entrants into fields of other German chemists similarly indicates that most
entrants with previous patents (in any field) had patented in both émigré and other non-émigré classes before
they began to patent in a specific non-émigré class (Appendix Figure A3, Panel B).


                                                                                                                24
dismissed chemists are a good predictor of the fields of émigrés, with an F-statistic on the
excluded instrument of 18.3 (Table 3, column 2). Summary statistics indicate that pre-1933
fields of dismissed chemists attracted fewer entrants before 1933. After 1933, entry into pre-
1933 fields of dismissed chemists increased relative to other fields (Table 8 and Figure 8).


[Figure 8 approximately here]


          Instrumental variable estimates indicate that entry into the fields of émigrés increased
by 142.1 researchers per class and year after the dismissals (Table 9, column 6, significant at
1 percent); entry by patentees without prior patents in the 166 classes increased by 109.5
patentees per class and year (Table 9, column 8, significant at 1 percent). These results imply
that about three quarters of the new researchers who entered the fields of émigrés had no prior
patents in the 166 classes. Thus, entry data indicate that the émigrés’ effect on U.S. patenting
was driven primarily by their ability to attract a new group of domestic inventors to their
fields.


C. Co-Inventors and co-inventors of co-inventors
          To further investigate the mechanism by which émigrés encouraged U.S. innovation,
we collect data on all co-inventors of the émigrés from joint U.S. patents. Specifically, the
impact of the émigrés may have been amplified and made more persistent through their
collaborators. Overall, 47 co-inventors were granted at least one patent with one of the
émigrés. Between 1920 and 1970, co-inventors patented 576 inventions in the 166 classes;
134 of them were joint patents with émigrés.
          Scientists who became co-inventors of émigrés after the dismissal became
disproportionately more likely to patent in émigré fields, not only in joint patents but also in
their independent work. Before 1933, inventors who later became co-inventors of émigrés,
patented 8 inventions. These patents were equally distributed across fields with and without
émigré patents; 4 patents were exclusively assigned to émigré fields, and 4 patents were
exclusively assigned to other fields. After 1933, co-inventors patented a total of 568
inventions, including 469 patents (83 percent) that were exclusively assigned to émigré fields
(Table 10, Panel A), 24 patents (4 percent) that were exclusively assigned to other fields, and
75 patents (13 percent) that were assigned to both.



                                                                                                25
[TABLE 10 approximately here]
       Confirming the time patterns of the main estimates (Figure 3), co-inventors patenting
activity in émigré fields increased most dramatically after 1940, from less than 10 to more
than 20 patents per year, and remained high until the second half of the 1950s (Figure 9).
Even in the 1960s, the number of patents in émigré fields remained above 10 in the early part
of the decade and increased to 18 patents in 1967. Co-inventors’ patents that were assigned to
both émigré and other fields began to increase in 1940, albeit at lower levels, and continued to
increase until the late 1960s.


[FIGURE 9 approximately here]


       We also identify the co-inventors of co-inventors of the émigrés. Overall, 154 co-
inventors of co-inventors patented at least one invention jointly with a co-inventor of an
émigré. Between 1920 and 1970, co-inventors of co-inventors patented 1,660 inventions in
the 166 classes; 177 inventions were jointly patented with co-inventors of émigrés. Similar to
first-degree co-inventors, co-inventors of co-inventors became disproportionately more likely
to patent in émigré fields. Before 1933, co-inventors of co-inventors patented 131 inventions,
including 48 patents (37 percent) that were exclusively assigned to émigré fields, (Table 10,
Panel B), 59 patents (45 percent) that were exclusively assigned to other fields and 24 patents
(18 percent) that were assigned to both. After 1933, co-inventors of co-inventors patented a
total of 1,529 inventions, including 1,103 patents (72 percent) that were exclusively assigned
to émigré fields (Table 10, Panel B), 162 patents (11 percent) that were exclusively assigned
to other fields, and 264 patents (17 percent) that were assigned to both.
       These data suggest that the émigrés’ effect on their collaborators may have been a
significant channel by which the arrival of émigré chemists increased U.S. invention.
Collaborators of émigrés switched into research fields of émigrés after 1933, and continued to
patent at higher levels throughout the 1950s. These patterns are even more pronounced when
we consider networks of collaboration more broadly by including co-inventors of co-
inventors.


D. Other, more junior German émigré chemists
       While our main tests are limited to examining the effects of émigré professors on U.S.
innovation, émigré professors may have been only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of a broader


                                                                                              26
movement of scientists, which also included junior, and less prominent German chemists. As
a first step towards investigating this phenomenon, we collect data on younger German
chemists who emigrated from Nazi Germany. Straus (1983) reports the names of 62 German
chemists who were at least 18 years old in 1933 - but did not hold a faculty position at the
time of the dismissals. These individuals included university students, and research
assistants, as well as a small number of young industrial chemists who had worked at
companies such as Hoffmann-La Roche, Hoechst, and Schering. Thirty-four of them moved
to the United States after 1933. The average age of the junior émigrés was 30 in 1933,
compared with an average age of 45 years for professors.
       Patent data indicate that these junior chemists were active inventors in the same fields
as émigré professors. Junior émigrés patented 175 inventions in the United States between
1920 and 1970 in the 166 classes of invention in our data; nearly all of these patents, 169 of
175 patents, were issued after 1933. 113 of the junior émigrés post-1933 patents (67 percent)
were issued in classes with patents by senior émigrés; 34 patents (20 percent) were assigned
to both émigré classes and classes with patents by other German chemists. Only 22 patents
(13 percent) were assigned to classes that include only patents by other German chemists but
not by émigré professors (Table 11). These statistics suggest that the research fields of
prominent émigré professors, which we can capture with existing records, may be a proxy for
the research fields of a broader, largely unobservable flow of German Jewish scientists, who
may have contributed to the observed increase in U.S. invention.


[TABLE 11 approximately here]




IV. CONCLUSIONS
       Historical accounts suggest that German Jewish émigrés revolutionized U.S. science
and innovation, but empirical evidence has been scarce. This paper presents the first
systematic analysis of the émigrés’ effects on U.S. innovation. Baseline estimates compare
changes in patenting by U.S. inventors after 1933 in chemistry for research fields of German
émigrés with fields of other German chemists. This analysis indicates that U.S. invention
increased by 31 percent after 1933 in fields of U.S. émigrés. A potential threat to the
empirical approach is that émigrés may have chosen to work in fields, in which U.S.
invention became more productive after 1933, after they had moved to the United States. To


                                                                                                 27
address this issue, we use the pre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists as an instrument
for the fields of émigrés to the United States. Consistent with historical accounts that émigrés
to the United States may have been negatively selected, and that they were more likely to
work in less productive research fields in the United States, estimates from instrumental
variable regressions exceed estimates from OLS.
        To investigate the mechanism by which the arrival of German Jewish émigré scientists
encouraged U.S. innovation, we have collected a new inventor-level data set of changes in
U.S. patenting. These data indicate that the arrival of German Jewish émigrés increased U.S.
invention by attracting a new group of domestic U.S. inventors to the fields of émigrés, rather
than by increasing the productivity of incumbent U.S. scientists. Our findings of limited
positive effects on incumbents are consistent with results from publications data for
mathematics (Borjas and Doran 2012), which suggest that the arrival of a new group of highly
skilled scientists may crowd out publications by incumbents. Analyzing patents instead of
publications, however, allows us to investigate effects on incumbents in a setting that is less
affected by capacity constraints, and estimate the overall effects of high-skilled immigrants
on innovation.
        The data also indicate that networks of co-inventors may have helped to amplify the
émigrés’ effects on U.S. innovation. U.S. inventors who collaborated with émigré professors
began to patent at substantially higher levels in the 1940s and continued to be exceptionally
productive in the 1950s. These patterns suggest that émigré professors helped to increase
U.S. invention in the long run, by training a new group of younger U.S. scientists, who then
continued to train other scientists.
        Importantly, our analysis is limited to investigating changes in U.S. invention in the
research fields of a small, albeit prominent group of German Jewish émigré professors.
Comparisons with patent data for a younger group of less prominent German Jewish scientists
indicate that the fields of émigré professors may be a good proxy for the fields of a broader
flow of German Jewish émigrés, which caused the observed increase in U.S. invention.

Notes: The dependent variable is patents by U.S. inventors per USPTO class and year, excluding patents by émigrés. Émigré class equals 1 for classes that
include at least one U.S. patent by an émigré. # émigré patents measures the number of U.S. patents by émigrés in class c. Classes without émigré patents
form the control group. The dummy variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. # of foreign patents counts U.S. patents by foreign nationals in
class c and year t. Quadratic class age is a second-degree polynomial for years since the first patent in class c. The indicator variable patent pools equals 1
for classes that were affected by a patent pool.

Notes: In first stage regresssions (columns 1-4), the dependent variables are Émigré class * Post (columns 1 and 2) and # émigré patents * Post (columns 3
and 4). Émigré class equals 1 for classes that include at least one U.S. patent by an émigré. # émigré patents measures the number of U.S. patents by
émigrés in class c. Dismissed class equals 1 for classes that include at least one pre-1933 U.S. patent by a dismissed chemist. # dismissed patents indicates
the number of pre-1933 U.S. patents by dismissed chemists in each class. The dummy variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. # of foreign
patents counts U.S. patents by foreign nationals in class c and year t. Quadratic class age is the second-degree polynomial for years since the first patent in
class c. The indicator variable patent pools equals 1 for classes that were affected by a patent pool. In reduced form regressions (columns 5-8) the
dependent variable measures patents by U.S. inventors per USPTO class and year, excluding patents by émigrés.

Notes: Data include 210,410 U.S. patentees with at least one patent between 1920 and 1932. We constructed data on patents per year of these patentees through a
search algorithm, which identified patents by individual inventors per class and year, using Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Text (1920-
1979) database. The Appendix includes a detailed description of the search algorithm and the process of data cleaning.

The sample includes all domestic U.S. patentees with at least one patent between 1920 and 1932. Share of
patents in émigré classes measures the total share of patents by a U.S. inventor that are in the 60 research
fields of émigrés. The variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. Quadratic time to first patent is a
second-degree polynomial for years until an inventor patents for the first time in any of the 166
classes. Quadratic time since first patent is a second-degree polynomial for years after an inventor patents for
the first time in any of the 166 classes.

Notes: Entrants are patentees who patent for the first time in one of 166 research fields, defined at the level of USPTO technology classes. To collect these
data we developed an algorithm that matches inventors across classes and years, and assigns a unique identifier to each inventor. See the Data Appendix for
a detailed description. We apply this algorithm to the full text of 1,365,689 U.S. patent documents in Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) Text (1920-1979) database across 166 technology classes between 1920 and 1970. This yields 1,396,318 entrants who patented for the first time in
class c and 964,526 entrants without prior patents in the 166 technology classes. Dismissed and émigré professors are identified from the List of Displaced
German Scholars (1937), Deichman (2001), Kröner (1983), and Straus (1983).

   Notes: In colunns 1-2 and 5-6, the dependent variable is number of new patentees per year in class c without prior patents in class c. In colunns 3-4 and 7-8,
   the dependent variable is number of new patentees per year in class c with neither prior patents in class c nor prior patents in any other of the 166 classes.
   Émigré class equals 1 for classes that include at least one U.S. patent by an émigré. Classes without émigré patents form the control group. We instrument
   with Pre-1933 Dismissed class * Post for Émigré class * Post. Pre-1933 Dismissed class equals 1 for classes that include at least one pre-1933 U.S. patent
   by a dismissed chemist. The dummy variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. First stage regressions are reported in column 2 of Table 3. # of
   foreign patents counts U.S. patents by foreign nationals in class c and year t. Quadratic class age is a second-degree polynomial for years since the first
   patent in class c. The indicator variable patent pools equals 1 for classes that were affected by a patent pool.

DATA APPENDIX

1. Inventor-level Data on Patenting


We implement a four-step process of data collection and cleaning to construct inventor-level
data on changes in patenting for 166 classes of chemical inventions, using records from
Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Text (1920-1979) Database.
First, we extract inventors from the OCR database using a Pearl script. We then clean the
data by correcting common errors in Google’s OCR and by removing substrings that do not
contain the actual inventor. In the next step we create an algorithm that separates inventors
using information on 3,439 common first names from the U.S. Censuses and Social Security
records. Lastly, we assign unique identifiers based on Levenshtein (1966) distances. In this
section, we describe each of these four steps in more detail.


Step 1: Pearl Script to Identify Inventors in Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) Text (1920-1979) Database
      The inventor data come from Google’s Patent Grant Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) Text (1920-1979) database. We program a Pearl script to search for the inventor in
the full text of each patent document.
      To optimize the quality of our inventor data we adjust the Pearl script to reflect changes
in the layout of the patent document. Until 1953 the inventor name appears in two sections of
the patent document: near the title of the invention and at the end of the document. We
collect both and use the string that has a higher probability of identifying the inventor for
patents issued until 1953 (more details below).
      The other major change of reporting inventors occurred in 1933 (after patent number
1,920,164) when USPTO switched from reporting inventors at the beginning of the patent
document in upper-case letters (e.g. “ARNOLD WEISSBERGER”) to lower-case (e.g.
“Arnold Weissberger”).
    To obtain inventor names found near the title, the code searches for relevant substrings
of the marker “United States Patent Office” (non-case sensitive). After identifying the
marker we extract the next 10 lines of the OCR document; they usually contain the title of the
invention and names of all inventors. As the title is usually spelled in capital letters we use
regular expressions to cut any consecutive strings of capitalized letters. We then concatenate



                                                                                                  2
all remaining strings and use commas to delimit the resulting string that is usually formatted
“inventor name, geographic location of inventor, assignee”.
    To obtain inventor names that appear at the end of the patent document, we look for the
marker “BRS DOCUMENT” which indicates the end of a patent document within the OCR.
We then take the 10 lines that precede this marker. To isolate inventors from substrings
containing other information, our Pearl code removes lines that only contain spaces. It also
removes lines that contain the strings “AISD” (assigned date), “CCOR”, “CCXR” (classes),
“ISY” (assigned year), and consecutive capitalized letters. As above, we then concatenate all
remaining lines and separate inventors with commas.


Step 2: Cleaning Code
a. Remove substrings that do not contain the inventor
In many cases the output of step 1 contains just the correct inventor(s) for each patent.
Sometimes, however, the output contains additional substrings that do not identify inventors.
Additional substrings can be part of the output because markers such as “United States Patent
Office” or “assignor” are often misspelled in Google’s OCR data. To isolate the inventor
from other text we therefore search for regular patterns that indicate inventors and discard
other parts of the inventor string. The following list gives an overview of our cleaning:
   1) If “United States Patent Office” is misspelled in Google’s OCR data the inventor
       string contains misspelled versions of “United States Patent Office”. We manually
       identify more than 1,100 substrings with misspelled versions of “United States Patent
       Office” and remove them.
   2) Sometimes the OCR adds additional letters after “United States Patent Office” (which
       do not describe the inventors). The resulting string therefore contains individual
       letters at the beginning of the string followed by a large number of blanks before the
       actual inventors are listed. We therefore cut individual letters followed by large
       numbers of blanks from the inventor string.
   3) If “assignor” is misspelled in Google’s OCR data the inventor string contains
       misspelled versions of “assignor”. We manually identify 48 substrings with
       misspelled versions of “assignor” and remove them.
   4) In some cases the inventor string includes the beginning of the description of the
       invention. We therefore remove everything after “This invention” and 113 misspelled
       variations of “This invention”.


                                                                                                 3
   5) Similarly we remove 27 misspelled versions of “application filed” from the inventor
       string.
   6) In early versions of the patent layout the inventor’s place of residence is marked with
       “of” e.g. “Ernst Berl, of Darmstadt, Germany”. In some cases the inventor string
       contains the inventor’s place of residence and we therefore cut “of” (and 32
       misspelled versions of “of”) plus the following word from the inventor string.
   7) We remove substrings that include the name of a U.S. state, e.g. “California” and 83
       misspelled versions of state names (exceptions: Virginia and Georgia that can also be
       inventor names).
   8) We remove 339 substrings that include U.S. cities such as “Cleveland” and misspelled
       versions of cities e.g. “Clev6land”.
   9) We remove substrings that include foreign countries such as “Germany” or “France”.
   10) Patents with patent numbers higher than 1,920,164 use upper case spelling for the
       initial and lower-case spelling for the rest of the inventor (e.g. “Arnold Weissberger”).
       Substrings with consecutive upper case letters do thus not identify the inventor for
       patent numbers > 1,920,164. We therefore cut substrings containing only upper-case
       letters for patents with patent numbers > 1,920,164.
   11) If the inventor string only includes lower case letters we set the inventor to missing as
       inventor names always contain upper case letters. We manually identify exceptions
       where the inventor string only contains lower case letters but still includes a large part
       of the inventor and keep them in the data.


b. Correct Common Misspellings
Our cleaning code also corrects common misspellings that originate from the OCR process.

We also correct a total of 1,530 misspelled versions (e.g. “Jos@ph” instead of “Joseph”) for
the following first names: Abraham, Adolf, Adolph, Alan, Albert, Alexander, Alexis,

d. Choose Between Inventors If Available Between Different Parts of the Patent Document
As mentioned above, until 1953 the patent document lists the inventor in two different places:
near the beginning of the document and at the end. After patent number 2,672,389 the
inventor can only be easily identified near the beginning of the document. If the inventor is
listed in two places in the document the information at the beginning of the document is
usually of higher quality because the entry at the end sometimes contains witnesses or patent
examiners.
For each patent we therefore choose the inventor as follows:

   1) We first use the inventor listed at the beginning of the patent document.
   2) If the inventor from the beginning of the document is missing, we use the inventor
       from the end of the document if the patent number is smaller than 2,672,389 (after



                                                                                                6
       this patent number the string from the end of the document does not include the
       correct inventor).
   3) If the inventor from the beginning of the document contains numbers or the characters
       ‘:’ ‘@’ ‘=’ ‘&’ ‘)’ ‘!’, we use the inventor from the end of the document if the patent
       number is smaller than 2,672,389 and if the inventor from the end of the document is
       a string longer than 5 characters and includes at least two words.
   4) If the inventor from the beginning of the document is a string with less than 7
       characters, we use the inventor from the end of the document if the patent number is
       smaller than 2,672,389 and if the inventor from the end of the document is a string
       longer than 5 characters and includes at least two words.
   5) If the inventor from the beginning of the document does not contain spaces, we use
       the inventor from the end of the document if the patent number is smaller than
       2,672,389 and if the inventor from the end of the document is a string longer than 5
       characters and includes at least two words.
   6) If the inventor from the beginning of the document contains lower case characters
       before the inventor is reported in lower case (i.e. patent number < 1,920,164), we use
       the inventor from the end of the document if the patent number is smaller than
       2,672,389 and if the inventor from the end of the document is a string longer than 5
       characters and includes at least two words.



Step 3: Separating Inventors
In our third step we separate inventors. This addresses the following issues:
   1) After the previous cleaning steps the data contain all inventors in one string, even if a
       patent was filed by multiple inventors.
   2) Even after extensive cleaning in step 2, the inventor string may still include substrings
       that do not identify inventors.
The following procedure addresses both of these issues.


Separate inventors if they are separated by “and”
We first separate inventors that are separated by “and”: e.g. “Ernst Zerner and Marcel
Gradsten”. We also identify 86 misspelled versions of “and” and separate inventors
accordingly.



                                                                                                  7
Identify inventors that do not need separation
         Whenever the inventor string contains only two words, we treat such words as first
name and last name of an inventor, and we do not proceed with further separation. Similarly,
if the string contains one word followed by one or two initials and by another word, we do
not proceed with any further separation. All other strings are examined through a process
described below.


Separate other inventors using data on 3,439 first names
         Strings that contain more than one inventor are separated with an algorithm that uses
3,439 common female and male names from U.S. Censuses (1920, Ruggles et. al. 1997) and
Social Security records (1900-1999, Shackleford 2000) to isolate individual inventors. 1 The
algorithm proceeds as follows: we first search for a common first name starting at the
beginning of a string. If the first name is not separated from the following middle name or
family name, we introduce a space after the first name to isolate it from the rest of string.
         We then identify first and middle names in the inventor string. This algorithm
compares each word in the string to each of the 3,439 first names in our list. We classify a
word as a first or middle name if it matches one of the common names with a Levenshtein
distance that is less or equal to 25%. We identify individual inventors as substrings with the
pattern first name, middle name, plus one unmatched word, or with the pattern first name plus
one unmatched word. 2 This process yields 842,068 unique inventor names. Some of these
names may be misspelled (such as “Arnold Weissberge” instead of “Arnold Weissberger”).
In the next stage described below we address these misspellings.


Step 4: Generate unique inventor identifiers
         In the last stage, we use Levenshtein distances to construct a unique inventor
identifier, which allows for misspellings of the inventors’ name. As our algorithm processes
about a million inventor strings we assign inventor identifiers in two steps. We first group
inventors by first names and then use Levenshtein distances to assign unique inventor
identifiers within those groups.
         First, inventors are grouped by their first names. We use the list of common first
names described above and find all inventors that share the same first name. To allow for

 As our list of common first names also includes initials we also identify inventors who report a first name,
middle initial, and a last name.

                                                                                                                8
remaining misspellings of the first name the first name groups are based on a maximum
Levenshtein distance of 25%, i.e. Arnol is in the same group as Arnold (the normalized
Levenshtein distance of the two strings is: 1/7 = 14.3 percent).
        We then use the STATA strgroup command within each first name group of inventors
to generate unique identifiers for strings that have a Levenshtein distance of 20% or lower. 3
E.g. in the group of all inventors with the first name Arnold (or Arnol, or other similar first
names) we generate a unique identifier if the Levenshtein distance between two strings is less
than 20% (“Arnold Weissberger” will be assigned the same identifier as “Arnold
Weissberge”).

Notes: Panel A separates entrants to research fields of émigrés according to their prior patenting activity in other
classes. Entrants with prior patents in other fields only measures entrants who had exclusively patented in classes
with patents of other German chemists before they patented their first invention in a specific émigré class. Entrants
with prior patents in émigré fields only measures entrants who had patented in other émigré classes but not in
classes with patents of other German chemists before they patented their first invention in a specific émigré class.
Entrants with prior patents in émigré and other fields measures entrants who had patented in other émigré classes
and classes with patents by other German chemists before they patented their first invention in a specific émigré
class. Entrants w/o prior patents measures entrants who had not patented in any of the 166 classes of our sample
before they patented their first invention in a specific émigré class. Panel B performs the corresponding
decomposition for entraints into classes of other German chemists.

Notes: Entry into émigré fields from fields of other German chemists measure the normalized number of entrants
into émigré fields who had prior patents in fields of other German chemists only. Entry into fields of other German
chemists from émigré fields measure the normalized number of entrants into fields of other German chemists who
have prior patents in fields of émigrés, only. Our data include 106 fields with patents by other German chemists
(with an average of 218.4 patents until 1932) and 60 fields with patents by émigré chemists (with an average of
149.3 patents until 1932); as a result patentees are more likely to move from fields with patents of other German
chemists to fields with patents by émigrés. To account for this mechanical difference, we normalize the number
of entrants by the share of pre-1933 patents in each set of fields (i.e. we multiply the number of entrants from
fields of other German chemists to fields of émigrés with (106*218.4)/(106*218.4 + 60*149.3), analogously, we
multiply the number of entrants from fields of émigrés to fields of other German chemists with
(60*140.3)/(106*218.4 + 60*149.3).

Notes: The dependent variable is patents by U.S. inventors per USPTO class and year, excluding U.S. patents by
émigrés. n émigré patents equals 1 when the number of U.S. patents by émigrés in class c is equal to n. Classes
without émigré patents form the control. The dummy variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. n
dismissed patents equals 1 when the number of pre-1933 U.S. patents by dismissed chemists in class c is equal to
n. # of foreign patents counts U.S. patents by foreign nationals in class c and year t. Quadratic class age is a
second-degree polynomial for years since the first patent in class c. The indicator variable patent pools equals 1
for classes that were affected by a patent pool.

Notes: Columns 1-4: Odds ratios from Poisson regressions. The dependent variable is patents by U.S. inventors per USPTO class and year, excluding patents by émigrés.
Columns 5-8: The dependent variable is citation-weighted patents by U.S. inventors per USPTO class and year, excluding patents by émigrés. Citations-weighted patents are
calculated by adding the number of times that a patent is cited in patent issues between 1921 and 2002 (from Lampe and Moser 2012) to each patent. Other variables are
defined as above.

Notes: The dependent variable is the number of patents obtained by incumbent inventor i in year t. The sample includes all domestic U.S. patentees with at least one patent
between 1920 and 1932. Share of patents in émigré classes measures a domestic U.S. inventor’s combined share of patents across the 60 research fields of émigrés. The
dummy variable Post equals 1 for years after the dismissals. # of foreign patents counts U.S. patents by foreign nationals in class c and year t. Quadratic in time to first patent
