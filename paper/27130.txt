Does Biology Drive Child Penalties? Evidence from Biological and Adoptive Families

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper investigates if the impact of children on the labor market outcomes of women relative
to men -- child penalties -- can be explained by the biological links between mother and child.
We estimate child penalties in biological and adoptive families using event studies around the
arrival of children and almost forty years of adoption data from Denmark. Short-run child
penalties are slightly larger for biological mothers than for adoptive mothers, but their long-run
child penalties are virtually identical and precisely estimated. This suggests that biology is not a
key driver of child-related gender gaps.

1    Introduction

    Parenthood has large and persistent effects on the labor market outcomes of women,
but not men. This holds across different households, across different countries and over
time, making it one of the most robust findings in labor economics. Estimates of long-run
child penalties in female earnings range from 20-25% in Scandinavian countries to 30% in
the United States and a staggering 60% in Germany (Kleven et al. 2019a,b). In fact, most of
the remaining gender inequality in high-income countries can be attributed to the unequal
impacts of children on men and women (Kleven et al. 2019a, 2020).
    Why are child penalties so large and persistent? While the evidence on reduced-form
impacts is fairly conclusive, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is much
less developed. A traditional explanation focuses on the factor that make men and women
obviously different: biology. Only women can bear and give birth to children, and only
women have the option to breastfeed. One would certainly expect such factors to matter
for the short-run impacts of children, say within a year or two of child birth, but they
could also matter for the long-run impacts.
    Two sets of reasons point to the possibility of long-run impacts. First, the physiological
implications of pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding may extend beyond the short run.
This could be due either to post-partum health complications or to changes in hormonal
levels and brain structure around child birth. Indeed, a large literature in neurobiology
argues that pregnancy and child birth create lasting changes in hormones and gray mat-
ter associated with maternal attachment (see e.g., Numan & Insel 2003; Feldman et al.
2007; Hoekzema et al. 2017). Second, biology may affect long-run labor market outcomes
through the dynamic effects of work interruptions. Interrupting work around pregnancy
and infant child care may affect future earnings capacity through experience effects (such
as human capital accumulation or signaling), and it may change preferences over family
vs career. Indeed, the push for earmarked paternity leave in several countries is predi-
cated on the idea that such leave may strengthen the bond between father and child, with


                                              1
longer-run implications for the division of child care.
    Testing for the importance of biology requires separating the effects of having a child
from the effects of giving birth to a child. A natural way of obtaining this separation is to
compare child penalties in biological and adoptive families. However, any such investi-
gation faces two challenges. The first challenge is statistical power: The best estimates of
child penalties are based on event studies around the arrival of children, which require
large panel data sets with information on labor market outcomes and children. This re-
quirement is harder to satisfy for adopted children, because relatively few families adopt
and data sources often do not record adoptions. We deal with this challenge by using
Danish administrative data that contain exhaustive information on adoptions over almost
forty years. The second challenge is identification: Adoptive families are a selected sub-
sample of the population, implying that any differences in child penalties between bio-
logical and adoptive mothers may reflect selection rather than biology. We deal with this
challenge by matching on a rich set of observables, showing that the matched samples
display parallel pre-trends in the event studies.
    We find large and persistent effects of children on gender gaps in both biological and
adoptive families. Women and men evolve in parallel until the arrival of their first child,
whether by birth or by adoption, and then diverge sharply and persistently. The short-
run impacts are slightly larger in biological families, but the long-run impacts are virtually
identical. Ten years after birth, the child penalty in earnings is 17-18% in both biological
and adoptive families.1 When investigating the underlying determinants of earnings --
participation, hours worked, and wage rates -- we find that biological and adoptive fam-
ilies are similarly impacted in those dimensions too. These findings provide evidence
against the importance of the biological link between mother and child for explaining the
gendered impacts of children.
    More broadly, our results have implications for understanding the impact of compar-
ative advantage in child care on gender gaps. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are the most
   1 The  long-run child penalties estimated here are slightly smaller than those estimated in Kleven et al.
(2019a) for the full population. This is because we are reweighting biological families to match the char-
acteristics of adoptive families, where the latter tend to have fewer children overall and therefore smaller
child penalties.



                                                     2
obvious sources of such comparative advantage, and if these factors have no impact on
long-run child penalties, it is conceivable that other sources of comparative advantage
have no impact on child penalties either.2 To further investigate the role of comparative
advantage, we study heterogeneity in child penalties by the earnings potential of mothers
relative to fathers in biological and adoptive families. The earnings potential is estimated
based on detailed information about education level, education field, and labor market
experience at the time of birth of the first child. Strikingly, we find that long-run child
penalties are virtually unaffected by the relative earnings potential of women and men,
and this holds in both biological and adoptive families. These findings suggest against
the comparative advantage channel, and they are consistent with finding a zero effect of
biological links between mother and child.
    Our paper contributes to a large literature on gender inequality in the labor market
(recently reviewed by Bertrand 2011 and Olivetti & Petrongolo 2016) and specifically to
studies investigating the importance of parenthood (e.g., Bertrand et al. 2010; Angelov et al.
2016; Kleven & Landais 2017; Kleven et al. 2019a,b; Kuziemko et al. 2018). Moreover, our
finding that biological and adoptive mothers experience the same long-run child penalties
-- even though adoptees arrive later and require less maternity leave -- sheds light on a
key finding in the literature on parental leave policies (reviewed by Olivetti & Petrongolo
2017). This literature finds that paid leave has no long-term impact on female labor market
outcomes and gender gaps (e.g., Lalive & Zweimüller 2009; Rossin-Slater et al. 2013; Lalive
et al. 2014; Schönberg & Ludsteck 2014; Dahl et al. 2016). Our paper is consistent with
this finding and go one step further: It suggests that we should expect limited long-term
effects on maternal labor market outcomes from any policy or treatment that affects new
mothers only temporarily, say in the first year or two following child birth.
    Finally, our paper is related to Andresen & Nix (2019) who study child penalties in
lesbian couples, where one partner is biologically linked to the child while the other part-
ner is not.3 They find no long-term differences in child penalties between the biological
   2 Women    may have other biological sources of comparative advantage in child care than pregnancy and
breastfeeding. This includes the argument among some biologists and psychologists that the female brain
is hard-wired predominantly for empathy (conducive to care taking) while the male brain is hard-wired
predominantly for understanding and building systems (see e.g., Baron-Cohen 2005).
    3 Related, Rosenbaum (2019) studies child penalties in lesbian couples who adopt.



                                                   3
mother and the "co-mother". In other words, biological links do not matter in couples
where gender is held constant. An important advantage of studying adoptive couples
over same-sex couples is that it gives a much larger and less selected sample of the popu-
lation, yielding more precision and greater generalizability.4



2      Empirical Specification and Data

2.1     Event Study Specification

      We estimate the impact of biological and adopted children on the labor market out-
comes of men and women using the event study approach of Kleven et al. (2019a). Specif-
ically, we consider a balanced panel of parents observed in each year from 5 years before
the arrival of their first child, by birth or by adoption, until 10 years after. We consider the
following specification


                              Yit =  Dit    +  Dit              +  DYear
                                      Event               Age
                                                                    it   + it ,                           (1)


where Yit is the outcome (e.g., earnings) of individual i at event time t. On the right-hand
side, we use boldface to denote vectors. The first term includes event time dummies,
indexed such that t = 0 denotes the year of arrival of the first child. We omit the dummy
for t = -1, so that each t   measures the impact of children in a given year relative
to the year before child arrival. The second and third terms include a full set of age and
year dummies to control non-parametrically for lifecycle trends and time trends.5 This
specification is run separately for men and women, and for those with biological and
adopted children.
      Equation (1) is specified in levels rather than logs to keep observations with zero earn-
ings and thus capture both intensive and extensive margin responses. We convert level
    4 Regarding the selection argument, an important way in which same-sex parents differ from heterosex-
ual parents is that their child penalty (for the biological mother as well as the co-mother) converges to zero
in the long run. This stands in sharp contrast to the large long-run child penalties observed for heterosexual
parents, whether biological or adoptive.
    5 The conditions for causal identification of the short- and long-term impacts of children in this frame-

work are laid out and validated in Kleven et al. (2019a).

By running the estimations separately for men and women with biological and adopted
children, we obtain four series of Pt . These series can be compared to estimate the impact
of children on women relative to men -- child penalties -- in biological vs adoptive fam-
ilies across event time. This will shed light on the potential role of biology for short-run
and long-run child penalties.
   It is worth discussing two points on interpretation. First, differences in child penalties
between biological and adoptive parents may not necessarily reflect biology alone, but
also the differential selection of the two sets of parents. As we show, adoptive families
tend to have their first child later, have fewer children overall, and have higher education
and earnings levels. We deal with such selection issues by reweighting the sample of bio-
logical parents to ensure that their distribution of background characteristics ( x B ) exactly
matches the distribution for the adoptive parents ( x A ). Formally, we compute weights
as the relative fraction of individuals with a certain set of characteristics in the two sam-
ples ( f ( x A )/ f ( x B )) and use these weights in the regression (1) and in the expectation
in equation (2) for the biological sample. By reweighting only the biological sample, we
are able to adjust for a potentially rich set of observables while losing power only in the
power-abundant biological sample.
   Our baseline specification reweights the biological sample to match the distribution
of the adoptive sample on the following variables: (i) year of arrival of the first child, (ii)
years to arrival of the second child, (iii) the total number of children, (iv) the mother's
age at first child, (v) the mother's pre-child education, and (vi) the mother's pre-child
earnings. The first three variables (related to the timing and total number of children) en-
sures that biological and adoptive families experience the same treatment intensity. This
is potentially important because, even though the event studies are centered on the arrival
of the first child, the longer-run impacts will capture the impact of subsequent children


                                                 5
as well. Hence, finding that biological and adoptive families experience similar long-run
child penalties would not be very informative if they were treated differently by subse-
quent children. In robustness checks discussed below, we consider the implications of
more parsimonious weighting schemes.6
      Second, since adopted children do not arrive immediately after birth, there is a differ-
ence between event studies centered on child arrivals and event studies centered on child
births. Our baseline specification is based on arrivals -- the actual "event" for adoptive
families -- but a specification based on births would have merit as well. In particular,
centering on births ensures that biological and adopted children have the same age at
each event time, while centering on arrivals implies that adoptees are a little older (about
one year older on average) at each event time. We consider specifications based on births
in the appendix, showing that the long-run child penalties are virtually the same when
doing this.


2.2     Data

      Our analysis uses administrative data from Statistics Denmark (DST) covering the full
population between 1980 and 2017. The DST data combine several administrative reg-
isters linked at the individual level through personal identification numbers. The data
allow us to link individuals to their family members and contain detailed information on
earnings, labor supply, education, children, and a range of other variables.
      We focus on the impact of foreign adoptions throughout. Domestic adoptions are less
common, the children tend to be older at arrival, and the adoptive parents often have
a pre-existing link to the child (such as a step parent or aunt/uncle). Importantly, the
adoption registry of Statistics Denmark only covers the period 1988-2009. Using this data
alone would narrow the time window available for our event studies and reduce statis-
tical power. We therefore augment the official records by identifying foreign adoptions
outside the 1988-2009 window using information on country of origin and migration his-
   6 Matching on variables determined after the arrival of the first child (years to second child and the
total number of children) may pose threats to identification if these variables respond endogenously to the
labor market impacts of the first child. We therefore consider specifications that match only on pre-child
outcomes, showing that the estimates are very similar.


                                                    6
tory. Specifically, we define foreign adoptees as individuals who fulfill the following con-
ditions: (1) They were born in a non-western country, (2) they have two known parents
born in a western country, (3) both parents had their legal address in Denmark (with no
emigration record) at the time the child was born, and (4) the child has a recorded entry
(immigration record) into the Danish Central Person Register after the date of birth.
   To validate this procedure, Figure A.I in the online appendix compares our measure of
adoptions to the official records during the time period where we have both. The figure
shows that our measure captures the official numbers almost perfectly. Virtually all of our
adoptees are also listed in the official records (no type II errors) and virtually no adoptees
in the official records are missed by our measure (no type I errors). We find around 400-
600 adoptions per year, corresponding to 16,260 children between 1980-2017. About two-
thirds of all foreign adoptees come from Asia, and about 40% of the Asian adoptees come
from South Korea.7
   We focus on parents whose first child arrives (by birth or by adoption) between 1985
and 2007, which gives us data for at least 5 years before and 10 years after parenthood
in all families. We require that both parents are known, alive and reside in Denmark in
each year of the event time window (t = -5, ..., +10). We impose no restrictions on the
relationship status of the parents, including parents who are married, cohabiting, sepa-
rated, divorced, or have not yet formed a couple in a given year. We also require that
all subsequent children are of the same type as the first (adopted or biological) such that
we are comparing purely biological to purely adoptive families, and we restrict attention
to adoptive children arriving before the age of 5. These data restrictions leave us with
around 527,000 first births in the biological sample and around 4,600 first arrivals in the
adoptive sample.8
   Our main outcome of interest is annual earnings. This includes income from wages,
salaries, and self-employment. We also consider the impact of children on labor force
participation, hours worked, and wage rates (earnings/hours worked). Our measures
of hours worked and wage rates are based on administrative and third-party reported

data from a mandated pension scheme called Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension (ATP), which
requires employers to contribute on behalf of their employees based on individual hours
worked.
      Table 1 provides descriptive statistics in three samples: adoptive families, biological
families, and reweighted biological families. While other studies (e.g., Fagereng et al.
2019) have shown that foreign adoptees are as good as randomly allocated to adoptive
families, our table shows that adoptive families are a selected subsample of the popula-
tion. For example, adoptive parents tend to have their first child later, have fewer children
in total, and have higher education and earnings than biological parents. This motivates
our reweighting procedure described above. As shown in the table, this procedure en-
sures that the distribution of adoptive and biological families are balanced on year of first
child, years to second child, total number of children, the mother's age at first child, and
the mother's pre-child education and earnings levels. The adoptive and reweighted bio-
logical samples retain minor discrepancies on some of the matching variables, because we
match on binned rather than continuous variables.



3      Results

3.1     Child Penalties in Biological vs Adoptive Families

      Figure 1 shows the earnings impacts of parenthood on men and women in biological
and adoptive families, respectively. Panel A considers all adoptees pooled, while Panel B
considers adoptees split by their age at arrival. Each dot gives the percentage impact at
event time t (relative to event time -1) based on the specification in (1)-(2). As described
above, this specification controls non-parametrically for any underlying lifecycle and time
trends, and it is implemented on a reweighted biological sample.
      Consider first biological families. Relative to the underlying life-cycle and time trends,
the earnings of men and women evolve in parallel until child birth and then diverge
sharply. Female earnings drop by about 25% immediately after child birth, while male
earnings are unaffected. Women recover some of their earnings loss after infant child care,


                                                8
but they never catch back up to men. The figure shows the implied long-run child penalty,
defined as the average difference in the impact of children ( Pt in equation 2) between men
and women across event times 6-10. The long-run child penalty in biological families is
equal to 17.0%. These findings are well-known and hold across different countries (Kleven
et al. 2019a,b).9
    Consider then adoptive families. The main insight from Panel A of Figure 1 is that
adoptive families are affected by parenthood in much the same way as biological fami-
lies. The earnings of adoptive parents evolve in parallel before having children and then
diverge sharply and persistently after having children. The short-run earnings impacts
are somewhat smaller in adoptive families than in biological families, but the long-run
impacts are virtually the same. The long-run child penalty on adoptive mothers equals
18.1% and is statistically indistinguishable from the penalty of 17.0% on biological moth-
ers. That is, even though adoptive mothers are not biologically linked to their children
and are unaffected by aspects such as breastfeeding and postpartum health complications,
they converge to long-run penalties at least as large as those for biological mothers.
    Furthermore, the penalties on adoptive mothers feature little heterogeneity by their
child's age at arrival as shown in Panel B. The different adoptive subsamples -- those
with early, intermediate, and late arrivals -- line up closely throughout the event study
window. Even adoptive mothers whose first child arrives after the age of one (two) expe-
rience a long-run penalty of 17.9% (16.7%), statistically indistinguishable from the penalty
of 17.0% on biological mothers. In other words, the age of the child is not critical for the
labor market impacts, at least not after the initial stage of breastfeeding and infant child
care.10
    As discussed in Section 2, our baseline specification reweights the biological sample to
match the adoptive sample in terms of the number and timing of children as well as the
   9 The   long-run child penalty of 17.0% estimated here is slightly smaller than the penalty of 19.4% esti-
mated in Kleven et al. (2019a). This is due to the fact that biological families have been reweighted to match
adoptive families.
   10 In Figure A.II in the online appendix, we replicate the analysis presented here when centering on child

births instead of child arrivals. In this case, the short-run differences between biological and adoptive fam-
ilies are larger due to the delayed arrival of adoptees. When splitting adoptees by their age at arrival, the
short-run impacts are staggered across ages as one would expect. Despite these short-run differences, how-
ever, the long-run impacts on biological and adoptive families are still very similar (and they are similar to
those estimated when centering the analysis on arrivals in Figure 1).

                                                      9
mother's education and earnings levels prior to having children. Figure A.III in the ap-
pendix investigates robustness to alternative weighting schemes. Without any reweight-
ing (Panel A), the long-run child penalty is 3.4pp larger in biological families than in adop-
tive families. Matching the samples on some observables is therefore important for the
conclusion that biology does not affect long-run penalties. Reweighting only on pre-birth
variables (Panel B) avoids any concerns about the potential endogeneity of fertility deci-
sions made after the first child. Reassuringly, this specification yields very similar results
as the baseline specification (repeated in Panel C of the figure).11


3.2        Anatomy of Child Penalties

      In this section we investigate the anatomy of the large and persistent earnings im-
pacts of both biological and adopted children. Figure 2 presents event studies of the three
underlying earnings determinants: hours worked conditional on working (Panel A), the
labor force participation rate (Panel B), and the wage rate (Panel C).
      For hours worked and the wage rate, we find virtually identical child penalties in bi-
ological and adoptive families throughout the event study window. The long-run hours
penalty is about 7% and the wage rate penalty is about 10% in both family types. The
participation penalty, on the other hand, is larger in biological families than in adoptive
families during the initial years of parenthood. But the two family types converge to the
same level over time, a long-run participation penalty of around 3-4%. Taken together,
these findings imply that the short-lived differences in earnings penalties documented in
the previous section can be explained by differences in extensive margin responses that
last for 3-4 years and then dissipate. The short-run differences in extensive margin re-
sponses are likely driven by the larger need for maternity leave among biological mothers
due to aspects like breastfeeding and health complications.
      Table 2 summarizes the graphical results presented so far. The table shows estimates
of child penalties in different labor market outcomes (earnings, hours, participation, and
  11 All  of the matching variables that we retain in the more parsimonious specification in Panel B (year
of first child, mother's age at first child, and mother's pre-child education and earnings) do matter for our
conclusions. For example, if we do not match on pre-child education and earnings, the short-run differences
between biological and adoptive mothers become larger and there are some long-run differences as well.

times 0-5), while Panel B focuses on the long run (event times 6-10). The short-run earn-
ings penalty is 3.7 percentage points larger in biological families than in adoptive families
and this difference is statistically significant. Looking at the underlying drivers of the
difference in earnings impacts, only the difference in participation impacts is statistically
significant. Turning to the long run, the differences in child penalties between biological
and adoptive mothers are small and statistically insignificant for all four outcomes. The
differences are precisely estimated, allowing us to rule out any economically significant
impact of biology on observed child penalties.


3.3     Heterogeneity in Child Penalties by Comparative Advantage

      A classic explanation for the large and persistent child penalties on women focuses on
specialization based on comparative advantage: women have a comparative advantage
in child care, while men have a comparative advantage in market work. Our results have
implications for this interpretation. The most obvious reason why women would have a
comparative advantage in child care is based on the biological link between mother and
child. The fact that only women can bear children and breastfeed almost certainly gives
them a comparative advantage in the early stages of parenthood, and it may give rise
to longer-lasting comparative advantage due to changes in earnings capacity and pref-
erences. The absence of persistent differences in child penalties between biological and
adoptive mothers run counter to these ideas. However, it is possible that comparative
advantage is important, but that the source of comparative advantage studied here (the
biological link between mother and child) is short-lived, while other sources of compar-
ative advantage are longer-lived. To investigate this point, this section presents evidence
on heterogeneity in child penalties by comparative advantage.
      Studying the role of comparative advantage requires a measure of male and female
earnings capacity within families. To avoid endogeneity of measured earnings capacity
to children, one strategy would be to divide the sample by observed earnings prior to
the arrival of children. However, selecting subsamples based on pre-child earnings may
create problems with mean reversion: If earnings consist of both permanent and transitory

                                              11
income components, we would be splitting the sample partly by transitory income shocks
rather than by comparative advantage alone. To avoid such problems, we use potential
earnings rather than actual earnings to measure comparative advantage.
    We estimate potential earnings based on Mincer regressions of earnings on education
level and experience within cells of education field. Dividing the sample into 140 different
education fields (such as "physics" or "acting"), we run the following regression within
each field
                       ln Yis =  Eduis +  1 Expis +  2 Exp2
                                                          is + Years + is ,                            (3)

where Yis is earnings of individual i in year s, Eduis is a set of education dummies (six
levels from elementary school to PhD), Expis is experience (years since graduation), and
Years is a set of year dummies. These regressions are run on the sample of men alone
(as they are unaffected by children), using the estimated coefficients to predict potential
earnings for both men and women. We then split the sample by relative female earnings
potential within families prior to the arrival of the first child (at event time -1).
    The results are shown in Figure 3. The figure shows earnings impacts in both biological
and adoptive families, split by relative female earnings potential. Panel A compares fam-
ilies below and above the median of the distribution of relative female earnings potential,
while Panel B compares families in the bottom and top quartiles of that distribution. The
difference in comparative advantage is sizeable in these sample cuts: Women in the top
quartile of relative female earnings potential contribute 61% of the total household earn-
ings potential, whereas women in the bottom quartile contribute only 38%. If comparative
advantage matters, we should see larger child penalties in families where the woman's
relative earnings potential is lower. Instead we see that child penalties are unrelated to
our proxy for comparative advantage: the long-run child penalties are very similar for
low-earning and high-earning mothers, and this holds in both biological and adoptive
families.12 This suggests against the importance of the comparative advantage channel
and is consistent with our main finding that biology has no effect on child penalties.
  12 Figure
          A.IV in the appendix shows that this finding is robust to alternative measures of relative female
earnings potential, including measures that are more forward-looking.

4    Conclusion

    A recent literature documents large child penalties in female labor market outcomes,
showing that these penalties can explain most of the remaining gender inequality in de-
veloped countries (see e.g., Kleven et al. 2019a,b). In this paper, we ask why the impacts of
children are so large and gendered, focusing on traditional explanations rooted in biology
and comparative advantage. Using Danish administrative data, we provide compelling
event study evidence on child penalties in biological and adoptive families. Despite the
existence of short-run differences in the child penalties of these two family types, they
converge to the same penalty in the long run. This is true for earnings as well as for its
underlying determinants.
    Our findings provide evidence against the importance of biological links between
mother and child for explaining child penalties. Moreover, since these biological links
represent some of the most obvious sources of comparative advantage, they provide evi-
dence against classic specialization stories. We provide further evidence on comparative
advantage, showing that child penalties are unrelated to the relative earnings potential
within families in both biological and adoptive families. Overall, this paper suggests that
child-related gender inequality (i.e., most remaining gender inequality) cannot be under-
stood through the lens of biology and incentive-based specialization, pushing towards a
greater focus on preference formation, social norms and culture.

Notes: The figure shows the impact of children ( Pt defined in equation 2) on the earnings of men and women
in biological and adoptive families, respectively. The sample of biological parents is reweighted to match
the distribution of the adoptive parents on (i) year of first child, (ii) years to second child, (iii) total number
of children, (iv) mother's age at first child, (v) mother's pre-child education, and (vi) mother's pre-child
earnings. Panel A pools all adoptees, while Panel B splits adoptees by their age at arrival. The long-run
child penalty is defined as the average difference in the impact of children between men and women across
event times 6-10. Standard errors are bootstrapped (500 replications).

Notes: The figure shows the impact of children ( Pt defined in equation 2) on the underlying determinants
of earnings for men and women in biological and adoptive families, respectively. Panel A shows the impact
on hours worked (conditional on working) using our ATP hours measure. Panel B shows the impact on
participation (positive ATP hours). Panel C shows the impact on the wage rate (conditional on working),
computed as annual earnings divided by annual ATP hours. We winsorize wage rates at 0 and the 99th per-
centile to deal with measurement error due to the fact that some workers (in particular, the self-employed)
may have large positive or negative earnings with very small ATP hours. The figure is otherwise constructed
as Panel A of Figure 1 and the sample of biological parents is reweighted in the same way. Standard errors
are bootstrapped (500 replications).

Notes: The figure is constructed in the same way as Figure 1 and shows the earnings impact of children on
men and women in biological and adoptive families, respectively. To investigate the role of comparative
advantage, the sample of women is split by relative female earnings potential within families prior to the
arrival of children (at event time -1). The earnings potential of women and men is estimated based on Mincer
regressions of earnings on education level and experience within cells of education field (as specified in eq.
3). Panel A compares women below and above the median of the distribution of relative female earnings
potential, while Panel B compares women in the bottom and top quartiles of that distribution. These splits
are done for biological and adoptive mothers separately. Standard errors are bootstrapped (500 replications).

     Notes: The table shows descriptive statistics in three samples: adoptive families, biological families, and reweighted biological families. The
     reweighted biological sample matches the distribution of the adoptive sample on the following variables: (i) year of arrival of the first child, (ii)
     years to arrival of the second child, (iii) the total number of children, (iv) the mother's age at first child (4-year bins capped at 32), (v) the mother's
     pre-child education (6 levels), and (vi) the mother's pre-child earnings (10 deciles). Years of schooling is measured 2 years prior to the arrival of
     the first child, while earnings rank is measured using average earnings 1-5 years prior to the arrival of the first child (and computed within cells
     of gender and year of first child). The adoptive and reweighted biological samples retain minor discrepancies on some of the matching variables,
     because we match on binned rather than continuous variables.

Notes: The table shows estimates of child penalties in biological and adoptive families for different labor
market outcomes (earnings, hours, participation, and wage rates) . Child penalties are defined as the impact
of children for women relative to men ( Ptwomen - Ptmen where Pt is defined in eq. 2). Panel A shows short-
run penalties (an average across event times 0-5), while Panel B shows long-run penalties (an average across
event times 6-10). Standard errors are bootstrapped (500 replications).

Notes: The figure compares our procedure for identifying foreign adoptees to the to the official records of
foreign adoptees (where the latter is available in DST data from 1988 to 2009). We identify foreign adoptees
as children that fulfill the following conditions: (1) They were born in a non-western country, (2) they have
two known parents born in a western country, (3) both parents had their legal address in Denmark (with
no emigration record) at the time the child was born, and (4) the child has a recorded entry (immigration
record) into the Danish Central Person Register after the date of birth. The figure shows that our procedure
captures the official records almost perfectly, with virtually no type I or type II errors.

children in each of the three age groups.

Notes: The left panels of this figure replicate Panel A of Figure 1 under different weighting schemes, while
the right panels show the number of children arrived in biological and adoptive families under each weight-
ing scheme. Panel A shows a specification without any reweighting of the biological sample. Panel B shows
a specification in which we reweight the biological sample using only on pre-birth variables (i.e., year of first
child, mother's age at first child, mother's pre-child education, and mother's pre-child earnings). Panel C
shows the baseline specification in which we reweight on both pre-birth variables and subsequent children
(i.e., we add years to second child and total number of children to the matching scheme).

Notes: This figure replicates Panel A of Figure 3 for alternative measures of relative female earnings po-
tential. All panels compare women above and below the median of the distribution of relative earnings
potential. Panel A repeats the baseline specification in which we measure relative female earnings poten-
tial just before the arrival of the first child (at event time -1). The others panels consider measures that are
more forward-looking (but potentially endogenous). Panel B is based on relative female earnings potential
measured 10 years after the arrival of the first child, Panel C is based on relative female earnings poten-
tial measured after 15 years of experience, while Panel D is based on relative female earnings potential
measured at age 45.
