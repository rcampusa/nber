        GOVERNMENT RELIEF FOR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT ACTION


                                  ABSTRACT

     A significant source of risk arises from uncertainty concerning future
government policy.  Government action - - tax reform, deregulation, judicial
decisions, budgetary shifts - - produces gains and losses for those who
invested under preexisting rules.  The effects of government relief -  -
compensation, grandfathering, phase-ins - - on ex ante incentives and risk
bearing are examined in a model in which private insurance is taken into
account.  It is demonstrated that government relief is inefficient, even when
private insurance is subject to moral hazard, because relief shields
individuals from some of the effects of their actions.

    A significant source of risk arises from uncertainty concerning future
government action.    Government action produces gains and losses --   often
amounting to billions of dollars --   for   those who invested under preexisting

rules.'   Government policy with regard to these effects (often referred to as

"transition policy") varies widely: full compensation for takings of real
property, partial relief through grandfathering and phase-ins for tax reform
and deregulation (in some instances but not others), and no relief for most

budgetary shifts and changes in common law tort rules (as in the products

liability context).


    Risk associated with government action, despite its prevalence and

magnitude, has not been recognized as presenting a general problem, and little

attention has been devoted to analyzing the effects and efficiency of

government relief.2   For example, in Feldstein's (1976a, 1976b) influential

analysis of losses arising from tax reform,     a policy of compensation or other

relief is advocated but no systematic framework in support is offered.     Among

the questions that must be addressed in analyzing government relief are
whether insurance markets are able to provide appropriate compensation and how

relief affects investment incentives.


    Section 1 presents a model of the purest form of government relief:

compensation (partial or complete).     Private insurance markets are assumed to

be present.   Because such insurance is available, any allocation of risk that




   Because anticipated change is reflected in pre-reform market values, the
problem addressed here arises only when future policy is uncertain.   In
addition, any government action that affects the probabilities of future
change, including action not entailing reform -- such as defeat of legislation
or an announcement making future enactment more or less likely -- should be
included in the analysis, for such events similarly produce gains and losses
(unless complete relief is anticipated).
2
   Most discussion arises in the context of tax reform, where inquiry
typically is limited to considerations of horizontal equity. The relationship
between such appeals and the perspective offered here is considered in Kaplow
(1989a)

can be achieved with government relief can also be achieved in the absence of

relief.    The provision of relief, however, shields investors from some of the

consequences of their actions, which distorts ex ante investment decisions.

Even when insurance coverage is partial due to the problem of moral hazard and

even when the level of relief is less than the level of insurance coverage

that individuals would otherwise have purchased, relief has this distorting

effect because, at the margin, a portion of the incentive cost is borne by the

government.


    Section 2 considers the range of application of these results.          First, it

notes that gains produced by government action are subject to the same

analysis as losses, suggesting that windfall taxation should be viewed
symmetrically with compensation (and similarly for other methods by which

gains and losses may be relieved) .       Second, the analysis is applied to methods
other than outright compensation by which governments mitigate the effects of

changes in policy.     Crandfathering, delayed or partial implementation, and

phase-ins have the same cx ante incentive effects as compensation schemes that

provide equivalent levels of relief.        In addition, such mechanisms are

generally more inefficient than direct compensation due to their effect on ex

post incentives.     The analysis permits an efficiency ranking of mitigation

schemes.    Third, the case for full retroactive application of some new

policies is explored.        Finally, the assumptions on which the analysis rests

are examined.    Section 3 offers concluding remarks.




                1.   Ex Ante Analysis of Government Relief


                        A.     The Model and First-Best Outcome


    It is assumed that identical risk-averse individuals choose a level of

investment, which determines net benefits in each of two states -- one

corresponding to government action and one to inaction --         having a known
probability.3    Individuals also choose a level of insurance protection that


   The probability of government action is assumed to be fixed. That the
availability of relief may affect government decisionmaking is considered in

                                          -2-
covers a portion of their loss, for which they pay an actuarially fair
premium.4             The government is committed to a policy of providing relief,

financed by a lump-sum tax, for a portion of losses.


          U           individual's utility as a function of wealth; U' > 0, U" < 0;
          k =         individual's        level of investment;

      b(k)            net benefits (private and social) from investment in state i; the

                      b(k) = bh(k) =      Ab #  o;            o,
                                                    where ab — b0   b3;                             -




          q =         portion   of loss (b0-b1) covered by private insurance in state 1;

                  = private       insurance premium;

              g   = portion     of loss (b3-b1) compensated by the government in state 1;

                  =   lump-sum tax, or              compensation premium"; and

          p =         probability    of state a.


An individual's expected utility is

(1)      EU           (l-p)U(b0(k)    -         -   r)   +   PWbaOo)         -        -    r   +    (q    +   g)Ab(k))
                      (l-p)U0 + PUa

where Ua and U0 denote utility evaluated in the states with and without
government action, respectively.                             The first-best levels of g, q, and k can be

derived from (1) by substituting pgAb                              -   -   the expected cost of government
compensation --             for    r and pqab -- the expected cost of insurance payments --

section 2D.  It is also possible that individuals could influence this
probability (through lobbying, bribery, or investment decisions that affect
subsequent government actions).

   It is assumed that insurance companies can observe individuals' aggregate
purchases of insurance.   See Arnott and Stiglitz (1987), Pauly (1974).

   Given the stated conditions on the second derivatives, if such a k existed,
it would be the optimum and there would be no moral hazard.
6
    Ifthe optimal investment given no insurance is such that Ab — 0, then the
optimum entails no insurance.   In this simple case, there is no risk to insure
against in the first instance.


                                                               -3-
Wealth must thus be equal in the states with and without government action;

hence, q ÷ g               1.     The optimal k is determined by

(4)                —    (l-p)U[b          -    pith']   +   pU[b           -   pAb' + Ab'] — 0.

Because wealth is equal in the two states, the first-best level of k satisfies

(5)     (l-p)b +           pb        0.


This means that the first-best level of k maximizes the expected return.


                                                 B.     First-Best Insurance


      There are two instances in which a first-best outcome would be achieved

with private insurance in the absence of government relief.                                        First, when

insurance companies can observe states                             -   -       whether or not government action
occurs     -   -       a first-best outcome can be achieved through a state-contingent

lump-sum transfer.                 The transfer is lump-sum in that the amount is independent

of the gains or losses, and thus independent of the level of investment as

well.      Clearly such a scheme has no distorting effect on incentives, while it

can equalize wealth in the two states.

       Second, when insurance companies can observe the level of investment (ex

ante or ex post), premiums or coverage can be made a function of investment                                           in

a manner that fully counteracts moral hazard.                                       For example, a first-best

outcome is achieved with full coverage (q = 1)                                      and a premium ir(k) = pqEth(k).


       In both cases, government relief would offer no benefits in allocating

risk and would distort ex ante incentives.7                                      The intuition is that investors

base their decisions only on their own exposure to loss --                                        that   portion of the

loss uncompensated by the government -                            - rather          than on the total loss.


       To demonstrate this, consider the case in which states are observable.                                         It

can readily be demonstrated that, for any g, insurance would entail premiums

of ir0 =       p(l-g)Ab         and lTa       = -(1-p)(l-g)txb,            with q     0.   That is,   the investor


      If relief were lump-sum                     --    that   is, independent of the level of the loss               -   -

itrelief.
     would cause no distortion.  This is not, however, the typical form of
           (E.g., with takings for a highway, it would involve identical
compensation regardless of the value of improvements, unless it were possible
to individualize such lump-sum payments.  Insurance accomplishes this result
when states are observable by contracting in advance for a suitable level of
coverage.)

                                                                 -4-
pays p(l-g)Ab in both states, which finances a recovery in the event of

government action of (l-g)txb, producing equal wealth in the two states.                             The

first-order condition for k is determined taking g,                   r,   q,   ir0,   and ir8 as given:


(6)         =   (1-p)IJ(b}       ÷ pU(b ÷ gab') = 0,             or


(7)     (l-p)b, +   pb   —    -pgAb'


Consider the case of txb' >            0   --   i.e.,   government action is associated with a

lower marginal return to investment.6                   In contrast to the first-best level of

k, given by (5)      investors will choose lower expected returns for g > 0 than

for g      0, because they take into account that increased investment will

increase their expected payment from the government by pgAb'                            Clearly, g         0


is the unique optimum.           Moreover, the greater the portion of the loss

compensated by government relief, the greater will be the resulting

inefficiency.


       It can be demonstrated that precisely the same results follow for the case

in which levels of investment rather than states are observable.


       Proposition 1:        If states or investment levels are observed by insurance

companies, the first-best outcome is achieved with no relief (g =                          0).
Moreover, g = 0 is the unique optimum, and sign dEU/dg                          -sign g, for

       Proof:   See Kaplow (1987a).

       Without government relief, the investor is able to join forces with the

informed insurance company to alleviate all risk and still achieve a first-

best level of investment.              The investor's reaction to anticipated government

relief involves both insurance and investment decisions.                        In these cases,

private insurance will fully, and without moral hazard, cover all of the loss

not covered by relief.           The investor and insurance company, however, have no



      For b' C 0, the direction of the distortion reverses.
   For g outside this range, expected utility will be less than for the
corresponding endpoints, but the fall in expected utility need not be monotone
unless further restrictions are made with respect to the b1 functions.

incentive to offset the incentive distortion, because it is borne entirely by

the government (r and g are taken as given)


    Consider the applicability of first-best insurance.             For government

actions that are limited in numbet and readily specified in advance (and
distinguishable ex post), a state-contingent contract should be feasible.'°

Investment levels might also be observable, at least in part.             Thus, with the

prospect that the government will level a building in order to build a

highway, insurance premiums could be proportional to the value of the

building.


     Note also that the results for first-best insurance will hold when

investors are risk-neutral.            In this case, investors need no insurance, so

observability of states or investment levels is not required.             This case is

important primarily because, with many government actions, gains and losses

fall largely on investors in widely held corporations, most of whom hold

diversified portfolios.         In such cases, as a rough approximation, modeling

tnvestors as risk-neutral might be appropriate.11


                                  C.      Second-Best Insurance


     When the assumptions of Proposition 1 are not fully applicable - - because

states or investment levels are costly to specify by contract or verify -- one

has a two-stage moral hazard problem.12             The simple moral hazard problem [see




   For other actions, it may be possible to approximate such results by use
of a proxy variable.  For example, with policy changes affecting the prospects
of a defense contractor, myriad possible actions might be indexed by the size
of the defense budget, or that portion of the budget devoted to a particular
sector, such as fighter aircraft.
    If the government action imposed systematic risk (which often           will not be
the case), it should be noted that, in principle, the government            is in no
better position to absorb such risk than are financial markets.             See the
discussion in Kaplow (1987a) of the applicability of the results            of Arrow and
Lind (1970) in this context.
    In this model with only two states, one associated with no loss, the
assumption that states are unobservable is unrealistic; more generally, it
often will be possible to infer something about states or investment levels
from the amount of the loss.   The assumption of unobservability corresponds to
an extreme case; the two-state model is retained for simplicity of exposition.
It will be clear that many of the particular results and all the core
intuitions hold more generally.   For a model of a context in which complete
unobservability is plausible, see Kaplow (1989b).

                                                -6-
Arrow (1963), Holmstrom (1979), Shavell (1979)] is that involving the
insurance compsny and investor when there is no government relief.             The

greater the level of coverage, the greater will be the degree to which

investment decisions are distorted.             Investors choose the level of coverage

that optimally trades off incentive and risk-bearing costs.


      The second stage of the problem is created by the prospect of government

relief.       That prospect affects not only investment but the insurance decision

as well.       Thus, a complete analysis of the problem in the general case must

take into account the maximizing response in the insurance decision, and how

it,   in combination with government relief, will affect investment incentives.

Since it will no longer be the case that the allocation of risk will be
identical (or unimportant) for different levels of government relief, it is

necessary to assess the trade-off between risk spreading and incentives.


      Despite the greater complexity of the problem, the basic results emerge

largely intact.             It is still the case that government relief induces investors

to behave as though only the uncompensated portion of the loss were incurred.

As a result, in considering a marginal increase in the level of insurance

coverage, individuals receive all the benefits with regard to the reduction in

risk-bearing costs but bear, through the increase in premium, only that

fraction of incentive costs that affects expected insurance payments; they

ignore the effect on the expected cost of government relief.


      It is helpful to state explicitly the government's optimization problem

for the situation just described,

                                               -7-
      In analyzing this problem, it is useful to think of the investor as

choosing total coverage (q + g)             ,   even though the insurance premium will cover
only the portion paid by the insurance company.                           Thus construed, it is clear

that private insurance can mimic any level of relief:                            For any g, where q and
k refer to the levels of insurance coverage and investment that would be

chosen, constder the alternative of no relief, insurance coverage of g + q,

and the corresponding level of investment, denoted as i.                            It   can readily be

demonstrated that EUI&qk              EUI08+q.j and k =             I13   That is, any level of

relief is equivalent to no relief combined with a corresponding increase in

insurance coverage 14


      The immediate implication is that g                   0 is an optimum, since the utility

achievable at any g #         0    can also be achieved at g = 0.                Uniqueness is

demonstrated in the Appendix.               The method involves noting that, at any optimum

for which g # 0,        the first-order condition for q must hold not only for the

stated g, but also for the equivalent scheme involving no relief, which is not

possible.


      Proposition 2:       No relief, g = 0, is the unique optimum, even when states
and investment levels are not observed by insurance companies.

      The intuition behind the inefficiency of government relief in this case is

further illuminated by examining the first-order conditions for the private

maximizing decisions.             For optimization over k:


(9)
       dEll
              =   (l-p)Ub + pU[b +              (q + g)Ab'] = 0.


Investment is affected by total coverage (q + g).                            Note, however, that the

incentive cost corresponding to insurance                   -   -   unlike   that corresponding to


'  Begin by considering the possibility that    = pqt1b. It is clear that
(8Bii) will be identical for both problems, leading to the same choice of
investment.   (This result holds if the solution for (8Bii) is unique, as it
will be in most cases of interest. See note 15. For other cases, it would be
sufficient to assume that, if multiple global optima for k exist, the same
selection rule is used in the inttial and transposed problems.) Thus, iv                             will
satisfy (SBi), and the conclusions follow.
14
   Another way of viewing this result is to observe that the government
optimization problem (choosing g) is the same as the private optimization
subproblem (choosing q) when g = 0 - compare (8) and (8B)
                                                  -          - except that the       -

former problem has an added constraint.

relief    -   -   is   reflected in individuals' insurance decisions because the premium

they must pay is determined by the level of coverage they select.                           To see

this, determine dtj/dq from (8E), substituting for                      ic   (using constraint (8Ei))

and noting that k is a function of q whereas (8E) has g taken as given.

where kq denotes the derivative of k with respect to q.                          The sum of the first

     The first term of (11) indicates the benefits from further equalizing

wealth between the two states.                 If government action results in a gain or loss

that is not fully mitigated (that is, if q + g < 1), this term will be
positive. 16


     ab'kq is the moral hazard effect.                    Consider the case in which Ab'       is

positive.'7            This indicates that the marginal return to investment is greater

in the state without government action.                        In that instance, one would expect an

increase in the level of insurance coverage (which applies in the state

involving government action) to cause an increase in the level of investment,

by making the marginal return in that state, as faced by the investor with
insurance coverage, closer to the return in the state involving no action.18




   As explored in Arnott and Stiglitz (1988) and Grossman and Hart (1983)
for this substitution necessarily to be valid, the solution to (9) must be a
unique maximum.  The second-order condition (see note 36) is strictly negative
for q + g E [0,1], which covers most cases of interest. This complication has
little effect on what follows, as explored further in Kaplow (198]a).

   When Ab is positive (negative), wealth is lower (higher) in state a,                             so
marginal utility is higher (lower) state a.
17
   When Ab' is negative, the argument to follow suggests that the sign for kg
is negative.


                                                        -9-
     Optimal private insurance thus trades off risk-bearing and incentive

costs.   Government relief distorts this decision because the moral hazard term

is weighted by q rather than q + g:             Only that portion of moral hazard

relating to private insurance is reflected in the investor's insurance

decision.


     It is also instructive to examine the level of private insurance that

would be selected for any given level of government relief.


     Proposition 3:       If government relief is less than complete, insurance

coverage is positive but insufficient to provide complete compensation.                    If

government relief is complete, no insurance is purchased.             That is, g < 1

q E (0, l-g) and & =      1      q =   19
     Proof:   See the Appendix.


     The intuition of Proposition 3 allows one to understand the effects of

relief on private insurance decisions, and therefore on investment as well.

If government relief is less than complete, insurance coverage will be

positive: When q = 0, a marginal increase in q reduces risk-bearing costs and

imposes no private incentive costs.             Note that q > 0 even when g > q*, where

q* is the optimal level of insurance in the absence of relief.               That is,

additional coverage is purchased even when government relief already exceeds

the coverage one would have purchased in its absence.             Yet, no matter how high

the level of partial relief, one will not be induced to purchase insurance

that, combined with relief, provides complete coverage:             At q —   l-g   (i.e.

full coverage for one's exposure), a marginal reduction in q entails no risk-

bearing costs and reduces private incentive costs.20


18  Due to subtle income effects, this relationship need not hold in general.
For many cases of interest, a sufficient condition would be that U is a
nonincreasing absolute risk aversion utility function.   See Kaplow (1987a).

' Also, g > 1         q       (l-g, 0).
20
    For g — 1, there is no further risk to spread, and q # 0 imposes two
costs:   It creates risk not otherwise present and it creates private incentive
costs.   Note that, although q < 0 would diminish total incentive costs, such
costs are borne by the government, so there is no private benefit; in fact
there will be a private cost if q # 0, since, for purposes of private
insurance, incentive costs are defined relative to a baseline that takes g as
given.


                                            -    10   -
     More precise characterizations require further restrictions because of

subtle wealth effects.            In the simplest cases, assuming a nonincreasing

absolute risk aversion utility function, Kaplow (198Th) demonstrates that

total coverage (q + g) is greater when (positive) relief is offered than when

there is rio relief.           The reason is that, for any level of positive relief, the

risk-spreading benefits of marginally increasing total coverage beyond q* are

the same as in the case of no relief, but the incentive costs, at the margin,

are strictly less when relief is positive.                 Thus, even though one would expect

insurance coverage to be less the greater is the level of government relief,

the reduction in private coverage (relative to q*) does not fully offset

government relief.         Note that even when relief is less than q*, individuals

purchase enough insurance to produce total coverage in excess of q*.


     Government relief could have been mimicked by greater private coverage

(with no relief)        but was rejected by the investor because the greater risk

spreading was not worth the incentive cost.                Because there is no externality

in the private insurance decision, government relief cannot improve upon it.21


                         ID.     Market and Government Risks Compared

     It is commonly stated that government relief against losses induced by

market forces   -   -   interpreted    broadly to include changes in technology and

consumer taste as well as natural disasters and acts of foreign governments                              -   -

is   inefficient.       Similarly, opposition to windfall taxation --              e.g.   ,   of
extraordinary gains in the case of a successful new product                -   -   is   based on the

fact that such windfalls are merely the tail of a probability distribution of

returns that was part of the ex ante inducement for investment.                         This section

has offered a model equally applicable to market and government risks.                             The

intuition is that, just as a firm might overinvest if losses caused, e.g. , by

an unexpected decrease in demand, are expected to be mitigated by the

government, the same effect follows if similar losses caused, e.g., by



21  This does not rule out all government action, such as taxes and subsidies
applied to the relevant activities. See Arnott and Stiglitz (1986).    For most
instances of government risk, however, it does not appear that there will
generally be a plausible tax/subsidy scheme to offset the moral hazard
produced by private arrangements and exacerbated by government relief.


                                              -   11   -
increased competition due to decegulation, are to be mitigated.               For victualiy

any government policy change imaginable, one can identify a corresponding

action in the market that would produce the same effects on investors.




                       2.        Extensions and Discussion


                            A.    Symmetry of Gains and Losses


    All of the analysis thus far (and to follow) is equally applicable to

gains and to losses.     When Lb > 0, g > 0 means that losses are (partially)

compensated.   Cams correspond to Ab < 0, in which case g > 0 involves

windfall taxation.     Thus, at noted in the preceding section, mitigation of

gains tends to produce underinvestment.

    This symmetry should be emphasized because in many contexts involving

government risk it is far more common to hear cries for relief for losses due

to government action, but no such demands that gains be taxed away or

otherwise mitigated.     Much academic commentary as well has proceeded as though

mitigation of losses were the only issue.               In a few contexts, such as the

windfall profits tax accompanying oil price deregulation, gains have been

explicitly taken into account.

    Overall, regardless of which concern dominates in a particular instance,

it is important to recognize that both the incentive and risk effects are

fully symmetric with respect to whether gains or losses are involved.               Since

most government actions involve both gains and losses, this observation is

relevant to virtually all considerations of government risk.


                B.   Alternative Mechanisms for Government Relief


    Rather than pure schemes of compensation (or windfall taxation),
mechanisms that directly nullify a government action to some degree are more

common.   Grandfathering consists of an exemption of preexisting investment.

Partial (scaled-back) and delayed implementation are also employed.               Both

reduce the impact of government action, and thus the gains and losses



                                           -   12   -
imposed.22   Phase-ins are a hybrid, in which the degree of implementation

increases with the passage of time.       Further combinations (e.g., partial

grandfathering, which may expire or be phased-out after a period of time) are

possible.


      There are three incentive effects, one ex ante and two ex post, to

consider.    The most important point is that all relief mechanisms are like

pure compensation in their effect on ex ante incentives.      Although the model

of section 1 purported to be about compensation (and windfall taxation), it

covers these other schemes as well.       For example, grandfathering, no

implementation ("partial" implementation at a zero level), and infinite delay

each correspond to full compensation.       Intermediate versions of each mechanism

correspond to partial compensation; since the model was general as to levels

of relief, the results are immediately applicable.23

      While all mechanisms are qualitatively similar with regard to their ex
ante incentive effects, their cx post incentive effects differ.       First, note

that grandfathering and other direct mitigation schemes tend to be more

distorting than equivalent degrees of direct compensation (and windfall



22 Moreover, because of typical nonlinearities concerning the effects of risk
and the returns to implementing a policy, it might seem plausible that a
favorable trade-off could be achieved.   If the optimal level of implementation
--   i.e.,
         ignoring concerns relating to incidental gains and losses -- is
characterized by zero marginal net benefits, the loss from modestly scaling
back might be quite small.   In contrast, risk-bearing costs rise
disproportionately with the magnitude of gains and losses.   Some such argument
is needed to explain why, if partial reduction or modest delay of a policy
change were desirable, it would not follow that complete abandonment would be
even better.

    Zodrow (1981, qualified in 1985) has correctly noted that, because of the
likely decreasing marginal net benefits associated with implementing various
policies, immediate partial implementation is probably preferable to a delay
that similarly mitigates losses from government action, since delay might be
expected to cause a full proportional reduction in net benefits of new policy.
As noted in the text to follow, such considerations are secondary in that they
(partially) address only one of three effects of such mitigation, the others
of which are generally decisive against both forms of relief.
23
    Some modifications are necessary to account for the differing contours of
alternative strategies.   For example, it is well-known that complete
grandfathering amounts to more than full compensation because of the scarcity
effect.   This can simply be modeled as g > 1.   The only relevant complication
is that the relief offered by some mechanisms may not be a uniform proportion
of the loss, requiring the use of a more complex (nonlinear) compensation
function to make the relevant comparison.    For more details, see Kaplow
(1987a)


                                      -    13   -
taxation) in terms of their ex post effect on old investment.                     For example, it

is more efficient to compensate directly for the decreased market value

created by a Pigouvian tax than to grandfather, because the latter approach

destroys the corrective effect of the tax on future output.                     In some instances

(including many in the income tax context) there may be no such future effects

once the past investment decision has been made; in all others, pure

compensation/taxation schemes will dominate these alternatives (unless

administrative cost considerations alter the balance)24


     With respect to ex post effects for new investment, grandfathering schemes

differ from delay or partial implementation (to an extent achieving the same

degree of relief).          Because grandfathering, unlike the latter schemes, does

not provide any relief for post-reform investment, it is more efficient in

that it avoids an additional cx post distortion: that is, it achieves the
benefits of the government action as to new investment sooner or to a greater

extent.     It is thus difficult to justify, except on administrative grounds,
most delay or partial implementation schemes commonly observed in many
contexts, since they could be converted into equivalent grandfathering

schemes -


     The conclusion is that all mechanisms for relief are subject to the same

analysis with regard to the central issue examined here: the efficiency of ex

ante decisions.         In addition, when government relief is to be provided, the

available mechanisms can be ranked by the inefficiency they produce, making

possible equivalent relief at less cost.


                                    C.   Retroactive Application


     Thus far, the analysis has indicated the efficiency of inunediste, full

implementation with no other government relief.                     In some instances, however,



24
   Grandfathering and delayed or partial implementation schemes avoid the
need to value particular investments, and thus are typically simpler.   In
addition, delayed or partial implementation may be simpler than
grandfathering, the latter requiring that one distinguish old from new
investment, which could be complicated in some contexts. Interestingly, this
administrative ranking is the reverse of the ranking on incentive grounds,
although the simplest scheme of all -- no mitigation -- is also the best in
terms of incentives.


                                                   -   14   -
the ex ante analysis implies that retroactive application would be efficient.
For example, if an activity is found to have negative external effects that

have existed for some time, it would be optimal not only to tax future
production (or otherwise regulate the activity) but to charge for the past

harm caused.   The anticipation of such retroactive application is necessary to

align ex ante incentives, particularly since private actors will sometimes

have had (or might have been able to obtain) better information than the

government at the time their previous investment decisions were made.               Common

law tort liability --   e.g.   for newly discovered hazardous activities        -   -   often
functions in this manner.


    Retroactive application is efficient when new information available to
government decisionrnakers suggests that past circumstances were different from

what the government previously believed.            By contrast, it is inefftcient where

circumstances themselves have changed - -       for   example, where changed water flow

patterns make discharges that were harmless in the past detrimental in the

future.


    This dichotomy is illuminated by considering a hybrid case.           Suppose that

a new analysis indicates that a highway should have been built twenty years

ago, which would have entailed leveling a set of buildings.            It would be

inefficient to tax the interim earnings on investments in such buildings

because, given that the highway was not built, the return on such buildings

was socially as well as privately valuable.           If building the highway is still

desirable, it would be efficient to level the buildings now, without

compensation for future earnings.    Given the actual timing of the highway

project, this policy provides investors, ex ante, with an earnings stream

reflecting the social value of investment in buildings in the path of the

future highway.   The treatment of this hybrid case arises naturally from

understanding that the new information was, by assumption, relevant to the

value of the buildings only insofar as it led the government to build the

highway.   That event constitutes a change in ctrcumstances as of the time the

highway is built, making applicable the branch of the analysis under which

retroactive application is inefficient.




                                       -   15   -
     Note that retroactivity does not merely present a special case.          Rather,

the analysis of this issue is necessary to define 'immediate" implementation,

and thus the meaning of "no relief" as well, since delay, as section B noted,

is itself a form of relief.


                           D.   Premises of the Analysis25


     1.    The policy concerning government relief.        At the core of the ex ante

approach is the assumption that the government relief to be provided is fully

anticipated.     This is equivalent to assuming that the government consistently

and credibly follows a given relief policy, at least in each identifiable

context,     If inconsistent policies could be maintained, it would be optimal,

ex ante, to announce no relief, but, ex post, to remedy any gap between the

partial relief obtained under second-best private arrangements and full

coverage.25     Presuiably, such a policy could not be credibly maintained.


     Given the repeat nature of the process of policy change in many contexts

and the wide range of institutional mechanisms, it seems plausible that a
government could commit to a consistent policy toward relief.           If so, the

analysis here suggests which one would be most efficient.           Note, however, that

the long-run optimal policy is not necessarily appropriate ex post when no

such policy has previously been announced.           But in considering any

prescription based on ex ante effects, one must address how to reach the long

run and whether action, ex post, consistent with the policy one ultimately

seeks to establish is helpful or necessary in establishing the desired
reputation.27


     2.    Optimality of underlying government action.        The welfare

characterizations (in contrast to the analysis determining behavior) assumed
that there was no divergence between the private and social returns to


25
     Kaplow (1987a) addresses these and other assumptions in greater depth.
26
   Thus, government relief poses the general time-consistency problem
explored in Kydland and Prescott (1977)
27
    If any commitment could be made credibly, the optimal policy would be to
announce immediately that, forever after, there would be no relief (the long-
run optimal policy), but to provide full compensation/windfall taxation for
the losses and gains engendered by the announcement itself.


                                        -   16   -
investment.      This assumption will often hold regardless of the desirability of

the underlying government action.             For example,        the social value of buildings

destroyed for a highway project is zero after their destruction regardless of

the wisdom of the project.

        In other instances, the efficiency analysis is dependent upon the
desirability of the new policy, as when the value of an investment is reduced

by a Pigouvian tax.      Then        the welfare results for relief require the further

assumption that the government action was,                   tn relevant respects, desirable.

Assuming the opposite      -   -   that   most or all policy changes are undesirable              -   -


leads to a simple contrary prescription: government mitigation, as by infinite
delays in implementation, that maximally disrupts all change.                           The efficient

government policy assumption, where necessary for the welfare analysis, serves

to highlight optimal relief policy as an adjunct to optimal underlying

substantive policy.28

        The model also assumes that the policy toward relief does not influence

the determination and implementation of underlying policies.                           This need not be

the case.      It is sometimes suggested that requiring relief would impede bad

reforms or make good reforms politically feasible                   -   -   although   the opposite

effects are also possible.            For example, it may be that a government agency

undervalues the costs of its projects, stnce costs are not directly borne by

the relevant decisioninakers.             Although many difficulties with this argument

are often overlooked -- most obviously that benefits may also be undervalued
-
    -   the result of accepting it is that the complete government problem entails
an incentive trade-off:            Further relief requirements would improve the

agency's incentives at the expense of private incentives.                        As another example,

government relief will facilitate enactment of reforms when powerful losers

need to be bought off.             Thus, in the context of deregulation, some suggest

that entrenched interests be bribed into accepting the more efficient policy.

The ex ante analysis indicates that more than distribution is at stake if such


28  In addition, the analysis in such instances implicitly assumes that
efficiency rather than distributional objectives motivate the government
action.   Relief is relatively uninteresting in the latter case: Full relief
for a tax scheme used to finance welfare programs would tax back all the
welfare benefits and compensate losers by returning all tax payments.


                                                -   17   -
pay-offs are to become a habit.     See Kaplow (1987b).         4oreover, within the

political process itself, an ex ante perapective may suggest that the

willingness ex post to buy off such opposition will increase ex ante rent
seeking that initially creates such inefficient policies.            See McKenzie

(1986).


     3.   Additional market imperfections.          The analysis adnitted no market

imperfections other than the information problems producing moral hazard.

Transaction and administrative costs may also be relevant.            Arrangements for

each of the myriad possible risks may be quite expensive through individual

insurance contracts, necessarily made ex ante, whereas government relief,

being ex post, need only be made available when government action results.               Of

course, the same can be said (as with most other imperfections) for

conventional market risks, where the argument for government mitigation may he

as strong.29   One response is a single insurance policy that covers a wide

range of risks.     In addition, such transaction costs, combined with the moral

hazard problems emphasized here, may contribute to the prevalence of
diversification rather than particularized insurance to deal with a large

range of observed risks, both market- and government-induced.

     The model also assumed that individuals accurately assess risk.            Consider

instead the extreme case where individuals mistakenly believe the probability

of action to be zero.    There would be no adverse ex ante incentive effects

from government relief (investment decisions are already distorted) , and

private insurance would not have been purchased (because any premium would
seem too high).3°    This parallels one case for disaster relief.         But

compulsory insurance is more efficient than simple ex post relief,31 as the



   One difference, noted above, is that relief through grandfathering, delay,
and direct mitigation is probably simpler than compensation; analogs are not
available with regard to some private risks.
30
    The government having better information does not itself justify relief,
as the information may be made available to private actors. The example
assumes transmission is too costly, due, for example, to psychological
characteristics that limit processing of information that comes in simple,
summary form.   See Kunreuther et al. (1978); Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky
(1979).
31
   To avoid the incentive problem examined here for any who perceive a
posittve probability of incurring a loss, the premium charged would have to

                                       -   18   -
requited ex ante payment of the premium in many contexts will induce mote
efficient ex ante investment even by actors who continue to misperceive the

probabilities.      For example, one contemplating construction of a building in a

flood plain or in a zone likely to be condemned soon for a highway would act

diffetently if required to pay in advance an insurance premium reflecting the

probability of adverse events.               Note, therefore, that government insurance --

voluntary     or compulsory --    is       fundamentally different from government relief.


        The model also ignored problems of adverse selection, which, unlike moral

hazard, may suggest the efficiency of government relief.32                             Adverse selection

only arises, however, when probabilities are specific to individuals and known

only to them, both unlikely with govetnment policy changes of general

applicability.       It is possible that adverse selection problems could act in

synergy with moral hazard in some contexts.                          For example, a firm may have

unique knowledge as to the likelihood its products will be banned or the

magnitude of loss that will result, in large part because its actions in

researching and developing the product                 -   -       actions   affecting this probability

-
    -   generate private information.



                                 3. Concluding Remarks


        This investigation indicates that government relief of all forms                         -   -


whether for gains or losses        -   -    distorts       the efficiency of ex ante decisions

concerning risk spreading and incentives in the same way that government

relief for market risks would distort behavior.                              In many instances, such

relief distorts investment incentives in the process of achieving risk

mitigation that private parties could have accomplished efficiently -- as
where investors can diversify their holdings or enter into first-best

insurance arrangements.       The result is that the benefits of market

arrangements are discarded to an extent that rises with the level of telief.

moral hazard.     See   note 21.

relief distorts the trade-off between risk and incentives.


   The problem of government risk arises in a wide range of contexts.33                      With

evolutions in common law tort doctrine, it is common for there to be no

relief, and somettmes retroactive application, as when damages are assessed

for prior harm caused by acts not previously viewed as violating the law.                     For

takings, there is full compensation (though virtually no taxation of gains).

The most plausible justification for this practice may relate to concerns

about the incentives of government actors.34             For tax reform and regulatory

reform, the wide mix   -   -   grandfathering,      phase-ins, and no relief   -   - might   best

be explained by the balance of political forces, although the analysis here

casts doubt on the efficiency of such relief and suggests that, if
unavoidable, such pay-offs often may be accomplished more efficiently by

choosing different mechanisms.         For budgetary shifts35 and many other

government actions, there is no relief, perhaps because many such policy

changes are seen as more akin to market risks for which government assistance

is less common.   Previously, it has not been recognized that these widely

varying contexts raised many of the same questions.

    When substantial government relief is to be offered, whether because the

assumptions of the model do not apply or because political forces make relief

unavoidable, the analysis here offers three insights.              First, charging a

premium ex ante may help preserve incentives, as illustrated with disaster

relief and takings.    Second, banning supplementary insurance may avoid the

inefficiency that arises from the maximizing response that entails additional

private risk mitigation.        Such analysis might be applied to government



   These examples and others are considered further in Kaplow (1986, 1987a,
1987b).  For partial analyses of the example of government takings, see also
Blume and Rubinfeld (1984) and Blume, Rubinfeld, and Shapiro (1984).

   When the constitutional requirement of just compensation was adopted,
insurance and other financial markets were not well developed.   Nearly full
compensation may well have been efficient in many contexts, viewed solely in
terms of risk and incentives.   Fears of abuse of power, however, more directly
relate to the origins of the provision.

   Government contracting is also amenable to the analysis presented here,
although additional considerations involvtng asymmetric information must be
taken into account.

insurance programs, such as Medicare.    Third, carefully selecting among relief
policies may limit inefficiency, as mechanisms that provide equivalent relief

generally give rise to different incentive costs.

                                Proposition 2: Proof of Uniqueness


      At a global optimum, g, the first-order condition for q (11) must hold.

The discussion of (8) implies that it must also hold for ( — 0, 4 — g +

since g is assumed to be a global optimum.                      Moreover, EU —      and k —   , so
(11) can equal zero in both cases only if qk

      Taking the derivative of the first-order condition (9) with respect to q

and regrouping yields

(Al) kq{(l-p)Ubg + (1-p)bUg[b - pqAb'] + pU[b                             + (q + g)ab"] +

               + p[b + (q + g)ab'U[b + (q + g                     -   pq)abn]]

           =   pab(1-p)bUg       -   pUAb'   -   pab(l-p)[b       + (q + g)Ab']U.


It simplifies matters and aids interpretation to separate the terms

corresponding to Ukk, which denotes d2EU/dk2.36                       The bracketed term on the left

side of (Al) thus becomes


(A2) Ukk -      pqAb'[(l-p)bUg        + p(b + (q + g)Ab']U].



Using this result,          (Al) can be rewritten as

(A3) kqtUkk - qG]           U


The discussion of (8) implies that 0, 0, and Ukk are identical for both

scenarios because each term depends only on q + g, U, and k.                        Therefore, we

can equate

(A4) kq[Ukk       -   q9}   q[Ukk - q9].


Factoring, we have

From the requirement that qk =                    kq,       it follows that q —                        Recalling that

       g + q,    the conclusion is that g = 0.

                                             Proof of Proposition 3


       Begin with the case of g c 1.                    q — 0 can be ruled out by reconsidering the

first-order condition for maximization over q:


(11) p(l-p)Ab(TJ            -   U)    -   pqAb'kqlJ'    =       0.


For q C (l-g), q + g C 1, which implies that the first term is positive:
First, note that the difference in wealth between the two states is

(q + g    -    1)ab.       Therefore, zlh > 0 (b < 0) implies that the difference in

marginal utilities is positive (negative).                                   At q — 0,        (11)   is positive.


       For g     1, consider q C 0 as a possible optimum.                                 Let k be the optimal

investment given q.               Compare the utility level thus resulting with the utility

produced by the same k and q                     0.     The difference in expected wealth between

the two cases is simply -it + pqb, which equals zero (8Bi).                                           ut for g      1 and
q < 0,    the spread in wealth is greater than with q = 0, so expected utility

must be less.          Therefore, q C 0 also cannot be an optimum.


       Finally, consider the possibility that q + g                                  1.        First, if q + g = 1,

wealth is equal in the two states, so the first term in (11) equals zero.                                                The

sign of the second term can be determined from (Al), noting that q + g =                                             1


implies b =                     The right side terms in (Al) are zero except for the



"   This derivation implicitly assumed qkq ' 0, U ' 0, and that qkq arid qfcq
are not both infinite.   If qk = 0, for (11) to equal zero, it must be that
marginal, and thus total utility is equal in each state, which holds only if
q + g    1.  In that case, the utility equals that at (g — 0, q — 1).
Proposition 3 demonstrates that g — 0    q < 1, ruling this out.    Inspection of
U (see note 36) readily demonstrates that a sufficient condttion for it to
be strictly negative is q +    e [0, 1]    Proposition 3 and the discussion
                                                                     .




following (8) guarantee that    c (0, 1) and    —q + g, so that, at an optimal
g, this holds.   Finally, given g, for qkq and qkq both to be infinite, both kq
terms must be infinite. From (A3), this requires Ukk qO        0 and                      -


    -    — 0. This is only possible if q —           desired conclusion, or  , the
9 — 0 and Ukk — 0 simultaneously, the latter just having been ruled out.


                                                            -    23      -
second, which is strictly negative (positive) in the case where Ab' >                                       0

(Ab' < 0), and the second and fourth terms on the left side equal zero, with

the other terms strictly negative, so kq > 0 (kq <                                   If q # 0,           q + g — 1

is thus not an optimum, and a smaller q is locally preferred.                                        And q — 0, with

q + g = 1, contradicts that g < 1.


      Consider q + g >    I;   i.e.      q >    l-g.       Let k be the optimal investment under

that scheme, and k be the optimal investment when q + g                               1.         In (9), the

bracketed part of the second term equals b + (q + g                            -   flAb'   .     For the case
where 11b' > Q,40 since an optimum requires (9) to equal zero, it must be that

b() < 0.      By assumption, b           < 0.    Therefore,             > k.       Compare the utility
level at q and     with that at q = 1-g and .                           > k    implies     that expected

wealth is greater at q =           l-g   and , because all b's are the same (since the
same k is assumed) and the change in the insurance policy produces a gain in
expected wealth because the cost per unit of remaining coverage is less (since

the level of investment associated with q =                       l-g   is less).        Moreover, the

greater expected wealth is distributed perfectly equally between states when

q —   l-g.   These two effects imply that the utility level is greater as well,

which rules out the possibility that q >                    l-g   can be an optimum.41


      It now follows as well that g= l q —0.                            At g= 1, q =             0    implies that

(11) equals zero (as both terms equal zero).                        q < 0 was ruled out above.

q > 0 is ruled out by the argument just presented that q >                                 l-g       cannot be an

optimum.     Therefore, at g = 1,          q = 0 is the optimum.


38
      The bracketed portion of the second term in (9) is

       b + (q+g)Ab'   =   b l(b+            -   b)     =    b
Therefore,    (9) reduces to U'b = 0.
   The possibility that Ab' = 0 needs no special consideration, as it is
clear from (9) that this would only occur if b =                         b
                                                      0, which was ruled out
by assumption.
40
    For the case where Ab' < 0, the relationship between the levels of
investment discussed in the text to follow is reversed, but this also produces
greater expected wealth in the case where q — i-g due to reduced premiums (the
combination of the greater k and the reversed sign of b' produces the same
effect as the lower k and Ab' > 0). The remainder of the argument in text
thus holds in this case as well.
41
      The proof for g >   1    follows that for g < 1, mutatis mutandis.
