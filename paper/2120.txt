        Household Behavior and the Tax Reform Act of 1986


                                 ABSTRACT

     This paper evaluates the effects of the 1986 Tax Reform Act on household

labor supply and savings. It describes the tax bill's effects on incentives to

work and to save, and uses recent econometric estimates of labor supply and

savings elasticities to describe the reform's impact on household behavior. Two

factors lead us to conclude that the new law will have small aggregate effects.

First, most households experience only small changes in their marginal tax

rates. Forty-one percent of the taxpaying population will face marginal tax

rates as high, or higher, under the new law as under the previous tax code.

Only eleven percent of taxpayers receive marginal tax rate reductions of ten

percentage points or more. Second, plausible estimates of both the labor supply

and savings elasticities suggest that even for those households that receive

rate reductions, behavioral changes will be small. Our analysis suggests that

the tax reform will increase labor supply by about one percent, and slightly

reduce private savings.

     President Reagan's May 1985 letter to Congress, accompanying his tax reform

proposal, argued that the existing tax system hindered economic growth because

"most Americans labor under excessively high tax rates that discourage work and

cut drastically into savings." This paper analyzes how the 1986 Tax Reform Act

affects these aspects of household behavior.

     The recent tax reform has been hailed as the most far-reaching change in

the personal income tax since the Revenue Act of 1942 transformed it from a levy

on high-income individuals to a broad-based tax. The Joint Tax Committee esti-

mates that the Tax Reform Act lowers federal receipts from the individual income

tax by $121.9 billion between 1987 and 1991. The new law has particularly dra-

matic effects on individuals with very high and very low incomes. For high

income households, the reform reduces marginal tax rates. When the new law

takes full effect in 1988, individuals at the top of the income distribution

will face marginal tax rates of 28. As recently as 1970, both earned and

unearned income were subject to top marginal rates of 7O. Unearned income was

taxed at up to 7O until 1981. For low-income wage earners, the reform lowers

average tax payments and removes nearly six million working poor from the

federal income tax system.

     The popular claim that the Tax Reform Act reduces marginal tax rates for

virtually all taxpayers, however, is an exaggeration. Our calculations suggest

that in 1988, over forty percent of the taxpaying population will face marginal

tax rates equal to, or higher than, the rates they would face under current law.

Only eleven percent of taxpayers receive marginal tax rate reductions of ten

percentage points or more. In part, these findings account for our conclusion

that the tax reform will have relatively small aggregate effects. The modest
                                      —2—



changes in marginal tax rates for most households, coupled with the small

behavioral elasticities that emerge from most empirical studies, imply small

effects on both labor supply and savings.

     The paper is divided into four sections. The first sketches the major

individual income tax provisions of the Tax Reform Act. Since detailed accounts

of the tax law are widely available, we discuss only the provisions that play

an important part in our subsequent analysis. The second section examines the

tax reform's labor supply effects. Using micro—econometric estimates of house-

hold labor supply, we analyze how a number of representative households will

respond to the tax reform. The third section discusses the reform's influence

on personal saving. We consider the incentive effects of changes in marginal

tax rates as well as restrictions on tax-favored savings vehicles. A brief

conclusion compares the recent tax reform with the 1981 tax cut, and evaluates

the new law's effect in the light of the previous tax change.


1. Salient Features of the Tax Reform Act

     Prior to the Tax Reform Act, the personal income tax schedule had fourteen

brackets and marginal tax rates ranging between 11% and 50%. Although the new

law is frequently described as a two-tier tax system, with marginal rates of 15%

and 28%, a variety of phase—out provisions for deductions and exemptions raise

marginal tax rates to 33% over sizable income ranges.1 The two phase-out pro-

visions that affect the largest number of taxpayers are the elimination of (i)

the 15% tax bracket, and (ii) personal exemptions. When the new law takes full

effect in 1988, a single individual will be taxed at 15% on taxable income up to

$17,850, and at 28% on taxable income above that amount. For single taxpayers
                                          —3—


with incomes above $43,150, however, the benefits of the 15% bracket are grad-

ually reduced. These phase-out provisions raise the marginal tax rate on tax-

able income between $43,150 and $89,560 to 33%. A similar phase-out eliminates

the $1950 personal exemption between taxable incomes of $89,560 and $100,480,

raising the marginal tax rate to 33% in this range as well. For single indivi-

duals with taxable income exceeding $100,480, the marginal tax rate returns to

28%. Parallel considerations apply to joint and head-of-household returns.

       The marginal tax rates on taxable income for both single and married tax-

payers are shown below:

that generate unusual marginal tax rates for some taxpayers.3

       To place the new tax rates in historical perspective, the next table shows

the marginal tax rates facing several hypothetical households over the last

thirty years. It assumes that each household's real earnings are constant

through time and that the household claims the standard deduction each year.4

The differences between the tax rates in 1980 and 1988 are more striking than

those between 1988 and either 1960 or 1970, except at very high incomes. This

reflects the gradual impact of ttbracket creep," which raised marginal tax rates

throughout the 1970s.

     These illustrative calculations show that not all taxpayers face lower

marginal tax rates as a result of the Tax Reform Act. More detailed information

on the distribution of changes in 1988 marginal tax rates is presented in Figure

1. The figure reports calculations based on the NBER TAXSIM model. TAXSIM

computes marginal tax rates and tax payments for a synthetic population of over

30,000 1988 taxpayers, constructed by extrapolating from actual 1983 tax returns

in the 1983 IRS Public Use Tax Return data file. The calculations suggest that

29.3 million taxpayers (27.3 of the total) will face higher marginal rates

after the tax reform than before. An additional 14.8 million (13.8) face the

same marginal rate under the new law as they would have under old law. Increas-

ed marginal tax rates are especially prevalent among non-itemizers, the elderly,

and low income earners who are not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Although the majority of taxpayers (58.9) do receive rate reductions, only

11.2 receive reductions of more than ten percentage points.5

     One aspect of the Tax Reform Act that Figure 1 does not reveal is the in-

creased number of low-income households that either pay no taxes or receive

rebates. TAXSIM calculations indicate that 5.9 million households will be re-

moved from the federal tax rolls as a result of changes in the personal exemp-

tion and the Earned Income Tax Credit.6 Under old law, an individual earning

more than $3,828 in 1988 would have faced some federal income tax liability.

The tax cut—off under new law is $4,950. For a family of four filing a joint

return, the prior-law tax cutoff was $9,856, compared with $14,480 under the new

law. These changes largely reinstate the degree of tax progressivity for low-

income individuals that was found in the tax system of the mid-1970s. Mus-

grave's (1986) observation that the tax system facing low income persons in 1988

will be more progressive than that in 1979 in part reflects the bracket creep

that reduced progressivity throughout the 1970s.

     We have described only a few of the numerous provisions in the 1986 Act

that will affect household behavior. Some, such as the tax exemption for income

from the sale of reindeer and the inclusion of Nobel prizes in the tax base,

significantly affect a small number of taxpayers. Others, such as the repeal of

the $100 dividend exclusion, have small consequences for a large number of

taxpayers. We now consider the reform's likely impact on two central aspects of

household behavior, labor supply and savings.

2. Tax Reform and Labor Supply

      The tax reform has both income and substitution effects on labor supply.

The income effects operate through changes in the standard deduction, the aver-

age tax rate on unearned income, and in marginal tax rates, while the substitu-

tion effects are due to changes in marginal tax rates. Both effects vary across

households. For the 60% of households that receive marginal rate reductions,

the tax reform raises the after-tax wage. This will have a small positive

effect on labor supply, as will the extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit.7

Other provisions reduce after-tax wages for some households, however. The eli-

mination of the two-earner deduction, previously equal to 10% of the lower-

earner's salary up to a maximum of $3000, will reduce labor supply by secondary

earners.8 In addition, for the one-quarter of all taxpayers who face higher

marginal rates under the new law, the after-tax wage falls and the rewards to

labor supply are reduced.


2.1 Estimated Changes in Labor Supply and Deadweight Loss for Primary Earners

      Our estimates of changes in labor supply and deadweight loss account for

federal income taxes as well as Social Security taxes9 and average state income

and sales taxes10. Our analysis focuses exclusively on the fully phased—in tax

system of 1988, and ignores the complicated 1987 transition rules. The labor

supply function we use is:


(1)        h*=aw+y+Zy+c.
The left hand side variable is desired hours of work. The variable w denotes the

net after tax wage, Z is a vector of socioeconomic variables, and e is a random
                                      —7—



error due to taste variation or optimization error. The variable y is the

household's "virtual income." The household behaves as if it has nonlabor

income equal to y, even though it may not, because of the after-tax budget

segment it faces. Virtual income is determined by market wages and the tax

code. Hausman (1981) provides a full definition of virtual income, as well as

the parameter estimates for (a, , y) that we use.1' A general survey of recent

empirical work on labor supply including estimates from specifications other

than (1) may be found in Killingsworth (1983).

     We first consider the labor supply effects for the average married man, who

earned $11.15 per hour in 1985. Our analysis assumes that his pretax wage is

held constant at its pre-reform level. Applying the 1988 tax code to 1985, this

individual's marginal federal tax rate would be 15% since his income would be

below $42,550, where the 28% rate begins for a worker with two children filing a

joint return.12 His labor supply would equal 2210 hours per year. Under the old

law, his marginal tax rate was 18% and his predicted labor supply was 2190

hours; under the 1975 tax code, his labor supply was 2181 hours. Thus, the 1981

tax reform is estimated to have raised his labor supply by 0.4%, and the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 by an additional 0.9%. This probably yields a good estimate of

the aggregate effect of the tax bill on male labor supply; Hausman (1983) finds

that the behavioral response of the average married man is reasonably close to

the average response by all married men.

    We now turn to the efficiency cost, or deadweight loss, of the income tax

system. The deadweight loss measures the cost of labor-leisure distortions due

to income taxation. An individual is not indifferent between (i) a no-tax world,

and (ii) a world in which his earnings are taxed at a marginal rate T and he
                                             -8-



receives a lump-sum payment equal to his equilibrium tax payments. Because the

individual's behavior is distorted in the second case, he must receive a lump-

sum transfer greater than his tax payment to make him as well off as in the no-

tax world. Deadweight loss equals the additional transfer, beyond the return of

all tax payments, that would be needed to return the individual to his pre-

reform utility level.   It is computed as the difference between the Hicksiari

compensating variation and the amount of compensated tax revenue raised:


(2)        DWL(w11w21U) = CV(w11w2,U) — T(w1,w2,U)

                        =             —             —              —
                            e(w21U)       e(w1,U)       [t(w21U)       t(w1,U)]

where w1 and w2 indicate the after-tax wage before and after the tax reform,

e(w2,U) is the individual's expenditure function, t(w2,U) denotes the amount of

(compensated) taxes raised, and U is the level of pre-reform utility.13 Distort-

ionary taxes were in place before as well as after the recent tax reform. We

therefore compute the change in deadweight loss due to the reform by finding the

deadweight loss of both the pre- and post-reform tax codes relative to a system

of lump-sum taxes and then taking the difference between these two measures.14

      Our results suggest that the new law does impose a smaller deadweight loss

than current law, but that the efficiency gains are not large. Hausman (1981)

found that the deadweight loss of the pre-1981 tax system for average married

man was 21.8. For every dollar raised through the tax system, the average

household was effectively made worse off by $1.22 because of distortions created

by income taxes. Our calculations for the post-Tax Reform Act scenario imply a

ratio of deadweight loss to compensated taxes raised of .135,15 compared with

.165 for the pre-1986 law. Although deadweight loss as a fraction of revenue
                                      -9-


falls by 18 because of the Tax Reform Act, this is smaller than the 24 decline

(from .218 to .165) that Hausman's (1981) estimates attribute to the 1981 tax

reform.

     We also did calculations for a high income husband who earned $10 per hour

in 1975, or about $45,000 per year in 1985 dollars.16 This high—earning husband

would see a reduction in his marginal tax bracket from 33 to 28; he is well

below the earnings of $84,700 that would put him into the Tax Reform Act's 33

bracket. We estimate the increase in his labor supply to be 1.5. The ratio of

deadweight loss to tax revenue decreases from .326 under old law to .256 under

the Tax Reform Act, but both estimates of the efficiency loss are well below

Hausman's (1981) value of .542 for the pre-1981 tax system.


2.2 Labor Supply Response of Secondary Earners

     We now turn to the effect of the Tax Reform Act on labor supply by second-

ary earners. In most households with two potential earners, wives are the

secondary earners. Our calculations therefore rely upon Hausman's (1981)

estimates of labor supply behavior of married women. We assume that the average

married woman is married to the average married man, and that she conditions her

labor supply on his behavior. This assumption is made in much of the labor

supply literature, although -it is relaxed in Hausman and Ruud (1984).

    The marginal tax rate facing the average married woman depends on the

amount of labor she chooses to supply. For her first hour of work, her marginal

tax rate is 15 under the new law, compared with 16.296 (.90 times 1896, due to

the ten percent two-earner deduction) under the old law. The two earner

deduction influenced marginal work incentives for most couples. TAXSIM shows
                                      -•10--




that only 6.1% of two-earner couples would have incomes in 1988 that caused the

$3000 deduction constraint to bind. The average married woman's marginal tax

rate at part time work, twenty hours per week, decreases from 22.5% (.90 times

25%) to 15% because of the tax reform. This rate change is probably the major

determinant of the increase in labor supply that we estimate. At full time

work, the average married woman faces a marginal rate of 28%. This is a slight

reduction from her 29.7% rate (.90 times .33) under old law.

     Our estimates suggest that labor supply of wives will increase by 2.64%

under the new tax bill. The majority of this increase is due to increased labor

force participation, not increased hours of work for participants. We calculate

the ratio of deadweight loss to taxes raised to be .250, a decrease from the

.305 ratio under the old law. Both of these estimates are well below Hausman's

(1981) estimate of .581 based on the pre-1981 tax code.


2.3 Further Issues in Labor Supply

     Our analysis of household labor supply focuses exclusively on decisions by

several "representative" individuals. The tabulations -in the last section that

show substantial heterogeneity in the tax reform's effect on different house-

holds suggest caution in generalizing from these results. Since most households

face small tax rate changes, however, our conclusion that the aggregate labor

supply effects are small is unlikely to be reversed by more detailed analysis.

     We have also considered only one dimension of labor supply, hours of work.

Many other aspects of labor supply may also be affected by the tax bill. With

respect to occupational choice, for example, the law has a number of effects.

First, the reduction in tax progressivity and marginal tax rates at high incomes
                                       —11—


may encourage individuals to choose risky occupations with a small chance of

extremely high compensation. If the rewards to occupational risk-taking are

generated primarily as capital gains, however, as in many entrepreneurial activ-

ities, then the tax bill's increase in the top capital gains rate from 2O to

33 may actually discourage entry into risky fields. Second, the tax reform's

elimination of income averaging will discourage entry into occupations with

highly variable earnings. Finally, progressivity may encourage schooling.

Under previous law, the marginal rates that applied to an individual's foregone

earnings were typically lower than the rates at which subsequent rewards to

schooling were taxed. By widening brackets and lowering marginal rates the Tax

Reform Act reduces this distortion for many individuals.

     Our static analysis of the Tax Reform Act may also neglect some potentially

important dynamic effects. If households foresee changes in their marginal tax

rates, either because of the new law's phase-in provisions or because they think

the steady-state level of tax rates is above the 1988 level, some intertemporal

substitution of labor supply may occur. Tax return data will surely show such

an effect, if only because taxpayers with discretion in reporting their income

may transfer income between tax years. Changes in capital income taxation may

also affect labor supply. Our analysis is not strictly appropriate for a house-

hold making labor—leisure decisions in a lifecycle setting.17 Changes in after—

tax rates of return could affect the lifecycle profile of labor supply, the

decision to invest in human capital, and retirement decisions. Available

empirical evidence does not provide much evidence on the influence of interest

rates on labor supply. For most households after-tax rates of return are not

substantially affected by the tax reform, however, so labor supply effects

through this channel are probably small.

3.   Personal Savings and the Tax Reform Act

     The Tax Reform Act will cause a relatively small reduction in private

savings. For many households, lower marginal tax rates will reduce the tax

wedge between pre-tax and post-tax asset returns and encourage saving. This

effect is likely to be offset for most taxpayers, however, by a decline in pre-

tax rates of return resulting from increased taxation of corporate capital.

After-tax returns will rise for some households and decline for others, but the

net effect on household savings is likely to be small.

     The Act also restricts tax-favored savings plans which have become an

important component of private savings. In 1985, IRA contributions of $40.8

billion, coupled with 401(k) contributions of approximately twenty billion

dollars'8, accounted for nearly half of personal savings ($129.0 billion) as

reported in the National Income Accounts.19 The new restrictions on tax-favored

savings instruments will decrease savings, even though they affect a relatively

small fraction of taxpayers.


3.1 Tax Reform and After-Tax Returns

     We begin by considering the tax reformts impact on incentives to save

through traditional taxable investments such as bonds, corporate stock, and bank

accounts.2° The new bill alters the after-tax return to private saving in two

ways. First, by lowering marginal tax rates in most assets, it shrinks the tax

wedge between pre-tax and post-tax returns. Calculations with the TAXSIM model

illustrate these effects. In 1988, the average marginal tax rate on interest

income will be 2]..7, compared with 25.8 under old law. The change in marginal

tax rates on corporate dividends is even more pronounced, from 33.4 to 25.3,
                                      —13--



although the net effect on the equity tax wedge is smaller because the capital

gains tax rate is increased.21 Some taxpayers receive larger marginal rate

reductions, but as King and Leape (1986) show, these investors already hold

lightly-taxed assets such as high-growth corporate stock and tax-exempt debt.

Changes in marginal tax rates have a smaller effect on the returns to these

investments, and their pretax returns may actually decline as a result of the

tax reform.

     The positive incentive effects of marginal rate reductions will be largely

offset by a second effect, operating through changes in pretax rates of return.

The Tax Reform Act raises total marginal tax rates on corporate capital. The

elimination of the investment tax credit and the lengthening of asset deprec-

iation lives, as well as other corporate tax changes, more than counterbalance

the reduction in investor tax rates (see Auerbach (1987)). The increased tax

burden on corporate capital will be reflected both in higher pretax corporate

returns, and in lower after—tax returns to -investors. Henderson (1986) esti-

mates that the new law will raise the marginal effective tax rate on corporate

assets, the difference between pre- and post-tax corporate returns as a percent-

age of the pretax return, from 37.2 to 42.2, while reducing the after-tax re-

turns to investors by forty basis points. Her calculations understate the law's

actual effects because they omit the various accounting changes that explain a

large part of the corporate tax increase (see Auerbach and Poterba (1987)).

Other estimates, for example Hendershott (1986), suggest more dramatic changes

and call for interest rate reductions of up to two hundred basis points.

     Although the tax reform will reduce pretax returns, its impact is unlikely

exceed one hundred basis points and it will probably be substantially smaller.
                                      —14—


Analyses that suggest much larger effects ignore the role of world capital

markets in damping the effect of domestic tax policy shocks on real interest

rates. Krugman (1985) concludes that policies which would cause a one point

interest rate movement -if the United States were a closed economy will actually

cause only a 53 basis point change because of capital market integration.

     The tax reform's effect on after-tax returns is further complicated by

heterogeneity in household marginal tax rates. For some households, marginal

savings are done through tax-exempt savings vehicles such as IRAs and the new

law affects their incentive to save only through its impact on pretax returns.

For households whose marginal savings are not tax exempt, changes in marginal

tax rates and pretax returns frequently have opposite effects. For a married

joint filer with total earnings of $25,000 in 1985, the marginal tax rate falls

from 18 to 15 because of the reform. Assuming a nominal interest rate of six

percent before the tax reform, a real rate decline of only twenty-two basis

points will offset the tax-induced increase in aftertax returns. For higher

marginal bracket investors, larger interest rate changes are required to offset

the tax rate effects. For a married joint filer with a $100,000 annual income,

interest rates could fall by as much as one hundred basis points while still

raising the after-tax return to saving. For a household experiencing a marginal

rate reduction from 50 to 28 percent, interest rates would have to fall by 1.7

points to offset the marginal rate reduction.   After-tax returns will therefore

probably rise for high-income individuals who account for a large fraction of

total savings.


3.2 The Savings Response to Changing After-Tax Returns

    Whether changes in after-tax returns will significantly affect household
                                      -15-


savings depends upon the interest elasticity of saving, one of the most

controversial parameters in empirical economics. Musgrave and Musgrave (1976)

described the concensus view of the mid-1970s: "such empirical evidence as

is available does not support the proposition that savings is highly elastic to

the rate of interest (p.491)." Since an increase in interest rates has

opposing income and substitution effects on current consumption, a small effect

can be justified on theoretical grounds. Moreover, the near constancy of the

private savings rate through periods of variable real interest rates provides

some support for this conclusion.

     This analysis is disputed by Summers (1981), who argues that changes in

interest rates lead to revaluations of household wealth. In particular, reduc-

tions in after-tax returns raise the present value of future labor income, so

they will increase household wealth, raise consumption, and therefore lower

savings. Summers argues that these effects can be very large, and finds aggre-

gate savings elasticities of roughly two for permanent interest rate changes.

Evans (1983) shows that the elasticity may also be much smaller in such models,

but does not dispute the possibility of large effects.

     Empirical studies have also questioned the traditional view that the inter-

est elasticity is small. Boskin (1978) reported an aggregate interest semi-

elasticity of 0.4, but his findings have been disputed by subsequent authors

(see especially Howrey and hymans (1978)). Both studies use aggregate data to

estimate "the" interest elasticity, but the findings are inherently difficult to

interpret because they do not address the source or persistence of interest rate

movements. The savings response to an increase in after-tax returns caused by a

temporary tax reduction, for example, should be very different from the change
                                        —16-


due to a permanent reduction in   marginal   rates.

     More recent studies have estimated structural models of consumption

behavior, and some findings also suggest significant elasticities. Hansen and

Singleton's (1983) estimates using aggregate time series data, as well as those

by Paquette (1985) and Zeldes (1985) using panel data, suggest aggregate savings

elasticities with respect to the short term interest rate of about one. Summers

(1984) provides a more detailed discussion of this evidence. These estimates

from structural models probably overstate the interest sensitivity of consump-

tion, however. They rely on a specification of preferences that constrains the

household's risk aversion and intertemporal elasticity of substitution to be

determined by the same parameter. Hall (1985) relaxes this restriction arid

finds a substantial risk aversion coefficient but very little evidence of

intertemporal substitution. His estimates imply virtually no savings response

to after-tax returns.

     These conflicting estimates underscore the uncertainty that still surrounds

this critical parameter for tax policy analysis. The relative stability of the

personal savings rate through periods of widely varying real interest rates may

provide the best evidence on the impact of the Tax Reform Act's changes in

after—tax returns. This suggests that the new law will cause a relatively small

adjustment in household saving.

     One explanation for the relatively small degree of observed intertemporal

substitution in consumption is that a sizable fraction of households are

liquidity constrained (see Hayashi (1985) for a survey). Such households are at

a corner, holding little or no wealth. Avery et al. (1984) report that the

Federal Reserve Board's 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances shows that 12 of
                                      —17—


households have no financial assets, while an additional 36 have net financial

assets worth less than $2,000. Similar results have emerged from numerous stud-

ies of household wealth (see Diamond and Hausman (1984)). Households with vir-

tually no wealth are already setting their savings equal to zero; reductions in

after-tax returns are unlikely to further reduce their savings.

    The Tax Reform Act significantly increases the disposable income of low-

income households who may be subject to liquidity constraints. TAXSIM estimates

suggest that in 1988 the new law will lower taxes on those with adjusted gross

incomes of less than $20,000 by $4.8 billion per year. By comparison, it raises

total tax payments by households with AGIs above $75,000 by $5.8 billion

annually. These redistributive effects will reduce the aggregate savings rate.


3.3 Changes in Individual Retirement Accounts

     The Tax Reform Act also affects savings through its restrictions on Indiv-

idual Retirement Accounts and other tax-deferred savings vehicles. Twenty-four

million taxpayers made IRA contributions in 1985. The total amount invested in

IRA and Keogh plans has grown from $46.7 billion in December 1981, before the

extension of IRA eligibility to all wage—earners, to $231.8 billion in July

1986.22 Income from these assets is untaxed when it accrues, but is taxed as

ordinary income when the assets are withdrawn from the IRA. There is a ten per-

cent penalty for withdrawals before age 593g.

     Under old law, each wage-earner was permitted to make a $2,000 tax-

deductible annual IRA contribution. Two-earner couples could contribute

up to $4,000. The Tax Reform Act limits the deductibility of IRA contributions

for high-income taxpayers. For a single taxpayer who is not covered by an
                                      -18—


 employer-maintained retirement plan, or who is covered by such a plan but whose

AGI before deducting IRA contributions is below $25,000, nothing changes. A

single taxpayer with income above $35,000 cannot make tax deductible contribu-

tions, however, and one with an income in the $25-35,000 range can deduct only a

fraction of his IRA contribution. Similar provisions with different cutoffs

apply to other types of tax filers. Taxpayers who cannot deduct their IRA

contributions from taxable income may still contribute to IRAs, and the accruing

income is still untaxed under the new law.

     Assets held in IRA5 earn significantly higher after-tax returns than those

held in taxable accounts. These accounts are attractive both because asset

returns are taxed at the taxpayer's post-retirement marginal rate, typically

below his rate while working, and because the assets grow at the pre-tax rate.

For someone 30 years from retirement, facing a current marginal tax rate of 33

arid a marginal tax rate of 16 during retirement, with a current interest rate

of eight percent and an inflation rate of four percent, investing through an IRA

is equivalent to receiving a nominal yield of 13.1%.23

     The Tax Reform Act's restrictions on IRA deductability will reduce the use

of IRAs, but it is easy to exaggerate their importance. Four arguments suggest

that IRAs will continue to be widely used. First, IRAs remain very attractive

savings vehicles under the new law, even when contributions are not deductible.

For an individual in the 33% bracket during his working life and the 15% bracket

when retired, with income high enough to prevent IRA deductibility, a contribu-

tion 30 years before retirement will be worth 1.97 times as much on the retire-

ment day as a similar taxable investment. Even for someone in the 33% bracket

both while working and while retired, the IRA would be worth 70% more than a
                                      —19-


taxable account. Although the Tax Reform Act's general reduction in marginal

rates reduces the implied yield differential between IRAs and taxable invest-

ments, IRAs should still be used by most long-horizon investors.

     Second, the IRA restrictions affect only a small part of the contributing

population.   The Employee Benefit Research Institute (1986) estimates that only

15% of taxpayers who made IRA contributions in 1985 will completely lose the

deductibility of their contributions, while another 12% will be eligible for

only partial tax deductability. Even assuming that all of these taxpayers would

have contributed the maximum allowable if they had been allowed the deduction,

and that they would contribute nothing (an extreme case) in the absence of the

deduction, IRA saving would be 60% as large under the new law as in 1985.

     Third, even if IRA contributions do fall, this does not necessarily imply

that private savings will decline. For many households that face deductibility

restrictions, IRAs are not a marginal savings vehicle. Most contributors who

lose deductibility were previously making the maximum contribution, so the

removal of deductibility does not affect their marginal after-tax return to

saving.24 For these households, marginal savings are invested in non-IRA assets,

and their marginal return is the return on these assets.

    Finally, the new law preserves the incentives for banks and other financial

institutions to promote a "psychology of savings" and encourage IRA contribu-

tions. The importance of psychological factors in determining savings behavior

is stressed by Katona (1975, chapters 15 and 16). The combined effects of IRA

advertising campaigns and the immediate tax savings associated with IRA contrib-

utions may account for the pronounced increase in contributions immediately be-

fore the tax-filing deadline. For the period 1982-1986, when the average
                                      —21—


contributions at $7,000 per year. These restrictions will affect a relatively

small fraction of the current participants in 401(k) plans, however. Data on

the use of 401(k) plans under current law compiled by Greenwich Research

Associates (1985) shows that 119 of plan participants contribute less than 3 of

their salary, 59 contribute 3-6 of their salary, 16 contribute 6-10 of their

salary, and only 1 of current participants place more than 10 of their salary

in a 401(k) plan. The mean contribution is less than $2000, and only 6 of

401(k) participants are estimated to contribute more than $7000 per year.26

     The impact of 401(k) restrictions is less clear than the impact of IRA

limitations. Even though few contributors currently exceed the new contribution

cap, they may account for most of the dollars contributed to these plans. If

the average contribution for those contributing more than $7,000 is $15,000,

these individuals account for half of all contributions. The new limits would

reduce 401(k) contributions by 25 in this case. Although contributions by

current contributors will decline, there is an offsetting effect because indiv-

iduals previously eligible for tax—deductable IRAs may transfer their saving

into still-deductible 401(k)s.


3.5 Further Issues in Tax Reform and Savings

     The tax reform's impact on interest rates and ultimately on investment

hinges on its effect on national savings, which is the sum of personal, cor-

porate, and government saving. In addition to the effects on personal savings

described above, the new law may have important effects on both corporate and

government saving. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the bill raises

corporate taxes by $120 billion over the next five years, reducing personal
                                      -20-


monthly change in real IRA and Keogh assets was 2.2 billion 1986 dollars, the

average changes in March and April were respectively $3.7 and $6.3 billion.

Thirty-seven percent of IRA contributions were made in these two months. This

probably indicates that some IRA contributors value liquidity enough to delay

their contributions, but it may also in part result from the mass media cam-

paigns encouraging savings.


3.4 Changes in Other Targeted Savings Vehicles

     The Tax Reform Act also changes provisions for a number of other tax-

favored savings plans. The most important of these are 401(k) plans, employer-

operated profit-sharing plans that employees contribute to through salary

reductions or from bonuses. Employers can match employee contributions, and

401(k) plans have less restrictive withdrawal provisions than IRAs. This makes

401(k) plans one of the most attractive savings instruments at present, and

accounts for their rapid growth.

     Although 401(k) plans were instituted less than a decade ago, and the

regulations that permitted their widespread use were only promulgated in 1982,

they have expanded rapidly. Ninety firms in the Fortune 100 had 401(k) plans in

1985. Although no official data are available, as many as 15 million persons

may have contributed to 401(k)s in 1985, and the Congressional Budget Office

forecast (under old law) called for a doubling of the number of participants by

1991.25 The assets held in 401(k) plans were estimated at $31.7 billion in 1986

and were projected to grow to $153.7 billion (1986 dollars) by 1991.

     Prior to the Tax Reform Act, an individual was permitted contributions

equal to the maximum of $30,000 or 25 of his salary. The new law caps these
                                      —22—


taxes by an equal amount. The household sector's propensity to save out of

disposable income is substantially below the corporate sector's savings rate out

of after-tax profits, so the tax bill transfers income from a high—saving sector

(corporations) to a low-saving sector (households). This will reduce national

savings unless households "pierce the corporate veil" and recognize corporate

savings on their behalf.27

     The Tax Reform Act may also affect national saving through its influence on

the federal deficit. The bill's net revenue effects are difficult to predict

accurately, especially since many of the behavioral assumptions in the Joint Tax

Committee's revenue projections are not publicly available. Predicting the

extent of income re-timing and other accounting-induced changes in tax liability

during the phase-in period is especially problematic. Since changes in the

government deficit can affect national savings (see Poterba and Summers (1986)),

the Tax Reform Act's revenue impact will be a key factor in its total effect on

national savings.

     Finally, the Tax Reform Act will affect savings by inducing changes in a

variety of asset prices. With respect to corporate capital, the Act increases

tax burdens on new assets while reducing burdens (through the reduction in cor-

porate rates) on old capital. This conveys a windfall to the holders of

existing capital, primarily older households. These households have a higher

marginal propensity to spend than do younger households, so this redistribution

will also reduce savings. Other asset prices will also adjust. For example,

reductions in the marginal tax rates facing high income individuals may reduce

the price of luxury homes (see Poterba (1986)). The tax bill's net effect on

the value of household net worth is complicated, but clearly important for

understanding its ultimate savings effects.

4. Conclusions

     Our analysis suggests that the Tax Reform Act will cause relatively small

changes in both household labor supply and savings. For married men we expect

an increase in labor supply of less than one percent, although the impact on

secondary earners could be somewhat larger. The bill's impact on savings is

difficult to assess because the reform affects different assets in different

ways, but we expect a small decline in savings.   This results in part from a

reduction in the alter-tax returns available to investors in taxable assets, in

part from restrictions on tax-favored savings vehicles, and in part from

redistribution toward households with high spending propensities. Our findings

of small behavioral effects are not surprising, however, since for middle income

taxpayers who did not make wide use of tax shelters, the Tax Reform Act changes

marginal tax rates relatively little.

     Our results do not imply that the tax reform has only small incentive

effects. The complicated transition rules which govern income earned in 1986

and 1987 are bound to induce significant changes in reported economic activity,

and probably in real behavior as well. Newspaper accounts during the

House-Senate Conference Committee's deliberations described tax shelters being

hastily organized to take advantage of grandfathering provisions. The realiza-

tion of capital gains may also be distorted by the transition to a new tax

regime. Long-term gains realized in 1986 are taxed at a top marginal rate of

20%, while those in 1987 are taxed at rates of up to 28%, and after 1988 capital

gains are not distinguished from other types of income and they could therefore

face tax rates of up to 33%. Realization of capital gains is a highly discre-

tionary activity, so significant gain-taking may occur before the new law takes
                                      —24—


effect.

     Although our analysis has relied primarily on econometric evidence to

assess the behavioral effects of the tax reform, another type of evidence may be

even more persuasive in the current context. The marginal rate reductions in the

new law are considerably smaller than the 23 cut in rates that followed the

1981 tax reform, except for very high income individuals. Although the two

reforms are not directly comparable because the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act

reduced total revenue by lowering corporate and personal taxes in tandem while

the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is designed to be revenue neutral, the evidence on

household response to the 1981 tax reform is useful nonetheless.

     With respect to labor supply, Lindsey (1986) compares the amount and

distribution of income reported on tax returns with a baseline projection based

on pre-1981 tax return data. He finds an increase in taxable income during the

1982-1984 period of roughly two percent relative to what would have been expect-

ed in the absence of the tax cut. These effects are larger than our analysis

would predict, but as we would expect, the response is largest among high income

individuals who received the largest rate cuts. The difficulty of separating

changes in labor supply from changes in reporting practices and the complicating

effects of macroeconomic events unfortunately complicate the interpretation of

Lindsey's results.

     The savings experiment is also enlightening. During the last five years,

real interest rates have reached record highs and tax rates have been reduced,

raising the after-tax return to savers. In 1980, the average married man's real

after—tax return to savings through a Treasury-bill fund was -1.37. In 1985,

the after-tax real return was 3.66 if marginal saving was channeled into an IRA
                                      —25—


and 2.32% if through taxable channels.28 Even more dramatic increases in real

after-tax returns have occurred for individuals near the top of the income

distribution. Despite this dramatic change in the return to saving, aggregate

savings have if anything declined.29 The National Income Accounts personal

savings rate, which averaged 8.796 between 1971 and 1975 and 7.1% between 1976

and 1980, averaged 6.296 over the last five years. Consumption as a share of GNP

has risen from 62.796 in the 1970s to 64.5% since 1981. Even if the household

savings rate is defined as the change in real net worth divided by disposable

income, so that it rises with the recent stock market boom, the average savings

rate is only 10.296 for the 1981-85 period compared with 13.2% during the 1970s

and 13.1% during the 1960s. This evidence suggests that changes in after—tax

returns of the type generated by the recent tax reform are also unlikely to have

large effects on savings behavior.

                                  Footnotes

1.   The NBER TAXSIM model estimates that 3.4 million of the 107.4 million tax
returns filed in 1988 will face the 33% bracket.

2.   Taxable income equals adjusted gross income minus deductions and
exemptions. The personal exemption equals $1950 in 1988, and $2000 thereafter.
The standard deduction in 1988 is $3000 for returns by single individuals, and
$5000 for married joint filers.

3.   Among the other rates that will affect some taxpayers are: (1) The 49.5%
marginal rate for taxpayers with incomes of between $100,000 and $150,000 and
whose passive loss deduction of $25,000 is being phased out. (ii) The 21% mini-
mum tax rate. (iii) The 26.25% marginal rate for taxpayers who face the minimum
tax and also are in the income range over which their personal exemption is
being phased out. (iv) The 25% rate facing taxpayers eligible for the Earned
Income Tax Credit, when the credit is being phased out. (v) The 33.6% rate
facing an individual who makes an IRA contribution and has taxable income in the
IRA deduction phase-out range. Many additional rates arise from the phase-out
provisions for medical and child care deductions.

4.   We ignore variation over time in allowable deductions, such as consumer
interest, which could have a significant effect on the marginal tax rates facing
some households. Our marginal tax rate estimates for 1988 assume that nominal
earnings grow at the inflation rate forecast by the Congressional Budget Office
for the 1986—1988 period.

5.   These calculations weight each tax return equally. Similar findings emerge
when we weight tax returns by married couples twice as heavily as those by
single persons; 12.1% receive marginal rate reductions of 10% or more, 11.5%
face the same marginal rates before and after the reform, and 22.3% face higher
marginal rates.

6.   Many low-income persons will still participate in the Social Security
system and therefore pay FICA taxes, although they have no income tax liability.
For 3.1 of the 18.3 million persons who will face no federal income tax
liability in 1988, however, the Earned Income Tax Credit largely offsets FICA.

7.   The new law raises the credit rate from 11% to 14%, and expands its
coverage. For a head of household with one child, earnings below $5714 receive
a credit of 14% under 1988 law. Earnings between $5715 and $8999 are untaxed,
while those between $9000 and $10251 (the earnings level at which he enters the
ordinary tax system) face a marginal rate of 10% due to the EITC phase-out. Be-
tween $10251 and $17000, the marginal rate is 25% due to the combined effect of
the EITC phase-out and the ordinary tax schedule. For earnings above $17000 the
marginal rate is again 15%.

8.   Previous studies suggest that the two—earner deduction has significant
labor supply effects. Hausman (1981) found a 1.8% increase in wive's labor
supply prior to the 1981 reform, and Feenberg and Rosen (1983) found similar
effects. The impact of this deduction, had it been preserved, would have been
smaller than under old law as a result of the reduction in marginal tax rates.
                                      —27—


9. We use only the employee portion of FICA because estimates of returns to
Social Security by Boskin et al. (1986) suggest the marginal benefit to be
approximately 50 of marginal taxes paid for two-earner couples, and slightly
more for single—earner households.

10. The Tax Reform Act's elimination of state and local sales tax deductibility
also reduces the real after-tax wage, but this effect is trivial. For a house-
hold using the federal tax return tables for state sales tax liability, a $1
increase in income leads to about a one cent increase in deductions. At a
marginal tax rates of 30 percent, this means eliminating sales tax deductibility
induces only a .3 change in the marginal wage tax rate.

11. The estimates in Hausman (1981) are based on a 1975 data sample, so we
deflate 1986 dollars to 1975 levels using percentage changes in average hourly
earnings. Since real wages have changed very little during this period, the use
of mean estimates from 1975 should not have a large effect on the results. The
parameter estimates for husbands are the convex estimates from Hausman (1981,
p.51); those for wives are the nonconvex estimates from Hausman (1981, p.56).

12. Earnings of $43,500 translate into taxable income of $29,750 when we sub-
tract the $5,000 standard deduction for married joint filers, and four times the
personal exemption of $1950. The Earned Income Tax Credit -is completely phased
out at incomes of $17,000, so it has no effect on the average married man.

13. We calculate deadweight loss using the expenditure function based on the
labor supply function of equation (1):


          e(w,U)=eU- +_1.
Compensated taxes are calculated from the compensated labor supply function,
which equals -ae(w,U)/aw.

14. It would also be possible in this setting to compute the deadweight loss of
the existing tax system relative to a more realistic alternative than lump-sum
taxes, such as a proportional tax scheme.

15. Compensated hours of work are estimated to be 2068 per year. Compensated
taxes raised are $1474, and the compensating variation is $1673 for the average
married man.

16. The high-income husband corresponds approximately to the mean of the top
quintile in the 1975 Panel Survey of lncome Dynamics sample.

17. MaCurdy (1981) and Hausman (1985) provide more detailed discussions of
labor supply in a lifecycle setting.
18. There are no systematic national data available for 401(k) plans. Our
estimate of employee contribution levels is based on the EBRI (1985) estimate of
15 million participating employees in 1985, coupled with data from Greenwich
Research Associates (1985) that mean contributions are just below $2000.

19. Some IRA and 401(k) contributions are not net savings but are simply trans-
fers from other accounts. This is especially likely to be the case in the first
few years after these savings programs are introduced.

20. Data from the Federal Reserve Board (1986) show that taxable bonds, other
interest bearing assets and corporate stock account for 73% of household liquid
wealth. Of the remaining 27%, 23.6% is held through tax-exempt pension funds.

21. Assets that yield returns primarily as capital gains are taxed more heavily
under the Tax Reform Act than under prior law. The marginal tax rate on long
term gains, which could not exceed 20% in 1986, will rise to 33% in 1988 and
thereafter. For investors whose marginal savings are channelled into high-gain
assets, the marginal tax burden on savings will increase. The relationship bet-
ween dividend taxes, capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, and the pretax return
is detailed in Poterba and Summers (1985).

22. Although most of the increase in contributions is due to IRAs, tax changes
in the post-1981 period have also encouraged Keogh plans by raising the contri-
bution limit and changing the tax treatment of personal service corporations.
We calculate the value of IRA and Keogh assets using the Federal Reserve Board's
report on asset holdings, which exclude some institutions that provide IRAs, and
grossing up by the ratio of total IRA and Keogh holdings from Pension Facts 1985
to obtain the total value.

23. The value at retirement of one dollar of earned income invested in an
interest-bearing asset is
                                    -
                                        ir]T
          Vtax =    (l_t0)eUl_tOh
where t is the tax rate while working, i denotes the nominal interest rate
and n te inflation rate, and I -is the number of years until retirement. By
comparison, investing one dollar through an IRA, with full deductability of the
IRA contribution, yields
          VIRA =    (1_tr)e[iT
where tr denotes the marginal tax rate during retirement. The analogous value
of a non-deductible IRA contribution held until retirement is:
          VIRA* =   (l_t0)e[T       -
                                        tr(1_t0){eT   -
                                                          1].
24. Galper and Byce (1986) report that 38.4% of IRA contributors made contribu-
tions below their legal maximum. For these taxpayers, the IRAs affected margi-
nal returns to saving. Venti and Wise (1986) estimate that only 20% of
contributions were financed from reductions in other asset stocks. They find
30% were financed from current tax savings, and 50% with reduced consumption.
Moreover, they found that the median financial wealth of IRA contributors was
about $8500, suggesting that after a few years most financial assets for many
contributing households would be transferred into IRAs and that these plans
would become the marginal source of savings.

25. Forecasts of future 401(k) contributions and asset growth were provided
by Larry Ozanne of the Congressional Budget Office.

26. The fraction of 401(k) participants who are currently contributing more
than $7000 per year is reported in the Wall Street Journal 2 September 1986.

27. The available empirical evidence, Feldstein (1973) and Howrey and Hymans
(1978) for example, suggests nearly one-for-one offsets between personal savings
and corporate savings, but the estimates are imprecise. The new tax reform
provides a powerful test of this view.

28. The IRA return is not a one—period return but presumes stationary interest
rates and withdrawl after retirement.

29. Poterba and Summers (1986) provide a more detailed discussion of recent
savings experience.
