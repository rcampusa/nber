                                          ABSTRACT

Poor financial capability can erode well-being in later life. To explore debt and debt management
among older Americans, age 51-61, we designed and analyzed a new module in the 2018 Health
and Retirement Study along with information from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study.
Even though this group should be at the peak of their retirement savings, it nevertheless carries
debt due to student loans and unpaid medical bills; having children also contributes to carrying
debt close to retirement. By contrast, the financially literate have more positive financial
perceptions and behaviors. Specifically, being able to answer one additional financial literacy
question correctly is associated with a higher probability of reporting an above average credit
record and planning for retirement. Higher financial literacy is also linked to being less likely to
carry excessive debt, being contacted by debt collectors, and carrying medical debt or student
loans, even after accounting for a large range of demographics and other characteristics.
Evidently, financial knowledge can help limit debt exposure at older ages.

1. Introduction

        Recent research has demonstrated that older Americans are increasingly likely to carry debt

into retirement, and over time, the volume of that debt has also grown substantially (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2020; Lusardi, Mitchell, and Oggero, 2018, 2020a). This reality is giving rise to concerns

regarding retirement security for several reasons. For one, the increased debt burden may affect how

much older persons can contribute to their retirement accounts and how they will manage their

retirement savings. Additionally, when interest rates rise, near-retirees and retirees will be required

to allocate larger fractions of their income to service their debts. Rising debt can also prompt delayed

retirement in order to recover one’s financial standing.

        In this paper, we first evaluate an experimental debt module that we devised and fielded in

the 2018 U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), seeking to better understand older persons’

attitudes toward and understanding of debt. To this end, we have developed a new set of questions

permitting us to examine how people perceive their financial situations and the role of debt. While

there are many studies about wealth and wealth accumulation, we know much less about debt and

debt management, and many data sets provide only information on highly aggregated measures of

debt.1 In our module, by contrast, we are able to examine the prevalence of debt in the form of student

loans and unpaid medical bills, evaluate peoples’ assessment of their credit records, and examine their

understanding of fundamental concepts related to debt such as interest compounding. This

information is helpful in evaluating debt and debt management close to retirement. Second, we

examine the same age group using the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), a survey

we also helped design, to better understand debt among older respondents, in addition to assessing

whether findings from our HRS module are confirmed in larger samples.

        We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we collect new data on debt close to

retirement, a topic which is becoming very important both for academic research and policy. Second,

and White (2020).
                                                                                                         3


we show that, even in later life, people face many difficulties managing their debt. This can inform

studies on both financial literacy and personal finance. Third, we highlight the need for researchers,

practitioners, and others to devote attention to two specific types of debt, student loans and medical

debt, and also to especially vulnerable groups such as African-Americans, women, and the least-

educated. These topics are of growing importance in the current economic climate, though many of

these issues were beginning to be evident even prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

       Results in both the HRS and the NFCS document that many older Americans do carry debt

close to retirement. These individuals are also more likely to have dependent children and have faced

negative income shocks, leading to them feeling over-indebted and dissatisfied about their financial

situations. People most subject to financial distress are being contacted by debt collectors, hold

outstanding student loans, and carry medical debt.        The least-educated, low income, African-

Americans, and women prove to be the most vulnerable. Conversely, we show that financial literacy

contributes to positive financial perceptions and behaviors, such as reporting an above average credit

record and planning for retirement.

       In what follows, we first describe our datasets and methodology. Next, we report our findings

from the 2018 HRS debt module, providing both descriptive statistics and results from multivariate

analyses to assess who is most affected by debt and financial outcomes related to debt. Next, we turn

to the 2018 NFCS which includes larger sample of older respondents; with this, we shed additional

light on the effects of debt close to retirement. A final section offers a discussion and conclusions.



2. Methodology and Data

       First, we turn to one of the best datasets on older Americans, the Health and Retirement Study

(HRS). The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey following persons over the age of

50 every other year until they die or otherwise attrite from the sample. For this survey, we designed

a special experimental module to gain a better understanding of debt, including its effects on

household well-being. In 2018, the module was offered to 1,679 HRS participants; of these, 1,336
                                                                                                      4


individuals agreed to fill it out, resulting in an 80% response rate (in line with other modules). Our

study sample of people age 51-61 has 446 observations. To help assess whether the high levels of

debt we observe at older ages are a cause for concern, we take as a frame of reference the

intertemporal economic model which posits that people save to protect against shocks and for

retirement. By focusing on respondents age 51-61, we can study respondents close to or at the peak

of their wealth accumulation, and before they are eligible to claim their Social Security benefits. We

then link the module responses to a rich variety of other variables available in the core HRS for these

same respondents, to generate insights into debt and debt management.

       Our goal is to evaluate the causes and consequences of debt late in life, and whether, in the

spirit of intertemporal decision making models, people anticipated having the amount of debt they

currently have. Specifically, in addition to a question about planning related to debt, the module asked

about whether people were satisfied with their financial situations, whether they believed they had

too much debt, how they rated their credit records, and whether they had student loans outstanding

(on their own account or for partners/children/grandchildren). In addition, we asked whether they had

past due medical debt, as this type of debt is becoming increasingly common for Americans (Lusardi

and Mitchell, 2020). To judge the severity of their debt, we also asked respondents whether they had

been contacted by debt collectors. Finally, our module asked a question about interest rates in the

context of debt, namely whether people knew how many years it would take for a loan at a 20%

interest rate to double, to assess whether basic financial knowledge most relevant for debt and debt

management was associated with larger debt burdens. These questions were inspired by our prior

research documenting a rise in debt close to retirement and they aim to shed light on how we can

interpret the statistics related to debt at older ages (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Oggero, 2020b).



       Many, but not all, of our HRS module questions were also present in the National Financial

Capability Study (NFCS), an online survey commissioned by the FINRA Investor Education

Foundation (FINRA, 2018). Below, we use the 2018 wave to assess debt data for persons in the same
                                                                                                      5


age range as in the HRS, but now for a larger set of observations. This survey provides uniquely

valuable information on how households manage their assets and liabilities, including subjective

measures of financial distress and debt burden. In particular, the 2018 NFCS added several new

questions about how people perceived their personal financial situations. The NFCS also includes

information on the potential determinants of financial perceptions and behaviors, such as negative

income shocks. Finally, and very importantly, the NFCS has included a set of financial literacy

questions since its inception in 2009, which have become known as the Big Five (Hastings, Madrian,

and Skimmyhorn, 2013).2 These questions permit us to assess respondents’ understanding of basic

concepts related to interest rates, inflation, risk diversification, bond prices, and mortgages. In more

recent waves, there is also a question on interest compounding in the context of debt, the same

question included in the HRS module. As in the HRS, we focus on respondents age 51-61 to look at

4,422 respondents on the cusp of retirement.

           In what follows, we first offer a descriptive overview of each dataset followed by a

multivariate analysis of the responses to the new questions of interest. The key survey questionnaires

are provided in Appendices A and B. While the most recent data we have available refer to 2018, this

analysis can shed light on older Americans’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic.



3. Debt at Older Ages in the HRS

           The bottom panel of Table 1 reports the demographic characteristics of our HRS sample,

combining the debt module with the HRS core data.3 About 58% of the respondents were women;

most were married, white, and had at least a high school degree. Moreover, many respondents (69%)

stated they were in good health or better. Household income averaged $103,000 and average net

assets amounted to $274,000. Thus, this is a sample of relatively high-asset and high-income

respondents.

    Appendix A describes all key HRS variables.
                                                                                                     6


Table 1 here

       The top panel of Table 1 provides an overview of key financial perceptions and behaviors,

differentiating between positive versus negative ones. Starting with the positive outcomes, we find

that only about one quarter (24%) of the HRS respondents in our age range (51-61) were

completely/very satisfied with their personal financial situations, and only around two-fifths (39%)

believed they had very good/excellent credit scores. Turning to the negative perceptions, we find that

about two-fifths (41%) of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that they had too much debt, and almost

one-quarter (23%) said that they had been contacted by a bill collector in the previous year. These are

disquieting percentages, given that these are older respondents who should be close to the peak of

their wealth accumulation. Moreover, about one-quarter (24%) indicated that they had unpaid/past

due bills from a healthcare or medical service provider, while 15% had outstanding student loans for

themselves or partners. We consider outstanding student loans as a negative behavior because of the

age range considered, with such individuals having only limited possibilities to take advantage of

long-term payoffs from education. Overall, these statistics indicate that debt looms large for

substantial groups of pre-retirees, perhaps because of their inability to manage their debt

appropriately.

       This interpretation is supported by additional evidence about older persons’ lack of

understanding regarding interest compounding in the context of debt. When asked how long it would

take for debt to double if a loan’s interest rate was 20%, fewer than one-third (31%) of our older

respondents could answer this correctly. Evidently, financial illiteracy regarding compound interest

is a widespread phenomenon, even in the older population, despite the fact that this group has likely

already dealt with several types of debt over their lifetimes. When it comes to financial literacy,

experience does not seem to be a great teacher, confirming earlier findings (Lusardi and Mitchell,

2014). We also find that most of our older respondents (66%) indicated that 10 years earlier, they had

given no thought to how much debt they would hold today.
                                                                                                           7


        The top panel of Table 2 reports the extent of heterogeneity in positive financial perceptions

and behaviors among this older population. Generally speaking, the more financially satisfied were

more likely to be men, college-educated, higher income, and white. A similar pattern applies to

peoples’ beliefs that they had a good credit score; in fact, whites were twice as likely to report having

good credit scores compared to nonwhites. The least-educated systematically reported less

satisfaction with personal finance and worse credit scores.

Table 2 here

        The lower panel of Table 2 reports which types of respondents felt they had too much debt.

Women, the less educated, those with low income, and nonwhites were all far more likely to report

feeling overburdened by debt, with the largest difference between whites (37%) versus nonwhites

(47%). Whereas almost one-quarter (23%) of this population had been contacted by a debt collector,

the rate was higher among low-income households (31%) and high school dropouts (28%). Women

were more likely (29%) to report having unpaid medical bills than men (20%), and low-income

respondents versus their highest paid counterparts (13%). Nonwhites (28%) were more likely to

report having unpaid medical bills than whites (21%). Differences by sociodemographic status were

narrower for student loans, though again 17% of the older women said they held these, versus 12%

of the men. The college educated and higher paid were more likely to have student loans; these loans

therefore appear to be carried into later life. The final row of Table 2 shows that lack of thought to

debt was more prevalent among the least educated (76%), those with low income (79%), and

nonwhites (77%). In sum, a majority of the HRS respondents confirmed that they had devoted very

little attention to financial planning for later life, including planning related to debt.

        To assess how peoples’ positive and negative financial perceptions and behaviors are

associated, Table 3 reports simple correlations between the key outcomes measured in the HRS

module. Two things stand out. First, those who have medical debt are also likely to be contacted by

debt collectors; the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.55, highlighting that this type of debt is quite

likely to have negative consequences. Medical debt is also highly correlated with the feeling of having
                                                                                                      8


too much debt (0.35). Thus, even in this sample of higher-asset and higher-income older respondents,

many feel that medical debt is out of control and creates repayment problems. Second, having too

much debt is highly negatively correlated with peoples’ satisfaction with their own personal finances.

Other results are commensurate with expectations. The least financially satisfied had student loans,

and they were less likely to have given thought to debt 10 years previously. In sum, debt and debt

mismanagement behaviors appear to have serious implications for older people’s financial situation

and well-being. Next, we examine which variables are associated with these outcomes.

Table 3 here

       Tables 4 and 5 offer multivariate analyses of the positive and negative financial perceptions

and behaviors, respectively. In each case, we estimate OLS models; nonlinear models are not essential

in our case (and the OLS models are easier to interpret). The first column of both tables includes only

sociodemographic controls, an indicator of whether the respondent knew the correct answer to the

interest compounding question, and household income indicators (by quartile). The subsequent

column adds to these controls total net wealth (by quartiles) to account broadly for different levels of

resources.

Tables 4 and 5 here

       Table 4 focuses on the two positive outcomes: whether people reported that they were satisfied

with their personal finances, and whether they believed that their credit scores were at least good or

better. Factors not consistently linked to positive financial outcomes include education, being

married, and race. Nevertheless, having more children was negatively associated with personal

financial satisfaction and credit scores, by 2-3 percentage points (equivalent to 9% and 7% changes

on a base of 0.24 and 0.39, respectively). Being in good/excellent health was associated with a 52%

higher probability of being financially satisfied (12 percentage points on a base of 0.24), and a 31%

higher probability of reporting better credit scores (12 percentage points on a base of 0.39), perhaps

because these people had smaller medical bills. Interestingly, the variable measuring knowledge of
                                                                                                      9


interest compounding was not statistically significantly associated with either outcome. All told, our

set of controls account for at most one-quarter of the variation in outcomes.

       Results in Table 5 summarize the factors associated with five negative financial perceptions

and behaviors, namely whether the respondent reported having too much debt, had been contacted by

a debt collector, had unpaid medical bills, had a student loan (for self or partner), or had given no

thought to debt 10 years prior. As anticipated from the statistics reported above, women were 11

percentage points (or 47% on a base of 0.24) more likely to indicate they had unpaid medical bills.

Older individuals were slightly less likely of not having thought about debt a decade earlier, and 3

percentage points (or 8% on a base of 0.41) less likely to report having too much debt, even after

controlling for many variables. Nevertheless, relatively few controls were systematically and robustly

linked to negative financial outcomes. Those with more children were weakly more likely to have

been contacted by a debt collector or have given no thought to debt a decade prior, but not to having

unpaid medical bills or student loans. Those with some college were 14 percentage points (or 96%

on a base of 0.15) more likely to hold student loans, possibly meaning that they did not complete the

educational program for which they borrowed money and still had to repay their student debt.

Moreover, they were 18 percentage points (or 77% on a base of 0.24) more likely to report having

unpaid medical bills, all else equal. By contrast, those in good health were 16 percentage points (or

72% on a base of 0.23) less likely to report being contacted by debt collectors. The lowest-income

households were not more likely to report negative financial outcomes, though being wealthier was

strongly correlated with fewer negative outcomes. Finally, knowing about interest compounding and

debt was not statistically associated with positive outcomes. Insights about who does some financial

planning, as reported in the last column of Table 5, are also useful. Here we see that older individuals

were slightly more likely to have thought about debt. Different from the other negative behaviors,

being white and college-educated was associated with a 15% and 29% lower probability of not having

planned for debt, respectively (10 and 19 percentage points on a base of 0.66). No significant

differences were found for women, those in better health, or by income; moreover, only those in the
                                                                                                     10


highest wealth quartile appeared to have thought about debt a decade earlier. Finally, those who

answered the interest compounding question were no more likely to have thought about debt 10 years

previously than their less-informed counterparts.

       While there is no single strong driver of the negative financial perceptions and experiences

summarized in Table 5, some groups such as women and the less educated do emerge as persistently

vulnerable. Health is also a very important factor, and perhaps one of the channels it affects financial

well-being is via the cost of health care. Overall, the evidence suggests that researchers must look

beyond preferences and economic circumstances to understand debt and outcomes related to debt. It

also shows that some groups who were subsequently hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic

were already vulnerable before the spread of the virus.

       In overview, then, the HRS dataset confirms that, despite being on the verge of retirement, a

sizeable proportion of older Americans expresses negative financial satisfaction and carries debt,

including student loans and unpaid medical bills. Debt management is also a concern, in view of the

fact that so many of our respondents were contacted by debt collectors, thought they had too much

debt, and had failed to plan about debt 10 years prior. We turn now to the NFCS, with its larger

number of observations and additional questions, to help us understand these and other facets of debt

behavior close to retirement.



4. Findings in the NFCS

       The NFCS sample size for the same age group is roughly 10 times larger than the HRS module

examined above; accordingly, estimated effects should be measured with more precision here than in

the smaller HRS debt module. The NFCS contains a set of questions comparable to those in the HRS

to assess debt at older ages Moreover, the NFCS included additional questions relevant to
                                                                                                                11


understanding debt and debt management. For example, the NFCS included the Big Five financial

literacy questions in addition to the interest compounding question.4

        We start by examining the questions most similar to those in the HRS module. The top panel

of Table 6 shows that only 33% of the older NFCS respondents were satisfied with their personal

financial situations (answering 8 to 10 out of a 10-point scale), similar to the HRS respondents.

Almost three-fourths of the NFCS sample (70%) believed they had above-average credit records.

While the NFCS does not ask about planning related to debt, we have information on whether people

have planned for retirement, a variable which has been shown to be a strong predictor for wealth

accumulation (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Among our respondents, a little over half (55%) said they

had tried to figure out how much to save for retirement.

Table 6 here

        While the top panel of Table 6 displays positive financial perceptions and behaviors, the lower

panel reports negative outcomes. Once again, the NFCS data confirm the HRS results: over one-third

(36%) of older adults reported being over-indebted. Specifically, on a scale from 1 to 7, they answered

5, 6, or 7 to the question, “How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ‘I

have too much debt right now.’” Moreover, 15% had been contacted by a debt-collection agency in

the previous year, 20% had unpaid medical bills that were past due, and 9% had student loans for

themselves or spouses and partners. Again, these percentages underscore the fact that older

Americans are likely to carry debt not only close to but also into retirement.

        We also note that the NFCS asked respondents the interest compounding question cited above.

Here we find again that fewer than one-third (32%) of older adults could answer the question

correctly, and 43% overestimated the amount of time it would take for debt growing at 20% to double

(consistent with the 45% reported in the HRS). Accordingly, both datasets confirm that older people

have limited knowledge about interest compounding, even though many hold debt close to retirement.

 More information about these questions and summary statistics on sociodemographics of the NFCS analysis sample are
provided in Appendix B.
                                                                                                      12


When we look at the Big Five financial literacy questions, we see that older respondents were also

uninformed about other and even simpler economic concepts, such as the workings of inflation, risk

diversification, mortgages, and basic asset pricing. On average, older respondents were able to answer

only 3.25 of the five financial literacy questions.

           Table 7 reports correlations for positive and negative perceptions and behaviors. As before,

there is a strong positive correlation (0.49) between having unpaid medical bills and being contacted

by a debt collector. Both variables are also strongly positively correlated with having too much debt

(0.32/0.33) and negatively correlated with personal finance satisfaction (-0.22). Having student loans

is also strongly positively correlated with having too much debt (0.19), underscoring the difficulty of

carrying this type of debt close to retirement.

Table 7 here

           Tables 8 and 9 dig more deeply into the NFCS data using multivariate models of individuals’

financial perceptions and behaviors, similar to the HRS analysis. Here we again explore both positive

and negative outcomes associated with sociodemographic controls similar to those used previously,

along with two additional important pieces of information available in the NFCS. The first indicates

whether respondents had experienced a large and unexpected income drop in the previous year, and

the second is a comprehensive measure of respondents’ financial knowledge. In particular, we

constructed a financial literacy index (“Big 5 FinLit”), which is the sum of the correct answers to the

Big Five financial literacy questions.5 In addition, we include a separate question identical to that

asked in the HRS module on interest compounding knowledge to be able to compare the results.

Tables 8 and 9 here

           Table 8 reports results for positive perceptions and behaviors, where the responses equal 1 if

the respondent indicated satisfaction with his/her personal finances (a score greater than 8 out of a

10-point scale), or having at least a good credit score, and 0 otherwise. In the NFCS, we also have

information on retirement planning, set equal to 1 if the respondent had planned for retirement and 0

otherwise. As above, we use OLS estimation.

       Here too, and confirming the HRS evidence, older people are slightly more likely to be

satisfied with their personal financial conditions and report having a good credit score. The larger

NFCS sample size provides additional statistical power to the results here, in that married persons

were more likely to have positive financial perceptions; singles were 5 percentage points (or 9% on

a base of 0.55; see Appendix Table B) less likely to have planned for retirement, and

separated/divorced individuals were between 9% and 16% less likely to report all the positive

financial perceptions and behaviors. Also, widowed persons were less satisfied with their credit scores

and less likely to plan for retirement. Having dependent children again contributed to poorer financial

satisfaction, lower credit scores, and less retirement planning. We also show that African-Americans

were significantly less sanguine about their financial situations: they were 18 percentage points less

likely to report good credit scores compared to whites (25% on a base of 0.70). Interestingly, better-

educated respondents were more likely to report good credit scores and plan for retirement, but their

financial satisfaction was no better than average. Individuals who had experienced an income shock

in the previous year were 14 percentage points (or 21% on a base of 0.70) less likely to report good

credit scores, and 15 percentage points (or 45% on a base of 0.33) less likely to be satisfied with their

personal finances compared to those without such an income shock.

       As noted above, the NFCS includes the questions needed to construct respondents’ financial

literacy index, which we lacked in the HRS module. In the NFCS, this index was positively related

to reporting good credit scores and planning for retirement, even above and beyond the role of

education. In particular, being able to answer one additional financial literacy question correctly was

associated with a 11% higher probability of planning for retirement (6 percentage points on a 0.55

base) and a 4% rise in the chance of reporting good credit scores (3 percentage points on a 0.70 base).

Confirming the HRS evidence, those who could answer the interest compounding question correctly

in the NFCS were not systematically more likely to express positive views of their financial situation,
                                                                                                     14


although they were more likely to say they planned for retirement. Thus, the interest compounding

question alone may be insufficient to capture financial knowledge affecting older persons’ debt

outcomes; instead, a more comprehensive set of financial skills is needed to explain debt at older

ages.

        Table 9 reports multivariate results of four negative perceptions and behaviors related to

respondents’ debt position in the NFCS data. Here again we see that older individuals were less likely

to report having too much debt, being contacted by a debt collector, holding medical debt, and having

student loans for themselves or partners. The fact that indebtedness and over-indebtedness decrease

as people age echoes what has been found in prior HRS studies as well (Lusardi, Mitchell, and

Oggero, 2020a). This implies that debt continues to be repaid at older ages, though debt remains

pervasive among people approaching retirement and there are signs of financial distress, as indicated,

for instance, by the percentage of older people contacted by debt collectors.

        In Table 9 we also see that having dependent children contributes to feeling over-indebted

among older individuals, by 8 percentage points (or 21% on a base of 0.36). Moreover, African-

Americans were disproportionately more likely to report negative debt perceptions and behaviors,

despite controlling on income and other demographic characteristics: they were 9 percentage points

(or 59% on a base of 0.15) more likely to be contacted by a debt collector, 9 percentage points (or

44% on a base of 0.20) more likely to have unpaid medical bills, and 11 percentage points (or 120%

on a base of 0.09) more likely to have student loans. Interestingly, people reporting an income shock

were up to 22 percentage points more likely to report any of the four negative outcomes, exacerbating

their debt situations. In particular, they faced a sharply higher probability to be contacted by a debt

collector (a 119% increase on a base of 0.15) and have unpaid medical bills (a 96% increase on a base

of 0.20). By contrast, those scoring higher on the financial literacy index questions were slightly less

likely to report negative debt perceptions, while those who knew the correct answer to the interest

compounding question were similar to those who did not. Accordingly, we conclude that having basic
                                                                                                                  15


and general financial literacy helps limit debt exposure at older ages.6 We are able to explain up to

14% of the variation in the dependent variables for negative outcomes, and 25% for positive

perceptions.

          Given the large sample size in the NFCS, we also considered a narrower age group (56-61) to

look at respondents very close to retirement, to determine whether results changed and whether debt

was concentrated among the younger versus the older age group. In results not detailed here, we show

that findings are similar overall, i.e., there is evidence of distress related to debt even in the older age

group.7



5. Conclusions and Implications

          Our analysis of two rich datasets on older Americans confirms that many older individuals

carry debt even as they near retirement. This turns out to have consequences: many felt that the debt

they held was excessive, creating stress and problems including being contacted by debt collectors.

Our analysis also highlights the importance of demographic characteristics, such as being nonwhite,

having low income, having children, and being separated or divorced, as drivers of negative

outcomes. The HRS data show that older women were almost 50% more likely to indicate they had

unpaid medical bills; conversely, being in good health was associated with a much higher probability

(52%) of being financially satisfied, and a larger chance (31% higher) of reporting better credit scores.

The NFCS dataset highlights the negative role of being hit by shocks and the positive role of financial

literacy. Specifically, individuals experiencing an income shock in the previous year were less likely

to report good credit scores and less likely to be satisfied with their personal finances, while they

faced about double the probability to be contacted by a debt collector or have unpaid medical bills.

The more financially literate reported more positive financial perceptions and behaviors: being able

  Prior research has demonstrated that loans are complex products for consumers (van Ooijen and van Rooij, 2016), and
poor financial literacy increases the likelihood of holding high-cost credit (Disney and Gathergood, 2013), choosing
mortgages with larger balloon payments (Gathergood and Weber, 2017) and not taking advantage of refinance
opportunities (Barbi and Bajo, 2018).

to answer one additional financial literacy question correctly was associated with a 11% increase in

the probability of planning for retirement and a 4% rise in the likelihood of reporting a good credit

score. Accordingly, it is clear that older people also require financial knowledge if they are to better

manage their debt exposure. We also found that African-Americans on the verge of retirement were

significantly more financially vulnerable than whites.

       To date, the household economics literature has devoted relatively little attention to debt and

debt management, particularly at older ages. Accordingly, our paper contributes to knowledge by

identifying which older individuals may need assistance coping with money mismanagement

problems. We also suggest that guidance and training programs could be effective in enhancing

financial literacy, capability, and retirement planning/saving outcomes, even at older ages. In other

words, in addition to focusing on retirement savings as means to enhance retirement security, it is

crucial to understand debt at older ages.

       More generally, if we are to better understand how people are positioned to manage their

finances in retirement, additional research on older peoples’ complete balance sheets would be

informative. For instance, in view of the high rates of older peoples’ medical debt, more attention

could be brought to bear on how to better protect against health shocks and high medical costs in later

life. Moreover, the extent and prevalence of student loans at older ages could benefit from additional

attention. Finally, employer-provided retirement security programs could explore not only how to

foster savings, but also how to help protect people against high debt as they near retirement.

Enhancing financial literacy is another way to help improve a variety of debt-related outcomes at

older ages.
