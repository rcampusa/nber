          The appreciation of the U.S. dollar over the past five years opens

 important areas of research. The fact of a large and persistent real

 appreciation poses a challenge for equilibriunj theorists to uncover the

 change in fundamentals and seems to supprt the role of long—term wage

 contracts in macroeconomic adjustment. This paper adopts the perspective of

 given wages and investigates in a partial equilibrium setting the

determinants of relative price changes of different groups of goods.

Specifically it advances hypotheses about those sectors where an exchange

rate change should lead to large relative price changes and others where the

relative price effects should be negligible.

          The general idea is to draw an models of industrial organization to

explain price adjustments in terms of the degree of market concentration.

the extent of product homogeneity and substitutability, and the relative

market shares of domestic and foreign firms. The exchange rate movement and

the less than fully flexible money wage interact to produce a cost shock for

some firms in an industry ——   foreign   firms in the home market and home firms

abroad—— and thus bring about the need for an industry-wide adjustment in

prices.

 important areas of research. The fact of a large and persistent real

appreciation poses a challenge far equilibrium theorists to uncover the

terms of Fischer—Taylor long—term wage contracts the episode provides a

striking example of the differential speeds of adjustment of wages, goods

and assets prices. This paper adopts the latter perspective and explains the

determinants of relative price changes of different groups of goods.

 slow.l There is a long—standing questioning of PPP, especially in the work

of Kravls and Lipsey (1978, 1983). But so far there seems to exist no formal

analysis of price setting behavior in this context.2

          This paper adopts a partial equilibrium approach in that it assumes

throughout a given, exogeneous movement in the nominal exchange rate. The

exchange rate movement and the less than fully flexible money wage interact

to produce a cost shock for some firms in an industry ——   foreign   firms in

the home market and home firms abroad—— and thus bring about the need for an

industry—wide adjustment in prices. Although the assumption of exogeneous

exchange rate movements and sticky wages is apen to criticism, it is a

useful working hypothesis for the purpose of investigating relative price

issues.

          The first section reviews some facts. Section 2 offers a stylized

view of the link between exchange rates and prices. The third and fourth

sections study respectively the behavior of materials prices and

manufactures



1. Some Facts

          The large dollar appreciation is reflected both in absolute and

relative prices. Table 1 shows two measures of the change in U.S. relative

costs and prices; relative unit labor costs and the relative value added


1See Dixit(1983) and Helpman and Krugman (1985) for extensive work on
and references to trade applications. In the macro context see
lanchard 1985), Hart (1982) and Mankiw (1985).
 Aizenman (1984,1985) and Giovannini (1985) investigate price setting
behavior in the context of exchange rate ,ovements. Their focus,
however, is on short—term issues of transactions costs and
uncertainty rather than on the large, persistent movements in the real
exchange rate.

deflator in manufacturing. In each case the U.S. series is deflated by the

corresponding time series (Dr the trade—weighted average in dollars of our

trading partners. The magnitude of the change in relative costs and prices

arises from the fact that unit labor costs and prices abroad in national

currencies were rising at a lower rate than in the U.S. and that the dollar.

rather than offsetting the divergent trend by a depreciation, further

reinforced that divergence by a strong appreciation.

slow down and ultimately import prices fall in absolute terms. Export prices

track the GD? delator more closely though the pattern of divergences is

similar to that for imports. At this broad level it is clear then that

import prices fell relative to the deflator and relative to export prices.

          In the absence of comprehensive price series Table 2 shows unit

 values for different export and import groups. The table shows that the

 absolute decline in import prices must be attributed to the first three

groups, and not to finished manufactures. Oil price increases In 1979 easily

explain the divergent pattern of export and import unit values for crude

materials. The interesting comparison therefore is between the relatively

homogenous commodity groups——food and semi—manufactures—— and finished

manufactures where price setting and product differentiation are likely to

be important. For the former group export and import unit values move

roughly in line, while for finished manufactures exports follow the domestic

price trend and imports show a much smaller of an increase.

         We aim now to models of price determination for commodities and for

manufactures to explain these patterns.




2. standard Models

         There are two extreme models that have been studied extensively in

the literature. One aspumes that the 'law of one price holds. Prices of
                                  S


goods are geographically arbitraged and, adjusted for tariffs and transport

costs, they are equalized in different locations. Homogeneity, information

and perfect competition assure this result.   Let p., p. and e denote the

price of good I in the home country and currency, the foreign price, and the

home currency price of foreign exchange. Arbitrage then implies:



(1)      p1 =   ep.

        In this form, or in the first—difference version of Gustav Cassel,

the law of one price is asserted in the PPP literature. The law of one price

has seen important application in the monetary approach to exchange rates

which combines the quantity theory of money, price flexibility, and PPP to

obtain a theory of the exchange rate. An important implication of coniplete

spatial arbitrage, not only for commodities but for all goods, is the idea

that relative national price levels in a common currency are independent of

the exchange rate since exchange rate movements merely reflect, passivejy,

divergent national price trends. That is. of course, an application of the

homogeneity postulate which holds when money is fully neutral.

        The alternative model might be called "Keynesian'. Here it is

assumed that each country is fully specialized in the production of "its

own' good. Domestic and foreign goods are less than fully homogeneous or

substitutable. Wages are fixed in national currencies or at least sticky.

        Letting P and * be the national GDF deflators, the relative price

of domestic and foreign goods or the real exchange rate then is:


3For a review of PPP see Dornbusch (1985).
                                     6




 (2)            • P/eP


 If the   mark—up of prices over unit labor   costs   is   constant   then for given
unit labor costs prices will be given. Hence in this model, exchange           rate
movements change relative prices one—for—one. Exchange rate—induced changes

in the relative price affect the world distribution of demand and

employment. This approach tends to be used in open economy versions of the

IS—LM model in the Meade—Mundell tradition.

          In what follows we show that equation (1) would be a useful model of

international price relations for materials——say sisal, copper, tea——

whereas (2) more nearly describes what happens with manufactures. But the

assumption of a constant mark—up is no longer justified when domestic and

foreign firms have strategic interactions in their pricing.



3. Materials Prices

          In this section we consider the prices of cDmmodities. To be

specific we discuss the IMF indices of metals and agricultural raw materials

as concrete examples. We make the point that movements in the real exchange

rate between the dollar and other currencies will affect the real prices of

commodities in terms of the U.S. GNP deflator. Put alternatively, given the

U.S. GNP deflator a real appreciation of the dollar will reduce world

commodity prices In dollars.

          Consider a simple model of the world market for a commodity. There

are two regions, the U.S. and the rest of the world. The rest of the world
                                     7


 is viewed as the foreign country and denoted by an asterix. World demand for

 commodities depends on the real price of commodities in terms of GtiP

 deflators in the two regions and on real activity. The supply of commodities

 is assumed exogeneous.

where

                 are domestic and foreign activity

        pp* are commodity prices in home and foreign currency

                 the national deflators



Now it is assumed that materials or commodity prices are arbitraged so that

p—ep.

Using that relation in (3), and the definition of the real exchange rate X E

P/eP*, we can solve for the real commodity price of the U.S. in terms of

activity, commodity supply and the real exchange rate:



(4)           p/P=J(Yy*•_;S)



        The model is illustrated in Figure 2. The schedule MM shows the

commodity market equilibrium for given levels of activity and a given

supply. It has a negative slope since an increase in the real price to users

in one region reduces demand; in order to restore market equilibrium there

must be an offsetting cut in the real price for the other region. Note that

the real price is always measured in terms of the respective regions' GNP
                                   8


deflators. The ray OR has a slope equal to P1eP. Equilibrium obtains

initially at point A.

         The model confirms the well—established cyclical behavior of real

commodity prices an increase in activity raises real commodity prices. But

there is also a role for the real exchange rate: equation (4) shows that a

real appreciation of the U.S. will lower real commodity prices in terms of

the U.S. deflator while raising them in terms of foreign deflators.4 In

terms of Pigure 2 the ray OR rotates to OR as a result of the real

appreciation and the equilibrium shifts to point B. This effect is simply

the implication of a flexible price model for commodities combined with an

assumed change in the real exchange rate. The latter assumption implies that

real commodity prices, in terms of the respecti"e users deflators, must

change because the law of one price does hold for commodities but not for

def lators.

         The elasticity of the real commodity price with respect to the real

exchange rate is determined by the elasticities of demand of the two regions

weighted by their shares in canmodity absorption. The model does have the

implication that the elasticity should be less than one. With equal demand

elasticities the fraction reduces to the U.S. share in world commodity

absorption.

         The model was tested with quarterly data for agricultural raw

materials and for metals over the period 1970—85:1. The real price of each

commodity group in terms of the U.S. deflator was regressed on a distributed

lag of the U.S. real exchange rate and on world industrial produrtion.5 The

regession is run in the log difference of the variables.

Note: t—statistics in parenthesis




         Both activity and the real exchange rate appear as significant

determinants of changes in the real commodity price. The real exchange rate

has the anticipated sign, but the quantative effect is far larger than the

model predicts. Recall that the coefficient should be a negative fraction,

perhaps —0.5, but certainly not larger than unity in absolute value.

         There are a number of possible explanations for seeming the

overreaction to real exchange rates apparent in Table 3. Perhaps the most

likely reason for the result is the neglect of structural change and supply

side effects including inventories. But commodity markets (unlike the

markets for manufactures) operate in the manner asset markets and hence an

emphasis on interest rates and a distinction between anticipated and

unanticipated movements in the determinants of demand is also appropriate.



4. Manufactures

         Table 1 gave evidence of large, persistent fluctuations in exchange

rate—adjusted relative prices in manufacturing. In this section we explore

theoretical models that would explain these price movements as the result of

changes in relative unit labor costs.
                                   10



         The basic assumption we make is that firms in any industry have a

linear technology, with labor as the only input. Unit labor costs, w and w

are given in home and foreign currency respectively. This assumption about

costs is combined with a model of pricing to yield predictions about the

behavior of relative prices. The experiment is simply this: the exchange

rate change, say a dollar appreciation, lowers foreign unit labor costs in

dollars. As a result the market equilibrium is disturbed in each industry

and price and output adjustments must occur. What these adjustments look

like depends on three factors:6

          Market integration or separation. Is a particular commodity is

traded in an integrated world market, or are there significant barriers to

restrict spatial arbitrage?

          Substitution between domestic and foreign variants of a product.

The extent of substitution influences price setting and the output effects

of cost and price changes.

          Market arganisation. Is the market perfectly competitive in which

case forms are price takers, or is the market imperfectly competitive or

oligopolistic in which case firms are price setters and may interact in

strategic ways?



Two models lend themselves in a straight forward fashion to formulating the

price response to cost shocks of part of the industry. The Cournot model

assumes perfect substitution between alternative suppliers and places more

emphasis on the extent of oligopoly. It allows in principle more variation


   fourth item of relevance is the functional form of the demand
curve.
                                    11



in the mark—up in response to cost shocks and thus has the potential for a

richer pattern of response to cost shocks.The Dixit—Stiglitz (1977) model by

contrast emphasizes imperfect substitution between alternative suppliers and

in its predictions jocks very much like the     Keynesian model discussed

above. An alternative to the Dixit—Stiglitz model, again emphasizing product

differentiation, is the Salop model of competition of competition on a

circle.



The Cournot Model:

          In the Cournot formulation the analytical focus is on a homogeneous

commodity sold in an oligopolistic market. Each seller assumes that other

sellers defend their sales volume. We assume that there is an effective

spatial separation between the home market and foreign markets and discuss

the pricing in the U.S. market.

          Market demand is linear in the price of the commodity:



(5)        D=a-bp

where all non—price determinants are captured in the constant. There are n

domestic suppliers and n foreign firms with respective sales of q and

per firm respectively. Aggregate sales of these firms have to sum to market

demand:




(6)       D=nqtn*q*
                                     12


         Each firm maximizes profits taking the sales of other firms as

given. Profits of the representative domestic and foreign firm in the home

market are:




(7)
        111
               (p—w)[a—bp —(n—1)q —ntq]



         It.    (p/e—w)[a-bp —nq



         Maximization gives rise to the reaction functions shown in Figure 3.

The home country s reaction function is JJ while JtJ' represents the foreign

country. They yield the oCournot—e Nash equilibrium shown at point A which

gives the equilibrium quantity allocation between representative domestic

and foreign firms. The common equilibrium price in the industry is given by:



(8)       p — (nw. n*ew*)/N + a/bN        N =   n.n+1


      A dollar appreciation shifts the J*J* schedule out and to the right,

thus leading to increased foreign sales and reduced domestic sales. At the

initial level of sales for every supplier, the individual foreign firm faces

a given marginal revenue schedule in dollars but experiences a reduction in

its dollar marginal cost and hence wishes to increase output. In the flew

equilibrium at point Aforeign firms increase their output while home firms

contract. The industry price declines, as seen from (8).

          We are now interested in the exte:,t to which exchange rate movements

(or movements in relative unit labor costs) affect the equilibrium price.
                                   13



 The elasticity of the equilibrium price with respect to the exchange rate,g

 is:




 (9)       g   (n*/N)(ew*/p)



         The elasticity formula has two determinants: the relative number of

 foreign firms (or the relative number of firms with wages not fixed in

 dollars), and the ratio of marginal cost to price of foreign suppliers.

Since both terms are fractions it is immediately clear from (9) that a

dollar appreciation will lower price less than proportionally. The decline

 in the dollar price is larger the more competitive the industry ——   i.e.   the

smaller the mark—up of price over marginal cost—— and the larger the share

of imports in total sales. This latter term is represented by n*/N on the

assumption of symmetry and initially equal wages between countries.

        Equation (9) is interesting because it stretches all the way from

the "small country" case to the case where exchange rates have virtually no

impact on home pricing. The small country case, in the trade literature, is

the case where a country is a price taker in world markets. In that case a

currency depreciation will raise prices in the same proportion. This is, of

-course, the limiting case here under perfect competition and a number of

foreign firms that is large relative to hone firms.

        The other extreme of no influence of the exchange rate on home

prices results when there are few firms in the industry, most of which are

domestic. In that case foreign firms absorb the dollar appreciation

primarily in the form of extra profits rather than increased sales.
                                      14


        The Cournot model thus potentially explains both unchanging prices

and steep price declines. The market structure -—     import   share and

concentration ——   are   the key parameters that explain the outcome.

        Consider next U.S. export firms competing in a foreign mrket. A

dollar appreciation will lower their marginal revenue in dollars. With

unchanged marginal dollar cost these firms will contract. In terms of

Figure 3 applied to the foreign market our schedule JJ shifts down and to

the left. The common foreign currency price rises, but in dollars it

declines, though less than proportionately to the appreciation. Using the

same model for the foreign market we find that the elasticity of foreign

price with respect to the exchange rate is



(10)
              —    (n/N*)(w/ep*)


where n' is the number of domestic firms in the foreign market and N* the

total number of firms. With 9* a negative fraction the dollar price of

exports, pee, has an elasticity 1+9* and hence must decline in response to a

dollar appreciation.

        Consider next the price of U.S. exports relative to the price of

imports. Remembering that the markets are separated we look at p/ep*. In

case of a dollar appreciation, dollar export prices rise relative to import

prices if the following condition holds:

         In principle the condition can go either way. In the small country

case export and import prices in dollars fail in the sape proportion as the

currency appreciates (g=1. 9—1) so that the relative price p/ep remains

constant. In general the outcome depends on the relative oligopolistic

structure of the two markets. Export prices will rise relative to import

prices, in the appreciation case, if at home import competition is pervasive

and foreign markets are strongly affected by U.S. suppliers as well as

highly competitive.7



The Dixit—Stilitz Model: The representative consumer in this model

maximizes a utility function V with consumption of two commodities z and x

as arguments.



(12)    V =   tJ(zx)   x =                   0< a< 1



We focus on commodity x which is an index of consumption of different brands

of the sane good. We assume that there are n domestic firms supplying sane

variant each, and n foreign firms doing the same.

        Maximization yields the demand for each individual brand, as well as

the utility—based price index for commodity x:


7me results are sensitive to the functional form of the demand curve.
With a constant elasticity demand function 0= Ap the easticity of
equilibrium price with respect to the exchange rate becomes    =
(n*/N)(ew*/W) where N=n+nt and I'? =(n/N)w • (ri/N)ew. The exchange
rate impact thus depends no longer on cost—price mark—up and, when
costs are initially equal between countries, is only    functicn of the
relative number of firms. In that case the wage—price ratio w/p = 1—
1/SN.

           We are now interested in the response of prices to cast shacks. The

individual imperfectly competitive firm faces a demand curve as in (13) with

the relative price of its product p/p as the determinant. The firm assumes

it is sufficently small so that its own price changes leave the industry

price, F, unchanged. The representative firms profits are



(15)
         ii (1 —        w)x1


Maximization yields the familiar constant mark—up pricing equation:



(16)     p1 = aw                  a       11(1—1/c)



where a depends inversely on the elasticity of substitution among variants.

Since the industry structure is symmetric each domestic form will follow the

salie   pricing   rule with an equal mark-up.

          We now assume again markets are separated and we can thus

meaningfully discuss the price set by a foreign firm for our market. Foreign

firms in the home market face the same form of demand curve as home firms
                                       17



and hence they also follow the same pricing rule, with the same mark-up, but

with foreign wages in dollars, mc, as the base of their pricing.



(17)     p.     aew



          From (16) and (17) we have two strong predictions: First the

relative price of domestic and foreign variants in the home market depends

just on relative unit labor costs in a common currency:



(14) P/P =         w/ew



          The industry price can be calculated and it is readily shown that

the relative price of a domestic variant in terms of the industry price

index            is just a function of the relative wage, w/ew*. The elasticity

of the relative price will be



(15)          n*z/(n+n$z)       Z   = (wIew*)1'l


If   wages are initially equal between countries the effect of an exchange

rate change on the industry price and on the relative price depends merely

on the fraction of firms that has wages fixed in foreign currency and hence

experiences a reduction of their costs in dollars when the dollar

appreciates,

         Given the wages in hone and foreign currency the Dixit—Stiglitz

model provides strong predictions about the impact of dollar appreciation:
                                       18


      .The prices of imported variants fall in proportion to the decline of

dollar unit labor costs of foreign firms and the prices of domestic variants

would remain unchanged.

      Exporting firms at home, although they have to compete in foreign

markets, still follow their mark—up pricing on dollar wages. Accordingly a

change iii   the   dollar does not affect their dollar export price. Of course,

it does affect their sales and profits. A dollar appreciation will raise

their foreign currency price in the same proportion and hence raise their

relative price in the foreign market.

           The strong prediction of the model is to look for a sharp fall in

import prices relative to domestic prices and to see export prices stay

constant relative to domestic prices of the same variant. This is. of

course, the exact specification of the fixed—price 'Keynesian' model which

is derived here as an implication of given labir costs and an invariant

mark-up.



An Extended Dixit Stiglitz Model:

           The Dixit—Stiglitz model represents Chanberlinian imperfect

competition and hence each supplier assumes that he does not affect industry

price. Strategic interaction with other firms is therefore excluded. But the

same structure of differentiated products can easily be adapted to introduce

strategic interaction by way of a conjectural variation. Assume, contrary to

the preceding section, that the individual firm is sufficently large to

affect industry price. Assume, too, that fir,;is respond to changes in the

industry price and let the conjectural variation be the parameter a. a
                                          19


fraction between zero and one. Thus a one percentage point rise in the

industry price is assumed to cause each firm to raise their price by ,

percent.   Assuming a given conjectural variation rather than deriving it from

a dynamic game—theoretic framework is obviously a shortcut.

           With this adaptation the demand curve facing the individual firms

price policy no longer is a constant mark—up over unit labor costs but

rather becomes



(18)         =           a'   =   1/[l—   1/c(1—t)]



where the tern c emerges to capture the strategic interaction between firms.

The term is a function of relative prices and the conjectural variation:8



(19)       0 c C(a.P/p.) E                              C I



        From (18) and (19) it is clear that pricing decisions are now

interdependent, so we can represent each firms pricing policy in terms of a

price reaction functions.



(20)       p =


              = F*(P.c.c)ew*

8The tedious derivation of (19) relies on the definition of the
industry priceR, the conjectural variation and the assumption of
symmetry for domestic firms and for foreign firms so that we can deal
with representative firms.
                                  20




        Figure 4 shows the impact of a dollar appreciation in this setting.

The schedules F? and PF are the reaction functions and A is the initial

equilibrium.

        An appreciation wili shift the foreign reaction function up and to

the left. the magnitude of the shift at constant relative prices (e.g. along

the ray OR) is proportional to the appreciation, Thus AB/BO represents the

percentage appreciation. The new equilibrium is therefore at A'. Note that

this equilibrium at A' differs from the Dixit—Stiglitz one and resembles

more nearly the Cournot model. Foreign firms reduce their price

proportionally less than the reduction in dollar unit labor costs and home

firms cut their price. But at A' the relative price of domestic products has

increased relative to A as can be seen by the slope of a ray through A'

compared to OR.



Competition on the Circle:

       We conclude the discussion of masnufactures prices with a sketch of

a third model of pricing for differentiated products. In the Dixit—Stiglitz

model consumers buy some of each brand of a product. Applied to toothpaste

that is an implausible model; we should look for an alternative model where

consumers buy only one brand. A particuiarly manageable version is the Salop

(1978) model where consumers' tastes (defined by preferences for the

attributes or characteristics of goods) are uniformly spread over the unit

circle. Since domestic and foreign firms have potentially different costs, a

symmetric equilibrium does not necessarily exist. We simplify matters by

assuming that there is an even number of firms and that domestic and foreign

firms alternate along the circle and that each consumers buys a unit from

one or the other of the firms adjacent to his preferred location.

         Producers have constant unit labor costs and other than entry costs

there are no fixed costs. With these assumptions we can derive equilibrium

prices and study the impact of dollar cost changes for foreign suppliers.

Each consuner is located at a point on the circle. The significance of the

location on the circle is that firms may not supply precisely the most

preferred product and that accordingly the consumer is forced to chose

between the alternatives offered by the most adjacently located brands.

Following Salop consumer surplus derived from buying a good that is a

distance x Iron the best location (on the circle) depends on the price and

on the distance and the relationship is assumed linear:



121)    h = v—cx—p



where v is a constant. c denotes the utility cost per unit distance from the

best location and p is the price of a particular firm. Consumers will be

indifferent between the brands offered by two conpeting firms on either side

of their preferred location if the consumer surplus is the same, h. =
                                                                        h.
Taking the case of n firms that are equally spaced on the circle the

condition for indifference between a domestic and a foreign supplier is:



(22)      v —   cx   -
                         v—cO/n   —
                                      x)   —p
                                                    22


Hence the distance served by a foreign fir, is an increasing function of the

price charged by domestic firms and a declining function of its own price.



(22a)    x =       (p+c/n—p')/2c


Profits for the foreign firm are equal to 2Lx times the excess of price over

marginal cost:



(23)                 =    (p*_ew*)2L(p.c/n_p*)/2c


where L denotes the total number of consumers and hence L also represents

the density per unit distance served by the fir,. Since the firm serves both

sides of its location 2Lx is the total number of units sold. Maximization

taking domestic price as given yields the foreign reaction function:



(24)           pt= (p. c/n +             ew*)/2


The typical domestic firm's reaction function is derived in the same manner:



(25)           p         (pt +    c/fl   +   w)/2


From (24) and (25) we obtain the solution for the prices charged by home and

foreign firms:



(26)           p =       c/n     '-(ew •2w)/3            pt   c/n + (2ew*   -w)/3
                                       23




           From (26) we can calculate the elasticity of prices with respect to

the exchange rate.




(27)            =   (l/3)(ew/p)        id =    (2/3)(ew*/p*)


Note that these elasticities, once again are fractions. If wages and hence

prices are initially equal. wep, the elasticities simplify to the

following expressions:



(27a)           = Y/3       w'= 2y/3          fl 11(1+ c/nw)



The elasticities show that the relative price of imported goods declines and

that the change in the relative price 1/3 is smaller the smaller the number

of firms in the industry and the lower the substitutability as measured by

the term c. Along with the change in relative prices there will be a shift

in demand from hone firms to foreign firms as consumers tradeoff the

reduction in price for a larger distance iron their most preferred brand

location


9At this point it is worth commenting on the properties of the
equilibrium when there is not an alternating pattern between domestic
and foreign firms. Specifically suppose that there are five firms, two
domestic and three adjacent foreign firms. It is apparent that the
middle foreign firm competes only with foreign firms and hence will
cut its price more than the outlying foreign firms that compete with
home firms which have not experienced a cost reduction. Hence there
will be three prices.
                                             24


        The same model can be applied to the foreign market. In terms of

foreign exchange the prices will rise and the relative price of our export

brands abroad will rise. But because it rises proportionally less than the

currency appreciates, the export price in dollars changes in the proportion:




(28)    laY =   I   —    2YI3           1'    = 1/(Ic/n*w)


where n is the total number of firms serving the foreign marketwe can

therefore find the change In the relative price of domestic exports in terms

of imports and in terms of home brands:



(29)      &ou=          1—   2(T+Y)/3                 1 —    2y/3   -1/3




        The first point to note is that export prices may rise or fall in

terms of import prices as a result of appreciation. But the fewer the number

of firms in each country, the more likely that an appreciation leads to a

fall in the relative price of exports. By contrast as the number of firms

increases (and hence y and Y tend to unity) the relative price of exports

must rise, reflecting the increase in the relative unit labor cost at home

which sets competitive relative prices.

        The second point is that export prices may decline relative to

domestic prices as a result of an appreciation. This must be the case if the

number of firms in the two markets is the same (y*) As the number of

firms Increases the relative price tends to remain unchanged. This result
                                  25



arises because price gets competed down to marginal cost which is the same w

for home and export production. It is apparent fro. (29) that the change in

the relative price in terms of laportables will always be larger than that

in terms of domestic goods.



Summary: We have now seen common features of a number of models: they all

predict that appreciation should lead to a decline in the price of imports.

In the case of homogeneous goods domestic firms, of course, fuliy match the

decline in price. If products are differentiated it will always be the case

that the relative price of the imported brands declines in response to an

appreciation. The extent of the decline depends on a measure of competition

and on the relative number of home and foreign firms.

        The empirically testable hypotheses concern price—marginal cost

mark—ups and the behavior of relative prices. For differentiated products it

is always the case that export and domestic prices will stay closer in line

than import and domestic prices. In the Dixit—Stiglitz model imports fall in

terms of domestic goods and the relative price of exports goods stays

unchanged in terms of hone goods. In other models the export price can in

principle even decline in terms of imports.



Some Evidence: Econometric testing of the hypotheses is unfortunately

precluded by the absence of a comprehensive matched data set of export.

import and domestic prices. The BLS does now publish transactions prices

for exports and imports that are disaggregated to the 4—digit levei and

classified on the SIC basis. But few of the series go back beyond the early
                                   26


iRROs. Where they do the revisions of the SIC—based U.S. producer prices

in most cases are either not at all available yet or only go back very few

years. A complete overlap between export, import, and domestic prices for

more than two years apparently only exists for fewer than a handful of cases

and overlap between any two series is limited to less than a dozen.

        At a more informal level there are intersting patterns to observe.

First consider a comparison of U.S. export prices in dollars with those of

Germany and Japan. Table 3 shows the percentage loss in U.S.

competitiveness over the period 1980:IV to 1984:1'.' using as a sample all

available data at a highly disaggregated level.   In the U.S—Germany

comparison there are 36 different matched time series, in   the U.S—Japan
comparison there are 20. Typical items in the list of commodities are

 gears and gear units or 'household electrical space heating".

        The data do not allow us to tell whether these are prices of the

same products sold in the sajie third market (say France) or whether they

represent exports to different markets (say U.S. sales to France and German

sales in the U.S.). Accordingly we cannot tell from these data whether they

reflect market segmentation or imperfect substitution. They are consistent
                                    27



with markets being segmented but goods being perfect substitutes and having

a common price in the same market independent of supply source. But they

are also consistent with markets being integrated —— a common world market

——   but goods being imperfect substitutes so that the relative price of

different suppliers can change.

          Consider next a comparison of the transactions prices of U.S.

exports and U.S. imports in the same commodity group. There is simply

overwhelming evidence that virtually without exception the dollar

appreciation of the past 5 years has been accompanied by an increase in the

price of exports relative to imports. Evidence in this direction comes from

export—import price comparisons at the more narrow 2— and 4—digit level. An

example is provided in Table 4 which shows data for two 2—digit industries.

prices in these individual commodity groups. The first finding then is that

across industries, virtually without exception, export prices have increased

relative to import prices. This is true at the level of individial

commodities but also. as we saw at the outset of the paper in Table 2. for

aggregate export and import unit values.

        This result would obtain strictly only in the Dixit—Stiglitz model.

In the other formulations it is a possibility though it need not occur.

Tables 6 and 7 iook at the relative price of exports and imports in terms of

domestic goods. Export prices change little relative to domestic prices.

even though there is no clear pattern of decline in all industries. By

contrast most import prices decline in terms of domestic goods.But the order

of magnitude of the decline remains relatively small compared to the change

in relative unit labor costs, With a change in relative unit labor costs of

more than 40 percent the decline in the relative price is in most cases less

than 20 percent. That is not at all out of line with the theory once some

degree of "pricing to the American market" is taking into account, just as

the price setting models above suggest. It is worth noting that at the

retail level this effect would obtain even more strongly. The reason is that

here distribution costs come intop play so that even with the full pass—

through of cost reductions on imported goods the proportional decline in the

price of imported goods would be much less than the exchange rate

appreciation.



5. Concluding Remarks
                                  29


        The models reviewed in this paper focus on a relatively short time

perspective. The wage rate is assumed not to react to changes in output and

profitability and the number and location of firms in an industry is

unaffected. These assumptions are plausible in the short term, but it is

clear that a sustained real appreciation will ultimately showe its effects

in wage cuts in those industries where the loss in competitiveness causes

unemployment and wage increases in the expanding sectors. Firms will close

in high wage areas and entry into an industry will take place in areas where

labor costs are low. These longer term adjustments are also part of the

macroeconomics of adjustment to exchange rate movements. It is clear from

the analysis offered here that also for these issues a microeconomic

pe:spective will be helpful. In particular it will be interesting to see how

pricing decisions are affected by entry and relocation possibilities at an

international level and by the anticipated persistence of disequilibrium

exchange rates.
