                                          ABSTRACT

We employ a unique hand-collected dataset and a novel methodology to examine systemic risk
before and after the largest U.S. banking crisis of the 20th century. Our systemic risk measure
captures both the credit risk of an individual bank as well as a bank’s position in the network. We
construct linkages between all U.S. commercial banks in 1929 and 1934 so that we can measure
how predisposed the entire network was to risk, where risk was concentrated, and how the failure
of more than 9,000 banks during the Great Depression altered risk in the network. We find that
the pyramid structure of the commercial banking system (i.e., the network’s topology) created
more inherent fragility, but systemic risk was nevertheless fairly dispersed throughout banks in
1929, with the top 20 banks contributing roughly 18% of total systemic risk. The massive
banking crisis that occurred between 1930–33 raised systemic risk per bank by 33% and
increased the riskiness of the very largest banks in the system. We use Bayesian methods to
demonstrate that when network measures, such as eigenvector centrality and a bank’s systemic
risk contribution, are combined with balance sheet data capturing ex ante bank default risk, they
strongly predict bank survivorship in 1934.

1 Introduction

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) focused attention on the importance of understanding the
connections between financial institutions, which have been seen as a means for propagating distress
(Allen and Gale, 2000; Elliott et al., 2014; Acemoglu et al., 2015; Allen et al., 2010; Freixas et al.,
2000; Dasgupta, 2004; Caballero and Simsek, 2013). Researchers and policymakers have sought
a better understanding of the characteristics that predispose financial systems to systemic risk as
well as the potential negative macroeconomic externalities when “systemically important” financial
institutions suspend or fail.1

       In response, researchers have developed new analytical measures aimed at quantifying institu-
tional as well as aggregate risk.2 These tools provide new insights into the interpretation of systemic
risk, although researchers continue to explore their properties and utility for policy makers. To date,
studies have largely focused on the period around the GFC. This is somewhat surprising, given the
well-documented challenges of measuring connections between the “shadow banking system” and
the regulated sector of the 2000s, a need to understand the “out of sample” properties of these
tools, and the benefits from comparing the GFC to earlier crises.3

       To shed further light on these issues, we analyze how the largest financial crisis of the 20th
century – the Great Depression – altered the network of financial institutions in the United States.
To do so, we construct network measures using a new data set of correspondent banking relation-
ships for all commercial banks and trusts in the United States in 1929 and 1934. In contrast to
most recent approaches that estimate financial linkages from financial flow data, our measure of
connectedness for 1929 and 1934 uses stated bank correspondent relationships based on historical
bank records.4

       We then develop tools to compute individual bank risk and systemwide risk to measure the
exposure of the entire commercial banking network to risk before the Great Depression began, and
   1
      The Dodd Frank Act (2010) defines a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) as one that is large,
complex, linked to other financial institutions and “critical,” providing services that may have few close substitutes.
For an example of a model linking systemic risk externalities to measurement of it, see Acharya et al. (2017).
    2
      For a survey of methodologies, see Bisias et al. (2012).
    3
      Research is now beginning to explore them in the context of earlier periods. For example, see Brownlees et al.
(2017), which tests a variety of empirical measures of systemic risk on a small subset of commercial banks. By
contrast, our research models the connections across an entire network and for a particular crisis.
    4
      For example, Billio et al. (2012) construct networks of financial institutions using bivariate Granger causality
regressions based on inferences from asset returns. Exceptions are Burdick et al. (2011); Brunetti et al. (2017), which
examine the properties of “physical connectedness” for U.S and European banks, respectively, during the 2007-8
crisis.

analyze where and how much risk was concentrated in individual banks within the network. We
assess whether the pyramid-like structure of the banking system that existed prior to the Great
Depression concentrated risk, and how counterfactual failures or interventions to rescue systemically
important banks would have changed overall systemic risk. We examine how the failure of nearly
9,000 banks between 1930–33 altered risk within the system. Finally, we test whether the 1929
network measures of connectedness and risk are useful in predicting subsequent failure. The pyramid
topology, geographical distribution of risk, and various network positions of the thousands of bank
failures make studying the Great Depression a useful contribution to the systemic risk literature.
These features are unlike the recent crisis and are important for understanding the impact of crises
on networked systems.

   We find network features can quantify the predisposition of financial systems to risk. In par-
ticular, we show that, even within the class of “scale-free” networks, a particular topology can
amplify risk. Relative to a “random graph” topology, the pyramid-like structure of the commercial
banking system that existed in 1929 increased fragility and the propensity for risk to spread by
concentrating banking interactions to particular nodes in the network. That said, systemic risk was
fairly dispersed in 1929, with the top 20 banks contributing roughly 18% of total systemic risk.

   Because our risk measure can be decomposed to show an individual bank’s contribution to
systemic risk, we assess if network features are helpful in predicting whether individual banks
failed or merged during the severe banking crisis of the early 1930s. Using marginal likelihood
computations, we show that when network measures such as eigenvector centrality and a bank’s
systemic risk contribution are combined with balance sheet data that capture ex ante bank default
risk, they strongly predict bank survivorship in 1934. Banks more central to the system or with
higher ex ante default risk were more likely to subsequently fail. On the other hand, we find that
a bank’s individual contribution to systemic risk positively impacts survivorship, an interesting
result in light of the large-scale intervention by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to rescue
banks beginning in 1932 and perhaps the wellspring of American “too big to fail” banking policy.
Bayesian model selection and in-sample hit rates dramatically favor a specification when network
measures are included, suggesting network-based systemic risk measures may have considerable
utility for policy makers wanting to understand where risk lies in the system and the implications
of that risk.

   Having identified where risk resided in 1929, we show that, of the 20 systemically riskiest banks



                                                 3
prior to the Depression, only one of them subsequently failed, raising overall systemic risk per
bank by 1.59%. This result is largely because the systemically riskiest banks, while central to
the network, had below average credit risk going into the Depression. They flexed, in response to
massive withdrawals of deposits, but for the most part, did not break. Had all 20 of them instead
failed, systemic risk would have risen by over 50%. Bank failures in the early 1930s were largely
concentrated in smaller– and medium–sized institutions, and the 30 largest realized bank suspen-
sions of the Great Depression were not central to the correspondent network system, accounting
for only 8.33% of aggregate systemic risk in 1929. We also find that the massive banking crisis of
the early 1930s reshaped the network and redistributed risk: it raised systemic risk per bank by
33% and increased the riskiness of the 20 largest banks in the system by 5 percentage points. The
distribution of risk thus became more concentrated at the top of the system.


2 Data

To construct network measures and to compute individual bank risk and systemwide risk, we
use information on the correspondent relationships for all commercial banks and trusts in the
United States in 1929 and 1934. Institutional linkages, as used here, report on observed network
relationships rather than those inferred from data, although, like many other network measures for
banks, the data cannot quantify the intensive margin (i.e., we lack information on the precise size of
the balance sheet connections between financial institutions). Correspondent relationships initially
arose to service the needs of customers conducting business in larger cities and the financial centers
of the United States in the 19th century, and were later reinforced by banks that met mandated
regulatory reserve requirements by maintaining balances in larger city banks.

       We collected data on correspondent relationships for the entire banking system in 1929 (roughly
26,000 banks) and in 1934 so that we could analyze how the system changed as a result of the bank-
ing crisis of 1930-33.5 These data, as well as information on each bank’s balance sheet and other
characteristics (location, population of city or town, date of first charter, Federal Reserve mem-
bership, etc.), were hand collected from Rand McNally Bankers Directory (July 1929, September
1934). On the liabilities side, the publication lists four items: paid-up capital, surplus and profits,
deposits, and other liabilities. Rand McNally also records four categories on the asset side of the
ledger: loans and discounts, bonds and securities, miscellaneous assets, and cash and exchanges
   5
    Foreign correspondents exist for some large city banks in locations such as New York and San Francisco. These
are excluded from our analysis.

(due from banks). In describing directional relationships within the network, a “respondent” is
defined as a bank that initiates a business relationship with another bank for its customers or
itself (i.e., to satisfy reserve requirements by holding interbank deposits at a bank in a large city).
A “correspondent” bank is the bank that satisfies those business needs. Because Rand McNally
reports these precise correspondent relationships, we initially coded the relationships direction-
ally, as illustrated in Figure 1. Dexter State Bank located in Dexter, Iowa, lists two banks as
its correspondents in 1929: Iowa National Bank (Des Moines, IA) and Continental Illinois Bank
and Trust (Chicago, IL). The correspondent bank Iowa National Bank in turn lists First National
Bank (Chicago, IL), Continental Illinois Bank and Trust, Midland National Bank (Minneapolis,
MN), and Guaranty Trust Company (New York) as its correspondents. Since we lack data on the
intensive margin, we follow other analyses of financial networks and treat linkages equally in the
data (i.e., no adjustments are made for differences in flow).


3 The 1929 Network

We begin by describing the contours of the network just prior to the Great Depression. In July
1929, 26,671 respondent banks and 4,204 unique correspondent banks existed. Our data set shows
the complete list of relationships between these financial institutions. After removing rows and
columns in which correspondent banks did not have a relationship with a respondent bank, we are
left with 25,144 rows (respondents) and 3,602 columns (correspondents) for 1929. This matrix is
“sparse” since many of the elements are zeros.

   In 1929, there are 3, 062 banks that were both correspondents and respondents. Hence, the
number of banks having at least one relationship with another bank is 25, 684 (= 25, 144 + 3, 602 −
3, 062); this determines the number of nodes n in the network graph. Correspondent banks that

are not also listed as respondents are typically non-depository institutions and international banks,
for which we do not have balance sheet data. Finally, the relationship between respondent and
correspondent banks is a many-to-many relationship, meaning each respondent bank may be related
to more than one correspondent bank, and vice versa.

   The adjacency matrix for the network is defined as A(i, j), i, j = 1, 2, ..., n, where n = 25, 684
for 1929. A(i, j) = 1 if respondent bank i has a relationship with correspondent bank j, else
A(i, j) = 0. The total number of links in the network is 70,679. Examining their distribution, most
respondent banks have very few correspondents. On the other hand, correspondent networks can
be very large – in the thousands – a fixture that has implications for the shape of the network.
Figure 2 plots the locations of correspondent and respondent banks in 1929. If a bank is both a
respondent and correspondent, it is plotted as a correspondent bank. The size of the point for
correspondent banks is proportional to 1 plus the natural logarithm of the degree of the node and
is plotted in blue color. Respondents are in red.

   Correspondent banks are clearly more connected. Country banks, the term used to describe
banks located in small towns and cities, are close to their correspondents, which explains the
widespread geographical coverage by correspondent banks. Nevertheless, correspondent banks ap-
pear to be located in larger cities.

3.1 Network Statistics

To better understand the structure of the commercial bank network prior to the Depression, we
compute a variety of common network statistics. We first examine the density of the network.
Clusters, defined here as the number of disjoint connected components, describe one aspect of
network connectivity. In 1929, there were 31 such disjoint groups. Of these, there is one extremely
large connected component of 25,576 banks (out of a total of 25,684). Therefore, the banking
network is almost fully connected. The remaining 30 components have sizes of 22, 12, 9, 6, and the
rest have four nodes or less.

       The number of links that a node has is known as its degree, and the computation of degree
is directionless. That is, even though our network is directed, degree only depends on a node’s
links, regardless of the directional linkage (i.e., respondent to correspondent or correspondent to
respondent). For 1929, the mean degree of nodes in the network is 5.50 with a standard deviation
of 49.60.6 The median degree in the network is 3.0 in 1929.

       The “degree distribution” of the nodes is shown in Figure 3. The left plot shows nodes with
degree less than 50 while the right plot shows nodes with degree greater than 50. The distribution is
extremely skewed with a large number of nodes with low degree and a few nodes of very high degree.7
We can also examine this feature by plotting the (log) number of nodes against the (log) number
of links (degree). Figure 4 shows the expected quasi-linear and negative relationship characteristic
of a log-log plot of a network, where we have excluded extreme nodes with degree greater than 50.
The data on bank nodes exhibit the usual power law distribution that is characteristic of social
networks (Barabasi, 2002; Barabasi and Bonabeau, 2003; Gabaix et al., 2003). The power law
coefficient α = −1.65.

       Understanding which nodes have the greatest influence in the network, i.e., which nodes are the
most critical, is also of interest, especially for policymakers who might want to identify “too big to
fail” or systemically important institutions (SIFIs). Although there are many ways to capture this
mathematically, we use several variants of the most common measure, centrality. First, centrality
can simply be measured by the number of connections a node has, i.e., its degree; this is known as
degree centrality. Of course, degree centrality ignores the fact that a node with few connections may
   6
     Note that the number of links per node is the number of links divided by the number of nodes, i.e., 70679/25684 =
2.75. Since each link connects two nodes, it accounts for two degrees. Therefore, the mean degree of the network is
twice 2.75, i.e., 5.50.
   7
     This is characteristic of a scale-free network. For a full exposition, see http://barabasi.com/f/623.pdf. See
also Barabasi and Bonabeau (2003).

Figure 4: Log-log plot of the degree distribution in 1929 excluding extreme nodes with degree greater than
50. We plot log degree on the x-axis and log of the density function on the y-axis. For power-law densities,
the function is f (d) = d−α . Taking logs we have ln[f (d)] = −α ln(d). The power law coefficient is α = −1.65.

still have a huge influence if it is connected to a node with many connections.8 Degree centrality
may be varied by computing degree to a chosen depth, say three levels deep, a parameter chosen
at the discretion of the modeler. The top banks by degree centrality in 1929 are shown in Table 1.

      A more general formulation is eigenvalue centrality (Bonacich, 1987; Bonacich and Lloyd, 2001),
where centrality (ci ) of a node is defined as a function of the centrality of the nodes to which it
is connected, through the network matrix, A. This leads to a circular system of n simultaneous
equations:
                                             n
                                             X
                                      ci =         Aij cj ,       ∀i = 1, 2, ..., n.                        (1)
                                             j=1

This system of equations may be written in matrix form such that:

                                                      λc = A · c                                            (2)

where λ is a scalar quantity, c is a vector of size n, and as before, A ∈ Rn×n . Equation (2) is
an eigensystem, and one solution to this system of equations is the principal eigenvector in an
eigenvalue decomposition of adjacency matrix, A. This is known as the centrality vector, which
contains n components, ci , i = 1, 2, ..., n. Eigenvalue centrality is equivalent to degree centrality
computed with infinite degree depth. The banks with the most eigenvalue centrality are also shown
in Table 1.

      As shown in Table 1, Continental Illinois Bank and Trust (Chicago) has the most linkages
in the network, with 4,474 in 1929. Chase National Bank is second (in both degree centrality
and eigenvalue centrality) with 2,982 linkages. Eight of the top 15 banks with the highest degree
centrality are located in the financial centers of New York City and Chicago. In 1929, these were
known as central reserve cities since non-Fed member banks could satisfy their state-mandated
reserve reserve requirements by holding reserves in banks located in these cities. The other seven
are in reserve cities of the Federal Reserve system. Combined, these locations give rise to the
pyramid structure analyzed in the next section.

      A third measure for determining the importance of nodes is betweenness centrality, which assigns
importance to a node in a network if it sits at the intersection of paths between other nodes. In this
context, a node has importance because it acts as an information “broker.” Betweenness centrality
is calculated as the number of shortest paths in the graph that pass through a given node. Following

one still has a lot of influence.

                                         bv =                                                    (3)
                                                i,j
                                                       g(i, j)

where g(i, v, j) is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j that pass through node v, and
g(i, j) is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j. The summation is taken over all (i, j)
where i 6= j 6= v and i 6= v. Centrality is normalized, with the highest scoring (most important)
bank being set equal to one and others set relative to this value.

   Interestingly, the results differ when considering betweenness centrality. Only one of the top 10
banks using this measure are located in the central reserve cities of New York and Chicago (versus
the majority of banks for the two other measures). As Table 2 shows, using betweenness centrality,
the most influential connector nodes are coast-to-coast and geographically dispersed.

3.2 The Pyramid Structure of the 1929 Network

Financial historians provide us with some priors about the general topology of the network in 1929
– features that evolved out of the evolution of correspondent banking. Their descriptions point
toward a network topology resembling a pyramid, where banks in cities, such as New York and
Chicago, had the greatest number of connections; those in other large cities, such as St. Louis,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco, had fewer linkages; and banks in small towns and cities had the
least. In this section, we explore the extent to which their priors are confirmed by the data, and
examine the degree to which the topology of the network predisposes the system to risk.

   The structure of the correspondent banking network that existed on the eve of the Depression
had evolved over the course of the nineteenth century, especially after the Civil War and the
establishment of nationally chartered banks. As the nation grew and population moved westward,
banks located in smaller towns and cities sought correspondent linkages with financial centers to
carry out business on behalf of their customers as well as on their own account. Further, the
National Banking Act of 1864 led to increased circulation of bank drafts as a national payments
instrument (James and Weiman, 2010). It had the effect of solidifying the importance of New
York correspondent banks at the apex of an emerging pyramid-shaped correspondent network as
these centrally-located banks could mediate payments of bank drafts between parties regardless of
their location (Redenius, 2007; James and Weiman, 2011). The national banking acts of the 1860s
further required “country banks” (those located in the hinterlands) with national bank charters to
meet legal reserve requirements by keeping a portion of their reserves as cash in their vaults and

                                                  11
the remainder (originally up to three-fifths) in correspondent banks in “reserve” or “central reserve
cities” (larger cities dispersed throughout the country). State laws (applying to those banks that
received charters to operate from state banking authorities) reinforced the need for correspondent
relationships by also requiring state-chartered banks to split their reserves between vault cash and
interbank balances kept in the larger city banks.

    Thus, as a result of the growth of a national payments system and regulations, interbank deposits
were particularly concentrated in reserve and central reserve cities, and fostered a pyramid-like
structure in terms of correspondent relationships.9 The Federal Reserve Act altered the structure
of reserves, with framers imagining a system whereby banking panics (not uncommon in the late
19th century) would be reduced by consolidating deposits in one of the Fed’s 12 regional reserve
banks instead of being scattered among hundreds of commercial banks in scores of reserve cities.10
The Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1917, required national and state-member banks to meet
their reserve requirements entirely by holding deposits at their regional Federal Reserve Bank.
By 1929, however, only 10% of state-chartered commercial banks had joined the Federal Reserve
System.

    Since roughly 90% had declined to join, much of the reserve pyramid remained in place in 1929
(Mitchener and Richardson, 2019). Non-member banks continued to meet their state-mandated
reserve requirements by holding interbank deposits at banks in one of the 63 reserve cities as well
as Chicago and New York – the central reserve cities. They also held their excess reserves in these
reserve-city banks, which they used to manage liquidity and offer a broader array of services to
their clientele.11 To a large degree, then, this pyramid structure was a relic of the national banking
era (when regulations allowing reserve requirements to be met by holding them in larger-city banks
were first imposed (Anderson et al., 2018a), and the subsequent failure of the Federal Reserve
System to convince all state-chartered banks to switch their charters and join the system after 1914
    9
      This reserve pyramid proved ineffective during large financial crises of the nineteenth century, when reserves
became difficult, and at times impossible, to access. When faced with widespread demands for cash and credit,
reserve city banks hoarded funds for their own defense and left country banks to fend for themselves. As a result,
banking panics periodically shut down the payments system (Kemmerer, 1922; Sprague, 1910). The pyramid structure
was thus more effective at satisfying needs arising around the payments system than it was at providing liquidity to
distressed institutions.

      For a detailed analysis of the interbank network and 19th century crises, see Calomiris and Carlson (2017). For
additional research on how the founding of the Federal Reserve influenced the interbank market, see Carlson and
Wheelock (2016) and Carlson and Wheelock (2018).
   11
      Federal Reserve member banks also deposited excess reserves at correspondent banks in reserve and central reserve
cities, since commercial correspondent accounts paid a higher interest rate (typically 2%) than Federal Reserve Banks
(typically 0%). This was particularly true of reserve-city banks, which deposited their excess reserves in money-center
banks in New York and Chicago. In June 1929, member banks held 93% of all interbank deposits in the United States.
Nonmember banks held only 7%.

(Anderson et al., 2018b).

   To examine the properties of this particular network topology, and in particular how they relate
to systemic risk, we compare the diameter and fragility of our network to a random graph network.
Diameter is defined as the maximal shortest path between any pair of nodes in the cluster for a
non-directional network. It is the max-min measure over all paths between all pairs of nodes. This
is a measure of how many banks it takes for a financial flow to spread from one edge of the network
to the other, thus giving us some insight into how quickly “contagion” could occur. The bigger
the diameter, the less likely that a local financial shock will become a global event in a banking
system. We define the concept of “system fragility” as the Herfindahl index normalized by dividing
by mean degree: R = E(d2 )/E(d), where d is degree of each node. Fragility takes concentration
more explicitly into consideration than diameter because a highly-concentrated network tends to
have a greater risk of transmission. If a highly central node is compromised, the propensity for risk
to spread to the other nodes is high, which is captured by fragility.

   We begin with an example that illustrates the differences between a pyramid structure and a
random graph. Pyramid graphs are mostly tree-like, even though they are not directed acyclic
graphs (or DAGs). Panel A of Figure 5 displays an undirected graph of 10 nodes, where a principal
node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. Node 2 is then connected to nodes 1, 5 and 6, node
3 is connected to 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 4 is connected to 1, 9, 10. This looks like a tree but the
specification of node 1 at the top of the tree is artificially imposed – one can just as easily “pick
up” any other node and make it the root of the tree (or the apex of the pyramid). Topologically,
pyramid graphs are likely to have degree (connections) concentrated in a few nodes, and are within
the class of scale-free networks (Barabasi and Bonabeau, 2003; Barabasi, 2002). The graph in
Figure 5 (Panel A) has mean degree of 2.2 connections per node. For comparison, we also generate
a random graph of 10 nodes with mean degree 2.2 (Panel B of Figure 5). Even though both graphs
have the same mean number of connections per node, the concentration of connections in a few
nodes is higher in the former. A measure of node importance is “centrality,” analytically described
earlier. The normalized mean centrality for the pyramid network is 0.65 versus 0.60 for the random
network.

   The diameter of the pyramid network as well as the random network is 4, whereas fragility is
equal to 2.91 for the pyramid and 2.64 for the random network. These results suggest that, all
else equal, contagion will spread faster in the pyramid network because its connections are more

not necessarily look like a tree. The mean degree is 2.2. Panel B is a depiction of a random graph with 10
nodes and mean degree 2.2. Repeated simulations confirm the stability of this result.



concentrated.

      Having considered how topology matters for risk, we now turn to examining the actual network
for 1929. The 1929 network contained 25,684 nodes and mean degree of 5.5. For comparison, we
generated a random network with the same number of nodes and mean degree.12 The pyramid
network has a diameter of 13 (average shortest path length was 3.31) and fragility of 453, whereas
the random network has a diameter of 12 and a fragility of 6.5. The pyramid structure in existence
prior to the banking distress of the Great Depression made the network inherently more fragile
than a random network by increasing the centrality of particular nodes and concentrating risk.


4 Systemic Risk

4.1 Risk Scoring

We now turn to measuring systemic risk. We develop measures of both individual bank credit risk
as well as aggregate system-wide risk that incorporate the interconnectedness of banks noted in the
previous section. In order to construct the systemic risk score, we needed to quantify the credit
quality of all commercial banks. Since credit ratings were non-existent for the tens of thousands
of banks that were too small to be listed on the NYSE, we employ financial ratios to develop a
composite measure of credit risk, a product of inverse profitability and transformed leverage. We
combine this with the network matrix to create a systemic risk per bank.

      We begin with bank-level balance sheet and income data to derive bank-specific measures of
 12
      We generated several random networks and the results align with the presented case.


                                                         14
risk and define and/or compute the following financial ratios:


   1. Assets – the sum of loans and discounts, miscellaneous assets, bonds and securities, and cash
         and exchanges;

   2. Equity – the sum of paid-up capital plus surplus and profits;

   3. Leverage – assets divided by equity;

   4. Buffer stock of retained earnings (BUF) – stock of retained earnings (surplus and profits
         divided by equity).13


       We convert profitability into a risk score (C) using the following function of BUF, i.e., an inverse
profitability risk score:
                                                             1
                                              C =a+               ·b                                              (4)
                                                         1 + BU F
where a = −8 and b = 18. We can see that C ∈ (1, 10) because BU F ∈ (0, 1). An increasing score
implies greater risk. The mean credit risk score is 5.02 (median 4.90), with a standard deviation
of 1.92. The minimum and maximum scores are 1 and 10. The largest ten banks ranked in terms
of equity are shown in Table 3 alongside their credit risk scores and leverage ratios. Interestingly,
all of the largest banks have risk scores below the mean in 1929. Additionally, the most connected
banks in Table 1 have below average credit risk scores. Much of the balance sheet risk in the system
resided in medium to smaller sized banks.

       We also transformed our leverage ratio in Table 3 to deal with an artificial right skew arising
from positive outliers in the data, i.e., banks with very low equity. Leverage-based risk (L) is thus
calculated as the following transformed value:

                                          L = ln(1 + Assets/Equity).                                              (5)

Leverage-based risk has a mean of 2.10 and a standard deviation of 0.38.

       Finally, we compute a composite risk score, R, which combines the inverse of profitability
measure, C, and transformed leverage, L, such that:

                                                    R = C × L.                                                    (6)
  13
    This is close to a bank’s return on equity, however, because we do not observe dividends paid out, it is not
identical to it. It was nevertheless used by banks to expand operations or write off losses relative to the book value
of net worth. See Carlson and Rose (2015).

In the ensuing analysis of systemic risk, we focus on R since this metric has appealing properties.
For example, because it is possible for firms with a high BUF to have low equity (and consequently
high leverage), these firms would be quite risky, yet the measure C would not assign them as such.
Multiplying C by L compensates for this possibility. R has a mean value of 10.52 and a standard
deviation of 4.27.

      The risk measure, R, is analogous to modern credit-scoring methods such as the probability of
default which, for example, is computed using the Merton (1974) model. This model defines the
distance to default (an input to computing probability of default) as a leverage-adjusted measure of
volatility, providing the connection to our risk model here, where R is a leverage-adjusted measure
of inverse profitability. We use R since there are no measures of asset volatility available for all
banks in 1929.


4.2 Systemic Risk

We combine the network adjacency matrix A (described above) with the composite risk score for
each bank in the vector R to create a single measure of systemic risk per bank. We extend and
modify the metrics proposed in Das (2016) and Das et al. (2019). Our approach allows one to
empirically estimate “exposure” despite not knowing everything we might want about the financial
financial network. (For example, data on balance-sheet linkages between financial institutions is
often opaque or incomplete, both historically and today.) Systemic risk per bank, S, is thus defined
as:
                                                 1 √ >
                                         S =       · R ·A·R                                        (7)

where n, as noted before, is the number of banks in the system, and superscript > denotes the
transpose of a vector or matrix. (Recall that R is an n-vector and A is a n×n matrix. Thus, Q is an
n-vector.) Division by n is a normalization used to measure systemic risk per financial institution
and to account for the fact that the banking crises of the early 1930s drastically reduced the number
of financial institutions in the network by 1934 – the year we use for post-crisis network comparison
later in the paper. Equation (8) implies that systemic risk, as denoted by scalar quantity S, increases
if the elements of R (individual bank risk) increase, holding n and A constant. Likewise, ceteris
paribus, if the elements of A (interconnectedness of banks) increase, systemic risk per bank also
increases. Note also that since the elements of R and A are all non-negative, S is also non-negative.

   The systemic risk measure, S, may be thought of as a network, modified measure of composite
credit risk in the banking system. We note that it can be decomposed into two components: (1)
the amount emanating from individual bank risk and (2) that from network effects. If we replace
                                                                                  qP
                                                                                       n
the network matrix, A, with the identity matrix and recompute S, i.e., S 0 =                2
                                                                                       i=1 Ri   then this
measures composite emanating risk from individual bank risk only. The ratio S/S 0 ≥ 1 is a measure
of systemic risk arising from network effects.

   Plugging the values from the 1929 data into these equations, we find that the total systemic risk
per bank, S, is 0.104. The ratio S/S 0 = 1.46, suggesting that the network effect amplifies systemic
risk by a factor of 1.46. By itself, the value carries little meaning, but since it can computed at
different points in time (e.g. 1929 and 1934), the metric will allow us to examine how overall risk
in the system changes as a result of the banking crises of the Great Depression. To understand
where risk was concentrated prior to the Depression, we begin by breaking down systemic risk into
the risk contribution of each bank in 1929. This decomposition of the scalar function S(R, A) is
possible because the function is linear homogeneous in vector Q = [Q1 , Q2 , ..., Qn ]> , the normalized
value of R. We can apply Euler’s homogenous function theorem and obtain the risk decomposition
equation:
                                 ∂S         ∂S                  ∂S
                            S=       · Q1 +     · Q2 + . . . +     · Qn .                           (10)

                                 ∂S
Each partial derivative Sj =    ∂Qj   multiplied by Qj is the risk contribution of bank j. We can

which gives an n-vector of derivatives Sj . Once we know the amount of risk that is contributed
by each node, we can pinpoint the riskiest banks in the network in terms of their contribution to
overall systemic risk.

   Computing this for the 1929 data, we calculate each bank’s contribution to S. Table 4 shows the
percentage of systemic risk contributed by each of the top 20 risk contributing banks. Comparing
it to Table 1, we can see there is a considerable correspondence between the banks exhibiting the
most systemic risk prior to the Great Depression and the banks showing the greatest centrality.
However, an important additional feature of the 1929 network is that systemic risk is dispersed
across the entire network. Taken together, the top 10 banks account for 12.6% of the total systemic
risk and the top 20 banks account for 17.8%.

   We also recomputed the risk score in equation (6) using size weights based on bank assets, i.e.,
we redefined R = C × L × w, where w is an asset-based weight, such that if the bank was in the top

                                                 18

size decile by assets, then w = 3, and if it was between the 40th and 90th percentile, it was given a
weight of w = 2. All banks below the 40th size percentile had weight w = 1. We recomputed the
results in Table 4 and noticed no material changes. Therefore, the systemic risk measure is robust
to size-weighting of individual bank risk.


5 The Impact of the Financial Crisis on the Network

5.1 Network Features

As has been well documented by economic historians, waves of banks failures between 1930–1933
irrevocably altered the US financial system.14 Distress occurred throughout the country, but es-
pecially in rural areas and smaller towns. Using the 1934 data, we explore how the more than
9,000 banks that exited the system altered the structure of the network. Between 1929 and 1934,
the number of respondent banks declined by 36% (from 25,144 to 16,126) while the number of
correspondents fell by 41% (from 3,602 to 2,134). The number of banks in the network declined by
36%, from 25,684 in 1929 to 16,446 in 1934, and the total number of links in the network fell by
41%, from 70,583 in 1929 to 41,313. Comparing Figures 2 and 6 illustrates these changes spatially,
showing a substantial amount of thinning in both red and blue dots.

      The number of clusters (disjoint groups) fell from 31 to 27, but the system still retained one
large connected component with 16,380 nodes out of a total of 16,446. The mean degree of nodes in
the network declined slightly between 1929–1934, from 5.50 to 5.02. Other than the median degree

      For example, see Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Wicker (1996).

nodes of size 1-50, and the right plot shows the distribution for nodes of size greater than 50.



in the network falling from 3 in 1929 to 2 in 1934 (reflecting the disappearance of many smaller
banks from the system), the frequency plots of the degree of nodes for 1929 and 1934 look quite
similar: the 1934 system still exhibits the usual power law distribution (power coefficient α = 1.60)
with the bulk of mass at low nodes and just a few banks having extremely large numbers of nodes
(Figure 7).

   Table 5 displays the most central banks in 1934. Because Chicago experienced two pronounced
banking panics in 1931–32, Continental Illinois lost several thousand of its respondents to failure
(Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Calomiris and Mason, 1997), and thus slipped from being the bank
with the highest degree centrality in 1929 to second overall in 1934. Chase National Bank gained
a few hundred connections. Table 6 shows that for betweenness centrality, the top banks change
considerably in comparison to 1929, with only four from that year remaining in the top 10 (with
new entrants shown in italics in Table 6). The greater degree of temporal change in betweenness
centrality, relative to the other measures, likely reflects the fact that the banking crisis knew no
geographical limits. That is, even in 1929, many of the most influential banks were located outside
of the central reserve cities.

   We can also compare how the diameter and fragility of the network changed over time. As a
point of reference, we discuss these two measures in relation to those for the recent GFC. Between
1929 and 1934, the diameter remained the same at 13. The average shortest path length in 1934 was
3.25, similar to the 3.31 of 1929. Between 2005 and 2009, diameter remained quite stable, decreasing
from 5 to 4 as the network shrank because of bank exits (see Burdick et al. (2011)). Therefore,
the network was much wider in 1929 and 1934 compared to the recent financial crisis in the US.

In 1934, fragility fell by roughly one-fifth, from 453 to 354, suggesting that the system displayed
much more concentrated risk before the banking distress of the early 1930s. These numbers are
much higher than in 2005 when fragility was 138 (see Burdick et al. (2011)). Fragility in 2006 rose
to 172 and then dropped to 35 by 2009. While this was still high, system fragility during the GFC
was smaller by orders of magnitude than in the Great Depression. This difference may be driven
by the fact that analyses on 2005-2009 are performed on a small number of financial institutions.15

       Table 7 displays how our risk measures changed as a result of the crisis. The mean credit risk
score rose from 5.02 in 1929 to 5.65 (with an SD of 2.05) in 1934. Whereas all of the largest banks
had risk scores below the mean in 1929, circumstances had changed this by 1934: both National
City Bank of New York (6.17) and Continental Illinois (7.28) exceeded the mean of 5.65. Leverage-
based risk (L) shrunk slightly from 2.11 in 1929 to 1.93 in 1934 (with an SD of 0.39). Using the
composite risk score R = C · L, we can see that by 1934, the banking crises had raised the average
riskiness of banks, from a mean of 10.54 in 1929 to 10.76 (with as SD of 4.29).

       Because overall connectivity decreased between 1929 and 1934 (with the mean degree falling)
and balance-sheet risk, R, increased, the change in systemic risk S is not immediately clear. Using
the A matrix and R vector from the 1934 data, we recompute S. In comparison to 1929 (0.104),
total systemic risk per bank rose to 0.138. We thus find that the financial panics of the early
1930s increased systemic risk per bank by 33% – a dramatic change in a span of only 4.5 years.
  15
     Comparing the Great Depression with the GFC is not precise by any means. The construction of networks in
both periods uses quite different variables and there are differences also in the measure of bank credit quality, as
different credit risk variables were developed and employed in modern times. Therefore, these comparisons should
not be taken literally, but more as indicative of how financial crises change the structure of the banking system.

Given connectivity and balance sheet risk are moving in opposite directions, this number shows
that increased balance sheet risk more than offset the decline in connectivity. Note, however, that
the measure S/S 0 , the network multiplier, is marginally higher at 1.53 than in 1929 (=1.46).

    To investigate how the banking distress of the early 1930s redistributed risk, we can decompose
our systemic risk measure and examine it bank-by-bank. Table 8 shows the percentage of systemic
risk contributed by the 20 systemically riskiest banks in 1934. Comparing these figures to those
from 1929 (Table 4) reveals that the banking crises of the early 1930s caused the concentration of
risk in the network to rise. In 1934, the 10 systemically riskiest banks contributed 17% to overall
risk (versus 13% in 1929), while the top 20 contribute to 23% of the overall systemic risk (versus
18% in 1929). Additionally, while Continental Illinois lost thousands of connections, its balance
sheet risk increased enough so that it remains the systemically riskiest bank. These findings are
important from a modern regulator’s perspective because the network topology and number of
failures are unlike the GFC and thus provide additional perspective on understanding systemic
risk.



                                                23
5.2 Counterfactuals and Realized Suspensions

An important question from a regulator’s perspective is how overall systemic risk changes if some-
thing happens to one of the systemically riskiest banks? In this section, we discuss methods for
considering counterfactuals and present the changes to systemic risk due to the largest realized
suspensions that occurred during the Great Depression.

   Our model allows us to consider the effects of two types of counterfactuals that affect systemic
risk: (1) when banks are removed from the system (perhaps through supervisory action) and (2)
when banks fail. We begin by noting that the risk contributions, such as those shown in Table
4, have a useful mathematical property. They approximate the percentage reduction in per bank
systemic risk that occurs when any bank exits the system for some reason other than failure, e.g.,
ownership decides to voluntarily liquidate; it is correctly quantified by the risk contribution of
the bank. For example, if Continental Illinois Bank and Trust, the top risk contributor in 1929,
were to exit the banking network, then the per bank systemic risk metric, S, would decline by
approximately 3.2%. Therefore, when a bank exits, system-wide risk falls by approximately the
same amount that the bank contribute to overall systemic risk.

   Given this insight, it follows that our analytic solution also permits direct measurement of the
percentage reduction in systemic risk achieved if a bank were “quarantined.” In this counterfactual,
a bank is quarantined if it remains in the network, but is not allowed to fail. Such a situation could
arise if a regulatory authority chooses to intervene during a crisis, perhaps if a bank is viewed as
systemically important or “too big to fail.” We can simulate this by setting the risk score, R,
for the bank equal to zero (i.e., the government backstop), leaving it in the network, and then
recalculating S. It turns out that this has the same effect as removing the bank from the network
altogether. Therefore, if Continental Illinois were quarantined, risk falls by 3.2%. Even when a
collection of banks is quarantined, the same result is realized. For example, if we allow the 10
riskiest banks in 1929 to be quarantined, the reduction in systemic risk is 13.5% and the sum total
of their individual risk contributions is 12.7%.

   The second counterfactual of interest considers how the hypothetical failure of an ex ante
systemically important bank affects overall systemic risk. In our model, when a bank fails, risk in
the system rises through its relationship to other banks in the adjacency matrix. We can simulate
the failure of the of the 10 systemically riskiest banks by setting their risk score, R, equal to
the maximum risk score across all banks in 1929. Table 9 displays the results of this simulation.

Clearly, systemic risk changes drastically if the riskiest bank, Continental Illinois Bank and Trust,
fails: overall systemic risk S increases by approximately 13%. Chase National’s bankruptcy would
lead to over an 8% increase in S. The simultaneous failure of all 10 of the top contributors would
raise systemic risk by over 50%, even without considering dynamic risk to the network (how it
changes other banks’ risks in the A matrix).

    We now turn to the results for realized distress. In general, banks identified as the systemically
riskiest prior to the start of the banking crises of the 1930s did not fail. Only one of the top 20
banks identified as the systemically riskiest in 1929 (Table 4), Union Trust Company (Cleveland,
OH), failed, increasing systemic risk by 1.59%. Four others experienced suspended payments and
subsequently experienced “distressed” mergers: National Park Bank (NYC), The National Bank of
the Republic of Chicago, Fidelity National Bank and Trust Company (Kansas City), and Fletcher
American National Bank (Indianapolis). The survival of most of the 20 ex ante systemically riskiest
banks was buttressed by the fact that, on average, these banks had lower than average composite
risk, R, in 1929. While they were central to the network, and thus “systemically important,” their
better financial position prior to the crisis allowed them to bend, but not break. Additionally,
there was a large-scale bank rescue program that was implemented after the banking crises of the
Great Depression had begun to ravage the country’s financial system. The Reconstruction Finance
Corporation (RFC) was established in early 1932. It initially offered collateralized loans to banks
in need of assistance and later was given the authority to recapitalize them through preferred stock
purchases. An interesting point is that about 70% of the 1929 top risk contributors received a large
capital injection from the RFC. This suggests that regulators, even then, implicitly understood the

nature of risk in networked financial systems.16

    Thus far, we have highlighted the risk contributions of the systemically riskiest banks before and
after the crisis. However, our empirical design also allows us to examine how actual commercial bank
suspensions occurring during the period of the banking panics (1930-33) altered systemic risk. We
focus on the 30 largest realized suspensions, as measured by total loans and investments.17 These
include some of the most notorious banks failures during the Depression, such as the Bank of the
United States, First National Bank of Detroit, Guardian National Bank of Commerce, and the two
largest banks from the Caldwell chain of banks (National Bank of Kentucky and Central Bank and
Trust Company).18 These 30 suspensions accounted for a total of $1.8 billion or 25% of the nation’s
loans and investments in suspended commercial banks.19 The top 10 suspensions by total assets
and their contribution to systemic risk are shown in Table 10. Although the Great Depression
wiped out an inordinate number of banks, systemic risk arising from the realized suspensions of
the 30 largest banks increased by 8.33% – considerably less than if the ex ante systemically riskiest
bank in 1929, Continental Illinois, had failed (a resulting 13% increase).


6 Network Features and Bank Survivorship

  16
     RFC assistance is not the same as the bank being “quarantined.” Even Union Trust Company (Cleveland) failed
despite receiving RFC assistance.
  17
     Board of Governors (1936) (Table 18, p.36) provides data on the largest bank suspensions between 1929-33.

     See Heitfield et al. (2017) for an analysis of the banks that did business with Caldwell and Company.
  19
     The mean size of bank failures for 1930-33 falls from $954,000 to $714,000 if these 30 banks are excluded. (Board of
Governors (1936), p.34).

6.1 Predicting Bank Survivorship for the Entire Network

Because our underlying analysis is based on firm-level data, we can also analyze whether systemic
risk measures improve prediction of subsequent banking distress – something that has been lacking
in the literature on systemic risk. In this section, we use the sample of all banks operating in 1929
to predict bank survivorship in 1934. The outcome variable, yi , thus equals 1 if bank i survives and
appears in 1934 and equals 0 otherwise (i.e., we coded 0 as a bank failure).20 62% of the sample
survives and the remainder exits.21

       We consider two latent-variable models:

                                            M1 :    yi∗ = x>
                                                           i1 · β1 + εi                                        (12)

and
                                     M2 :     yi∗ = x>          >
                                                     i1 · β1 + xi2 · β2 + εi .                                 (13)

       For both, the mapping from the latent to the observed data is yi = 1{yi∗ > 0} and εi ∼ N (0, 1),
i.e., a probit model. The covariates in the vector xi1 include standard balance sheet measures,
Federal Reserve membership, location information, and county characteristics for bank i in 1929.22
The covariates in the vector xi2 include systemic risk measures for bank i in 1929, namely, composite
risk score (R), eigenvalue centrality, and percent contribution to systemic risk. The specifications
are purposefully parsimonious to offer simple interpretations and to help us examine the predictive
power of our network measures. Other variables may also be important for modeling the causes of
bank failures, but since our primary goal is to shed light on the predictive properties of network
features, our benchmark model relies on bank specific characteristics, institutional features of the
Federal Reserve system, and location controls.

       The models are estimated by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods. The estimation results are similar across both methods; however, the
Bayesian results permit us to compute marginal likelihoods and posterior model probabilities.
Although the parameter estimates are interesting, again, our focus is on the predictive fit of our
new measure - whether network features provide improved prediction. Thus, a fully Bayesian
  20
     Banks are matched between 1929 and 1934 based on their name and routing number. Routing numbers are a
useful matching tool for banks that have gone through name changes or charter changes.
  21
     In this section, we do not differentiate between failures and mergers; however, in the following subsection, we
disentangle failures and mergers.
  22
     County information includes county population, manufacturing establishments, and acres of cropland. The data
were collected from the 1930 U.S. Census of Population, Manufacturing, and Agriculture.

approach is implemented. Specifically, the Accept-Reject Metropolis-Hastings (ARMH) algorithm
is used to estimate the model (Tierney, 1994; Chib and Jeliazkov, 2001). The priors on β are
centered at 0 with a variance of 25 and the results are based on 10,000 MCMC draws with a burn
in of 1,000. We begin by discussing the parameter estimates, then move on to prediction and model
comparison.

   The estimated coefficients shown in Table 11 demonstrate that bank size (measured by log (as-
sets)), the ratio of bonds/assets, and Federal Reserve membership are positively associated with
bank survival – findings that hold across both models. As shown in M2 , both eigenvalue cen-
trality (measuring the importance of a bank’s position in the network) and composite risk score
(bank-specific risk) have a negative impact on bank survival. The negatively-signed coefficient on
composite risk is quite intuitive and aligns with results found in numerous studies on bank sur-
vivability. The finding that a bank’s position and importance in the network negatively influences
survival is also intriguing. It aligns with Mitchener and Richardson (2019), which finds that, dur-
ing the banking panics of the early 1930s, banks in reserve cities and central reserve cities faced
significant withdrawal pressure from correspondent banks located in the hinterland. As shown
above, centrality was concentrated in the major money centers: Chicago, New York, Kansas City,
Minneapolis, St. Louis, St. Paul, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Cleveland. Thus, during pan-
ics, a prominent position in the network meant exposure not only to time and demand deposits
withdrawals, but also interbank withdrawals, raising the probability of liquidity-induced suspen-


                                                 28
sions. Lower probabilities of survivorship are also associated with the indicator variables for central
reserve city and reserve city as well as county population.

   Interestingly, the coefficient for a bank’s ex ante contribution to systemic risk is positive and
statistically different from zero. While individual bank risk and position in the network have a
negative effect, higher systemic risk for a bank in 1929 increases the probability of bank survival.
This finding is interesting in light of the RFC’s recapitalization program. Jesse Jones, Chairman
of the RFC, noted that the bank-rescue agency paid particular attention to large institutions
in deciding which banks to grant assistance (Jones, 1951) and, as mentioned previously, of the
systemically riskiest banks in 1929 (shown in Table 4), 70% of them received RFC assistance. The
result for systemic risk may point to the beginnings of the too-big-to-fail approach to banking crisis
in the US.

   The new measures employed in this paper not only provide us with interesting results, but offer
inferential advantages over other systemic risk measures. Importantly, the measures developed in
this paper are constructed from the raw data, as opposed to being the predicted outcome of a
regression. Hence, we do not have additional layers of uncertainty in the model and we do not need
to conduct any inferential adjustments. Other systemic risk measures, such as CoVAR and SRISK,
are developed from regression output. And using such measures as covariates in a separate model
would lead to generated regressor issues and require standard-error adjustments.

   For model comparison and prediction, we focus on marginal likelihoods (ln f (y|M1 ) versus
ln f (y|M2 )) and posterior model probabilities. Given that we are using ARMH, we can use the
building blocks of that algorithm to compute marginal likelihoods, which follows from Chib and
Jeliazkov (2001). The marginal likelihood for model k is given by
                                               Z
                             m(y|βk , Mk ) =       f (y|βk , Mk )π(βk |Mk )dβk                    (14)

and is crucial for comparing models. An advantageous property of marginal likelihoods is that
they provide a measure of sequential out-of-sample predictive fit, where the fit of observation i is
measured with respect to the posterior density based on data up to i, without conditioning on
observations after i (Choudhary et al., 2017). This feature allows the researcher to overcome the
complications associated with conditioning on the entire data set or using subsets of the data for
in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.

   Table 12 presents the model comparison and prediction results, and shows overwhelming evi-
dence in favor of M2 . In particular, the specification has a posterior model probability of nearly

1 in comparison with M1 . The data heavily support the specification with the three additional
measures (Eigenvalue Centrality, Composite Risk Score, and SysRisk Percentage). Additionally,
the model strongly out performs M1 at predicting the probability of bank failure.

    While the marginal likelihood is the superior measure for out-of-sample prediction, the in-
sample hit rates give us straightforward and intuitive numbers. M1 has a hit rate of 66.79%,
whereas M2 has a hit rate of 64.57%. With the inclusion of network and composite bank risk
measures, outcomes for 548 additional banks are correctly predicted. Overall, these new variables
constructed from bank correspondent networks have immense explanatory power when it comes
to specifying the probability of bank failure during the Depression. Further, these results point
to the importance of including network variables and risk characteristics in analyses aimed at
understanding bank survivorship during crises and support recent research in modeling systemic
risk. Even ignoring the predictive ability of the model, the probit analysis shows that network
position was an important determinant of bank failure in the crisis.


6.2 Robustness Check using National Bank Sample

To obtain results for our full sample, we coded exits as both mergers and failures, but these are
clearly different outcomes. We lack this type of detailed information on survival outcomes of state
banks; however, for national banks, we are able to further distinguish between types of exits using
data from the Annual Report of the Comptroller of the Currency (1929-1934).

    To do so, we again use two models with covariates that are the same as M1 and M2 in the
previous section. However, the outcome variable is now ordered and defined as:
                                                 

    The analysis was also completed with four ordered outcome categories – survive, merger/consolidation, distressed
merger (bank absorbed or succeeded), failure – and the results do not vary from the presented case.

are done by fixing the cutpoints, which are the parameters that relate the observed outcomes to the
unobserved latent utility scale. The models are estimated by Gibbs sampling methods (Algorithm
3 in Jeliazkov et al. (2008)), and the MLE parameter estimates align. The priors on β are centered
at 0 with a variance of 25 and the results are based on 10,000 MCMC draws with a burn in of
1,000. Marginal likelihood calculations follow from Chib (1995) and Jeliazkov et al. (2008).

   Table 13 shows that the coefficients for our network measures are similar to those for the full
sample; we observe negatively-signed effects that are statistically different from zero for eigenvalue
centrality and composite risk score, and a positively-signed effect for a bank’s contribution to
systemic risk. Again, by comparing the marginal likelihoods, we see overwhelming support for M2 ,
with a posterior model probability of nearly 1. These results align with the previous section and
point to an additional important implication: a specification including our new measures not only
improves the prediction of bank failures, but also those for bank mergers, an important observed
outcome in most financial crises.


7 Conclusion

Using a new, hand-collected data set of correspondent linkages for all commercial banks, we analyze
systemic risk and network features on the eve of the Great Depression. We then assess how the



                                                   31
largest banking crises of 20th century altered banking network properties and the concentration
of risk. Systemic risk is modeled as a function of the interconnectedness and the credit quality of
financial institutions in the system, which we combine to produce a single measure of systemic risk.
We show that the pyramid-shape of the interbank network concentrated risk in particular nodes
and made the banking system in 1929 more fragile and prone to contagion risk. We find that the
resulting failure of over 9,000 banks increased systemic risk by 33%. Further, the banking crises
caused risk to become more concentrated. The 10 systemically-riskiest banks increased their share
of overall risk by 5 percentage points between 1929 and 1934.

   Our analysis of the Great Depression also shows how much more damaging the crisis would
have been if more systemically-important banks had failed. For example, if the 10 systemically
riskiest banks in existence in 1929 subsequently failed, systemwide risk would have risen by more
than 50%. On the one hand, the system showed some resiliency. Failures were concentrated in
small and medium-sized banks. Centrally-located banks in the network had a higher predicted
probability of failure, but the most systemically important banks were able to weather heavy
depositor withdrawals during panic periods. They entered the Great Depression relatively healthy
– with below average credit risk. They flexed but, in general, did not break (fail). Of the 20
systemically riskiest banks in 1929, only one failed, increasing systemic risk by only 1.59%. On the
other hand, the Fed’s reluctance to act as a Lender of Last Resort (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963)
and the pyramid-shape of the banking system, meant that the largest and most central banks in
the system (those in New York City and Chicago) met heavy depositor withdrawals during panic
periods by contracting lending, leading to a more severe decline in economic activity during the
early 1930s (Mitchener and Richardson, 2019).

   The findings from our micro analysis of the Great Depression suggest that modeling banking
networks has the potential to improve our understanding of where risk is concentrated before a
crisis occurs and to predict where subsequent distress might center. Using bank-level data for the
entire commercial banking system in 1929, we are able to identify useful predictors of subsequent
financial distress. Bayesian model comparison and prediction show that bank-specific network
centrality, composite risk, and a measure for the bank’s contribution to systemic risk significantly
enhance a probit and ordered probit model’s ability to predict bank failures and bank mergers;
we capture over 500 more survivals/failures occurring between 1930–33 when these variables are
included. Both position in the network and composite risk are negatively related to bank survival.

However, a bank’s systemic risk contribution appears to have increased survivorship. Given the
RFC’s intervention into the banking system in 1932, this finding points to perhaps early use of
too-big-to-fail policies to influence financial institution survivorship in the U.S. financial system.

   Finally, our research sheds light on similarly-motivated research on the GFC. By investigating a
historical crisis and modeling network importance, we complement existing work in showing where
risk may lie in the network. SRISK models (see Acharya et al. (2012); Brownlees and Engle (2017)),
emphasize common risks across financial institutions’ balance sheets, such as housing-sector assets
during the GFC, as a source of risk. Our findings suggest that bank specific idiosyncratic risk and
network position are also important variables of systemic risk and that they determine subsequent
survivorship. In terms of our methodology, this is reflected in the fact that model selection places
substantial weight on individual bank composite risk and centrality, which mattered because smaller
banks relied on more central banks for business services and for satisfying regulatory requirements
on reserves (e.g., interbank deposits). Our results for the Great Depression therefore complement
the properties of SRISK in the GFC.

   A large macro shock may have different effects on the financial system depending on the struc-
ture of network connections. Brunetti et al. (2017) examine correlation and physical networks
of banks in Europe through the GFC and find that increases in correlation network connectivity
presage financial crises and increases in physical network connectivity forecast liquidity problems.
Our work using physical bank networks complements these findings for the Great Depression, and
also show that physical network metrics are able to predict bank failure. Therefore, the uniqueness
of the network during the Great Depression and the geographical dispersion of bank failures offer
new insights into the analysis of systemic risk during crises, especially as the number of financial
institutions in the Great Depression was far higher than that exists in recent times. The nature
of economic crises may change over decades, but the value of network analysis in measuring and
predicting systemic risk and its fallout remain robust across time.
