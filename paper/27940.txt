Who Benefits From the Child Tax Credit?

                                           ABSTRACT

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides a cash transfer of up to $2,000 per child under age 17 to
millions of families in the United States. Using the Current Population Survey, we examine the
aggregate effects and distributional implications of the rules governing children's eligibility for
the credit. While approximately 90% of all children qualify for at least a partial CTC, we
document striking disparities in eligibility by income and race. The vast majority of children
living in households in the bottom decile of the national AGI distribution are completely
ineligible for the CTC and the majority of filers in the bottom thirty percent are eligible only for a
partial credit. In contrast, virtually all children living in households in the top half of the income
distribution qualify for the full credit amount. Approximately three-quarters of white and Asian
children are eligible for the full CTC, compared to only about half of Black and Hispanic
children. We use our results to estimate the distributional effects of a range of reforms to the CTC
eligibility rules. Our results suggest that reforming the credit to include a larger share of children
would more evenly distribute the credit's benefits across children of different races and incomes.

Introduction

Tax benefits for children are a central component of the social safety net in the United States.

Among the most important is the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which provides up to $2,000 per child

under the age of 17. Unlike the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a tax credit

specifically targeted at lower-income households with children, the CTC affects a much broader

range of the income distribution, with credits available to households earning as little as $2,500

and as much as $400,000. While there is scant research on the effect of the CTC itself on child

outcomes, cash transfers of this form (like the EITC) have been shown to improve children's

health and educational outcomes (Dahl and Lochner 2012; Hoynes, Miller, and Simon 2015;

Hoynes, Schanzenbach and Almond 2016; Bastian and Michelmore 2018; Manoli and Turner

2018). However, many low-income children in the United States do not benefit from the CTC,

and among those who do benefit, some face limitations that prevent them from receiving the full

credit amount.

   In this paper, we investigate which children benefit from the CTC and which children are

excluded. In particular, we focus on three elements of the CTC rules. First, we consider the rules

setting out a taxpayer's eligibility to claim a particular child; loosely speaking, only children who

live with a close family member can be claimed for the CTC. Second, only taxpayers with

sufficient earned income can receive a tax refund from the credit, and the maximum amount of

their refund depends on how much income they earn. Third, only $1,400 out of the maximum

$2,000 per-child credit is refundable, which limits the full credit to taxpayers who have sufficient

tax liability. We study the distributional effects of these individual rules as well as their

interaction with one another.




                                                   1
    To understand the operation of these rules, we draw on the Annual Social and Economic

Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate which children benefit from the

CTC. Based on this analysis, we classify children into three categories: (1) ineligible children,

who cannot be claimed for any CTC; (2) partially eligible children, who can be claimed for

some, but not all, of the full credit amount; and (3) fully eligible children, who can be claimed

for the full CTC amount. We then compare the characteristics of the children that fall into each

of these categories.

    We document striking differences in patterns of CTC eligibility based on a child's race.

Approximately three-quarters of white and Asian children are eligible for the full CTC,

compared to only about half of Black and Hispanic children. Black children are particularly

unlikely to be eligible for the CTC, constituting one in four ineligible children, despite

representing only 14% of all children.

    We next investigate differences in the distribution of the CTC's benefits by income. Because

CTC refundability is tied to earnings and tax liability, it is not surprising that we find large

differences in eligibility across the income distribution. The vast majority of those in the bottom

decile of the national AGI distribution are completely ineligible for the CTC, and the majority of

filers in the bottom thirty percent of the distribution are only eligible for a partial credit. By

contrast, virtually all children in the top half of the AGI distribution are eligible for the full

credit. Finally, we investigate differences in eligibility based on household structure. We find

that children under six are less likely to be eligible for the full credit compared to teenage

children, and more likely to be eligible for a partial credit, though rates of ineligibility were

similar across childhood. We also document large differences in eligibility based on whether the




                                                   2
child's parents are married and in particular whether the child's father is present in the

household.

   We next investigate the role of various CTC rules in generating these differences in

children's CTC eligibility. To do so, we simulate how eligibility for the credit would change

under reforms that eliminate a particular rule or combination of rules. We find that the

relationship test disproportionately limits benefits for Hispanic children and mainly excludes

children who live in low-income households. Removing this constraint would render about 2

million more children eligible for the credit. By comparison, removing the earnings test limit on

refundability--essentially creating a child benefit for all families living with related children

under age 17 and with AGI below the current law thresholds--would affect many more children

(5.9 million children would become eligible), particularly black children and children residing in

very low-income households. Removing the $1,400 refundability cap would also help families

with lower-than-average incomes, but ones with somewhat higher incomes than the other

reforms. Additionally, removing the refundability cap would not increase benefits among those

currently ineligible. Finally, we find that removing the relationship test and refundability limits

to make the credit near universal for low- and middle-income children would benefit

approximately 23 million children, primarily those growing up in the lowest income households.

   Our results provide evidence that can inform ongoing policy debates about child allowances

in the United States. The CTC was reformed and expanded by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

(TCJA) and there have been a number of recent legislative proposals to further expand the credit,

either in size or in the scope of which children it covers (for recent summaries and analyses, see

Greenstein et al. 2018; Maag and Airi 2020). Our paper contributes to this discussion by

providing new statistics concerning the operation of the current CTC and by shedding light on



                                                  3
how various policy reforms would affect children. Two previous studies ­ Burman and Wheaton

(2005) and Harris (2012) ­ both investigate the CTC's distribution; our paper updates this prior

work in light of significant policy reforms and demographic shifts during the intervening period.

More recently, Ackerman and Cooper (2019) describe the distribution of CTC benefits claimed

by taxpayers; our analysis complements theirs by focusing on the distribution of benefits across

all children, some of whom may not be claimed on tax returns due to the limitations we study.

Outside the specific context of the CTC, our results contribute to a literature investigating

differences in the distribution of tax benefits by race, notwithstanding the tax code's nominal

race-neutrality (e.g., Moran and Whitford 1996; Brown 2018).

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides additional detail

regarding the CTC and its eligibility rules. Section 2 details the methodology underlying our

estimates and describes our data. Section 3 provides our results. Section 4 concludes.



    I. Institutional Background on the Child Tax Credit

    Like other tax credits, the CTC operates by reducing one's tax liability by the amount of the

credit for which one qualifies. It is partially refundable, meaning that a taxpayer with a CTC in

excess of her tax liability may receive a refund from the IRS for some or all of the excess credit

amount. 1 The amount by which the taxpayer benefits from the credit is a function of three main

factors: (1) the number of qualifying children the taxpayer claims, (2) the taxpayer's income, and

(3) the taxpayer's tax liability, absent the credit.




1
  The IRS typically refers to the refundable portion of the CTC as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) and to
the non-refundable portion as the Child Tax Credit, or CTC. In contrast, we use the latter term to refer to the sum of
the refundable and non-refundable portions.

                                                          4
    In general, a taxpayer's CTC is equal to $2,000 per qualifying child she claims for the credit

on her tax return. 2 The credit is phased out for very high income taxpayers; in 2019, the credit

phased out at a rate of 5% for unmarried filers with AGI above $200,000, and for married filers

with AGI above $400,000 (these phase-out thresholds are indexed for inflation). A taxpayer

whose tax liability exceeds her CTC (and whose income is below the phase-out threshold) will

benefit by the full amount of the CTC for which she qualifies. When a taxpayer's CTC exceeds

her tax liability, however, the taxpayers' ability to benefit from the CTC is limited by the degree

to which the excess credit amount is refundable. As a result, rules that limit the refundability of

the CTC have the effect of limiting the degree to which taxpayers can benefit from the credit.

    There are two important limitations on the CTC's refundability. First, the refundable portion

of the credit is capped at $1,400 per child for the 2019 tax year (and is indexed to inflation for

future years). As a result, taxpayers whose CTC exceeds their tax liability by more than that

amount cannot benefit from the full credit amount. For example, consider a taxpayer with two

children and tax liability of $1,000, who qualifies for a CTC of $4,000. Assuming no other limits

on refundability applied, this taxpayer would receive a $1,000 non-refundable credit along with

up to a $2,800 refundable credit, or an average (total) CTC benefit of $1,900 per child.

    The second limitation on CTC refundability is based on the taxpayer's earned income. This

earnings test imposes that the refundable portion of the credit is limited to 15% of the amount by

which the taxpayer's earned income exceeds $2,500. To illustrate, a taxpayer with $7,500 of

earned income and one qualifying child could not receive a CTC refund above $750. Similarly,




2
 The rules described in this section are set out in section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. They reflect temporary
changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, currently scheduled to expire beginning in tax year 2026. See
also IRS publication 972.

                                                         5
the earnings test prevents a taxpayer with $2,400 of earned income from receiving any CTC

refund at all. 3

    To put these earnings and refundability limits in context, note that an unmarried parent of one

child working full-time at the federal minimum wage would earn about $16,000 per year, just

below the federal poverty threshold for a two-person family and below the applicable filing

threshold for 2019. If the individual were to file, she would be eligible for the maximum EITC

benefit ($3,526) for a one-child household, but would only qualify for $1,400 of the CTC due to

the cap on refundability. A single filer with one qualifying child would have to earn $24,350 to

receive the full $2,000 CTC, which represents a household with earnings of about 145% of the

federal poverty line.

    Thus far we have described the rules for calculating the CTC, taking as given the number of

children a taxpayer may claim. A number of additional rules govern this aspect of the credit. 4

First, the child must be 16 years old or younger during the entire year for which they are

claimed. 5 Second, the child must not have filed a joint return with her spouse for the year in

which she is claimed, which, in practice, typically means that the child was not married during

the year in question. Third, the child (but not necessarily the taxpayer claiming the child) must

have a social security number that is valid for employment. Fourth, the child must not provide

more than one-half of her own support. Fifth, the taxpayer claiming the child must be the child's



3
  In theory, this earnings test limitation can be less restrictive for taxpayers who claim three or more children for the
CTC. For such taxpayers, the refundable portion of the credit must not exceed the maximum of the earnings test
limit (as described in this paragraph) and the excess of social security payroll tax liability over the taxpayer's EITC.
In practice, we find that this modification to the earnings test ends up affecting refundability for very few families in
our sample.

  See Internal Revenue Code sections 24(c) and 152(c).
5
  Note that individuals aged 17 and 18 who meet the relationship and residency tests, as well as those aged 19-24
who are full-time students, can be claimed for an additional $500 non-refundable credit per child, as can certain
children lacking social security numbers. This $500 "dependent credit" is calculated as part of the CTC but is
outside of our focus here. For more details, see Internal Revenue Code, section 24(h)(4).

parent, grandparent, sibling, aunt or uncle (including step-relatives and certain relatives by

marriage). Sixth, the child must be younger than the taxpayer claiming the child. Seventh, the

taxpayer must reside with the child for at least half of the year in which the child is claimed. 6

Finally, if multiple taxpayers meet the requirements to claim a child during the same year, the

child may be claimed by either: (1) a parent of the child, or (2) the highest income taxpayer who

is eligible to claim the child, whether or not that taxpayer is the child's parent. 7



    II. Data and Methodology

    Our data come from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current

Population Survey (CPS), administered during March 2018 to households in the 50 states and the

District of Columbia. We limit our analysis to unmarried individuals under the age of 17 at the

time of the survey. 8 This leaves us with a sample of 44,929 children, representing approximately

69 million individuals in the U.S. 9

    To assign children to tax filing units, we first identify the set of taxpayers who are potentially

eligible to claim each child. In particular, for each child, we identify the individuals living in the

same household as the child who are the child's parent, grandparent, sibling, aunt, uncle, great

aunt, or great uncle. 10 Following the qualifying child rules, we further restrict this set of


6
  In certain cases, a custodial parent may grant a non-custodial parent the right to claim a child for purposes of the
CTC even if the non-custodial parent lives with the child for less than half of the year. See Internal Revenue Code
section 152(e).
7
  If both a parent and non-parent do in fact both claim the same child for the same year, the child is treated as the
qualifying child of the parent. If multiple parents claim the same child for the same year, the child is treated as the
qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived during the longer portion of the year, or, if the parents lived
with the child for the same amount of time during the year, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent
with the higher income.
8
  As described in the prior section, the CTC is not available to children who file a joint return with their spouse. In
our data, married individuals constitute only 0.11% of all individuals under the age of 17.
9
  All statistics we report incorporate person-level weights to reflect the survey sampling design.
10
   For 1% of children, the relationship data collected in the CPS does not allow us to determine whether one or more
individuals living in the child's household satisfy the relationship test with respect to the child. In such cases, we
assume the individual does not satisfy the relationship test unless the individual is the child's parent.

                                                           7
potentially eligible taxpayers to individuals who are at least as old as the child under

consideration.

     A limitation of our data is that we observe household residency at a single point in time

rather than continuously over the course of a year. Hence, we cannot directly observe whether an

individual has lived with a child for more than half of a year, as is required to claim the child for

the CTC. For purposes of our analysis, we assume that all individuals living with a child at the

time of the survey satisfy the residency test with respect to the child for the year as a whole. We

similarly assume that the residency test is not satisfied by any taxpayer who lives in a different

household than the child at the time of the survey. In terms of assigning children to taxpayers,

these assumptions may be violated in two directions: some individuals living with a child on the

survey date may fail the residency test (incorrectly broadening the set of potential claimants),

whereas others may satisfy the residency test despite not living with the child on the date of the

survey (incorrectly limiting the set of potential claimants). In addition, because all children we

observe are part of a household at the date of survey, our estimates will understate the share of

children excluded from the CTC because of the residency test. 11

     Having identified the set of taxpayers potentially eligible to claim each child, we next narrow

this set based on the qualifying child rules that apply when multiple taxpayers are eligible to

claim a single child for the same year. As described above, these rules require that in such cases,

the child may be claimed by either the child's parent or the highest income taxpayer who is

eligible to claim the child. As such, we limit the set of potentially eligible taxpayers for each


11
   We also do not observe information that allows us to assess whether two other CTC requirements are met:
whether a child has a social security number that allows him or her to work, or whether a child provides half of his
or her own support. By abstracting from these requirements, our analysis will overstate the share of children who
benefit from the credit. Proxying for the support test using the earnings of the individuals in the household, less than
0.1% of individuals under the age of 17 earn more than half of total household income. We treat these individuals as
ineligible for the CTC. Results were nearly identical when restricting the sample to individuals who self-report U.S.
citizenship (a proxy for having a social security number) in the ASEC.

                                                           8
child to the child's parent(s), if present, as well as the non-parent relative with the highest

income in the household. Among the remaining set of potentially eligible taxpayers, we initially

assign the child to a parent if at least one of the potentially eligible taxpayers is a parent. 12

However, when the parent's earned income is below the $2,500 threshold required to satisfy the

CTC's earned income requirement, we instead assign the child to the (higher income) non-

parent, to increase the chances that the child will qualify for the CTC. 13 If none of the taxpayers

potentially eligible to claim the child is a parent of the child, we assign the child to the highest-

income non-parent relative in the household.

     After constructing tax filing units, we use NBER's TAXSIM to estimate eligibility for the

CTC based on the 2019 tax laws. Since the 2018 ASEC contains information on 2017 income,

we inflate all income measures to 2019 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). We

classify children as ineligible for the CTC if their tax filing unit receives no reduction in tax

liability or refund from the credit. We classify children as partially eligible if their tax filing unit

receives some tax reduction or refund from the credit, but not the full $2,000 credit per child in

the household. 14 We classify children as fully eligible if their tax filing unit receives the full

$2,000 credit per child under the age of 17 in the household.




12
   When two or more unmarried taxpayers are parents (or step-parents) of a child, we assume the child is claimed by
the parent with the higher income, who, in most cases, is more likely to be able to claim the child for a positive CTC
amount.
13
   A different approach would be to assign children to tax filing units to maximize the total tax refund of all
taxpayers in a household. For discussion of such issues, see Jones and O'Hara (2014).
14
   Throughout, we use "child" to refer to an unmarried individual under the age of 17. Note according to this
definition, a taxpayer's claiming of a partially-eligible child for the CTC may not increase the amount of the credit
that the taxpayer can claim. For example, when the earnings test limitation is binding, claiming a fourth child would
not increase a taxpayer's CTC refund, but we would classify that fourth child as partially eligible. An alternative
method for calculating eligibility would be to assign full eligibility for some children in the household, and partial or
no eligibility for the remaining children in the household.

   III. Results

   A. Current Law

   This subsection investigates patterns of CTC eligibility among children in the overall

population and across various population subgroups.

   Table 1 presents summary statistics for the children in our sample according to their CTC

eligibility. Initially, we restrict our focus to children living in households below the income

phase-out range (Columns 1-3). We estimate that approximately 10% of children ­

corresponding to almost 6.7 million individuals in the U.S. ­ are completely ineligible for the

CTC (Column 1) ­ i.e., their tax filing unit receives no benefit from the CTC and has income

below the CTC phase-out range. Ineligible children have substantially lower family income than

the overall population; 74 percent of this group resides in households with income below the

poverty line and the average income of the ineligible children's tax unit is only $1,359.

   We also observe striking differences in CTC eligibility by race, ethnicity, and family

structure. Relative to the overall population, ineligible children are more likely to be black (25

percent compared to 14 percent among all children) or Hispanic (30 percent compared to 26

percent among all children), and less likely to be white, non-Hispanic (36 percent compared to

50 percent among all children). Ineligible children are also more likely to have both parents

absent from the household (22 percent compared to 4 percent overall) and are particularly

unlikely to have a father present (71 percent do not have a present father, compared to 26 percent

in the sample of all children). All of these differences are statistically significant at conventional

thresholds.

   Apart from entirely ineligible children, we find that another 25% of children ­ corresponding

to approximately 17 million individuals ­ are partially eligible for the CTC (Column 2 of Table



                                                  10
1) ­ i.e., their tax filing unit has income below the CTC phase-out and receives a positive CTC

benefit that is less than $2,000 per child. Such children are part of tax filing units with incomes

above the $2,500 earnings threshold but receive less than the full credit because of one or more

of the limits on refundability. The children in this group also reside in lower-income households,

with an average household income of $23,460, and a 25% poverty rate. The average CTC benefit

per child in this group is about $1,200 ­ about 60% of the full per-child credit amount. Like

ineligible children, the children who receive a partial credit are more likely than the overall

population to be black (19 percent compared to 14 percent) or Hispanic (39 percent compared to

24 percent), and less likely to be white (32 percent compared to 50 percent). Partially eligible

children also tend to be younger than the overall child population, and are more likely to be

under age six (38 percent, compared to 35 percent overall). Finally, partially eligible children are

less likely to have a father present (45 percent do not live with their father, compared to 26

percent of all children), though they are equally likely as the overall population to live in a

household without any parent (4 percent).

   Column 3 of Table 1 shows that more than 44 million children in the U.S. are eligible for the

full CTC, and these children are more affluent than the population overall, with an average

household income of approximately $112,000. While 13 percent of children live in poverty in the

U.S., none of the children who are eligible for the full credit are poor. Compared to the overall

population, fully eligible children are more likely to be white (59 percent compared to 50 percent

of all children) and less likely to be black (10 percent compared to 14 percent of all children) or

Hispanic (20 percent compared to 26 percent of all children). These children are also more likely

to live in a married-parent household (82 percent compared to 67 percent overall) rather than a

single-parent household.



                                                 11
     Columns 4 and 5 of Table 1 present characteristics of children that receive either a partial

benefit (1% of children) or no benefit (1% of children) from the CTC because of the income

phase-out. By definition, such children live in very well-off households, with average household

incomes of approximately $409,000 and $746,000, respectively. 15 Compared to the overall

population, such children are much less likely to be Black or Hispanic, slightly more likely to be

Asian, and much more likely to be white.

     Table 2 explores the reasons why some children do not receive any benefit from the CTC

(i.e., the children described in Columns 1 and 5 of Table 1). Among children who do not receive

any CTC benefit, the vast majority (79%) are ineligible solely because their tax filing unit fails

the earnings test ­ they do not have income above the minimum $2,500 required to receive any

CTC benefit. The next largest group (11%) receive no CTC benefit because their income exceeds

the top of the phase-out range. The remaining children who receive no CTC benefit are ineligible

solely because of the relationship test (1%)­ i.e., they do not reside with an eligible relative such

as a parent or grandparent ­ or as a result of the earnings and relationship tests in conjunction

with one another (9%). 16 A child in the latter category, for example, would gain eligibility for the

CTC if either the relationship or earnings test were relaxed. Finally, a small minority (0.1%) are

ineligible because they earn more than half of total household earnings, which we treat as failing

the support test.




15
   The 2018 CPS uses a "rank proximity swapping" method for dealing with values above the top-coded thresholds.
This procedure involves swapping values across proximally close observations in order to preserve the distribution
of values while also protecting anonymity. This technique applies to several of the income source variables included
in calculating AGI, including wages and salary, interest income, and rental income. See the technical documentation
for more information: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar18.pdf
16
   As an example of the latter possibility, consider a child living with his mother and her unmarried partner. If the
mother does not work but the partner does work, the child would be ineligible for the CTC because of the
refundability phase-in (otherwise his mother could claim the credit for him) and because of the relationship test
(otherwise the cohabitating partner could claim the credit for him).

    Figure 1 further explores differences in CTC eligibility by income (panel A), race (panel B),

and child's age (panel C). Because the CTC is tied to earnings, it is not surprising that the Figure

reveals stark patterns across the income distribution. The vast majority of those in the bottom

decile of the national AGI distribution are completely ineligible for the CTC (87 percent), and

the majority of filers in the bottom thirty percent of the distribution are only eligible for a partial

credit. By contrast, in the top half of the AGI distribution, virtually all children are eligible for

the full credit. Even in the highest income decile, only about 20% of children qualify for a

reduced CTC because of the income phase-out, consistent with the extremely high income

thresholds at which the phase-out begins to occur.

    We next investigate racial disparities in CTC eligibility (panel B of Figure 1). While

approximately three-quarters of white and Asian children are eligible for the full CTC benefit,

this applies to only about half of Black and Hispanic children. There are some differences in

eligibility between black and Hispanic children--Black children are more likely to be completely

ineligible for the CTC (18 percent compared to 12 percent among Hispanic children), whereas

Hispanic children are more likely to be eligible for a partial credit (38 percent compared to 34

percent among Black children). These patterns can be explained by both income and family

structure differences between Black and Hispanic children--Black children are more likely to

live in households with AGI below $2,500, and are much more likely to reside with a single

parent, compared to Hispanic children.

    Finally, we document smaller differences in patterns of eligibility by child age (panel C of

Figure 1). While rates of ineligibility are similar among younger children and teenagers

(approximately 11 percent), children under age six are less likely to be eligible for the full




                                                  13
benefit (62 percent compared to 67 percent among children aged 13 to 16), and more likely to be

eligible for a partial credit (28 percent compared to 22 percent among children aged 13 to 16).



    B. Role of Specific CTC Rules

    In this subsection we consider the effects of several potential changes to the CTC eligibility

rules to assess the contribution of these rules to the patterns of eligibility we documented in the

previous subsection. We assess the effects of these rules on overall eligibility rates as well as on

the characteristics of which children become eligible. We focus on eliminating several of the

current rules that limit taxpayers' ability to benefit from the CTC: the relationship test, the

earnings test, and the dollar cap on refundability. In addition to considering these reforms in

isolation, we also consider the effects of relaxing these requirements in conjunction with one

another.

    Table 3 summarizes the results of these analyses. Column 1 summarizes eligibility rates

under current law (previously described in Table 1). Column 2 shows the effect of eliminating

the relationship test. For example, without the relationship test in place, children of non-working

or low-earning parents can be claimed by cohabiting and higher-earning unmarried partners or

relatives other than the ones allowed to claim the child under current law. Under this reform, the

share of fully ineligible children would decline by 2.9 percentage points, corresponding to about

2 million additional children receiving at least some CTC benefit. 17 In addition, the reform

would increase the share of children receiving the full CTC by 1.6 percentage points,




17
   Although eliminating the relationship test would, on net, increase the share of children who qualify for the CTC,
in principle this reform could also have the effect of reducing CTC for some children if it forces a higher-earning
non-parent to claim the child under the tie-breaker test, and that non-parent is subject to the CTC phase-out. In
practice, we observe only a few children in our data who would lose CTC eligibility by eliminating the relationship
test.

                                                         14
corresponding to approximately 1.1 million children. This reform would be quite progressive,

extending eligibility to children growing up in households with average AGI of just $536.

Hispanic children would particularly benefit from this reform; 38% of the newly eligible children

are Hispanic, compared to 26% of the overall U.S. population.

   Column 3 of Table 3 considers the effects of eliminating the earnings test ­ i.e., the phase-in

of refundability based on the earned income of the taxpayer claiming the child. This reform

would dramatically reduce the share of fully ineligible children, from 10.8% under current law to

just 2.3% following this change. In contrast, it would not substantially increase the share of

children eligible to receive the full CTC benefit, since the $1400 limit on refundability would

still be in place. Because it would extend the CTC to children living in very low income

households, this change would be quite progressive. The average AGI of the children who gain

CTC eligibility from this reform is just $873. Twenty-six percent of the newly eligible children

are Black, compared to 14% of all children.

   Column 4 of Table 3 shows the effects of eliminating the $1400 cap on refundability. Not

surprisingly, this reform would not benefit children who were currently ineligible for the credit,

but would benefit those partially eligible under current law. Correspondingly, the children who

benefit from this reform have higher income than the other reforms discussed so far, with an

average household income of $31,282. Hispanic children are disproportionately likely to be

harmed by the refundability cap, constituting 42% of the children who benefit from its

elimination compared to 26% of all children.

   Finally, Columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 evaluate combinations of the reforms discussed so far.

In particular, Column 5 considers the effect of removing both limits on CTC refundability,

combining the reforms in Columns 3 and 4. Under this reform, any child living with a relative



                                                15
would be eligible for the full credit amount, except for those living in households with incomes

subject to the phase-out. This reform would dramatically reduce the share of low- and middle-

income children who do not receive the full CTC, leaving only children living in high-income

households subject to the phase-out as well as children who do not meet the relationship test with

respect to any household member.

     Column 6 targets the latter group of children by considering a reform that would eliminate

the relationship test in addition to the limits on refundability, thus making the credit near

universal for low and middle income families. 18 As expected from our earlier discussion, the

results show that such a reform would most benefit the groups that are disproportionately harmed

by the current CTC rules, such as Black and Hispanic children, children living in poverty, and

children with single-parent headed households.



     IV. Conclusion

     Drawing on a representative sample of children in the United States, we have explored which

children benefit from the Child Tax Credit, as well as the rules that give rise to these patterns.

Our findings suggest striking disparities by income and race: the lowest income children are

entirely excluded from the benefits of the credit, and many children growing up in working class

households are not eligible for the full credit. At the same time, Black and Hispanic children are

much less likely than their white counterparts to receive the full credit amount. These gaps in




18
  Even under this reform, the CTC would not reach children who are married, provide more than half of their own
support, or lack a social security number that authorizes them for work. Using citizenship as a proxy for the last of
these, we estimate that fewer than 3% of individuals under the age of 17 fall into one of these three categories. In
addition, even without the relationship and earnings tests, children who do not live with an (older) taxpayer for at
least half of the year would not qualify for the CTC. As discussed above, our data do not permit us to estimate the
share of children who fall into this category.

                                                          16
coverage are significant; a large body of research suggests that excluding children from cash

transfers in this way harms children in both the short- and long-terms.

   Several caveats are important to keep in mind when interpreting our results. First, although

the CPS contains the required information on household composition, relationship, and income

for determining CTC eligibility, it lacks information about certain expenditures that could affect

one's CTC benefit through tax deductions or other benefits. For example, because taxpayers with

childcare may face lower tax bills because of the Child and Dependent Care Credit, the limits on

CTC refundability may affect more taxpayers than we estimate. A second caveat is that our focus

has been on describing which taxpayers qualify for the CTC, rather than on which taxpayers

actually claim it on their returns. In practice, take-up of the CTC is incomplete; some taxpayers

who qualify for the credit will fail to claim it (Dickert-Conlin et al. 2005; Jones 2014). At the

same time, like other tax credits, some of those claiming the CTC will not actually qualify under

its rules. Finally, our investigation into the role played by the various CTC rules result from

static analyses that do not consider behavioral responses on the part of taxpayers. Eliminating

these restrictions could affect other outcomes such as labor supply via changes in the marginal

tax rate or affect eligibility through second-order effects such as changes in individuals'

decisions about where to live.

Notes: Current Population Survey ASEC 2018. The table shows the share of children by CTC benefit category. All Columns are limited to
unmarried individuals under the age of 17 at the time of the survey. Columns 1-3 are limited to children assigned to tax filing units below the
beginning of the CTC phase-out ($200,000 if single, $400,000 if married); Columns 4-5 are limited to children assigned to tax-filing units
above this threshold. Columns 1 and 5 include children whose tax-filing unit qualifies for no CTC. Column 3 includes children whose tax-filing
unit qualifies for $2,000 per CTC-qualifying child. Columns 2 and 4 include children whose tax-filing unit qualifies for a non-zero CTC
amount that is less than $2,000 per CTC-qualifying child. Population estimates calculated using CPS March supplement weights. Income refers
to the adjusted gross income (AGI) of the tax-filing unit to which the child is assigned. Married refers to the marital status of the tax-filing unit.
CTC per child refers to the total (i.e., refundable and non-refundable portions) CTC benefit for which a household qualifies, averaged over the
CTC-qualifying children present in the household. All income dollars inflated to 2019 real terms using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Notes: Current Population Survey ASEC 2018. The table presents
information on the rules that prevent children from qualifying for
the CTC. The analysis is limited to children who are fully
ineligible for the CTC (columns 1 and 5 in Table 1). Each row
presents the share of this population that is ineligible for the credit
because of the specified rule. The reason for a child's ineligibility
is determined by comparing the child's CTC eligibility under
current law to eligibility under a counterfactual policy in which the
specified rule was eliminated. Children classified under the
relationship and earnings tests row would be eligible if either the
earnings test or the relationship test were eliminated. Any child
with household income above the top of the phase-out threshold is
considered ineligible due to the income phase-out. All estimates
calculated using CPS March supplement weights.

Notes: Current Population Survey ASEC 2018. The table shows the effect of alternative policy reforms to the Child Tax Credit rules. Panel A shows the effect on child
eligibility; Panel B shows the characteristics of those children who receive a non-zero credit amount because of the reform; Panel C shows the characteristics of those children
who receive a full credit because of the reform. Column 1 shows eligibility under current law. Column 2 shows the effect of eliminating the relationship test. Column 3 shows
the effect of eliminating the earnings test (including the payroll tax limit applicable to taxpayers with three or more children). Column 4 shows the effect of eliminating the
refundability cap of $1400. Column 5 shows the effect of eliminating all of the limits on CTC refundability (i.e., the earnings test and the refundability cap). Column 6 shows
the effect of eliminating the relationship test and all of the limits on CTC refundability. Income refers to the adjusted gross income (AGI) of the tax-filing unit to which the
child is assigned under current law. All estimates calculated using CPS March supplement weights. All income dollars inflated to 2019 real terms using the Consumer Price
Index (CPI).

Notes: Current Population Survey ASEC 2018. The figure shows the distribution of CTC eligibility categories across a range of demographic
characteristics. The fully shaded portion of each bar corresponds to the share of children in the specified subgroup that are eligible for the full CTC
credit amount ($2000 per child). The partially shaded portion corresponds to the share of children that are partially eligible for the credit (i.e., the tax
filing unit that claims them qualifies for a non-zero CTC amount of less than $2000 per child). The unshaded portion corresponds to the share of
children that are entirely ineligible for the CTC. Panels A, B, and C show the share of children in each eligibility category separately by the income
of the child's tax filing unit, the child's race, and the child's age. All estimates calculated using CPS March supplement weights.
