Measuring the Macroeconomic Risks Posed by Asset Price Booms

                                                ABSTRACT

Modern central bankers are the risk managers of the financial system. They take actions based not
only on point forecasts for growth and inflation, but based on the entire distribution of possible macroeconomic
outcomes. In numerous instances monetary policymakers have acted in ways designed to avert disasters.
What are the implications of this approach for managin the risks posed by asset price booms? To
address this question, I study data from a cross-section of countries to examine the impact of equity
and property booms on the entire distribution of deviation in output and price-level from their trends.
The results suggest that housing booms worsen growth prospects, creating outsized risks of very bad
outcomes. By contrast, equity booms have very little impact on the expected mean and variance of
macroeconomic performance, but worsen the worst outcomes.

1. Introduction

      We pay central bankers to be paranoid. One of their primary responsibilities is to do
extensive contingency planning, preparing for every possible calamity. And when they do their
job well, most of us don’t even notice. In the past decade there are numerous examples of the
central bank actions that were taken in response to an increase in the probability of disaster.
These include the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate reductions in the fall of 1998
that followed the Russian government’s bond default, the preparations for the century date
change, the enormous liquidity injections in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks in the U.S., as well as the discussions that occurred as nominal interest rates and
inflation approached zero simultaneously. All of these episodes demonstrate policymakers’
willingness to take actions in order to reduce the chance of disaster, acting as the risk managers
for the economic and financial system.

      Then Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan put it best in 2003 when he said that
“a central bank seeking to maximize its probability of achieving its goals is driven, I believe, to a
risk-management approach to policy. By this I mean that policymakers need to consider not only
the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about
that path.” (Greenspan 2003, pg. 3) Importantly, the common practice of risk management
requires controlling the probability of catastrophe. For a financial intermediary, the focus is on
reducing the risk of significant monetary loss. For a central banker it suggests acting to reduce
the chances that output or the price level will be substantially below trend.

      To control risk in financial institutions, risk managers employ the concept of value-at-risk, or
VaR for short. Value-at-risk measures the worst possible loss over a specific time horizon, at a
given probability.1 A commercial bank might say that the daily VaR for a trader controlling
$100 million is $10 million at a 0.1 percent probability. That means that, given the historical
data used in the bank’s models, the trader cannot take a position that has more than one chance in
one thousand of losing 10 percent in one day.

    In some circumstances, VaR is all you need. For example, if it is being used to measure the
probability of institutional insolvency, it doesn’t really matter how insolvent you are. But
policymakers may care about more than just VaR, may be concerned with the expected loss
given that an event is in the lower tail – something called the expected tail loss (ETL). That is,
not only that the fifth or tenth percentile of the distribution of GDP outcomes fell, but what
happened to the expected value conditional on being in the lowest fifth or tenth percentile.

    Risk-management measures like VaR and ETL are computed from the lower tail of the
distribution of possible outcomes, examining the worst events that could occur. This requires
moving beyond simple quadratic measures of risk like variance or standard deviation. It is fairly
easy to imagine circumstances where the worst possible events have become worse, but the
standard deviation of the distribution of all the possibilities is the same. This is one view of the
case in the fall of 1998. The point forecasts for the aggregate price level and the GDP gap, and
their standard deviation stayed roughly the same. But the lower tail shifted – the probability and
size of a very bad outcome – rose. Policymakers acted in response to the perception that the
GDP at risk and expected tail loss had gone up.2

    A risk-management approach comes naturally to central bankers. It is the basis for the
creation and maintenance of the lender of last resort: The policy of providing loans to private
financial intermediaries that are illiquid but not insolvent helps to ensure that the payments
system continues to operate smoothly. Together with deposit insurance, central bank lending is
designed to reduce the probability of bank runs to a negligible level. (The implementation of
prudential regulation and supervision is the response to the moral hazard created by these
policies.)

    The risks posed by asset price booms and crashes are a prime candidate for the risk
management approach. Bubbles increase the volatility of growth, inflation, and threaten the
stability of the financial system. The 2003 IMF World Economic Outlook estimates that the
average equity price bust lasts for 2½ years and is associated with a 4 percent GDP loss that

  Formally, this means that the central bank’s loss function is not quadratic. For a recent discussion see Surico
(forthcoming).

affects both consumption and investment. While less frequent, property (or housing) busts are
twice as long and are associated with output losses that are twice as large. 3

      Asset price bubbles distort decisions throughout the economy and are a source of instability.
Wealth effects cause consumption to expand rapidly and then collapse. Increases in equity
prices make it easier for firms to finance new projects, causing investment to boom and then
bust. The collateral used to back loans is overvalued, so when prices collapse it impairs the
balance sheets of financial intermediaries that did the lending.

      As the IMF evidence makes clear, any discussion of bubbles must distinguish between equity
and property prices. This is true for several reasons. First, the efficient markets hypothesis is
more likely to apply to equity than to property. Arbitrage in stocks, which requires the ability to
short sell, is at least possible. In housing and property, it is not. Second, even in the few
countries with sizeable equity markets, ownership tends to be highly concentrated among the
wealthy – people whose consumption decisions are well insulated from the vicissitudes of the
stock market. By contrast, home ownership is spread much further down the income and wealth
distribution. Finally, in many countries housing purchases are highly leveraged leaving the
balance sheets of both households and financial intermediaries exposed to large price declines.
This suggests that the macroeconomic impact of a boom and crash cycle in property prices might
be larger in countries that have more credit outstanding. 4

      In this paper I examine equity and housing price booms and crashes from a risk management
perspective. Using equity price data from 27 countries and housing price data from 17 countries,
I will look at the various consequences of rising equity and housing prices for growth and
inflation. I begin by investigating how asset price booms influence the mean and variance of
deviations in (log) output and (log) price level from their (time-varying) trends. I then proceed
to measure both the GDP at risk and the price-level at risk that these booms create.

      The scarcity of booms and crashes, especially in property prices, mean that I must pool data
across countries. From what data there is, I come to the following conclusions: Housing booms
are bad in virtually every way imaginable; they create drive the output gap down, increase its

volatility, increase GDP at risk, and push the lower tail of outcomes (ETL) even lower
(decreasing the expected value of the GDP gap conditional on being in the lower tail of the
distribution). By contrast, equity booms have little impact on either the level or volatility of the
output and price-level gaps at horizons on three years; do not change GDP at risk, but increase
the risk of prices falling dramatically below trend; and drive the lower tail (ETL) even lower.

      The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides overwhelming evidence
that the distribution of output and price level deviations from their trends have fat tails implying
that methods based on quadratic loss and normal approximations could be misleading. Then, in
section 3, I characterized the distribution of output and price-level conditional on housing and
equity booms. That is, I look at the mean, variance, value-at-risk, and expected lower tail of
output and price-level conditional on asset price booms. Overall, the results suggest that normal
approximations are inadequate. Section 4 expands the discussion contrasting housing and equity
booms.

      There is a growing consensus that traditional interest rate policy is not a very effective
instrument in the battle to combat the deleterious macroeconomic effects of asset price bubbles.5
At the same time, equity and housing booms and busts pose clear risks to macroeconomic
stability. Adopting a risk management perspective means asking whether there are institutional
solutions to the problem. That is, are there ways to structural the financial system that will then
inoculate the real economy from the adverse effects of bubbles? With this question in mind, I
examine relative impact of asset price booms in economies with market- versus bank-based
financial systems. The results, reported in Section 5, suggest that market-based systems have a
somewhat higher GDP at risk in the aftermath of equity booms, but the systems weather housing
booms equally poorly.

2. GDP and Prices: General Considerations

      Financial economists employ concepts like value-at-risk in order to address the problems
created by fat tails. That is, cases in which a normal (Gaussian) distribution provides an overly
optimistic picture of the likelihood of extreme events. Equity returns are notorious for exhibiting
high probabilities of extreme events in their lower tail. Because these “bad” outcomes are so
important for controlling the risk of large losses, modeling them has attracted substantial
attention.6

    Aggregate output and prices share some of the properties exhibited by equity returns. The
distribution of deviations of (log) output and the (log) price level from their respective trend
exhibit fat tails. That is, the probability of observing a large negative realization is substantially
higher than one would infer from a Gaussian distribution. To see this, I have calculated the 5th
percentile of the distribution of log output and log price level deviations from their Hodrick-
Prescott (1997) trends, with smoothing parameter set to 1600, for a series of countries using
quarterly data from 1970 to 2003.7 These results are plotted in Figures 1 and 2. (The appendix
provides a more detailed description of the data.) The figures also include results for a Jacque-
Bera test for normality – these are the *’s next to the country names. In 11 of the 17 cases
presented, normality is rejected for 11 of 17 cases using the output gap and 10 of 17 using the
price-level gap.

  I have also computed results for a shorter sample beginning in 1985 that verify the inaccuracies of the normal
approximation reported below. In addition, the results throughout the paper are robust to using a smoothing
parameter of 9600, rather than 1600; to using the residuals from a four-order autoregressions; and to using the
residuals from the estimation of a two-equation aggregate demand – aggregate supply model based on Rudebusch
and Svensson (1999) as implemented in Cecchetti, Flores-Lagunes, and Krause (2006) that includes interest rates.



                                                                  6
Cecchetti                                                                                 Asset Price Booms


    The figures show the results for the following calculation. For the normal distribution, this is
just -1.645 times the standard deviation of the series. The alternative, that takes the fatness of the
tails of the distribution into account, begins by the computation of a Hill index. As described in
LeBaron and Samanta (2005), the Hill index is an estimate of the number of moments of a
distribution that exist. For a normal distribution, the index is infinity. After computing the
index, the tail is approximately distributed as a Student t with degrees of freedom equal to the
Hill index value. So, the t-distribution approximation to the 5th percentile of the deviations of
log GDP or the log price level from their trend is equal to the standard deviation of the series
times the 5% level of the t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the series’ Hill index.8

    As one would expect, in some countries the deviations of output and prices from trend – their
output and price-level gaps – have fatter tails than others. But if one were to use the normal
distribution, the errors would be large – averaging roughly 50%. For the U.S., the 5th percentile
of the normal distribution implies a deviation of output from trend of slightly more than -2½%.
Taking the fatness of the lower tail of the actual data into account yields an estimate of more than
-4½%. That is the 5% GDP at risk for the U.S. (without conditioning on anything). For the price
level, the estimates diverge by less with the normal distribution giving a 5% price-level at risk
equal to -2½% and the t-distribution approximation yielding an estimate of -3½%.

    It is important to keep in mind that standard statistical and econometric procedures are
designed to characterize behavior near the mean of the data, so they are particularly ill-suited to
the examination of tail events, especially when the data have fat tails. This means that when
extreme events are more likely than the normal distribution implies, and we care about them, it is
important to adopt techniques that explicitly account for fat tails.

3. Risks Created by Asset Price Bubbles

    Managing risk means having information about the entire distribution of possible outcomes.
That is, one needs to know not only the mean and variance, but tail probabilities as well. With
that in mind, I now compute the mean, variance, value-at-risk, and expected lower tail for output
and price-level deviations from their trends; all conditional on the asset price booms.

8
 Computation of the Hill index requires the decision about where the tail of the distribution starts. I take LeBaron
and Samanta’s advice and use the bottom 10% of the observations.

3.1 The Mean

    How do asset price booms change the mean and volatility of output and price-level gaps? I
examine this question using a series of regression, which allow straightforward statistical
inference.

    To study the conditional mean, consider the following regression:
(1)      xit = a + b dit-k(α) + εit ,
where xit is the either the level of the output (or price-level) gap; dit-k(α) is a dummy variable that
takes on the value 1 if k periods earlier the filtered asset price data exceeds the threshold α. The
coefficient b measures the impact of the asset price boom on the distribution of the gap variable.

    Before continuing, let me pause to describe the procedure used to construct the data. 9 First,
for each country I take the deviation of the log of each series – real GDP, the aggregate price
level, the real equity price index, and the real housing price index – from its Hodrick-Prescott
filtered trend with a smoothing parameter equal to 1600 (the results are robust to using a
parameter of 9600). All data are quarterly, and most samples are from 1970 to 2003.10 To
construct the dummy variable dit-k, I filter the log equity and housing price data using a Hodrick-
Prescott filter with smoothing parameter equal to 3200 (again, this is robust to increasing the
parameter value). It is important to note that the use of a two-sided filter means that large
positive deviations of asset prices from this trend – these are the booms – must be followed by
crashes. Put another way, the booms I locate cannot continue indefinitely.

    Finally, taking deviations from country-specific (and time-varying) trends has the advantage
that it removes country fixed effects. While there are surely numerous conditions that vary in
these countries over the sample, this is at least a minimum condition for pooling.11




9
  The 17 countries in the housing price sample are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland,
Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S. The 27
countries in the equity price data sample add Austria, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Peru,
and South Africa.
10
   While it would be interesting to look at shorter samples, there is simply not enough data to do it.
11
   As in Section 2, the results in Section 3 are robust to use of residuals from a fourth-order autoregression; and use
of residuals from a model that includes interest rates and external prices.

        The table reports the coefficient b in the regression xit = a + b dit-k(α) + εit , where x is the deviation of
        either log GDP or the log price from an Hodrick-Prescott filtered trend, with parameter 1600; and d is
        either a dummy variable equal to one if the filtered asset price exceeds the threshold (in percent), or
        the filtered asset price data itself. In each case, the first row of numbers is the coefficient itself, while
        the second row is a p-value for the test that b is strictly less than zero, computed using Newey-West
        standard errors with lags equal to 1.5 times k. Italicized values are significantly greater than zero,
        while bold values are significantly less than zero, both at the 5-percent level. Samples are described in
        the data appendix.

     Returning to the results, Table 1 reports estimates for equation (1). To read the table, take the
example of the last entry in the third column under housing. That’s the one where the threshold
α equals 10-percent and the lag k is 12 quarters. For this case, the estimate of b is -1.42 with a p-
value of 0.00. This means that, conditional on seeing a housing boom that is 10-percent above
trend, the mean of the output gap 12 quarters later is on average -1.42 percent – that seems like a
big number, and it is precisely estimated.12



12
  To address problems of heteroskedasiticity (throughout) and serial correlation (within each country) I have
estimated the standard errors and resulting p-values using a panel version the Newey-West (1986) procedure with
lags equal to 1.5k.

Cecchetti                                                                       Asset Price Booms


      Overall, these results allow a number of conclusions. First, in the near term, at horizons of
four quarters, both equity and housing booms lead to positive output gaps. This is for the simple
reason that the at a four-quarter horizon, an asset-market boom is likely to continue, adding fuel
to the general economic growth. Second, housing booms create future declines in output and
increases in prices while equity booms do not. And third, the bigger the housing boom, the
bigger the expected drop in output and the expected increase in the price level.

3.2 Volatility

      Next, I examine the impact of asset price booms on the volatility of output and price deviation
from trend. To do this, I regress the square of the gap, that is (xit)2 on the dummy variable dit-
k(α).   That is:
(2)       (xit )2= a’ + b’ dit-k(α) + υit .

      To simplify interpretation, I standardize the data, dividing by the variance of the entire
sample. This means that the coefficient is a measure of the percentage increase in the volatility.
So, for example, a number like 5.28 (that’s the estimate for a 10-percent housing price boom at a
horizon of 4 quarters) means a 5.28-percent increase in volatility. The results are reported in
Table 3, and they are quite stark. Housing booms increase the volatility of growth at all
horizons, and that’s it. Interestingly, neither housing nor equity booms have a measurable
impact on the volatility of prices. And equity booms do not affect the volatility of growth – the
estimates are both economically tiny and statistically irrelevant.

      Focusing on the bottom left panel of the Table 3 – the impact of housing booms on GDP
volatility – we see that the bigger the boom, the bigger the impact on volatility. But the bigger
impact is at short horizons where we know from Table 2 that on average growth rises. So, while
housing booms increase volatility, it seems to do it primarily on the up side.

      The table reports the coefficient b2 in the regression (xit)2 = a2 + b2 dit-k(α) + ηit, where x is the
      deviation of either log GDP or the log price from an Hodrick-Prescott filtered trend, with parameter
      1600; and d is either a dummy variable equal to one if the filtered asset price exceeds the threshold α
      (in percent), or the filtered asset price data itself (those are the rows labeled “data”). In each case, the
      first row of numbers is the coefficient itself, while the second row is a p-value for the test that b2 is
      strictly greater than zero, computed using Newey-West standard errors with lags equal to 1.5 times k.
      Bold values are significantly greater than one at the 5-percent level.




3.3 GDP and Price-Level at Risk

   Next, I turn to an examination of the tails of the distribution of output and price-level
outcomes, conditional on asset price booms. Are GDP at risk and price-level at risk are affected
by the equity or housing booms or busts? If, for example, there is a dramatic increase in equity
prices should this change our view of the possibility of bad events? And, importantly, are
normal approximations likely to give the wrong signal?

Equity Bubbles

   For equity booms, the answer to this question is reported in Figure 3. The horizontal axis in
the figure plots the minimum size of the equity price deviation, and the vertical axis plots the
fifth percentile of the distribution of future outcomes for the GDP gap – the 5% GDP at risk.
The two lines show the 5% GDP at risk 4 quarters ahead and 12 quarters ahead. So, for example,
if equity prices are at least 10 percent above trend, the 5th percentile of the distribution of the
GDP gap 12 quarters into the future is -3.6. As it turns out, this is only slight below the 5th
percentile of the unconditional distribution for deviations of GDP from trend, which is -3.44, so
it isn’t very troubling. In other words, the GDP at risk from a 10 percent equity boom is only
very slightly below than the unconditional GDP at risk. The upper line in the figure, the 5%
GDP at risk 4 quarters ahead, is always significantly above the unconditional 5th percentile of the
GDP gap distribution. The reason for this is that all booms are likely to continue, so the horizon
for the collapse of equity prices and GDP both is beyond 4 quarters.

about prices rising while others may care more about prices falling, I report the risk results for
both tails of the distribution. These are referred to as the 95% price-level at risk. As the equity
boom grows, the risk of the price-level falling below trend (shown in Panel A of Figure 4) grows
substantially. When real equity prices are 15 percent or more above trend, the 5th percentile of
the distribution of price-level gap 4 quarters out is more than –9 percent. Depending on the
current level of inflation, that could be a significant risk. By contrast, the risk of the extreme
positive price level gaps (in Panel B of Figure 4) goes down. Conditional on an equity boom, the
distribution of price level deviations from trend shifts down.

Housing Bubbles

   Turning to housing bubbles, Figures 5 and 6 report computations analogous to those reported
in Figure 3 and 4. The results in these two figures suggest that housing booms are followed by an
increased risk of a large decline in GDP in 4 to 12 quarters, and a decreased risk of prices falling
below trend. Note from the scale that the GDP at risk is quite large. When real house prices are




                                                                   14

5% or more above trend, there is a 5% probability that 12 quarters later GDP will be at least
3.44% below trend – substantially below the unconditional 5th percentile of -2.86%.13

Housing booms affect the price-level at risk as well. The information in Figure 6 suggests that a
housing boom has very little impact on the upper tail of the price-level distribution, but
dramatically eliminates the lower tail – at least at a 12-quarter horizon. Unconditionally, the
upper tail 5% price-level at risk 12 quarters following a 10% housing price boom is roughly one-
quarter the unconditional 5th percentile – that is, it -1% as compared with -4%.

Comparing the Normal Approximation and the Empirical Density

   It is important to ask whether there is any difference between the results in Figures 3 and 5
and those that from a simple normal approximation. That is, if a central banker had been looking
at the -1.645 times the standard deviation of the distribution of output and price-level gaps,
conditional on an equity market boom, would they have done anything different? The results
suggest that the answer to this is yes.

   Figure 7 compares the 5th percentile for the GDP gap computed using a normal approximation
with one from the empirical density. For equity booms, the normal approximation gives an
overly pessimistic view of the size of the lower tail. The average distance between the two
estimates of the 5th percentile of the distribution is roughly three-quarters of one percentage
point. This particular example suggests that employing a quadratic loss would likely
overestimate the importance of an equity boom.

   Housing is another story. Here the normal distribution gives an overly optimistic view of the
true size of the lower tail. The 5th percentile of the empirical density is on average 1.25
percentage points below what is implied by the normal approximation. Since the probability of



                                                                                     17

extreme negative outcomes for the GDP gap is higher than suggested by a Gaussian distribution,
a quadratic loss will underestimate the importance of a housing boom.

      In the case of price-level outcomes, normal approximations are also misleading. For example,
twelve quarters following a housing boom, the 5th percentile of the upper tail of outcomes is 2½
percentage points smaller than would be implied by simply multiplying the standard deviation of
the observed outcomes by 1.64.

3.4. Expected Lower Tail Loss

      Direct statistical inference for a number like GDP at risk is difficult. Instead of constructing
Monte Carlo experiments that might allow confidence interval estimation, I turn to the
examination the expected tail loss. This is the expected value, conditional on being in the tail of
the distribution. As in the case of the GDP at risk and price-level at risk, here I ask whether the
expected tail loss changes when asset prices boom. In order to do inference, I run a regression
similar to equation (1):
(3)       xit = a + b0 dit-k(α) +b1tail(β)it+b3 dit-k(α)x tail(β)it +ηit ,
where xit is the output or price-level gap; dit-k(α) is a dummy variable equal to 1 if k periods
earlier the filtered asset price data exceeds the threshold α.; and tail(β)it as a dummy variable that
equals 1 if xit is in the β-percent lower tail of the distribution of all xit.

      The coefficient b3 on the interaction term in equation (3) provides an estimate of the impact of
an asset price boom of size α on the expected tail loss in the lowest β-percent of the distribution
of the output or price-level gap. Because of the structure of the regression, it is possible to
compute standard errors that are robust to both serial correlation and heteroskedasiticity in the
error term ηit.14

      The results of this regression are reported in Table 3, and they are quite striking. Asset price
booms – both equity and housing – result in a fall in the expected lower tail loss. The decline is
both economically and statistically significant. Put another way, equity and housing booms
make it more likely that something bad will happen.

14
  The estimation method is an adaptation of the Newey-West estimator to a panel in which there is serial correlation
and heteroskedasiticity within a country, but no dependence between countries.

      + υit where xit is the deviation of either log GDP or the log price from an Hodrick-Prescott filtered
      trend, with parameter 1600; tailit(β) is a dummy variable that equals 1 if xit in the lower β-percent
      tail; and d is either a dummy variable equal to one if the filtered asset price exceeds the threshold α
      (in percent), or the filtered asset price data itself (those are the rows labeled “data”). In each case, the
      first row of numbers is the coefficient itself, while the second row is a p-value for the test that b3 (the
      coefficient on the interaction term) is strictly less than zero, computed using Newey-West standard
      errors with lags equal to 1.5 times k. Bold values are significantly greater than one at the 5-percent
      level.



3.5 Summary of the Results

   Table 4 summarizes the results of this section. The conclusion is that housing booms
dramatically change the distribution of outcomes in virtually every way. By contrast, equity
booms have little impact on the mean and variance of deviation from trend, but do affect the

4. The Difference between Equity and Housing Bubbles

     To understand the differential impact of equity and housing bubbles, it is useful to focus on
their consumption effects. Booms in either equity or property prices drive up the wealth of
individuals. The natural response to an increase in wealth is to raise consumption. If you are
rich, you can buy a fancy car, purchase a bigger and flatter television, go on nicer vacations, eat
in expensive restaurants, and the like. And, the data show that this is exactly what happens.

     A useful rule of thumb is that a $1 increase in US wealth generates between 2 and 5 cents of
additional consumption by American households.15 That is, the marginal propensity to consume
for wealth is in the range of 0.02 to 0.05.

     As Norman, Sebastia-Barriel and Weeken (2002) note, the marginal propensity to consume is
of somewhat less interest than the elasticity of consumption with respect to wealth. 16 They
emphasize that we care more about the impact of a 10% increase in the value of wealth than we

15
  See, for example, Norman, Sebastia-Barriel and Weeken (2002).
16
  The elasticity of consumption with respect to wealth is equal to the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth
times the ratio of wealth to consumption.


                                                     20
Cecchetti                                                                              Asset Price Booms


do about the number of cents or pence that consumption rises per dollar or pound of additional
wealth. This is especially true of equity wealth, since the size of equity markets vary so widely
across countries. Bertaut (2002) reports that, at the end of 2001, total equity market
capitalization equaled 153% of GDP in the U.K., but only 59% of GDP in Germany. To
understand the importance of this, consider the impact of a 10% increase in equity prices on
consumption in each country, assuming that the marginal propensity to consume is the same.
The estimated impact in the UK the impact would be roughly 3 times as large as that in
Germany.17

     This highlights the importance of thinking about bubbles in housing and equity prices
separately. There are two reasons for this. First, equity prices are substantially more volatile
than housing prices, so the former is much less likely to be permanent than the latter.
Reasonably, households respond more aggressively to changes in wealth that they perceive to be
permanent.18 Second, equity ownership tends to be concentrated among the wealthy – people
who are much less likely to adjust their consumption levels. Housing ownership, by contrast, is
distributed more broadly. And while the quality of housing and the concentration of ownership
vary across countries, the differences are far less dramatic.

     Returning to the evidence, using data from 14 developed countries Case, Quigley, and Shiller
(2005) discusses how a one percent increases in housing wealth raises consumption by between
0.11 and 0.17 percent. By contrast, they find that the stock-market wealth elasticity of
consumption is substantially smaller, only 0.02. It is natural that the housing booms would have
more of an impact on the distribution of macroeconomic outcomes than equity booms do.

5. Policy Responses: Risk Management and Financial Structure

     Is there anything to be done about all of this? Can we provide any useful guidance on how to
avoid the risks bubbles pose? Researchers have investigated a myriad of possible responses
including, but not restricted to reacting only to bubbles insofar as they influence inflation
17
   Careful econometric estimates show an even larger disparity. Bertuat (2002) reports that 10% increase in stock
market creates 0.5 to 1.0% increase in consumption in the long run in the US and U.K., but only 0.07 in Germany
where the equity is less than 60% of GDP.
18
   Kishor (2005) estimates that while 98% of the change in housing wealth is permanent, only 55% of the change in
financial wealth is. This suggests that the housing wealth effect should be roughly twice the stock-market wealth
effect.


                                                   21
Cecchetti                                                                                Asset Price Booms


forecasts; reacting only to the fallout of a bubble after it bursts; leaning against a bubble as it
develops; including asset prices in the price index central bankers target; and examining various
regulator solutions involving margin and lending requirements. In Cecchetti (2006) I summarize
the traditional debate in each of these cases. Briefly, there is a consensus building against the
purely activist view. As Gruen, Plumb, and Stone (2003) discuss, the information requirements
for the activism are fairly high and there are significant risk of costly missteps. The conclusion
is that interest rates may not be the best tool for combating the destabilizing effects of asset price
bubbles

     From a risk management perspective, the discussion of central bank responses to asset price
bubbles is unnecessarily restrictive. Why focus only on traditional monetary policy? Risk
managers do more than simply monitor and react to developments; they build institutional
structures that are unlikely to collapse when hit by large shocks. The regulators and supervisors
of the financial system have built mechanisms exactly like this. Are there similar responses to
bubbles? When subjected to equity and property price bubbles, are some financial systems more
resilient than others?

     Recent work by Dynan, Elmendorf and Sichel (2006) and Cecchetti, Flores-Lagunes, and
Krause (2005) suggests that changes in the financial system have been an importance source of
stabilization over the past several decades. Their results suggest that enhanced household access
to credit has allows for increased consumption smoothing that has been a major factor in
reducing the volatility of aggregate real growth.19 This brings up the natural question: Does the
impact of housing and equity bubbles on GDP at risk or price-level at risk depend on financial
structure?




19
  The argument is that there is a linkage not only between financial system development and the level of real
growth, as describe in Ross Levine’s (1997) survey, but also between financial development and the stability of real
growth.


                                                    22

     To examine this, I begin with data on financial structure taken from Demirguc-Kunt and
Levine (2001). Briefly, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine have constructed a data set on financial
indicators during the 1990s covering a broad cross-section of countries. Included are measures
of the relative size of a country’s stock market and banking sector, as well as a measure of the
relative efficiency of the two. Countries with “market-based financial systems” are those with
bigger more efficient stock markets. I examine the relationship of this composite financial
structure index and the behavior of an economy following booms in equity or housing prices.

     As a first step, I reproduce Figure 3 and 5 with the data for GDP at risk dividing the data
based on whether it comes from a country with a predominantly market-based or bank-based
financial system. The results, reported in Figure 8, show that for countries where equity markets
are important, equity booms increase GDP at risk. By contrast, GDP at risk following a housing
boom is not sensitive to financial structure as characterized by this index.

     To examine this a bit further, and try to get a grasp on whether any of it is precise in a
statistical sense, I add the I add the financial structure variable to regressions (1), (2) and (3) –
both as a level and interacted with the asset-price boom dummy. Here’s an example:

     (1’) xit = a + b dit-k(α) + cfi + dfi dit-k(α)+εit ,
     (2’) (xit )2= a’ + b’ dit-k(α)+c’fi + d’fi dit-k(α)+ υit .
     (3’) xit = a + b0 dit-k(α) +b1tail(β)it+b3 dit-k(α)x tail(β)it
                    b4 fi+b5 fi dit-k(α) +b6 fi tail(β)it+b7 fi dit-k(α)x tail(β)it +ηit .

Kunt and Levine (2001).20

assets (relative size of stock market compared to banking sector), (2) total value traded in stock market divided by
claims on private sector by deposit money banks (relative activity of stock market compared to banking sector), and
(3) total value traded in stock market as a share of GDP divided by banking overhead costs as a share of total assets

             Table reports the regression coefficients from the interaction of the financial structure
             measure with the asset price boom dummy variable in equations (1), (2), and (3). The
             more positive financial structure, the more market-based a countries financial system;
             the more negative, the more bank-based it is. Numbers in parentheses are p-values
             computed using heterskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors, as
             described in the notes to Tables 1, 2, and 3.


   Unsurprisingly, the strongest results are those for the mean. In countries with market-based
financial systems, which is to say places where equity markets are important, the first and second
column of the top panel in Table 5 shows that equity price increases lead to bigger short-horizon
booms and bigger long-horizon crashes (although the latter are imprecisely estimated).
Analogously, for bank-based economies, housing booms lead to bigger short-horizon GDP
booms, but smaller long-horizon crashes. (These are the results in the first and second column of
the bottom panel of the table.)


                                                    25

   Turning to the volatility, there is no measurable impact on financial structure. The point
estimates reported in the fourth and fifth columns of Table 5 are all small and the the p-values
are never below 0.2 or above 0.8.

   Finally, looking at the far right columns of Table 5, the results from estimating equation (3’),
there is some weak evidence that market-based economies fare somewhat worse at longer-
horizons when hit with equity price booms. Again, this is really no surprise.

   In the end, these results are disappointing. While we may believe that financial structure plays
are role in the real economic impact of asset price booms, the available data do not show much
evidence of it.

6. Conclusion

   Stability is the watchword of monetary policymakers. Listening to most modern central
bankers speak about their goals you are likely to hear about the desire for low, stable inflation
and high, stable growth. Policymakers will explain how they raise and lower short-term interest
rate targets in order to meet their stability-oriented objectives. But listen closely, and you will
realize that the statements are nuanced. While stability is the ultimate objective, it is the
possibility of catastrophe that keeps central bankers awake at night. They want to ensure that
nothing really bad happens, and to do this they consider the entire distribution of possible
outcomes.

   In analyzing the macroeconomic impact of asset price booms and crashes, it is the disasters
that are the true concern. This suggests a different approach to managing risk; one based on
keeping the probability of output deviating from its trend (or price level deviations from its target
trend) over some time horizon below some fixed threshold. The implication is that policy
responses be designed to keep the lower tail of the distribution – as measured by value-at-risk or
the expected tail loss – sufficiently small.

   In this paper I use data from a broad cross-section of countries to examine the mean, variance,
and lower tail risks arising from booms and crashes in equity and housing markets. The
conclusion is that housing bubbles change the entire distribution of macroeconomic outcomes.



                                               26

By contrast, equity bubbles tend to make the worst events even worse, leaving the mean and
variance of the distributions roughly unchanged. The strongest conclusion is that
approximations that use the normal distribution, and analyses based on quadratic loss functions,
have the potential to be extremely misleading. Looking further, I present weak evidence
suggesting that those countries with market-based financial systems, where stock market
capitalization is relatively large, weather housing booms somewhat better and equity booms
somewhat worse than countries with bank-based financial systems.

   In closing, it is important to emphasize one critical implication of adopting a risk management
view. As mentioned earlier, econometric modeling tends to provide go characterizations of what
happens near the mean of the data. In fact, in order to improve the quality of estimates,
researchers have a tendency to remove outliers. This is sometimes done in the guise of
sensitivity analysis, and other times using limited-influence estimation that explicitly truncates
tail observations. This means that standard modeling strategies provide virtually no information
about the behavior of the economy when it is under stress. As a result, evaluating the problems
posed by extreme events, which is at the core of risk management, necessarily requires
judgment. And, to quote Chairman Greenspan (2004) one final time: “Such judgments, by their
nature, are based on bits and pieces of history that cannot formally be associated with an analysis
of variance.”
