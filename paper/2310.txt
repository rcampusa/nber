                         Exchange Rate Policy Reconsidered




                                      ABSTRACT

     The Bretton Woods Conference of 191414   which fixed exchange rates for over
twenty-five years is often cited as a model of economic cooperation among

countries.     Yet over fifteen years have elapsed since the breakdown of the

Bretton Woods System without any serious efforts to restore fixed exchange

rates among the currencies of the major industrial countries. This paper

considers why governments may have refrained from "reforming" the exchange

rate system.

     The first section of the paper examines the principal problem which

exchange rate policy is designed to address, exchange rate variability. The

paper distinguishes between the short run volatility of exchange rates, which

firms can hedge against in the financial markets, and longer term swings in

real exchange rates, which can lead to costly resource reallocation.

     The paper reviews evidence concerning the effectiveness of exchange

market intervention, evidence which suggests that intervention may not be

effective unless it is monetized. The paper goes on to analyze arguments

concerning fixed exchange rates, and to assess the experience of two fixed

rate systems, Bretton Woods and the European Monetary System. Finally, the

paper examines the target zone system which has been proposed as an

alternative to freely floating and fixed exchange rates.

     I would regard it as a catastrophe amounting to a world
     tragedy if [this Conference should] . . . allow itself to be
     diverted by the proposal of a purely artificial and temporary
     experiment affecting the monetary exchange of a few nations
     only. . . . The sound internal economic system of a nation
     is a greater factor in its well being than the price of its
     currency in changing terms of the currencies of other nations
     [from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's message to the London
     Economic Conference of 1933].

     It has been our task to find a common measure, a common
     standard, a common rule applicable to each and not irksome to
     any. . . .   [W}e have perhaps accomplished here in Bretton
     Woods something more than what is embodied in this Final
     Act. We have shown that a concourse of 1414 nations are
     actually able to work together at a constructive task in
     amity and unbroken accord [J.M. Keynes at the conclusion of
     the Bretton Woods Conference in 1914)4].1

     The Bretton Woods Conference of 191414 which fixed exchange rates for over

twenty-five years is often cited as a model of economic cooperation among

countries. Indeed the Bretton Woods Agreement on exchange rates was a

remarkable accomplishment, particularly when measured against the failures of

earlier conferences such as the London Economic Conference of 1933. Yet over

fifteen years have elapsed since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods System

without any serious efforts to restore fixed exchange rates among the

currencies of the major industrial countries. The last attempt to reconstruct

the exchange rate system, the Smithsonian Agreement of December 1971, broke

down almost immediately. Recent economic summits have agreed on ad hoc

policies to counter exchange rate movements and have considered modest

proposals to modify the existing system, but these summits have made no

progress on more systemic changes in exchange rate arrangements. Governments

may have refrained from "reforming" the system for good reasons. This paper

will consider arguments for and against more far-reaching international

agreements on exchange rate policy.

      When considering possible reforms of' the exchange rate system, it is

natural to compare experience since 1973 with that of the Bretton Woods

period. The difference in economic performance between the two periods would

be startling if it were not so well known. Table 1 updates a table presented

in Goldstein (19814, p. 10) that compares recent inflation rates, growth rates,

and other economic variables with those of the Bretton Woods period. The

period since 1973 is divided in two parts to highlight more recent

developments in the 1980s.

      Regardless of which indicator is chosen, the decade of the 1960s was a

time of' much superior economic performance. During the 1960s, inflation was

markedly lower in all major industrial countries, with the notable exception

of Japan where inflation in the 1980s is half what it was in the 1960s. A

more recent trend toward lower inflation rates, however, is observed by

comparing the 1981-85 and 1973—80 periods. Figure 1, illustrating the annual

inflation rates for the three largest industrial economies, confirms this

downward trend and also suggests that inflation rates for these countries may

be converging. But these recent favorable trends in inflation are not matched

by similar trends in output and other variables. Real growth in GNP was

higher during the 1960s in all countries. Productivity growth was higher in

all countries during the 1960s than during the 1973-85 period as a whole,

although in the United States and United Kingdom productivity growth during

the 1980s has exceeded that of the 1960s.2 Finally, unemployment rates were

in an entirely different range during the 1960s. In Germany, for example,

unemployment averaged only 0.8% in the 1960s, but 2.9% in the 1970s and a

depressingly high 7.1% in the 1980s. In the United Kingdom, a 2.6%

unemployment rate during the 1960s has turned into an 11.9% rate in the

 1980s.   Compared with the recent period of flexible exchange rates, therefore,

 the 1960s appear to have been a golden era of economic performance.

      Yet we should hesitate before attributing recent economic performance to

 the switch from fixed to flexible exchange rates. Although flexible rates
                                                                             may
help to explain high inflation rates in the 1970s, it is much more difficult

to tie growth rates, unemployment rates, or productivity performance to a

nominal variable like the exchange rate. Nor is it easy to say how the fixed

rate system would have performed in response to the economic disturbances of

the 70s and 80s, including the two oil shocks and the sharp changes in

macroeconomic policies undertaken in Britain and the United States. Rather

than try to account for this gap in economic performance, or to speculate

about how a different exchange rate system might have performed, the paper

will focus on the choices that are presented to policy—makers today. One of'

these choices is to return to fixed exchange rates, but in today's economic

environment this may prove as difficult as putting Humpty Dumpty together

again.

     The paper addresses a number of issues important to exchange rate policy:

Exchange Rate Variability: The first section of the paper examines the

problem which exchange rate policy is designed to address, exchange rate

variability. It distinguishes between two types of exchange rate variability,

the short—run volatility of exchange rates characteristic of all asset prices

and the misalignment of exchange rates which may persist for several years at

a time. This distinction is crucial to an understanding of exchange rate

policy, since actions designed to reduce volatility may not be well suited to

countering misalignments.

Role of Sterilized Intervention: Casual observers may regard exchange market

intervention as the primary tool of exchange rate policy, yet existing



27.18.2
evidence raises doubts about the effectiveness of intervention unaccompanied

by changes in money supplies. The second section of the paper reviews

existing statistical evidence on so-called sterilized intervention, then

studies two recent episodes of foreign exchange intervention in November 1978

and September 1985.

Fixed Exchange Rates: Those who look on the Bretton Woods System with

nostalgia may not recall how that system actually performed in practice. The

third section examines arguments for and against fixed exchange rates in

general. It then reviews experience under the Bretton Woods System as well as

the recently established European Monetary System.

Rules for Managed Floating: The fourth section considers various proposals

for managing exchange rates, including the rules adopted by the International

Monetary Fund in 1978. One ambitious scheme for exchange rate management

involves establishing target zones for the major currencies. The fourth

section examines target zones in detail because of the attention given to

targets in recent government and academic discussions.


1. The Problem of Exchange Rate Variability

      Variable exchange rates pose problems for an economy, but the problems

vary widely depending upon the nature of the variability. A useful

distinction can be drawn between two types of variability, volatility and

misalignment. Volatility is the day—to-day, month-to-month variability of

exchange rates, a variability that may have no trend to it. Misalignment, in

contrast, is the persistent departureof an exchange rate from its long run

competitive level. Misalignment thus refers not to month—to—month variability

but to longer-lasting movements of exchange rates, and only to those movements

which depart from relative price trends, thus altering the relative

competitiveness of a country's goods.3 This distinction is important for


27. 18 .2
                                       —5—




 intervention policy because a case might be made that only one form of

 variability is harmful and therefore might Justify intervention. It must be

 admitted at the outset, however, that this distinction between the two forms

of exchange rate variability is more easily made in theory than in practice,

since exchange rates may exhibit their greatest volatility during periods of

misalignment. Nonetheless, the paper will consider each form of variability

 in turn.

 1.1. Volatility

      One of the lessons learned from the voluminous literature on exchange

rate behavior written in the 1970s is that exchange rates behave like asset

prices, displaying much more volatility than most macroeconomic variables such

as output or the prices of goods and services.4 This is not surprising given

the dominance of asset trades in the determination of exchange rates. Table 2

examines the volatility of exchange rates using one measure of volatility, the

standard deviation of monthly percentage changes in exchange rates.5 This

measure of volatility, suggested by Lanyi and Suss (1982), counts as variable

only those movements in exchange rates which depart from an average trend

(measured as a percentage change).

Volatility Comparisons

     Table 2 compares the volatility of' exchange rates with the volatility of

price ratios based on two aggregate price indexes, the consumer price index

and the wholesale price index, for the so-called Group of Five industrial

countries, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and United States.

According to this table, bilateral exchange rates are more than twice as

volatile as these price ratios, in some cases more than five times as

volatile.6 This should not be surprising once it is recognized that, unlike

many goods prices which are changed only infrequently, exchange rates are free

to respond to any new information hitting the exchange markets.

      Even though exchange rates are volatile when compared with price indexes,

however, they are less volatile than some asset prices like stock exchange

indexes. And exchange rate volatility is also generally lower than the

volatility of commodity prices quoted on organized exchanges. Table 2 also

reports volatility measures for both sets of variables. Notice that three

agricultural commodities important to farming communities, cotton, rice, and

wheat, have almost three times the volatility of exchange rates.

      That exchange rates are so much more volatile than prices should suggest

that the volatility of real exchange rates is also quite large. Table 2 also

provides evidence that real rates are about as volatile as nominal rates.

This table presents volatility measures of' nominal and real bilateral exchange

rates as well as nominal and real effective exchange rates. Throughout the

paper, the real exchange rate (Rt) is defined as the ratio of the domestic

price index       to the domestic currency value of the foreign price index

(XtP) where      is the domestic currency price of the foreign currency:7


(1)
                                Rt   P/(XtP)

The domestic and foreign prices used are wholesale price indexes (or WPI's)

which are available on a monthly basis for most industrial countries.

Effective exchange rates are obtained by weighting the exchange rates of ten

countries (G—5 plus five medium-size industrial countries) by the share of

total trade in manufactures (imports plus exports) of one country with each of

the other countries.8 The lesson to be learned from this table is an

important one: real exchange rates are volatile primarily because nominal

exchange rates are volatile. That is, the relative stability of price levels



27. 18.2
                                     —7—



means that nominal exchange rate volatility translates into real exchange rate

volatility.

Excessive Volatility?

     Recent studies have addressed the question of whether asset prices are

excessively volatile relative to the underlying factors determining their

values. Shiller (1979), for example, studies whether long term interest rates

are excessively volatile relative to interest rates on short term bonds. He

finds that the volatility of long rates exceeds the limits imposed by term—

structure models which represent long term rates as averages of expected short

term rates. The same type of methodology can be used to investigate the

volatility of exchange rates.9 But the tests are valid only if the researcher

uses the correct underlying model of exchange rates, and there is little

consensus about the appropriate model to use)0 Huang (1981) shows that

exchange rates are excessively volatile relative to a monetary model of

exchange rates. But exchange rate volatility has yet to be investigated in

terms of other models, so whether exchange rates exhibit excessive volatility

remains an open question.

Changes in Volatility over Time

     We have lived with flexible exchange rates for over a decade now, but

there is no evidence that exchange rate volatility has declined as traders

have become more accustomed to flexibility. Figure 2 illustrates the pattern

of volatility over time for the real effective exchange rates for the yen and

dollar. (The currencies in the European Monetary System, including the

Deutche mark, are discussed in Section 3). Volatility is measured over the

twenty-four months immediately prior to each time period. The yen and dollar

experienced a decrease in volatility in 1976—77 before being hit by the second

          .nd by changes in U.S. policy (to be discussed below). There are no

   .Lous trends in these series.

     No doubt exchange rates are much more volatile than they were under the

so—called fixed exchange rate regime of the 1960s. Table 3 uses quarterly

data for real effective exchange rates to compare volatility during the 1960s

with that of the more recent period from 1973 to 1985. Volatility is defined

as the standard deviation of quarterly percentage changes. The results are

quite clear: the Bretton Woods System's band around par values did constrain

the volatility of real exchange rates. The two currencies experiencing only a

marginal increase in volatility, the franc and mark, are those which have been

tied together in European exchange rate arrangements, first the SNAKE and more

recently the European Monetary System.

Effects on Trade

     To what extent should we concerned with volatility per se? That question

is difficult to answer. There is ample evidence that the movements in

exchange rates reflected in the volatility measures are mostly

unanticipated. (For example, forward premiums explain only a fraction of the

variance of spot exchange rate changes.) So trading firms must cope with

uncertainty about exchange rates. In drawing up contracts involving foreign

exchange exposure, firms must take into account this uncertainty. They may

elect to purchase forward exchange, but the forward market is limited to less

than a dozen currencies, and for most of'   these   currencies the market is thin

for all but the shortest maturities. (Note, however, that limiting hedging

alternatives to less than a dozen currencies is less restrictive than it seems

since most of the other currencies in the world are tied to the major

currencies.) They may use the Eurocurrency markets to hedge their currency

exposure, matching assets and liabilities in different currencies (the range

of   currencies available closely corresponding to the set available in the

forward markets). They may take advantage of currency swaps which expand the

range of foreign currency instruments available to the average company. Firms

may also take advantage of the relatively new markets for options on foreign

exchange, particularly when bidding on contracts. Finally, large

multinational firms can diversify away much of the exchange risk. These

hedging and diversification strategies are not without costs, including the

additional managerial effort required to monitor exposure. These costs must

be weighed against whatever benefits the present system affords.

       Despite strong evidence that exchange rate volatility is much greater

under flexible rates than under fixed rates, it has been difficult to

establish statistically that this increase in volatility has seriously

affected international trade. Hooper and Kohlhagen (1978) studied the effects

of volatility on bilateral trade flows of the United States and Germany with

other major industrial countries. They found "absolutely no significant

effect of exchange risk on the volume of trade" (p. 505). Cushxnan (1983)

found some evidence of reduced trade using the volatility of real rather than

nominal exchange rates as his measure of risk. Kenen and Rodrik (19814), using

multilateral trade data and effective exchange rates for eleven countries,

also found some limited evidence of trade reduction. But for some countries

in their sample, higher volatility seemed to increase rather than reduce

trade. The strongest evidence in favor of trade reduction effects was

provided by Akhtar and Hilton (19814) who examined aggregate export and import

behavior in the United States and Germany. Using a longer sample period than

Hooper and Kohlhagen who studied the same two countries, Akhtar and Hilton

found that German exports and imports were significantly reduced as a result

of the increased volatility of nominal effective exchange rates, measured as



27. 18.2
                                      -la-




 the standard deviation of daily exchange rates. Even that study, however,

 found that U.S. imports were unaffected by volatility, and U.S. exports only

 marginally so. How is this evidence to be interpreted? It may be that

 opportunities for hedging and diversification are sufficient to limit the

 impact of volatility on trade. But it also may be that our econometric

 methods are not sufficiently powerful to determine the effects of volatility

 on trade.

 Example of a Trading Firm

      At this point it is useful to remind readers that volatility as defined

 is very different from the persistent misalignment of exchange rates that we

have experienced recently. When the rise in the dollar leads to a loss of

competitiveness for U.S. goods of more than thirty percent, as has happened

over the last several years, trade is bound to be affected regardless of how

successful firms are in reducing the effects of exchange rate volatility.

     The distinction between the two concepts can be illustrated by a simple

example. Suppose an American firm regularly exports goods to Germany for sale

in that country. Whether these goods are invoiced in dollars or marks

determines which firm, the American exporting firm or the German importing

firm, bears the "transaction risk", the exchange risk associated with a

particular export contract. If the mark/dollar (or DM/$) rate fluctuates

widely around an equilibrium value of DM2/$ (i.e., if the DM/$ rate ishighly

volatile), that risk can be considerable. The firm bearing the transaction

risk, however, may elect to purchase a forward contract to hedge this risk.

Alternatively, the risk can be reduced by appropriate financing or

diversification strategies. Contrast the same American firm faced with a

misalignment of the DM/$ rate at a level of DM3/$ (as occurred in the early

1980s). If this misalignment is persistent, then the firm will find its



27.18.2
                                      —.11—




"economic exposure" can not be hedged so easily. The firm may be faced with a

choice between shutting down or shifting its production facilities abroad.

1.2. Misalignment

      Economists writing on flexible exchange rates in the 1960s contemplated

neither the magnitude nor the persistence of the changes in real exchange

rates that have occurred in the last fifteen years, so the term "misalignment"

is a relatively new one. In his recent study of exchange rates, Williamson

defines misalignment as the "persistent departure of the exchange rate from

its long run equilibrium level" (Williamson, 1985, p. 13). Defining such a

long run equilibrium is no simple task. Williamson identifies the long run

equilibrium exchange rate as

      that which is expected to generate a current account surplus
      or deficit equal to the underlying capital flow over the
      cycle, given that the country is pursuing 'internal balance'
      as best it can and not rericting trade for balance of
      payments reasons [p. 114].

It is evident that such a definition refers to the real rather than the

nominal exchange rate, so the nominal exchange rate has to be adjusted by

relative prices through time if inflation differentials are significant. This

is analogous to calculating a purchasing power parity (or PPF) exchange rate

relative to some base period. But Williamson's concept of the long run

equilibrium rate is more sophisticated than a PPP concept since it also takes

into account real shocks such as the OPEC price increases of 1973—714 and 1978—

79.

      This paper will discuss some of the problems involved in defining long—

run equilibrium when we analyze target zones for exchange rates. In this

section, there is no need to be specific about what is the equilibrium level

of any exchange rate in order to illustrate the extent of movement of real

exchange rates over time for some of the major currencies. In Figure 3 one

commonly cited measure of' real exchange rates, real effective exchange rates

based on wholesale prices in manufacturing, is used to illustrate the

movements of the dollar, yen, and pound sterling over the period since the

start of floating in 1973. The series illustrated are provided by Morgan

Guaranty Trust in its World Financial Markets. The figure illustrates clearly

the wide swings in real exchange rates which have characterized these

currencies.12 In the period since 1973, the most serious cases of

misalignment among the industrial countries occurred with respect to the pound

sterling and the dollar. Between 1976 and 1980, the pound rose by over forty

percent in real effective terms. Between 1980 and 1985, the dollar rose more

than thirty-five percent using yearly averages.13 Its peak in February 1985

was forty-two percent above its 1980 average. Both cases of misalignment will

be studied in detail in order to show the extent of the misalignment and its

effects on the economies concerned. Before doing so, however, the paper will

discuss some of the costs associated with misalignment to show why there is so

much concern about it.

Costs of misalignment

     When real exchange rates are misaligned, there are incentives to shift

resources, both internally and externally. Internally, whenever the rate is

overvalued, services and other so—called "nontradable" industries gain at the

expense of export and import-competing or "tradable" industries. Externally,

foreign competitors gain at the expense of these same industries. These

shifts in resources are costly.1

     Misalignments of the size experienced recently, where competing countries

gain a price advantage of 20 or 30 percent, can have very disruptive effects

on firms producing traded goods. Since misalignments may persist for five

years or more, production facilities in some tradables industries may be



27.18.2
                                      —13-.




mothballed or scrapped altogether even though these facilities might be

internationally competitive at exchange rates closer to their long run

equilibrium levels. Short-run losses of competitiveness due to misalignment

can easily become permanent in cases where foreign firms are able to establish

themselves in an industry. Baldwin and Krugman (1986) have shown that such

irreversible changes can occur in industries where costs of entry (e.g.,

investment in marketing and distribution) would deter foreign competition in

the absence of the misalignment.

     If a firm is a multinational, it might elect to shift the production

facility threatened by the misalignment to lower—cost countries. That

decision is not without peril, however, since today's undervalued exchange

rate might swing to overvaluation as did sterling in the late 1970s. A firm

electing to locate a production facility in Britain in the mid 1970s would

have been unpleasantly surprised by the real appreciation that followed.

     Even if domestic production facilities are merely rnothballed, moreover,

the resulting unemployment is costly. Given sufficient time, the labor force

can be retrained and reassigned to non-tradable industries. But even if such

shifts of employment between industries can be effected, the costs involved

are still significant. The decision to shift to a new industry is made more

difficult by three factors. First, it is as unclear to the labor force as it

is to firms how long the misalignment will last. The decision of employees to

seek employment elsewhere or of firms to close facilities must be made despite

the considerable uncertainty about the timing of any return to equilibrium.

(Recall the uncertainty about the timing of the dollar's fall). Second, it is

hard to disentangle long run shifts in comparative advantage from

misalignment. The U.S. steel and automobile industries, for example, were no

doubt hurt by the misalignment, but the growth of foreign production was



27.18.2
                                     -1 J4_




important as well. Third, there is the uncertainty about future protectionist

measures which might shield an industry from both misalignment and secular

declines in competitiveness. These sources of uncertainty make it difficult

for both the labor force and firms to make decisions. In the early 1980s auto

workers, for example, had to decide whether to retrain and possibly relocate

on the basis of their assessment of the duration of misalignment, the long

term prospects of the auto industry, and the political economy of

protectionism. This was a formidable task indeed-—one certainly beyond the

skills of economists.

     The costs of misalignment are not limited to the firms and labor force in

the tradables sector. First, the economy as a whole must adjust its

consumption of nontradables if the resources shifted to that sector are to be

fully employed. Since the relative price of tradables has fallen, that shift

in nontradables requires an increase in total consumption relative to its long

run sustainable level. A capital account surplus will finance this consumer

surge, but at the cost of a buildup of debt. So one of the costs of the

misalignment, as emphasized earlier by Hause (1966) and Johnson (1966), is a

major shift in the time pattern of consumption.15 The second cost is one

alluded to earlier, the cost of tariffs and other protectionist measures which

may be introduced in response to the misalignment. In his study of trade

tensions between the United States and Japan, Bergzten (1982) points out the

three recent periods when protectionist pressures were at their height in the

United States were times when the dollar was most overvalued relative to the

yen. The costs of protectionist legislation if enacted, which would be

"justified" by the need to protect the tradables industries, are borne by

consumers throughout the economy.

     Some of the costs associated with misalignments are illustrated by the

two most serious cases of misalignment among the major industrial countries,

those of Britain and the United States.

The misalignment of sterling in 1979—82

     The run-up of sterling began before the Conservative Government led by

Margaret Thatcher took office in June 1979, but during the first three years

of that Government the misalignment problem became severe. Sterling rose from

$1.70/L in 1976 to $2.140/L in 1980. The rise in the nominal value of'

sterling,   moreover, was matched by its rise in real terms. Figure 3    above
shows a rise in the real effective exchange rate for sterling by 145% between

1976 and 1981. Recall that this series for the real exchange rate is based on

manufacturing prices, so the rise in the index reflects a startling loss of

price competitiveness in Britain's principal export sector. A real

appreciation of this magnitude led to what was called at the time the

"deindustrializatjon of Britain."

     This appreciation is usually attributed to two main factors: the

discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil and the commitment to tight

monetary policy by the Thatcher government. Although North Sea discoveries

began in the early 1970s, production rose sharply only in the late 1970s, from

16.6 million tons in (the financial year) 1976—77 to 79.6   million   tons in

1979_80.16 So the timing of sterling's rise coincides roughly with the rise

in North Sea production (although not with the exchange market's anticipation

of this rise). In a detailed study of economic policies under the first

Thatcher Government, however, Buiter and Miller (1983) find that at most 10

percent of the real appreciation can be attributed to the effects of North Sea

oil.17 The second factor, tight monetary policy, also undoubtedly played a

role in the appreciation. The appreciation, however, may have been due more



27.18.2
                                        —16—



to the announced targets for money growth rather than actual money growth

performance, since actual money growth (at least for the broader aggregates)

repeatedly outran the targets. After evaluating these and other explanations

of the appreciation, Buiter and Miller conclude that much of the appreciation

remains unexplained; indeed, they "find the decline in competitiveness

puzzling" (1983, p. 317).

     How much of this real appreciation represents misalignment of the real

exchange rate from its equilibrium level? The discovery of North Sea oil

shifted the equilibrium real exchange rate, so some of the loss of

competitiveness of' British manufacturing might be better termed "realignment"

rather than "misalignment." That is, some of the real appreciation of

sterling reflected the necessary adjustment of relative prices called for by

this real shock. But what about the real appreciation due to the monetary

tightening (or prospective monetary tightening)? If misalignment is defined

as the departure of the exchange rate from its equilibrium level, then the

overshooting of the exchange rate associated with monetary tightening should

be labelled misalignment. The monetary policy itself may have been desirable

as part of a disinflation policy, but the accompanying temporary overshooting

of the exchange rate imposes adjustment costs which are just as severe as when

the exchange rate becomes misaligned as a result of exchange market

inefficiences or speculative bubbles.

     The effects of the appreciation on the British manufacturing sectOr were

usually severe. Value added in manufacturing fell by over 8% in 1980 and by

over 6% in 1981 compared with declines of 2% or less in GDP in these same two

years. The effects on employment in manufacturing were slower to develop, but

appear to be longer lasting. According to Figure U, employment in

manufacturing declined by over )4% in 1980, but by over 10% in 1981, and it

continued to decline in 1982 and 1983. The effects of sterling's loss of'

competitiveness were devastating for British manufacturing. The term "Dutch

Disease" is used to describe the loss of competitiveness of a manufacturing

sector when oil or gas discoveries drive up the exchange rate. Britain seems

to have suffered from a particularly virulent strain of this disease, although

as argued above the causes of the illness cannot be attributed to North Sea

oil alone.

Misalignment of the Dollar, 1981-85

     The dollar has more recently been misaligned as seriously as the pound

sterling was in 1980-82, but the effects of the misalignment on employment

have been mitigated by strong domestic demand for U.S. goods. Figure 5 traces

three real effective exchange rates for the dollar, all based on prices in the

manufacturing sectors of the United States and its trading partners. The

three prices represented are wholesale prices, value added deflators, and

normalized unit labor costs. The real exchange rates measure U.S. relative to

foreign prices or labor costs, so a rise in any of the real exchange rate

series represents a real appreciation of the dollar and a loss of

competitiveness for U.S. manufactures.18 The sharp appreciation of' the dollar

from 1980 to 1985 is seen in all three series, appreciations of from 314 to 143

percent in five years.

     The origins of the appreciation remain a controversial subject. Among

the principal causes cited are the fiscal policies of the Reagan

Administration, the tight monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve

Board since Paul Volcker became Chairman in 1979, the rise in investment

associated with the Tax Reduction Act of 1981, and the flight of capital to

the "safe haven" of U.S. capital markets. Branson (1985) presents the

argument in favor of attributing much of the rise to American fiscal

policies.   Although the defense buildup and tax cuts were spread out over

several years, Branson argues that the Reagan Administration made credible

"announcements" concerning this policy in 1981, a year when the dollar rose

sharply. Obstfeld (1985) also attributes much of the rise to fiscal policy,

but he emphasizes the separate contribution of foreign fiscal authorities. In

a back-of—the-envelope calculation of fiscal effects, he attributes to fiscal

policy a real appreciation of a little over 20 percent, but almost half of

that appreciation is due to foreign fiscal policy. Frenkel (1985) argues that

the initial rise in the dollar (in 1980) was due more to actual monetary

policy than to expected future fiscal policy. He cites the rise in short-term

interest rates which could not have been due to fiscal actions several years

in the future. Evidence for the role of investment and the "safe haven"

flight of capital is harder to find. Branson points out that while the level

of investment rose sharply in the 1983-85 recovery, the level of investment

relative to GNP was not unusually high in that period. "Safe haven" effects

may have been at work during the period, but it is hard to argue that the

degree of political risk in Europe at least was higher in the 1980s than in

earlier postwar periods.19

       Unlike the origins of the misalignment, the effects on U.S. trade are

unmistakable. The export and importing-competing sectors of the U.S. economy

have been hard hit. Table 4     reports   the trade balance by sector in two years,

1980   and 1985, as   well as the percentage change in the trade balance over this

period measured as a percentage of exports in 1980. According to this table,

the sectors hardest hit by the misalignment were the auto and general consumer

goods sectors; the trade balance in autos deteriorated by almost 180% of 1980

exports during this five year period, while the trade balance in general

consumer goods deteriorated by over 200%. Even the capital goods sector,

normally the strongest of the U.S. manufacturing sectors, deteriorated sharply

with the trade balance falling to $11.6 billion from a 1980 level of $L3i

billion. The trade balance as a whole went from a deficit of $27.7 billion in

1980 to an alarmingly large deficit of $122.1 billion in 1985.20

     The misalignment, of course, was not the sole cause of this deterioration

in U.S. trade performance. During the 1980-85 period, growth in Europe lagged

behind that in the United States, causing faster growth of imports in the

United States. In addition, the debt crisis forced Latin American countries

to curtail their imports from the United States, a factor which may be

particularly important in explaining the fall in U.S. exports of capital

goods. But the trade sector had to have been seriously affected by a change

in relative prices of the magnitude experienced.

     The misalignment led to a fall in production and employment in many

subsectors of manufacturing. Branson and Love (1986) have estimated

disaggregated equations for production and employment in the United States to

determine the effects of the dollar's appreciation. They attribute a loss of

1.3 million jobs in U.S. manufacturing to a L0   percent   appreciation of the

dollar. This job loss was concentrated in the durable goods sectors, with

many of these jobs being lost in two of those sectors, primary metals and non-

electrical machinery. Nonetheless, the effects of the dollar's appreciation

on industrial production and employment were not as severe as in the case of

Britain for two reasons. First, the trade sector is much less important to

the U.S. economy than it is to the British. Perhaps more importantly, the

appreciation coincided with a defense buildup as well as a consumer boom which

kept domestic demand for U.S. goods strong despite the inroads made by foreign

goods.




27. 18.2
                                      -20-



      The two case studies serve to illustrate the disruptive effects of

sizable misaligrunents. One sector of the economy, the tradables sector,

suffers inordinately during the period of the misalignment while the rest of

the economy stumbles on. During the period of sterling's misalignment, the

dichotomy between traded and nontraded sectors took a geographical form. The

north of England, where traditional industries such as steel and automobiles

were centered, suffered from severe unemployment, while the area around London

remained relatively prosperous. In the United States, the contrast in

fortunes between the rust-belt and the sun-belt can be explained at least in

part by the deterioration of U.S. competitiveness associated with the

appreciation of the dollar.

      The problems associated with misalignment thus differ markedly from those

associated with volatility. No simple hedging strategy can protect a firm

from a loss of relative competitiveness of thirty per cent or more.

      Having defined these problems of exchange rate variability, the paper now

turns to the search for solutions. Some observers might contend that the

solution is obvious: governments must adopt policies designed to minimize the

variability of exchange rates. Yet the fact that there are costs associated

with volatility and misalignment does not in itself justify policies designed

to limit exchange rate variability. Before discussing the arguments for and

against exchange rate policies, the paper reviews evidence on the

effectiveness of the most common instrument used to control exchange rates,

foreign exchange intervention.


2. The Effectiveness of Foregp Exchange Intervention

     The central question addressed in this section is the following: does

foreign exchange intervention constitute a separate instrument of exchange

rate policy, or does it work solely through its effects on domestic and


27. 18.2
                                     —21—



foreign money supplies. If the latter is the case, then intervention must be

considered in the broader framework of monetary policy.

2.1. Definition of Foreign Exchange Intervention

    This section begins with a definition of foreign exchange intervention.

Intervention is difficult to define because there are many ways in which the

monetary authorities can influence exchange rates. The Working Group on

Exchange Market Intervention, commissioned to study foreign exchange

intervention by the Versailles Summit of June 1982, adopted a narrow

definition of intervention modified to include certain "passive" operations.

According to the Working Group's Report (hereafter referred to as the

Jurgerisen Report),21 the narrow definition consists of "any sale or purchase

of foreign exchange against domestic currency which monetary authorities

undertake in the exchange market." It includes all central bank purchases and

sales of foreign exchange against domestic currency, whatever form of

financing is used (reserves, swaps, official borrowing, etc.). The Jurgensen

Report adds to this narrow definition three forms of "passive" intervention:

sales concluded by the central bank with public sector entities including the

central government (which would otherwise have undertaken the transactions in

the exchange market), IMF drawings, and interest payments on international

reserves. This definition makes intervention equivalent to the change in the

monetary authorities' net foreign currency assets excluding any capital gains

on existing assets. The definition specifically does not include exchange

market transactions carried out by other private or public entities which

might be considered to be "directed" by the government or central bank (such

as Eurodollar loans to public authorities) because it is so difficult to

establish the intent of the authorities in the case of such transactions.




27.18.2
                                         -22—



      More important than the precise definition of intervention is the

distinction between sterilized and non-sterilized intervention. The Jurgensen

Report defines sterilized intervention as a "change in the monetary

authorities' net foreign currency assets which is offset by a corresponding

change in their net domestic assets so that their monetary liabilities (or,

specifically, the monetary base) remains unchanged" (p. 6). Non-sterilized

intervention, in contrast, involves a one-for—one change in the authorities'

net foreign currency assets and the monetary base. Non-sterilized

intervention thus is a form of monetary policy, distinquishable from

conventional open market operations only in the asset being exchanged for

money.22 There is virtually unanimous agreement among economists that non-

sterilized intervention can affect exchange rates, just as more

conventionally-defined monetary policy can undoubtedly affect exchange

rates. The effectiveness of sterilized interventior, in contrast, is a much

more controversial topic. Yet if foreign exchange intervention is to be

regarded as a separate instrument of economic policy, distinct from monetary

policy, then it must take the form of'   sterilized   intervention.

2.2. Effectiveness of Sterilized Intervention

      There are three distinct channels through which sterilized intervention

can affect exchange rates.23 The first is the most straightforward:

sterilized intervention works by altering the supplies of assets in private

portfolios, thus requiring a realignment of asset returns. This portfolio

balance channel requires that foreign and domestic securities be imperfect

substitutes. The more substitutable are these securities, the smaller is the

realignment of asset returns, and thus the smaller is the change in the

current exchange rate, required to rebalance portfolios. In the limiting case

of perfect substitution between securities, where investors regard domestic



27. 18.2
                                      -23—




and foreign bonds as interchangeable, sterilized intervention is completely

ineffective, at least through this portfolio balance channel.

      The other two channels operate through announcement effects requiring

either market inefficiencies or superior information on the part of the

authorities. If the market is inefficient, intervention operations may help

to focus the attention of the public on hitherto neglected factors even though

the operation itself provides no new information. It is difficult to provide

a convincing rationale for why market operators would neglect publicly

available information, or why intervention would refocus their attention on

this information. But we cannot rule out this possibility a priori.

Alternatively, the intervention operation could provide new information by

signalling the private market about the future monetary policies of the

authorities.21 This last channel could operate even if the market were

efficient, in the sense that market participants incorporate all available

information in forming their expectations, since the authorities naturally

have superior information about their future intentions.

      There is extensive empirical research on the effectiveness of sterilized

intervention. Although this evidence is far from conclusive, it is strong

enough to have led the Jurgensen Report to conclude that "there was broad

agreement among the members of the Working Group that sterilized intervention

alone did not appear to have constituted an effective instrument in the face

of persistent market pressures" (p. 20). Whether or not sterilized

intervention might have a short-term impact through announcement effects was

less clear to the Working Group.

      The Jurgensen Report's conclusion is based on two different types of

evidence. First, there are tests of "speculative efficiency", which are

actually joint tests of uncovered interest parity and market efficiency.



27. 18 .2
Second, there are estimates of portfolio models designed to determine the

influence of bond supplies on risk premia. These two sets of evidence reach

sharply different conclusions.

"Speculative Efficiency" Tests

      Tests of "speculative efficiency" are based on uncovered interest parity,

the equality of expected returns on securities denominated in different

currencies. If uncovered interest parity holds, the expected interest return

on a dollar security should equal the expected return on a foreign currency

security measured in terms of'   dollars   (the expected return consisting of the

foreign interest rate plus the expected capital gain or loss on the foreign

currency).25 The expected returns will be equal whenever investors regard the

two securities as perfect substitutes. If investors are risk—averse, on the

other hand, then they will regard two securities denominated in different

currencies as imperfect substitutes, and a risk—premium will separate the two

expected returns. In that case, sterilized intervention might be effective if

it can change the relative supply of dollar and non-dollar securities enough

to affect the risk premium.

     To determine whether uncovered interest parity holds, investigators must

examine actual, not expected, returns (since expected returns are not

observable). Uncovered interest parity does not ensure that actual returns

are equal on securities denominated in different currencies. But the

differential between these returns should be random as long as the forecast

errors from predicting exchange rates are random, which will be the case if

the exchange market is "efficient." The "speculative efficiency" test, which

tests jointly whether uncovered interest parity holds and the exchange market

is efficient, thus examines whether actual returns on securities denominated

in different currencies are equal except for a random factor.



27. 18.2
                                      —25-



      During the 1970s, a score of investigators ran tests of speculative

efficiency using different time periods and currencies. With few exceptions,

they were unable to reject the speculative efficiency hypothesis. The

evidence was strong enough for Mussa (1979, p. 214) to conclude in his summary

of empirical regularities in the foreign exchange market that "the interest

differential in favor of domestic currency bonds is equal approximately to the

expected rate of depreciation of domestic money in terms of foreign money."

      Recent studies, however, have been able to reject the speculative

efficiency hypothesis using longer data sets and more sophisticated

statistical techniques.26 In fact, they have provided such convincing

evidence against speculative efficiency that researchers have turned their

attention towards explaining deviations from uncovered interest parity in

terms of risk premia (while maintaining the hypothesis that the exchange

market is efficient).

Direct Evidence of Risk Premia

      If investors are risk averse, the expected returns on securities

denominated in different currencies will be separated by a risk premium which

is a function of the relative supplies of foreign and domestic securities,

domestic arid foreign wealth, and other factors.27 Investigators have searched

for evidence of this risk premia without success. Rogoff (19814), for example,

finds no evidence that the interest differential between U.S. and Canadian

bonds is sensitive to the relative supply of these bonds. (So he finds no

evidence that sterilized intervention in the Canadian dollar market, which

would alter the relative supplies of U.S. and Canadian dollar bonds, could

affect exchange rates). Other investigators have used more elaborate models

to £nvestigate risk premia, but have reached conclusions similar to those of

Rogoff.28

                                         -26-



 Interpreting the Conflicting Evidence

      The two sets of evidence from speculative efficiency and portfolio

balance studies seem to give conflicting results. The studies of speculative

efficiency suggest the importance of a time—varying risk premium, but the

portfolio balance studies are unable to explain that risk premium in terms of

relative asset supplies. There are at least three ways to reconcile this

evidence. First, an appeal can be made to market inefficiencies which would

account for the ex post interest differentials without appealing to a risk

premium. But to date no one has provided a convincing rationale for why

traders would fail to eliminate any perceived profit opportunities in the

foreign exchange market. Second, it may be the case that, even though a time-

varying risk premium is important in explaining interest differentials,

sterilized intervention (or any other change in relative bond supplies) has a

negligible effect on that risk premium. Third, existing empirical methods may

not be sophisticated enough to establish the effectiveness of sterilized

intervention. Unfortunately, there is no basis for choosing between these

last two alternatives. It is evident that the menu of' assets available to

investors is much larger than the choice between domestic and foreign bonds

modelled in many studies. Portfolio decisions, moreover, have an

intertemporal dimension in which consumption and investment decisions are made

simultaneously, in contrast to the static models that form the basis of

existing empirical estimates.29 It is unclear whether or not more

sophisticated empirical models, based on a larger menu of assets and

incorporating intertemporal decisions, would confirm or refute existing

empirical evidence. To date, however, there is no evidence that sterilized

intervention can affect exchange rates, at least through conventional

portfolio balance channels. On the basis of existing evidence, therefore, it



27. 18.2
                                     -27—



is difficult to justify using sterilized intervention to carry out exchange

rate policy.

     If sterilized intervention is ineffective, a second conclusion follows:

to pursue active exchange rate management, there is no substitute for monetary

policy. Monetary policy can be pursued either with traditional domestic

instruments or with non-sterilized foreign exchange intervention. Whether the

latter is called monetary policy or not is of little importance.

     Yet even if monetary policy is necessary for exchange rate management,

there is still a potential role for sterilized intervention if such

intervention provides a signal to the market about future monetary policy.

Because of the very nature of announcement effects, however, it is difficult

to find evidence of them using conventional statistical methods. Two

successive intervention operations of equal size may provide different signals

to the market, so they may have different effects on the exchange rate.

2.3. Two Episodes of Foreign Exchange Intervention

     Because statistical evidence leaves the question of announcement effects

unresolved, one might believe that the study of specific episodes of active

foreign exchange intervention might help to resolve this question. Such

episodes are difficult to interpret, but two particularly interesting are

singled out for study. These are the November 1, 1978, announcement of a

dollar defense package by the Carter Administration and the G—5 intervention

of September 1985.

1978 Dollar Defense Package

     This episode bolsters the Jurgensen Report's view that intervention can

have significant short term effects. But the ultimate failure of the defense

package, despite the fact that the U.S. authorities assembled $30 billion for

foreign exchange intervention, suggests that short term intervention packages



27.18.2
                                       -28-



 alone are not effective unless they are followed by longer term changes in

 monetary policy. The dollar defense package came at a time when the foreign

 exchange market was in disarray reflecting the growing loss of confidence in

 the policies of the Carter administration. In her in-depth study of this

 crisis, Margaret Greene (19814, p. 28), a senior official in the Federal

 Reserve Bank of New York, describes the market as follows: "During the last

 week of October, the selling of dollars reached near-panic proportions, and

 dollar rates plummeted to record lows against several major currencies."

 After the President announced an anti-inflation program on October 24, a

 program received by skepticism by the financial markets, the authorities sold

almost $1 billion equivalent of marks. Yet the dollar dropped against the

mark from DM1.81/$ to DM1.72/$ over the next four trading days.   Similarly,

the dollar dropped against the yen from 181/$ to 178/$.

     The package announced on November 1, in contrast to the anti-inflation

program, was an impressive one. First, monetary policy was tightened, with

the discount rate raised by an "unprecedented" 1 percentage point to a (then)

historic high of 9%. (Thus the package had an important monetary policy

component.) Second, a $30 billion package of foreign currency resources was

assembled for future intervention consisting of $15 billion in swaps with

foreign central banks, $5 billion in drawings on the IMF and sales of SDRs,

and $10 billion in so—called "Carter bonds", U.S. Treasury notes denominated

in marks and Swiss francs to be sold abroad.

     The market was obviously impressed with the scope of the package and the

resolve about future policy which it seemed to represent. By 9:13 a.m. on

November 1, the dollar had moved 7% above the previous day's low against the

mark to DM1.83/$.30 Within 23 minutes, the dollar had moved up another 1%

against the mark while the Desk sold the equivalent of $69 million marks, to



27.18.2
                                     -29—



SF1.5671$ while the Desk sold $19 million of Swiss francs, and to 1187.57$

with the Desk selling $5 million. As Figure 6 illustrates, by the time of the

closing in London the dollar had risen against the mark to DM1 .85/$ and

against the yen to 1186.51$. By the end of the (New York) day, the dollar had

risen to DM1 .879/$ and to 1187.9/$, up seven to ten percent from its lows of

the day before. The foreign exchange intervention undertaken by the Desk that

day amounted to a little more than $600 million, over two-thirds of it

consisting of intervention in the market for marks.

    The U.S. authorities, in cooperation with the Bundesbank, Swiss National

Bank, and Bank of Japan, had to intervene repeatedly in the following weeks as

the market tried to test official resolve. Figure 6 shows that the dollar

stabilized at around DM1.90/$ and 1190/$ through the first two weeks of

November, then rose somewhat more in the following two weeks. By the end of

November, U.S. intervention had totalled more than $3.5 billion. On

December 1, the spot rates for the dollar were DM1.9/$ and 1203.57$, both

rates being significantly above the October lows.

    This episode illustrates the effectiveness of monetary and exchange

market operations in halting a currency's slide. But it also illustrates the

limitations of such action if not followed up by more fundamental changes in

monetary policy and macroeconomic policy in general. The rise of the dollar

stalled in early December as market participants became skeptical again about

the Carter Administration's policies towards inflation. Then the dollar was

hit by the shock of an OPEC price increase of 114.5% following the political

upheavals in Iran. During the month of December, foreign exchange

intervention was almost as sizable as in November, totalling more than 3.1

billion. Yet no new monetary policy initiatives were taken. By the end of

the month the dollar had fallen to DM1 .828/$ and 1194.60/$. The short-run

impact of the November 1 package had faded, and the time afforded to make more

fundamental adjustments in policy had been squandered. As Greene summarized

the episode (19814, p. 140): "If this time is not put to productive use, then

intervention alone, no matter how large or how well coordinated, will not be

effective."

G-5 Intervention in September 1985

     The dollar rose through most of the four years of the first Reagan

Administration, peaking in February 1985. After falling from its February

highs during the following spring and summer, the dollar began to rally in

early September. That rally was cut short by the Group of Five (G-5) meeting

of finance ministers and central bank governors in New York on Sunday,

September 22. According to the G-5 statement issued at the end of' that day

(IMF Survey, October 7, 1985, p. 297):


          The Ministers and Governors agreed that exchange rates
     should play a role in adjusting external imbalances. In
     order to do this, exchange rates should better reflect
     fundamental economic conditions than has been the case. They
     believe that agreed policy actions must be implemented and
     reinforced to improve the fundamentals further, and that in
     view of the present and prospective changes in fundamentals,
     some further orderly appreciation of the main non-dollar
     currencies against the dollar is desirable. They stand ready
     to cooperate more closely to encourage this when to do so
     would be helpful. [Emphasis added.1

The statement had an immediate effect on exchange rates. As the Harris Bank

Foreign Exchange Weekly Review later remarked: "Foreign exchange traders were

taken by surprise, and the dollar dropped sharply following the announcement,

even before any official intervention occurred" (February 7, 1986, p. 1).    In


Figure 7, daily exchange rates for the yen are illustrated. The dollar fell

against the yen from 2140.1/$ to 231.7/$ by the close in London on Monday the

23rd. It fell further to 219.5/$ by Friday of that week. The dollar also

fell sharply against the mark from DM2.81414/$ on Friday September 22 to

DM2 .680/$ on the following Friday.

     There is a puzzle in this dramatic movement.       The exchange rates fell

despite the fact that interest differentials were virtually constant. In the

case of one month Eurocurrency deposits, for example, the interest

differential between dollar and yen deposits and between dollar and OH

deposits remained roughly constant throughout the week. Indeed, both
                                                                                  -



differentials remained constant until late October when the Japanese

authorities   tightened credit conditions in their market. The fall in spot

rates in the absence of interest rate movements may be due to pure

announcement effect of the G-5 communique.        That is, the exchange rates may

have moved primarily because the G-5 announcement signalled future changes in

policy rather than because of the foreign exchange intervention that followed
                                           is bolstered by the fact that, even
 the announcement. This interpretation
                                         following the G-5 announcement was not
 though foreign exchange intervention

 much greater than intervention in February and March of 1985, exchange rates

 moved much more after the G-5 announcement.31

      What did the G-5 announcement signal? The Bank for International

 Settlements Annual Report (1986, p. 1149) cited two factors. First, the joint

 communique gave a "convincing demonstration of unanimity and common policy

 resolve, and . .   . the   subsequent intervention operations were fully

 coordinated and had the wholehearted support of nearly all the major

 industrial countries represented." The fact that the policy actions were

 coordinated was said to be of crucial importance both because of the
                                                   operations and because there was
 potentially larger scale of any intervention
                                                of different countries would not be
 more of an assurance that the authorities
                                               G-5 statement marked a major change in
 working at cross purposes. Second, the

  U.S. policy which had shunned foreign exchange intervention since the

  beginning of the Reagan Administration. As the BIS describes it (1986, p.

   1149),


           ff]rom the point of view of credibility, it was of crucial
           importance that, for the first time, the US
                                                       authorities,
           whose capacity to sell dollars is in principle unlimited,
           were seen to recognize the need for a further downward
           adjustment of the dollar.

  Yet, given the evidence against sterilized
                                                   intervention, one must remain
  skeptical about whether either factor, international
                                                            coordination or the
  active participation of the United States, could have been decisive if the G-5

 countries had simply announced a series of sterilized intervention

 operations. Instead, the G—5 announcement may have moved exchange rates

 because the market believed either that the intervention would be monetized or

 that the intervention, even though sterilized, signalled future changes in

 monetary policy.

        In the case of the G-5 announcement, the evidence is unclear whether or

 not foreign exchange intervention was monetized. As indicated above, short

 term interest differentials between the dollar and the mark or yen remained

 constant from September 22 through most of October. The first unambiguous

sign of changes in monetary policy occurred in Japan in the last week of

October. The dollar had begun to rally somewhat, so the Japanese authorities

decided to tighten monetary conditions, sending short term interest rates from

6.5% to 8% in only a few days. As a result, the yen resumed its upward rise.

Comparison of These Two Episodes

      A comparison of these two episodes is quite instructive. The 1978

defense package bucked a downward trend of the dollar. If it had been the

signal for a fundamental change in U.S.
                                            monetary policy toward a more
restrictive stance, then the short term gains in strengthening the dollar in



27. 18.2
                                       —33—



November and December 1978 might have been consolidated and extended into 1979

and beyond. But since no such fundamental change was forthcoming, the dollar

resumed its downward trend. The G—5 intervention, in contrast, was clearly

reinforcing rather than bucking a trend. In fact, it is useful to ask whether

the G—5 announcement and actions that followed were on balance successful in

driving the dollar down relative to its previous trend.

     Figure 8 tries to answer that question by putting the period immediately

following this announcement into longer term perspective. This figure shows

the weekly movement of the yen from January through December 1985,

highlighting the G-5 announcement. The trend of the dollar against the yen is

downward throughout, but in the period immediately following the announcement

the dollar's fall accelerates. The same cannot be said of the dollar's fall

relative to the mark. It is true that the G-5 announcement halts a temporary

rise in the dollar, but it merely restores that mark to its previous trend.

These figures lend support to Martin Feldstein's (1986, p. 6) view that "for

Germany and other G5 countries, the Plaza (New York) meeting was essentially a

nonevent." Yet even if Feldstein is right about currencies other than the

yen, the G-5 period may provide evidence for announcement effects in the case

of the yen. Under one interpretation, the dollar fell relative to the yen

because the market perceived a greater degree of cooperation between Japan and

the United States than in the previous four years, and a willingness on the

part of the Japanese government to pursue a tighter monetary policy to drive

the yen down, a policy not actually put into effect until late October.

policy. If intervention is sterilized, in contrast, then its effects on the

exchange rate are thought to be minimal. The announcement of the intervention

may be the occasion for a rally in the exchange market, but perhaps only if

the market believes that the intervention signals broader changes in monetary

policy.

     Because the evidence implies that sterilized intervention is ineffective,

the remainder of the paper assumes that monetary policy, broadly defined to

encompass non-sterilized intervention, is the prime instrument of exchange

rate policy. The discussion now moves from the choice of' policy instruments

to the design of exchange rate policy.

     Exchange rate policy could take a variety of forms. Governments could

reestablish a system of fixed exchange rates, perhaps with wider bands to

accommodate greater variability of exchange rates. The fixed rates could be

confined to regional groupings of countries as in the European Monetary System

or encompass all industrial countries. Second, governments could retain the

present system of flexible exchange rates, but institute stricter rules

governing exchange rate management. Third, governments could establish a

system of target zones for exchange rates with "soft margins" which leave

governments with some discretion concerning intervention. All three

alternatives, which involve systemic changes in the international monetary

system, contrast sharply with ad hoc agreements like the G-5 intervention

which are designed to cope with specific exchange rate problems. The

following sections will explore these alternatives.


3. Putting Huinpty Dumpty Back Together Again: Restoring Fixed Exchange Rates

     This section analyzes the case for returning to fixed exchange rates.

The first part considers the general rationale for fixing exchange rates. The

next two parts ask what lessons can be learned from two fixed exchange rate

                                       -35-


systems, the Bretton Woods System which lasted until 1971 and the European
Monetary System established in 1979.

3.1 Rationale for fixed exchange rates

      Although many rationales have been offered in support of fixing exchange

rates, two are particularly prominent in most discussions. First, fixed

exchange rates help to neutralize financial disturbances which might otherwise

have an impact on the real side of the economy. Second, fixed rates provide

discipline to governments that might otherwise follow inflationary policies.

Each argument is considered in turn.

Sources of disturbances

      Economists analyzing exchange rate regimes have often posed the following

question: Would fixed or flexible exchange rates be preferable in the presence

of a particular disturbance?   Fixed exchange rates can be shown to be

superior when financial disturbances are predominant in an economy. A fall in

the demand for money, for example, can be neutralized by a reduction in its

supply leaving the exchange rate unaffected. If investors shift from domestic

money to foreign securities, this can be neutralized by intervention in the

foreign exchange market. In either case, the policy designed to keep the

exchange rate fixed also helps to keep the disturbances confined to the

financial sector, so that output and employment are left undisturbed. If

disturbances originate in the real sector of the economy, however, it is

difficult to make a case for preventing exchange rate movements since these

movements generally facilitate the adjustment of relative prices which real

disturbances require.32 A rise in demand for exports, for example, leads to

an appreciation of the domestic currency under flexible rates since the

increase in demand raises domestic interest rates and attracts capital from

abroad. The appreciation of the domestic currency, by shifting demand to



27. 18.2
                                      -36—



foreign goods, helps to dampen the rise in domestic demand.33 Thus fixed

exchange rates (or target zones for exchange rates to be discussed below) are

better designed for periods when financial disturbances are predominant.

      Most economists analyzing the desirability of foreign exchange

intervention have implicitly assumed that exchange rate fluctuations can be

traced directly to a particular disturbance or group of disturbances. The

case for foreign exchange intervention is much stronger if exchange rate

fluctuations instead reflect excessive volatility due to market

inefficiencies. If exchange rates are excessively volatile (as discussed in

Section 1), then fixed rates, or at least policies designed to limit exchange

rate fluctuations, may be called for even in economies where disturbances are

predominantly real in origin. Similarly, if exchange rates are driven by

speculative "bubbles," self-fulfilling expectations which depart from market

fundamentals, then exchange market intervention may be called for.

      In the present context of the misaligned dollar, this characterization of

real and financial disturbances takes a more specific form. As mentioned

above, many economists trace the appreciation of the dollar during the first

four years of the Reagan Administration to the expansionary fiscal policy of

that administration. This fiscal expansion represents a "real" disturbance

because the defense buildup has shifted expenditure towards U.S. domestic

goods (both traded and nontraded). Branson (1986) points out that the

appreciation of the dollar has moderated the effects of the fiscal expansion

on domestic output and prices by switching domestic and foreign private

consumption towards foreign goods. If that appreciation had been prevented

through the monetary expansion required to keep exchange rates fixed, then the

real appreciation of the dollar required for adjustment in the real sector

would have been brought about by a rise in the U.S. price level rather than by



27. 18.2
                                            -37—



  a nominal appreciation of the dollar.
                                             Branson suggests that higher U.S.
  prices would not have been preferable to
                                               the nominal appreciation and
  consequent fall in the inflation rate that did occur.

          If instead of being caused
                                  by the fiscal expansion, the dollar's recent
  rise had been due to a speculative bubble or to a more conventional
                                                                      type of
  financial disturbance, then the case for fixing the exchange rate would
                                                                          have
  been stronger.3 In the presence of financial disturbances, intervention
                                                                          to
  limit or halt the appreciation of the
                                            dollar would have helped to insulate the
 real sector from the disturbance.
                                         Presumably this intervention would have had
 to have been non-sterilized, in which
                                            case the intervention would have
 involved a significant change in
                                       monetary conditions. The question that has
 to be asked is whether governments
                                        are willing to tie their monetary policy to
 an exchange rate target in such circumstances.

 Discipline

      Proponents of fixed exchange rates often base their case on a second

 rationale: fixed rates impose discipline on national governments since

 inflationary policies soon run up against a balance of payments constraint.

 It is true that a government
                                 following inflationary policies under flexible
exchange rates must contend with the depreciation
                                                      of its currency, but that
same government under fixed exchange rates is
                                                   likely to have to contend with a
highly visible balance of payments crisis. If the crisis results in a

devaluation of the domestic
                               currency, that change in currency values is likely
to be much more politically
                               damaging than a gradual change in currency values

brought about "by the market." This discipline argument for fixed exchange

rates might appear to be a persuasive one, especially after more than a decade

of high inflation when governments were free to pursue "independent" monetary

policies under flexible rates.



27.18.2
                                      -38-



                                                        fixed rates is less than
     In practice, however, the discipline provided by

complete for the following reasons:

(1) First, fixed exchange rates exert no discipline over expansionary fiscal

     policies, at least as long as capital flows are highly sensitive to

     interest differentials. Higher government spending financed by either

     taxes or bond issues induces an inflow of capital and a balance of

     payments surplus rather than deficit.35

(2) Second, the fixed rate system as a whole has no external constraint

     unless currencies are tied to an external standard. If N-i currencies

     are tied to a reserve currency, as currencies were tied to the dollar

     under the Bretton Woods System, then there is discipline for the system

     as a whole only to the extent that the reserve currency country manages

      to discipline itseir.6 Under Bretton Woods, the United States main-

      tained a relatively stable price level throughout the 1950's and early

      1960's, but during the Vietnam War the Johnson and Nixon Administrations

      followed what were widely regarded as inflationary policies.

 (3) If, instead, all currencies are tied to a commodity like gold, then the

      increases of the world money supply are dependent on chance discoveries

      of' gold and can be affected by political instability in the producing

      countries. If the gold supply does not increase rapidly enough to keep

      pace with real activity, then either the world price level must fall

       (accompanied, most likely, by a fall in real activity) or banking systems

       must develop alternative means of payment (as happened in the last half

       of the nineteenth century). In times of crisis, moreover, governments

       are unlikely to adhere to the external standard, since the stability of

       their banking systems is likely to be regarded as more important than the

       credibility of their external standard. During several banking panics of



 27. 18 .2
                                          —39—



          the nineteenth century, even the Bank of England, the stalwart defender

          of the gold standard system, suspended gold payments in an attempt to

       stabilize its banking system.

  (4) Whether or not the U.S dollar (as the
                                                 Nth currency) is tied to an

      external standard, par values for all N currencies can be changed. Once

      a par value is changed, future commitments to a fixed rate system are

      less credible than before, so countries must weigh the benefits of a

      change in parity against the loss of credibility. A general lesson to be

      learned from past exchange rate systems is that governments will abandon

      fixed pegs, even if only temporarily, if exchange rate flexibility will

      help to ease the adjustment of their economies to a major shock. This

      was as true of Britain in the nineteenth
                                                  century, despite its pivotal
      role under the gold standard, as it was of France and later Britain in

      the interwar period, and a host of countries in the Bretton Woods

      period. If governments are likely to abandon pegs in a crisis, then it

      is necessary to ask what is the value of the discipline afforded by fixed

      rates. The answer must be that the value of the discipline is highly

     dependent on how participants in the financial markets assess the

     commitment of the government to the par value and the likelihood of

     shocks large enough to alter that commitment. So the discipline argument

     is less decisive than it appears to be.

3.2. Weaknesses of the Bretton Woods System

     The paper now turns to an assessment of the Bretton Woods System, the

fixed rate system which tied most currencies together during the post-war

period until 1971. After fifteen years of flexible exchange rates, many

observers look back longingly at this period. As already noted, the

macroeconomic performance under Bretton Woods compares favorably with that of



27.18.2
                                     _14Q_




the more recent period. Against this must be weighed some   of the inherent

weaknesses of the Bretton Woods System which observers of the time considered

major drawbacks of this fixed rate system.

Lack of Monetary Independence

     The Bretton Woods System was often criticized for providing no discipline

for the reserve currency country (for the reasons discussed above).   The

United States, in effect, was too free to pursue an independent monetary

policy to the detriment of the system as a whole. But an equally serious

weakness of the Bretton Woods System was the lack of monetary independence

afforded to other countries of the system. The Bretton Woods System imposed

such an extreme form of discipline on these countries that independent

monetary policies to deal with disturbances were severely handicapped.

     If one country tried to increase its money supply by increasing domestic

credit in the banking system, then this led to an incipient decline in

interest rates and an outflow of capital which offset, at least partially, the

initial increase in the money supply.37 This offsetting effect of capital

flows is characteristic of any fixed exchange rate system with internationally

mobile capital.

Capital Controls

      If capital flows offset domestic monetary expansions or contractions, one

solution is to restrict such flows with controls of one form or another. That

solution was adopted widely under the Bretton Woods System.   The recent period

of exchange rate flexibility, by no coincidence, has witnessed the progressive

dismantling of controls beginning with controls in Germany and the United

States in 197k, and Britain in 1978 and Japan in several stages beginning in

 1980. Of the major industrial countries during this period, Italy has

maintained and France has enhanced their controls, but that is because they



 27. 18.2
 have had to defend exchange rate parities within the European Monetary

 System.38

      The overall effectiveness of capital controls in stemming reserve flows

 is in some doubt since banks and other institutions go to some lengths to find

 ways to evade controls. But there is no doubt that controls distort

 investment and borrowing incentives as two episodes from the Bretton Woods

 period will illustrate.

 (1) The Kennedy and Johnson Administrations constructed progressively more

      complex barricades in an attempt to stem outflows of capital from the

     United States during the 1960s. In 1963, the Kennedy Administration

     began with an interest equalization tax on securities issued by

     foreigners in the U.S. market. The Johnson administration followed with

     its voluntary credit-restraint program in 1965 which limited the liquid

     foreign assets that U.S. banks and non-bank financial institutions could

     hold, and a direct investment program in that same year which compelled

     U.S. corporations to finance overseas operations with funds raised

     outside the United States. U.S. banks responded by expanding their

     operations in London and other foreign centers, in part to serve the U.S.

     corporations driven abroad for financing. With the arbitrage link

     between the United States and foreign financial centers severed, large

     interest differentials developed which reflected the distortionary

     effects of the controls. At one point in 1969, the three-month

     Eurodollar deposit rate rose to 11.5% at a time when U.S. Treasury bill

     rates were at 7.7% and U.S. certificate of deposit rates (because of the

     Federal Reserve's Regulation Q) remained fixed at 6%. Such remarkably

     large differentials distorted financing decisions by U.S. and foreign

     corporations. The controls also had the unintended effect of giving



27.18.2
                                    -)42-




    infant industry protection to the Eurodollar and Eurobond markets in

    London.

(2) Similar interest differentials developed between Germany and the

    Eurocurrency markets in response to a network of controls which the

    German authorities built beginning in 1971. The controls were

    progressively tightened in an attempt to close loopholes, finally

    extending to nearly all claims by non—residents to residents, until they

    were removed in early 19714. Figure 9 compares the internal German

     interest rate (on interbank loans) with the Euromark deposit rate (which

     is always approximately equal to the covered Eurodollar rate). The

    figure illustrates very clearly the effects of the controls which were

    designed to limit inflows rather than outflows of funds, and therefore

    led to a higher interest rate in Germany than in the market for mark

    deposits in London. At one point in early 1973, the differential between

     the internal and external markets reached the remarkably high level of

     11%. That is, an interbank loan in Germany carried an interest rate 11%

    higher than a mark-denominated loan, perhaps made by the same bank, in

     the Eurocurrency markets. With differentials that large, there is no

    doubt that considerable managerial effort was expended in finding ways to

    evade such controls.

    The U.S. and German controls were not isolated examples. In fact,

controls were the norm during the Bretton Woods period. As discussed below,

they are also a prevalent feature of the European Monetary System.

Exchange Rate Crises

     In the 1960's there was a tendency to blame private agents in the

financial markets for the "speculation" which brought on balance of payments

crises. Thus, for example, British Labor Government ministers characterized

speculators who took positions against the pound as the "Gnomes of Zurich".

More recently, however, international economists have formulated "balance of

payments crisis" models whose central actors are these same Gnomes, now

transformed into rational investors who speculate against governments. These

governments, in turn, blindly follow domestic credit expansions that are

unsustainable. The Gnomes help to accelerate the date of the crisis, a crisis

that is in any event inevitable, but otherwise act like responsible citizens.

     There is no doubt some truth in both views of balance of payments

crises. As politicians of the 1960s knew only too well, increased capital

mobility makes it more difficult for governments to sustain parities that are

under attack by speculators. But, on the other hand, the decision to change

parities is often dominated by political considerations because governments

have committed themselves to defending parities. When parity adjustments

justified by economic factors are postponed on political grounds, speculators

attempt to force the government's hand. The government may respond by

instituting restrictive macroeconomic policies simply to defend a parity

value, policies which under a flexible rate system it might be able to

avoid. Or it may attempt to shield its reserves from attack by restricting

capital movements. Jhether the government successfully defends the parity or

riot, the country loses. If the parity holds, the economy is disrupted by the

crisis and by the policies which have been adopted to defend the parity. If

the parity collapses, speculators win capital gains at the expense of the

central bank. We illustrate several of these features of exchange rate crises

by describing the sterling crisis of the mid—1960's.

The Sterling Crisis

     This crisis began building at the time when Harold Wilson's Labor

Government came to power in October ig6'4. The Wilson Government chose riot



27.18.2

   to devalue at that time despite
                                  a strong economic case that devaluation would
   help restore British competitiveness. One
                                             prominent reason given for the
  decision was the Government's fear
                                           that it would be identified as the

  it was in power. (This is a good example of the discipline
                                                             provided by a
  fixed rate system, although in this case the discipline
                                                          postponed needed
  adjustments).

           Having made the decision not to
                                             devalue, the Government had to face a
  series of balance of payments crises
                                             beginning soon after attaining office
  when it had to arrange a $3    billion   international credit from foreign central
 banks. (This was at a time when British
                                                bank reserves totalled only $2.6
 billion and the monetary base $9.1 billion). The Government managed to

 surmount each crisis, in part by arranging foreign central bank financing but

 also by instituting restrictive
                                     macroeconomic policies, until the fall of 1967
 when the speculative pressure became overwhelming. On the final day before

 devaluation, Friday November 17, British foreign exchange reserves fell by $1

 billion (in a country where capital controls were as tight as anywhere in

 Western Europe) (Solomon, 1977, p. 95). The next day sterling was devalued by

 11L3%. Not only did the Government have to succumb to the pressures of

foreign exchange speculation, but in doing so it lost over £350 million as a

result of intervention in the forward markets.

      In his assessment of the
                                  sterling crisis, Robert Solomon, a former senior
adviser at the Federal Reserve
                                   Board, points out two lessons of the sterling
crisis:

     It exhibited the potential for, and the impact of,
     speculative flows in the accounts of a major trading
     country          It pointed up the weakness of an exchange
     rate system in which a change of parity of a major currency
     became a political issues of the highest order that engaged
     heads of' state; in such a system a change in the exchange

    rate could be excessively delayed, permitting the build-up of
    a large imbalance which, when action was finally taken to
    correct it, required massive shifts of resources.

These same two lessons were consistent themes in the exchange rate crises of

the Bretton Woods system until its demise in 1971.

     These weaknesses of the Bretton Woods System turned opinion sharply

against fixed exchange rates, especially after the failure of the Smithsonian

Accord of' December 1971 (to be discussed below). It was only after a near

decade of floating that sentiment turned back against flexible rates, at least

in Western Europe where the European Monetary System was established in 1979.

3.3. The European Monetary System

     The European Monetary System (or EMS) was established on March 13, 1979

to tie together the currencies of member countries in a joint float against

the dollar and other foreign currencies. The initial membership of the EMS

consisted of all European Community members except the United Kingdom which

elected to float freely.1 All members except Italy agreed to limit

fluctuations of their currencies to 2% around a grid of central rates; Italy

adopted a 6% margin. As stated by the European Council in its Resolution of

December 1978, the main objective of the EMS was to create a "zone of

stability in Europe." The following evaluation of the EMS's success in

achieving this objective is based primarily on an excellent statistical

analysis by Rogoff (1985).142

 Reducing the Variability of Exchange Rates

      This   section begins by examining the success of the EMS in reducing the
 variability of exchange rates. There is evidence that the variability of
 bilateral   exchange rates has been significantly reduced in the EMS. Rogoff

 measures exchange rate variability by the variances of unanticipated changes

 in exchange rates.3 For both nominal and real bilateral rates, the variances



 27.18.2
                                              -4 6-




    have fallen for exchange rates
                                   between the mark and the other two major
    currencies, the French franc and
                                          lira. In the case of the nominal franc/DM
    rate, the variance of
                             monthly prediction errors has
                                                                fallen by two-thirds,
    while in the case of the
                               nominal lira/DM rate, the reduction has been by
   almost four-fifths      The results for real
                                                      exchange rates are less
                                                                                dramatic,
   but still statistically
                           significant. This is for a period when bilateral
   rates between the mark and dollar or yen were
                                                 becoming more, not less,
   volatile.

           Countries in the EMS,
                                   however, should be Concerned about the variability
  of effective
                  exchange rates as well as EMS
                                                      bilateral rates. There is some
  reason to believe that the
                                   stability of intra—EMS bilateral rates is purchased
  at the price of greater
                             variability in exchange rates between EMS currencies
  and those of other
                        countries, so the EMS may not have
                                                                stabilized effective
  exchange rates. Rogoff shows that among the three
                                                    major EMS currencies,
  only the lira has experienced
                                     a reduction in volatility for its nominal

 effective exchange rate. A similar pattern
                                            emerges for the real effective
 exchange rate, with the lira
                               being the only currency among the three to
 experience a significant reduction
                                     in volatility. it should be pointed out
 that countries outside the
                            EMS, including the United States, United Kingdom,
and Japan, experienced
                        statistically significant increases in the volatility
of real effective
                   rates, so the EMS may have
                                              helped to prevent the volatility
of EMS currencies from
                        rising even in the case of the franc and mark.
Role of Capital Controls

      Another set of evidence, also due to Rogoff, provides
                                                                    an interesting
perspective on how the EMS works,
                                         Rogoff examined real interest differentials
within the EMS, If most
                         disturbances are financial in nature, then foreign
exchange intervention that stabilizes
                                      exchange rates should also stabilize

of them favorable to the EMS. First, disturbances may have been primarily

                                      the discussion of intervention policy
within the EMS is undesirable (see

Thus we have in the EMS an exchange rate system which has managed to stabilize

bilateral exchange rates within Europe, but only by severely limiting capital

flows between the countries of the EMS. Perhaps that is the only way to

maintain fixed exchange rates in today's environment.

Other Features of the EMS

     One reason that capital controls are so essential to the EMS is that the

system has failed to bring about the convergence of inflation rates among its

members, a key objective of the EMS.17 Rogoff compares five year average

inflation rates before and after the establishment of the EMS. He reaches the

surprising conclusion that any convergence of inflation rates that did take

place was between the inflation rates of Germany and two outside countries,

Japan and the United Kingdom.

     Because inflation rates have been so divergent, frequent parity changes

have been necessary among EMS currencies. There have been eleven realignments

since the inception of the EMS. The franc-DM parity alone has been changed

six times, the latest realignment being in January 1987, for a cumulative

depreciation of the franc relative to the mark of over 27 percent. Similarly,

 the lira-DM parity has been changed seven times for a cumulative depreciation

 of the lira of over 38 percent.

      Some of the realignments have been quite large.   The latest realignment

 on January 12, 1987, involved a revaluation of the mark and guilder by only

 three percent and the Belgian franc by two percent.    But the April 1986

 realignment lowered the franc relative to the mark by 6 percent, while in July

 1985 the lira was devalued 7.8 percent against all other EMS currencies and in

 April 1986 fell 3 percent more relative to the mark and guilder when those

 currencies revalued by 3 percent. The frequency and magnitude of' these

 realignments    suggests how difficult it is to maintain a fixed rate system

 today.


 4. Managed Floating

      The alternative to fixed exchange rates would seem to be flexible

 exchange rates, but there are many shades of gray in between these two

extremes. Present exchange rate arrangements are usually referred to as a

system of managed flexibility. There are very few rules to this system, if

indeed the term "system" is appropriate to a laissez-faire world. In its 1978

amendments to its Articles of Agreement, the International Monetary Fund did

specify certain guidelines for exchange rate intervention. This section

begins by examining these guidelines, then turns to several more specific

rules for managed floating which have been proposed. Very different from

these rules are the taxes on exchange market transactions to be considered

next. Finally, "target zones" for exchange rates are analyzed in some detail

because they have received so much attention recently.

4.1. Alternative Approaches to Managing Exchange Rates

     In the 1978 amendment to its Articles of Agreement, the IMF specified

three principles that should govern exchange rate policies:

Principle' A: A member shall avoid manipulating exchange rates or the

                international monetary system in order to prevent effective

                balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive

                advantage over other members.

Principle B: P. member should intervene in the exchange market if necessary to

                counter disruptive conditions which may be characterized inter

             alia by disruptive short-term movements in the exchange value of

                its currency.




27.18.2
                                     -50—



Principle C: Members should take into account in their intervention policies

            the interests of other members, including those of the countries

             in whose currencies they intervene. (IMF Survey, May 2, 1977).

     It is not easy for a group of governments with different agendas to

achieve agreement on a set of policy rules. So it may not be surprising that

the principles adopted in this agreement are not specific enough to be binding

on any government. Unless there are objective criteria for determining

whether or not a country is "manipulating" its exchange rate to gain unfair

competitive advantages, for example, Principle A may not prevent such

behavior. Even the definition of' "disruptive short-term movements" may prove

elusive once it is recognized that exchange rates naturally exhibit high

volatility. To ensure that these principles are carried out, some have

proposed more specific rules of exchange rate management.

Minimal Reform: The "Reference Rate" Proposal

     One of' the most interesting proposals was that made by Wilfred Ethier and

Arthur Bloomfield (1975) in the Princeton Essay series. These economists,

writing soon after the breakdown of Bretton Woods, recognized that a return to

fixed exchange rates, whether desirable or not, was simply not feasible. So

instead of' specifying rules that mandated central bank intervention as had

been done in the Bretton Woods System, they proposed rules that prohibited

certain types of central bank actions. But unlike the IMF Principles later

adopted, they offered objective criteria for evaluating central bank adherence

to rules. The "reference rate" proposal which they formulated had two rules

(Ethier and Bloomfield, 1975, p. 10):

1.   No central bank shall sell its own currency at a price below its
     reference rate by more than a fixed percentage (possibly zero) or buy its
     own currency at a price exceeding its reference rate by more than a fixed
     percentage. This is the sole restriction imposed upon central-bank
     intervention.



27.18.2
                                     —51-



2.   The structure of reference rates shall be revised at periodic pre—
     specified intervals through some defined international procedure.

The aim of the first rule was to prohibit a central bank from driving its

currency away from its reference level (thereby "manipulating" its exchange

rate in the language of the IMF's Principle A). For example, a central bank

could not drive its currency down to gain, competitive advantage for its export

industry.   At the same time, the proposal did not oblige the central bank to

intervene at all. (It is in this sense a "minimal reform" proposal). Nor did

the proposal prevent the central bank from "leaning against the wind" to limit

movements away from the reference rate.

     The authors recognized that their proposal was limited in aim, but it did

provide a means to limit the type of competitive depreciations that had

plagued countries during the 1930's. In order for this proposal to be

successfully implemented, however, countries would have to agree on the

reference rates themselves "through some defined international procedure"

(their second rule). The discussion of target zones below identifies some of

the formidable problems involved in defining equilibrium exchange rates.      It

also points out how difficult it would be for different national governments

to agree on equilibrium rates. Both of those problems carry over to any

agreement' on reference rates.

Rules for Leaning Against the Wind

     Because volatility itself is viewed as a major problem by some

governments, policies of "leaning against the wind" have become common. Such

policies are designed to limit the "disruptive short—term movements" addressed

by the IMF's Principle B. This form of intervention requires minimal

knowledge of what factors may be moving the exchange rate, and does not

require that the authorities have superior knowledge about the long run

equilibrium exchange rate.   It does presuppose that exchange rates are too


27.18.2
                                       -52-



volatile in general, and that intervention operations can be effective in

reducing this volatility.

     There is a danger, however, that central banks might lean against the

wind more in one direction than the other, thus imparting a bias to exchange

rate movements over time. To ensure against "manipulating" exchange rates in

this way, central banks could be required to balance out their net purchases

and sales of foreign exchange over a given period. Argy (1982, p. 27) cites

one rule that "[n]et reserve changes in a given direction should not persist

for more than a few consecutive months (except when reserve levels are

excessive or deficient)." Argy, however, goes on to argue that such rules

would be difficult to implement, and might even provoke one-way speculation.

     If governments wish to limit exchange rate volatility, there is a non—

market alternative to foreign exchange intervention. This involves imposing a

tax on exchange market transactions.

Tobin's Exchange Market Tax

     This tax, proposed by James Tobin (1982), is imposed on each exchange

market transaction at a uniform rate, perhaps 1%. The tax has the explicit

aim of "throw[ing] some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient

international money market" (Tobin, 1982, p. 89). According to Tobin, a tax

of this magnitude is unlikely to make much difference to merchandise trade

transactions, since the tax represents such a small proportion of the value of

the product and the profit on the transaction. But such a tax is likely to be

a much more significant factor in a round trip financial transaction, thus

discouraging "hot money flows." It would make overnight or one month

roundtrip investments in foreign currencies almost prohibitively expensive.

Even in the case of a three month investment, a 1% tax paid twice in the




27.18.2
                                      -53—




roundtrip   transaction could be overcome only by an 8% differential between

interest rates in the two currencies involved.

     For a tax of this nature to be successful, it must be uniformly imposed

throughout the world, for otherwise financial transactions will gravitate to

tax-free zones. The experience of U.S. controls in the 1960's illustrates

that point. If such a tax were somehow internationally coordinated, however,

it is likely to have a significant impact on the volume of foreign exchange

transactions, especially those associated with short term investments. For

that reason, the tax may reduce the volatility of exchange rates. But such a

tax is unlikely to have a significant effect on the misalignment of exchange

rates because longer term investments and trade transactions would remain

largely unaffected. William Poole has drawn an analogy between Tobin's tax

and a real estate transfer tax.8 The latter may reduce the volatility of

real estate prices, but surely does not affect the longer run level of

prices. Nor would it prevent a speculative bubble from developing.

     Like the exchange market tax, the reform proposals governing intervention

outlined above offer no solution to the misalignment problem. They provide

"rules of the game" for managed floating, but they provide little positive

guidance for exchange rate policy. The first rule of the reference rate

proposal does prohibit central banks from deliberately creating a misalignment

through exchange market intervention, but none of the major misalignments

experienced recently have been caused by central bank intervention. None of

the rules prohibit other macroeconomic policies that can lead to

misalignment. Nor do they require that central banks take positive action to

prevent misalignments from developing. The paper will consider one type of

reform proposal, "target zones," which does address the misalignment




27.18.2
                                        -54-



problem. Since this proposal has received much attention recently, its

characteristics will be described in some detail.

4.2. Targets Zones for Exchange Rates

     In the Bretton Woods System of fixed exchange rates, the national

authorities were committed to intervening in the foreign exchange market

whenever the exchange rate reached a 1% "band" on either side of its par value

vis—a—vis the dollar. A "target zone" system of exchange rates also has bands

for the exchange rate, but these bands are typically much further apart, thus

allowing considerable fluctuation in the exchange rate.    More importantly, in

a target zone system the authorities make no firm commitment to defend those

margins. One of the leading advocates of target zones, John Williamson, has

described the zone as "a range beyond which the authorities are unhappy to see

the rate move, despite not being prepared to precommit themselves to prevent

such movements" (Williamson, 1985, p. 64).

Williamson's Proposal for Target Zones

     Given Williamson's central role in the debate over target zones, it is

useful to spell out his proposal more fully.49 His target zones would involve

five elements (Williamson, 1985, 72):

(1) soft margins, rather than a commitment to prevent the rate from straying

     outside the target zone;

(2) a zone perhaps 20 percent wide (i.e., with 10 percent margins), outside

     of which rates would be considered 'clearly wrong';

(3) a crawling zone, with the crawl reflecting both differential inflation

     and any need for balance of payments adjustment;

(4) publication of the target zone; and

 (5) the partial direction of monetary policy,
                                                     including foreign exchange

       intervention, to discourage the exchange rate from straying outside its

       target zone.

 The target zone system thus would be a form of managed float with the targets

 well defined but with national authorities only tentatively committed to

 intervention or other policy actions.

 Anatomy of Target Zones

      Target zones share some of the characteristics of fixed exchange
                                                                            rates,
 but there are important differences which may be the source of both strengths

and weaknesses for this proposed system. The paper next examines some of

system's crucial characteristics, then addresses the question of how targets

might be chosen.

(1) Wide Bands

      With margins permitting fluctuations of twenty percent, this system is

not designed to limit the volatility of exchange rates. Thus hedging by

corporations will be as important as in a flexible regime. But if the targets

are adhered to and the margins hold, then the system can be regarded as a way

of avoiding misalignments.

      The wide margins permit those abrupt shifts in speculative sentiment

which appear to characterize flexible regimes. Nonetheless, exchange rate

crises cannot be ruled out, at least when exchange rates approach the margins.

(2) Analogy with National Monetary Targets

      Zones are more akin to national monetary targets than exchange rate

parities under the Bretton Woods System.        Like monetary growth targets,

target zones for exchange rates single out one economic variable for special

attention without firmly precommitting the national authorities to achieving a

specific target for that variable.



27. 18.2
                                     —56—




     Yet there are important differences between monetary growth targets and

target zones for exchange rates. First, unlike the money growth targets, the

target zones provide no continuous guide for policy since the targets are

binding only when the exchange rate reaches one of its margins. It is true

that in some countries monetary growth targets are set in terms of bands, but

these bands are usually much narrower than those proposed for exchange rate

targets. Second, the variable targetted, the exchange rate, is an endogenous

variable which is normally determined by many factors other than economic

policy.   It is true that the money supply is also an endogenous variable

affected by both bank and nonbank behavior, but the authorities have more

direct control over the money supply than the exchange rate.

(3) Anchor for System?

     One of the advantages of a fixed rate system is the anchor such a system

provides for inflationary expectations. Target zones provide no such anchor,

since the zones are explicitly adjusted for differences in inflation rates.

The zones may help to anchor expectations regarding real exchange rates, but

only if governments are perceived as being willing to defend the margins.

(14) Commitment to Defend Margins.

     Despite the wide margins around the targets, governments will eventually

be faced with the choice between defending the targets or changing them.

Economists advising a government faced with a speculative attack are likely to

advocate defending the targets only if they view exchange rate movements as

part of the problem. (Recall the discussion of economic disturbances in the

previous section where exchange rates movements sometimes facilitated, rather

than hindered, the adjustment of the economy). Given a permanent shift in the

demand for a country's exports, for example, the government would be well

   advised to change the
                            exchange rate target rather than defend it. But if the
   change is temporary, then defense of
                                             the target might be warranted.
   (5) The Political Economy of Target Zones

          The rationale for target
                                     zones is very different if governments are
  viewed as the principal source of economic disturbances.
                                                                  Target zones then
  might have a political rather than
                                           economic role to play in stabilization.
  Proponents of target zones argue that announced exchange rate
                                                                      targets might
  constrain governments in their
                                     macroeconomic policies, much like multilateral
  tariff agreements constrain national trade policies.

          In the specific context of the
                                           dollar's misalignment, it is argued that
  target zones might have
                            encouraged the Reagan Administration to follow a less
 expansionary fiscal policy. This may be a difficult argument to
                                                                        sustain,
 however, since in order to pursue its
                                             fiscal policy, the Administration
 overcame much stronger domestic
                                     constraints than any international agreement
 could have imposed.

      A better case for the political role of target zones
                                                           can be made in the
 European context. A frequent argument in favor of the European
                                                                      Monetary
 System is that it constrains member
                                         countries to pursue policies closely in
 line with, its largest member, West Germany. The Mitterand
                                                            Government in
France, for example, stayed within the EMS despite being severely
                                                                  Constrained
at times by the requirements of
                                membership. One major exception to this
European pattern is the United Kingdom
                                            which has rejected joining the EMS
exchange rate arrangements in favor of free floating of the pound sterling.

     Perhaps the best that can be said for
                                                this political justification for
target zones is that it may be relevant
                                             to governments predisposed to the
constraints or strongly committed to regional or global cooperation. For

governments aiming to pursue policies

become a major impediment to such policies.

  Defining Exchange Rate Targets

          If economic conditions are
                                       favorable, governments might be willing to
  precommit themselves to a system of target zones. But formidable problems

  await the negotiators of such an
                                        agreement. Chief among these problems is
  that of finding (and agreeing upon) appropriate targets.
                                                                   It is useful to
  follow Williamson's description of how targets might be defined:

  (1) The first step in defining
                                       a target rate or target zone for the real
      exchange rate is to decide about the
                                                   appropriate equilibrium current
      account balance of each country (or
                                               equivalently, the "underlying capital
      flow' in Williamson's terminology since
                                                     the capital account must be the
      mirror image of the current account). The equilibrium current account of

      a developing country like Brazil or Thailand is very different from that

      of an industrial country like Germany or France. In estimates of his

      "fundamental equilibrium exchange rate," Williamson makes explicit

      allowances for such differences among countries. This is not to say that

      judgments about equilibrium current accounts are easy to make, as the

      experience of the Smithsonian meeting discussed below makes clear. Not

      least of the problems is that the negotiating governments will understand

     the close connection between the current account "equilibrium" agreed

     upon and the prospects for their leading export industries.

(2) Once figures for equilibrium current accounts are agreed upon, then real

     exchange rates consistent with them can be calculated using a trade model

     with its associated trade elasticities. To do so, it is first necessary

     to adjust the current account for cyclical factors, then to calculate the

     discrepancy between the equilibrium current account and the cyclically

     adjusted current account for a particular year. The trade model is then

     used to calculate the change in real exchange rates necessary to



27.18.2
                                    -60-.




    equilibrate the current account.51 Since estimates of price elasticities

    range widely, this step in the calculation is fraught with

    difficulties. Cutting the elasticities in half, for example, requires

     twice as large a change in real exchange rates to achieve equilibrium.

(3) The calculations so far only determine the equilibrium real exchange rate

     in a single year. It is then necessary to adjust that rate for real

     disturbances that occur through time. Among such real disturbances are

     the oil price shocks experienced twice during the 1970s, natural resource

     discoveries (such as North Sea oil for Britain), secular movements in

     demand, and secular movements in supply, including differential

     productivity growth rates. One issue that arises is whether to take into

     account changes in government policy if such changes are not just

     temporary measures but last for a number of years. In his study of

     exchange rates, Williamson explicitly
                                             excludes the shift in U.S. fiscal

     policy under the Reagan Administration because it is not sustainable in

     the long run. He also excludes variations in demand or supply over the

     business cycle from whatever source.
                                                                  be made.
     Most of these adjustments require that arbitrary judgments

Recall how difficult it was for analysts to evaluate the effects of the first

OPEC price increase in 1973. Even the effects of productivity growth are

difficult to assess. To illustrate some of the difficulties involved in

determining equilibrium rates, the next section examines the Smithsonian

 greement of exchange rates, an agreement reached by the major industrial

 countries in December 1971.

  Multilateral Agreement on Exchange Rates: the Smithsonian Accord

          The Smithsonian Agreement provides one of the few examples of a

  multilateral exchange rate agreement, but the lessons to be learned from
                                                                           this
  agreement are none too encouraging about
                                             exchange rate agreements in general.
          First, the agreement was reached only after
                                                        prolonged and sometimes
 acrimonious negotiations stretching through the fall of 1971. One of the

  reasons why the negotiations were so difficult was that the objectives of the

 participants were inconsistent with one another, which is not surprising given

 the pivotal role played by exchange rates in each economy. The U.S.

 Administration wanted to achieve a turnabout of $13 billion in its current

 account through the realignment of currencies.
                                                    The other major countries of
 the OECD envisaged, when their individual
                                              estimates were summed, a reduction
 of their current balances of
                                 only $3 billion (Solomon, p. 199). That an
 agreement was at all possible in these circumstances
                                                           is probably attributable
 to the heavy-handed actions of the Nixon
                                            Administration. In August 1971 that
 administration imposed import surcharge of ten percent in lieu of an agreement

 to realign the major currencies.

      Second, the agreement set new exchange rates that were simply

unsustainable in the long run, despite President Nixon's characterization of

the accord as the "most significant
                                       monetary agreement in the history of the
world" (New York Times, December 19, 1971, p. 1). It is interesting to

compare the rates agreed upon at the Smithsonian meeting with those prevailing

a little over a year later after the Agreement had broken down and most rates

were allowed to float. Table 5 presents the central
                                                          rates agreed upon at the
Smithsonian meeting as well as the market exchange rates prevailing in the

second quarter of 1973. The market rates diverge from the Smithsonian central

rates by more than ten percent in three out of four instances, with the dollar

                                                          inflation rates during
   the interim period. (Wholesale prices in manufacturing
                                                            are used to adjust the
   central rates.) In the case of the yen and pound, the
                                                          market rates deviate
  more from the adjusted central
                                  rates than from the
                                                      original central rates; for
  the other two

                                                smaller, but are still about ten
  percent off the mark. Thus
                              an agreement reached only after
                                                               prolonged
  negotiations resulted in an
                              exchange rate realignment that did not go far
  enough in lowering the value of the dollar.

       Some advocates of target
                                zones acknowledge the economic arguments against
 such a system, but nonetheless
                                 contend that targets have a role to play in
 fostering international economic
                                   cooperation. They argue that an agreement on
 target zones at least commits
                               governments to regular consultations on exchange
market developments    Even such regular
                                          consultations, however, may not induce
governments to limit the divergences
                                      in macroeconomic policies that cause many
misalignments. And if they do
                                not, then this argument for targets loses much
of its force.

     analysis of foreign exchange intervention policy above suggests that




     27. 18.2
  intervention would have to be non-sterilized, so active intervention would

  require a compromise of monetary targets.

          If misalignment is the most important problem, then the search for an

  ideal exchange rate policy may be too narrowly focused to be effective. A

  major source of misalignment in the last ten years has been the macroeconomic

  policies pursued by countries like the United States and Britain. It is not

  at all clear that the solution to
                                      major policy imbalances among the industrial
 countries lies in limiting exchange rate movements rather than changing the

 policies themselves.

      The adoption of target zones for exchange rates, on the other hand,
                                                                          may
 have a useful role to play in inducing
                                        governments to modify their policies.
 At the very least, the breaching of target zones may call attention to the

 need for international consultations
                                        on macroeconomic policies. Whether
 target zones would be any more successful than the IMF agreements remains to

 be proven.

      The Jurgensen Report concluded that exchange rate policy must consist of

 more than (sterilized) intervention to be successful.    Countries must be
willing to commit their macroeconomic policies to
                                                     controlling exchange
rates. In many circumstances, governments may find that limiting exchange

rate variability is not worth this price.

the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a Research Associate
at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He would like to thank William
Branson, Martin Feldstein, Dale Henderson, and Richard Herring for helpful
comments on an earlier draft.

     The passages are from Paris, 1937, p. 166, and Harrod, 1951, pp. 582—814.

     2Productivity tends to rise in recovery periods, so the recent rise in
productivity in these two countries may be partly a cyclical phenomenon.

     3Later sections discuss how measures of misalignment take into account
real economic shocks (which usually require departures of exchange rates from
relative price trends).

        useful survey of this literature is Frenkel and Mussa (19814).

     5Kenen and Rodrik (19814) show that other measures of volatility give
roughly similar results.

     6Similar results are obtained for earlier periods by Frenkel and Mussa
(1980) and Bergstrand (1983).

     71f Rt measures the real exchange rate of the dollar relative to the

pound sterling, for example, then a rise in Rt reflects either a rise in U.S.
relative to British prices (i.e.,       rises) or a fall in the dollar price
of the pound (Xt falls reflecting a depreciation of the pound). In either
case, a rise in Rt reflects a loss of competitiveness for U.S. exports.

     8Notice how much less variable the effective exchange rates, which
represent a diversified basket of currencies, are compared with the bilateral
rates (whether nominal or real).

     9just because most movements in an exchange rate are unforecastable does
not imply that the exchange rate is excessively volatile, although companies
engaged in international trade may regard the volatility as too high,
Instead, the volatility of an exchange rate is "excessive" if it exceeds that
of the factors which determine it.

      10Meese and Rogoff (1983) examine the out-of-sample performance of
 several well—known models of the exchange rate, and conclude that a random
 walk model performs as well as any of these models.

      William5on'S concept of the "underlying capital flow" is linked to
 current account targets (as discussed below in the section on "Defining
 Exchange Rate Targets").

           is interesting to note that while the yen was more volatile than the
 dollar during the period 1973-85, the misalignmeflts of the dollar were larger
 than those of the yen. This underscores the need to carefully distinquish
 between the two concepts.

  (maintaining unrealistic parities) rather than from market forces under
  flexible rates. Like most economists
                                        at that time, Johnson did not foresee
  the large misalignments that were to occur under flexible rates.

 proportion of the appreciation to North Sea oil.

 rates based on general price indexes (which contain nontraded as well as
 traded goods) provide a less reliable index of relative competitiveness than
 real exchange rates based on manufacturing prices alone. For further
 discussion, see Marston (1986). For a discussion of the relative merits of
 value added deflators and unit labor costs as measures of international
 competitiveness, see Artus (1978).

than the balance of payments figures
                                     widely quoted in the press, but are more
relevant for determining the effects of the misalignment on output and
employment.

     22Sterilized intervention
                               effectively consists of swapping foreign bonds
for domestic bonds, although the operation has several steps to it. Recall
that central banks typically hold
                                  foreign exchange reserves in the form of
interest—bearing, foreign currency-denominated securities. When a central
bank wants to intervene in the exchange market, it first sells the foreign
securities, then uses the foreign currency so obtained to buy domestic
currency from the private sector. If the intervention is to be
                                                                sterilized,
the sale of foreign currency is followed by an expansionary open market
operation (or an analogous monetary operation in different institutional
environments) involving the purchase of domestic bonds with the recently
acquired domestic currency, thus restoring the monetary base to its initial

     26Hansen and Hodrick (1980), for example, adopt a generalized least
squares estimating procedure so that they can utilize overlapping
observations, thus making it possible to use weekly data rather than the
monthly or quarterly data typically employed in the past. Cumby and Obstfeld
(19814) also use weekly data but adopt techniques to take into account the non-
stationarity of the foreign exchange data. These studies and others that have
followed are able to reject decisively the joint hypothesis of market
efficiency and uncovered interest parity. Levich (1985) provides a
comprehensive survey of recent studies.

 1985 (BIS 1986, p. 1)49).

 effects of aggregate supply disturbances on the exchange rate, however, are
 ambiguous since an increase in aggregate supply lowers prices at the same time
 that output expands (so nominal output, and hence the demand for transactions
 balances, may rise or fall).

 dollar's appreciation are Krugrnan (1985) and Frankel and Froot (1986).

      351f a government pursues an expansionary fiscal policy
                                                              indefinitely,
 then eventually foreign investors will balk at further exposure to Political
 risk. But until that point is reached, a country is free to expand through
 fiscal means.

           the reserve currency country follows an expansionary monetary
 policy, the resulting balance of payments deficits are
                                                        automatically financed,
 since the country gaining reserves invests them in the securities of the
 reserve currency country. The monetary base of the reserve currency country,
 moreover, does not decline as a result of the deficit as long as other
 countries choose to hold their foreign exchange reserves in the form of
 securities rather than the monetary base of the
                                                 reserve currency country.
 McKinnon (1974) has proposed that all foreign currency reserves be held in the
 form of central bank balances (bearing a market interest rate). If this were
 the case, foreign exchange intervention would affect the monetary bases of
 both reserve and non-reserve currency countries alike.

      If domestic and foreign securities are perfect sLthstituteS, the

 succeeds only to the extent that this one country manages to increase the
 money supply of the entire system. (The system would be like a set of
 reservoirs connected by open channels; an attempt to increase the water level
 in one would succeed only to the extent that the water levels of all were
 increased). Formal models of the offset phenomenon are presented in Kouri and
 Porter (197L) and Herring and Marston (1977).

theoretical models of exchange rate unions.

     U6The controls also lead to asymmetric responses of EMS currencies to
outside disturbances, since among the three most important EMS currencies only
the mark has open capital markets. When there is speculative pressure
involving the dollar, for example, the mark takes the brunt of this pressure,
thus causing strains within the EMS. See Marston (1984).

     7As Jacques van Ypersele, one of the architects of the EMS, has
described it: "The objective was indeed that external stability be the result
less of artificially imposed constraints than of a convergence of economic
trends among member countries, in particular of prices and costs" (Ypersele,
1984, p. 15).

     8See Brainard and Perry, 1986, "Symposium on exchange rates, trade and
capital flows," p. 23LL Another tax that has been proposed by Leviatan (1980)
is the "real interest rate equalization tax." This tax, by creating a wedge
between domestic and foreign interest rates, tries to reduce the incentive for
outflows (or inflows) of capital when a country abruptly changes its monetary
policy. A country trying to stabilize its price level through monetary
contraction, for example, would ordinarily have to contend with an
appreciation caused by an inflow of capital. By creating a wedge between
domestic and foreign returns, however, a country might be able to dampen the
currency appreciation. Such a tax is probably best thought of as a supplement
to national monetary policies, to be used when one country's policies depart
sharply from those of other countries.

     49Earlier advocates of targets for exchange rates include the "Optica
Group" of economists from EEC countries. See Commission of the European
Communities (1975).

     50Branson (1986) underscores the confusion regarding the source of the
dollar's rise by suggesting that misalignment is a "topic . . . for the
National Science Foundation, not a new Bretton Woods." (p. 176)

     51For further discussion of this approach to estimating equilibrium
exchange rates and the problems associated with it, see Artus (1978).

     52There is reason to believe that agreements on equilibrium rates would
be even more difficult to achieve in the 1980s than in 1971. Experts differ
widely in their estimates of equilibrium rates today, in large part because of
the many structural changes which have occurred since the Smithsonian
Agreement. Consider the key bilateral rate between the yen and dollar.
Before the dollar recently plunged from 250/$ to Y160/$, estimates of the
equilibrium value of this bilateral rate were as wide ranging as the market
rates themselves. Williamson, for example, cites six studies with estimates
ranging from 131/$ to 209/$. Krause (1986) writes of a possible 1O0/$
rate. Changes in energy prices make all such calculations difficult. But
another major reason why the yen-dollar rate is difficult to assess is the
pattern of productivity growth in the United States and Japan which distorts
simple purchasing power parity calculations. (For further discussion, see
Marston, 1986.)
