                                          ABSTRACT

The freedom of citizens to form voluntary associations has long been viewed as an essential
ingredient of modern civil society. Our chapter revises the standard Tocquevillian account of
associational freedom in the early United States by accentuating the role of state courts and
legislatures in the creation and regulation of nineteenth-century American nonprofit corporations.
Corporate status gave associations valuable rights that went beyond the basic right of individuals
to associate. Government officials selectively used their power to grant and enforce corporate
charters to reward politically favored groups while denying equivalent rights to groups they
viewed as politically or socially disruptive.

         New Jersey farmer George Hutchins catalyzed a major legal dispute in the late 1880s by

bequeathing part of his modest estate to support the propagation of political radicalism.

Hutchins’s will set up a trust fund dedicated to the free distribution of the writings of Henry

George, the popular critic of private property and leader of New York’s United Labor Party,

naming George and his “heirs, executors and administrators” as the trustees managing the fund.1

Legally, this bequest fell into the realm of charitable trust law, a contested branch of (originally

British) equity law that allowed testators to give property to groups without corporate charters as

long as courts deemed their purposes to be sufficiently “charitable.”2 At the urging of Hutchins’s

widow and son, the will’s executor asked the state’s Chancery Court to invalidate the bequest.

Since the American Revolution, state courts and statutes had overturned dozens of similar wills

leaving legacies to unincorporated associations.3 The outcome of this case proved no different.

New Jersey’s Chancery Court rejected Hutchins’ bequests on what were in effect political

grounds.

         The legal question at the heart of the case, according to Vice Chancellor John Taylor

Bird, was “What is a charity?”4 Reviewing the precedents, Bird conceded that some types of

voluntary associations, such as evangelical missionary societies, were routinely regarded as

  In England, charitable trust law had since the sixteenth century allowed specific kinds of unincorporated groups to
receive legacies. In the wake of the American Revolution several states, most notably Virginia, passed statutes
rejecting British practice, though most other states (including New Jersey) did not. The courts’ willingness to
enforce charitable trusts varied widely from state to state until the U.S. Supreme Court, in the 1844 case Vidal v.
Girard's Executors 43 U.S. 127 (also known as the Girard’s Will Case) reversed a contrary decision of 1819 by
recognizing charitable trusts as an embedded feature of American common law. Soon almost all American states
either tacitly or actively came to accept that unincorporated groups pursuing religious, educational, or
conventionally charitable purposes could receive bequeathed property. Useful surveys of this history include Gareth
Jones, History of the Law of Charity, 1532-1827 (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1960) and Howard
S. Miller, The Legal Foundations of American Philanthropy, 1776-1844 (Madison, Wisc.: State Historical Society
of Wisconsin, 1961).

  For the key cases, see Miller, Legal Foundations, pp. 21-50. Well into the twentieth century, appellate decisions
about the disposition of charitable trusts for political causes continued to vary according to judges’ assessments of
the threats posed by the recipient groups. See Note, “Charitable Trusts for Political Purposes,” Virginia Law Review,
37 (1951), esp. pp. 988-94.

charitable even though they aimed to destroy “existing laws, customs, institutions, and

religions.”5 He also acknowledged two recent path-breaking decisions by the Massachusetts and

Pennsylvania supreme courts that defined charity widely enough to encompass bequests for the

dissemination of abolitionist and atheist ideas (albeit only on the condition that the trustees

accept their primary goal to be education and not opposition to the law or Christianity).6 In

Bird’s view, however, the purposes of the book fund were more fundamentally subversive.

George’s vilification of private landholding posed too great a threat to the law for the trust to

stand. “Whatever might be the rights of the individual author in the discussion of such questions

in the abstract, it certainly would not become the court to aid in the distribution of literature

which denounces as robbery--as a crime--an immense proportion of the judicial determinations

of the higher courts. This would not be legally charitable.”7

        George successfully appealed to New Jersey’s high court the following year, but the

damage was done. Reversing the Chancery Court’s verdict, Chief Justice Mercer Beazley ruled

the key issue was not George’s radicalism but Hutchins’s intentions. The will itself, which

benignly described George’s works as “spreading the light” of “liberty and justice in these

United States of America,” disclosed no inclination to violate the law. Rather the book fund,

Beazley concluded, was best understood as akin to a library and, therefore, stood squarely within

the “charitable” domain of education.8 Nonetheless, George’s hard-won victory brought little

satisfaction to him and his followers. According to a biography written later by his son, legal fees

devoured a sizeable portion of the bequest, and the public fallout from the case damaged

George’s pride and reputation.9 He was not only injured by the Vice Chancellor’s hostile

description of his work but was also plagued by rumors that he personally profited from the

legacy.

          Without question, George and his fellow trustees would have been better off had they

been able to organize as a nonprofit corporation. The wills of benefactors leaving property to

incorporated groups stood on firmer legal ground because corporations had a standard right to

“take” or “receive” property.10 Not only would George’s organization almost certainly have

avoided going to court to get this legacy, but it also would likely have acquired several other

valuable rights that came with corporate status: the right to acquire property by means other than

bequests; the right to buy and sell property (as well as receive it); the right to sue and be sued as

a party in court; the right to offer their members limited liability for debts; and the right to legally

enforceable self-governance. This impressive menu of rights remained out of reach to virtually

all nineteenth-century voluntary associations that advocated social and political change because

they failed to meet the judicial and statutory requirements to incorporate. The only legal recourse

available to them if they were bequeathed an endowment was to claim that they qualified as a

charitable trust.

  Henry George, Jr., The Life of Henry George, by his Son (London: William Reeves, 1900), pp. 509-10. This loyal
account also claims that the legacy of around $5,000 was too small to be worth the bother, and that George initially
chose not to accept the legacy out of compassion for Hutchins’ widow until other “collateral kin” who stood to
benefit from the defeat of the will stood in his way. A degree of skepticism is in order. First of all, many charitable
trust cases involved smaller amounts. Second, Hutchins’ widow herself, along with their son, were the parties
opposing the bequest; and the biography itself depicts George as so offended by the Chancery Court’s negative
decision that he fought to appeal it. Third, New Jersey gave no rights to “collateral kin” in intestate cases except in
the absence of widows or children. Carole Shammas, Marylynn Salmon, and Michel Dahlin, Inheritance in
America: From Colonial Times to the Present (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987), pp. 240-41.

  A partial exception was the state of New York, which in 1830 passed a statute denying corporations the automatic
right to receive bequests. The state legislature, however, continued routinely to grant the privilege in special
charters, and New York’s general incorporation act of 1848 included it for “benevolent, charitable, scientific and
missionary societies.” There were no suits in New York that challenged bequests to corporations in the nineteenth
century, whereas there were many such cases involving unincorporated groups (which from 1846 to 1893 were
uniformly blocked from receiving them by the New York Constitution and courts). See Stanley N. Katz, Sullivan,
Barry Sullivan, and C. Paul Beach, “Legal Change and Legal Autonomy: Charitable Trusts in New York, 1777-
1893,” Law and History Review 3 (Spring 1985): 51-89.

         Being deprived of corporate rights did not mean that such associations could not exist or,

in some cases, even thrive. American citizens were remarkably free as individuals to create or

join organizations of most types without having to hide from the government. As Richard Brooks

and Timothy Guinnane explain in their chapter for this volume, however, there is an important

distinction between the right of individuals to associate and the right of associations to a

collective legal identity. To use their terminology, the early United States offered extensive

rights to individuals to associate in loosely defined groups and even to aggregate in ones with

mutually understood rules.11 At the same time, however, the government significantly restricted

associations’ access to the benefits that came from being legal entities and legal persons. These

associational rights depended primarily on access to the state-conferred right to incorporate (and,

secondarily, in the special case of bequests, on judicial definitions of charity). Nineteenth-

century legislators and judges in most parts of the country routinely extended such rights to large

numbers of voluntary associations they regarded as politically neutral or benign, including

churches and other religious societies, educational institutions like schools and libraries, and

traditional charities providing aid to the poor. By contrast, organizations that were viewed by

officials as socially or politically disruptive found themselves at a significant legal disadvantage

– especially when their members wished to acquire or protect property in order to advance their

cause.

         Our argument that the government systematically withheld valuable associational rights

from politically controversial groups raises fundamental questions about the Tocquevillian

portrait of the early United States as an “open access” civil society.12 Tocqueville famously

marveled at the effervescence of American voluntary associations and relished their wide-

ranging purposes. In his view, the state had no hand in their success. Unlike governments

“established by law,” these associations were “formed and maintained by the agency of private

individuals” exercising a “natural” “right of association … almost as inalienable in its nature as

the right of personal liberty.”13 For Tocqueville, this freedom from the state enabled voluntary

associations to provide a crucial check on the despotism he regarded as inherent in democratic

government.

         The basic Tocquevillian perspective continues to dominate scholarship on the role of

voluntary societies in democratic polities. Modern theorists of civil society not surprisingly take

a more positive view of democracy than Tocqueville – often, for example, highlighting the

constructive role played by egalitarian groups that challenge the government – but they, too,

locate voluntary associations “outside the state.”14 American historians of social and political

movements similarly reinforce Tocqueville’s view of an unfettered civil society by focusing on

the agency of dissident activists and limiting their descriptions of government intervention to

instances of criminalization or forcible repression.15 Historians of philanthropy and religion

   See, in this volume, Jacob T. Levy, “Corps Intermédiares, Civil Society, and the Art of Association.” Levy’s
useful typology distinguishes between the integrative, competitive, and oppositional roles that democratic theorists
commonly attribute to voluntary associations. This paper concentrates on their oppositional role, but it might be
possible to argue that their competitive and integrative roles were similarly compromised by the selective allocation
of associational rights.
15
   This literature, encompassing much of the subfield of social history, is far too vast to summarize in a footnote.
Efforts to “bring the state back in” have simulated legal histories documenting the government’s treatment of
subjugated and oppositional groups, but these almost never focus on voluntary associations as organizations. Our
work builds on a few recent exceptions that, however, offer interpretations that differ in important respects from our
own, including William J. Novak, "The American Law of Association: The Legal-Political Construction of Civil
Society." Studies in American Political Development 15 (Oct. 2001): 163-188; Christopher L.Tomlins, Law, Labor,

acknowledge the benefit of early incorporation in the United States, but they rarely depict it as a

privilege denied to disfavored groups. 16 A few recent histories of voluntary associations

highlight a degree of government intervention, but they, too, either overlook the discriminatory

dispensation of charters or maintain that the discrimination had largely ended by the time

Tocqueville arrived.17 Historical sociologists and political scientists vary widely in their value

judgments about the social impact of voluntary associations.18 Whether they view them as

beneficial or destructive to American democracy, however, these researchers still join

Tocqueville in regarding nineteenth-century voluntary associations as private, civil society

organizations separate from the state.

        In contrast to this scholarship, we contend that the voluntary associations so admired by

Tocqueville never really operated independently of the state.19 Instead, nineteenth-century

lawmakers systematically discriminated against certain groups by constraining their access to

   In this chapter we use the term “voluntary association” synonymously with “nonprofit group,” with both terms
referring to any association organized by private citizens for non-business purposes whether incorporated or not.
This use seems to us most consistent with today’s ordinary speech. In the nineteenth century, however, both terms
possessed much narrower legal meanings: “voluntary association,” which appeared frequently in case law and
treatises, usually referred to an unincorporated group (whether for business or non-business purposes); “nonprofit,”
“not for profit,” and “not-pecuniary” were adjectives coined in late nineteenth-century statutes to distinguish non-
business corporations from business corporations. The word “philanthropy” rarely appears in our study because
“charity,” as a legal term, is more pertinent to our argument, and because its positive valence obscures the
distinctions we make between favored and disfavored organizations.

valuable entity and personhood rights. The net effect of this process was that the political

judgments of government officials skewed the development of American civil society towards

conservative and acquiescent groups at the expense of oppositional ones.

         Our account of this history draws on the hundreds of legislative acts and court rulings

between 1750 and 1900 that shaped this lopsided allocation of rights.20 We divide the chapter

into chronological sections that highlight major changes and continuities over time: 1) the

American Revolution’s opening of access to corporate rights to churches, evangelical societies,

conventional charities, private schools, educational institutions like libraries and museums, and

fraternal lodges; 2) the restriction of these rights, nonetheless, to essentially same kinds of

noncontroversial organizations that had already enjoyed privileges in the colonial period; 3) the

manner in which post-revolutionary state legislatures and courts used their powers to grant and

interpret charters to curb the rights of potentially dissident organizations composed of artisans

and ethnic minority groups; 4) the transition in the mid-nineteenth century from special charters

to general incorporation laws that increased access to new categories of politically acceptable

organizations like social clubs and recreational groups; 5) the simultaneous mid-century

expansion of the range of rights held by associations that received charters, including greater

autonomy from judicial supervision; and 6) the state’s persistent denial of access to corporate

rights to voluntary associations with politically controversial goals, like radical reform societies,

trade unions, and political parties. This denial is especially noteworthy in light of the increased

opening of access to politically favored ones. It is the goal of this chapter to tell both sides of this

history.



20
  One reason scholars have largely missed the importance of the government’s role in dispensing these rights is that
the national picture was virtually impossible to investigate until the advent of large electronic databases since the
process took place by means of piecemeal statutes and scattered judicial decisions on the state level.

Expanding Access to Traditionally Favored Groups, 1750-1820

        The impact of the American Revolution on the legal rights of voluntary associations was

much more mixed than scholars generally recognize. On the positive side, American citizens

largely won a de facto right to associate despite its absence from the Constitution. Ordinary

people could immediately create numerous types of voluntary associations, including

oppositional political parties as early as the 1790s. A significant subset of these associations also

began to acquire the more explicit rights belonging to corporations – rights to entity and

personhood status that went beyond the individual right of their members to associate. On the

negative side, access to these corporate rights remained highly restricted for political reasons.

The power to issue and enforce charters, previously held by Parliament and the King, shifted to

state legislators and judges, who tended to favor the same types of associations as those

previously favored under colonial law. This significant degree of continuity with British rule has

gone largely unnoticed by celebrants of American voluntarism.

        It is well known that political associations that challenged the state during the colonial era

were considered illegal, and authorities often used force to repress them. Elites with connections

in Parliament or the colonial provincial governments could usually make their criticisms heard,

but inasmuch as they coalesced into associations, they were, in the parlance of the day, factions

shrouded in secrecy rather than legitimate organizations. On the popular level, traditionally

limited protests like bread riots enjoyed a partial legitimacy, but officials treated most public

demonstrations of antagonism to government policies as criminal.21 A few of the most prominent

examples of political repression during the late colonial period include the jailing of Baptists

who refused to defer to the Church of England in Virginia; the mobilization of militias against

the North Carolina Regulators and the Paxton Boys in Pennsylvania; and, of course, the use of

royal troops to suppress the Sons of Liberty in Boston.22

        What has been less often perceived is the extent to which British law recognized other

kinds of privately organized voluntary associations as legitimate. The Elizabethan law of

charitable uses endorsed the creation and support of parish churches, schools, workhouses for the

poor, and other local organizations serving the indigent or disabled. These types of organizations

were founded in the colonies as well as in Great Britain, supported both by the 1601 statute and,

in some colonies, by extra laws passed by provincial legislatures.23 The Glorious Revolution in

the late seventeenth century extended legal toleration, if not equal rights, to dissenting Protestant

churches. In addition, the King and Parliament granted corporate charters to especially favored

organizations, such as the Church of England’s missionary wing, the Society for the Propagation

of the Gospel, and a similar Presbyterian Scottish evangelical group, both of which operated in

America but were seated in Britain.24

        These types of legally recognized groups had an important characteristic in common:

they performed functions regarded by authorities as useful. No clear line divided public and

private: some of these state-sanctioned enterprises were founded or funded by donors who freely

contributed their own property; some were administered with minimal oversight by the

government. Ultimately, however, what justified the privileged legal status of all of them was

that they were seen as instruments, or extensions, of the state.25 The Elizabethan statute and

royal charters in effect functioned as official licenses that allowed groups organized by private

persons to acquire property and have standing in courts as long as their goals were specifically

endorsed by the government. By contrast, other kinds of voluntary associations, like elite social

clubs and fraternal groups, possessed no legal status at all.26

         In comparison to England, the legal standing of early American voluntary associations

suffered in one important respect: the imperial government was loathe to charter organizations

created by colonists, largely for fear of their becoming independent of British control. The few

exceptions tended either to be related to the Church of England, like William and Mary College,

or to receive strong support from royal and proprietary governors whose authority derived from

the King. Otherwise, legal protection for property held by colonial groups came from charitable

uses law or from charters issued by provincial legislatures without royal approval. The

reluctance of the Crown to incorporate organizations based in America produced friction already

in the seventeenth century when defiant Puritan legislators issued acts of incorporation for

Harvard College, and later Yale, without sending them to England for review.27 Tensions over

the issue of incorporation resurfaced in the late colonial period with several unsuccessful

attempts by colonists to gain official approval. The College of New Jersey (later Princeton) and

Eleazar Wheelock's missionary school (later Dartmouth) failed to secure charters, forcing their

founders to postpone the projects until more sympathetic royal governors agreed to them.28 In

1763, the imperial Board of Trade rejected the incorporation of a Congregationalist missionary

society because the Massachusetts charter required too little government supervision and the

group threatened to interfere with British policy towards Native Americans.29

        The American Revolution gave rise to new rights of association. First and most

importantly, the fight against British repression paved the way for the recognition of a de facto

right to associate. As Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. long ago emphasized, the political organizations

formed by the revolutionaries themselves had the practical effect of enhancing the legitimacy of

oppositional political groups.30 Similarly, the upheaval of the Revolution emboldened dissident

churches and radical sects that had been previously suppressed by officials supporting the

colonial ecclesiastical establishments.31 This revolutionary context shaped the interpretation of

the fundamental rights declared in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: the rights of

free worship and a free press, also proclaimed by virtually all state constitutions; and the rights

of free speech and assembly, proclaimed by over half of them.32 Although none of these

documents explicitly provided for a right of association, they nonetheless provided legal

grounding for the idea that Americans were free to form associations whose purposes did not

otherwise break the law.

        This background did not, however, immediately or completely secure the right of citizens

to associate for political purposes. In the 1790s a decisive setback occurred when leaders of the

Federalist Party tried to suppress Democratic-Republican clubs and the Jeffersonian oppositional

press. Seventy Democratic-Republicans were jailed and fined under the notorious Alien and

Sedition Acts of 1798, and after the Jeffersonians gained power, they briefly attempted to

retaliate by prosecuting a few prominent Federalists under the common law of seditious libel.33

Nonetheless, the expiration of the Alien and Sedition Acts in the early 1800s opened up a new

era of increasingly accepted partisanship, and by the 1820s, organized political conflict had

become widely recognized as an inevitable feature of popular rule.34 Even so, the extent of the de

facto American right to associate in the early republic should not be exaggerated. Laws passed

in the South routinely denied free blacks and slaves the right to congregate for virtually any

purpose, and Northern courts soon re-introduced the common-law doctrine of criminal

conspiracy in order to curtail strikes by labor unions.35

   As is also noted in this volume by Brooks and Guinnane, “The Right to Associate.” Other examples from later in

Utah Mormons in the 1880s; and the anti-conspiracy and anti-espionage acts used against Communists in the
twentieth century. Laws against nineteenth-century trade unions are discussed later in this chapter; also see:

        Secondly, the American Revolution gave rise to new associational rights by widening

access to incorporation. State legislatures assumed the power to issue charters that previously

had been reserved to the King and Parliament, and in many states elected representatives reacted

against the former stinginess of the British by passing acts of incorporation in large numbers.

Whereas the right to associate was at best a de facto right possessed by individual citizens, the

entity and personhood rights of corporations were at once formal and possessed by organizations.

They were particularly important for organizations that aspired to last indefinitely, consisted of

many members, and experienced high turnover in membership. At a time when the small size of

most businesses enabled them to manage their property as partnerships and single

proprietorships, voluntary organizations had more need for the form and therefore became

corporations more often than businesses.36 To be sure, not all eligible associations bothered to

apply for charters; those that were small, ephemeral, or propertyless had little incentive to do

so.37 Once post-revolutionary legislatures increased the availability of charters, however,

voluntary associations that had common property to safeguard frequently took advantage of the

greater opportunity to use the corporate form.

        Another reason that numerous voluntary associations became corporations was that

American revolutionary ideology undermined the British law of charitable uses that had

personhood rights before nonprofit groups. See Brooks and Guinnane, “The Right to Associate and the Rights of
Associations.”
37
   Historians have tended to overestimate the proportion of voluntary groups that procured charters because the
kinds of well-established, propertied groups that became corporations are so heavily represented in printed sources
(including charters). We found that only four (less than 5%) of 219 Massachusetts groups founded between 1807
and 1815 identified as broadly “charitable” (including evangelical, fraternal, mutual aid, poor relief, medical, and
educational organizations) had received charters by 1816. This figure was produced by cross-checking the
Massachusetts subset of the groups listed in the exhaustive appendix of Conrad Edick Wright ‘s The Transformation
of Charity in Postrevolutionary New England (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1992), pp. 244-260, with the
acts of incorporation reported in The Public and General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from Feb
28, 1807 to Feb 16, 1816, volume 4 (Boston: Wells and Lilly, 1816).
                                                                                                                    14


previously protected private donations to churches, schools, and local charities. Republican

sensibilities were offended by traditional charitable law for two reasons: first, it left jurisdiction

over bequests to the juryless, inefficient, and often corrupt chancery courts (think Bleak House);

and second, it gave perpetual control over donated property to trusts with inflexible mandates

that potentially tied up wealth for generations without serving a useful purpose. Although some

states continued to recognize British charitable law, others rejected it, which made incorporation

by state legislatures the only viable route to legal status.38

         The sorts of organizations that followed this route were generally the same sorts that the

British had previously permitted to hold legal rights either as recipients of royal charters or as

beneficiaries of charitable trusts.39 Although the years between 1780 and 1840 witnessed a

veritable explosion of voluntary groups, ranging from unorthodox churches to fraternal orders,

from political parties to utopian communities, the states mostly limited charters to those whose

purposes were religious, educational, or conventionally charitable (either in the sense of aiding

or uplifting the poor or, like hospitals, tending to the sick or disabled).40 Churches and other

Protestant religious organizations, which often owned property acquired before the Revolution

and comprised the majority of first applicants for charters, became the first beneficiaries of the

general incorporation laws passed in the 1780s and 90s.41 General laws facilitating the

incorporation of other traditionally privileged groups were not far behind. Indeed, Pennsylvania

and the U.S. Congress, acting for the Northwest Territory, passed general incorporation acts not

just for churches but also for charitable and literary societies already in the 1790s.42 By the

1830s several other states had passed one or more general incorporation acts for specific types of

voluntary groups, ranging from fire companies to social libraries to medical societies.43 Even

without general legislation, legislatures in most states incorporated great numbers of such

organizations by individual acts. Massachusetts had already issued so many special charters to

“charitable” societies that in 1817 the state’s weary legislators resorted to a barebones template

   Fishman, “Development of Nonprofit Corporation,” p. 632. The Revolution’s support for ecclesiastical
disestablishment led states to issue charters to churches as a sign of official religious toleration. Even in
Massachusetts, where the Congregationalists continued to receive state support, the government offered to liberally
incorporate dissenting churches and bristled when uncooperative Baptists and Universalists refused to take
advantage of the opportunity. The state’s strategy of attaching corporate rights to ecclesiastical rights (most
importantly the rights to tax exemption and licensed marriage ceremonies) ironically backfired as a gesture of
religious inclusion. See John D. Cushing, “Notes on Disestablishment in Massachusetts, 1780-1833,” William and

conferring, in one short phrase, “all the privileges usually given.”44 In addition, when

conventionally acceptable voluntary groups applied for charters, most states in most parts of the

country took a pluralistic approach to incorporating them. Even elite institutions with colonial

charters that established monopoly privileges, like Harvard College, fought losing battles in state

legislatures to prevent rival organizations from becoming incorporated.45

        Because the power to incorporate resided within state governments, however, local

political considerations inevitably affected the distribution of charters in different regions. In

general, the South incorporated fewer organizations than the North, both for nonprofit and for

business purposes. The rural spread of the population and the slave-based economy discouraged

the formation of the kinds of charitable organizations that, in Northern cities, served lower-class

groups. Added to this was an especially virulent anti-corporatism among Jeffersonians that

stemmed from the revolutionary struggle to disestablish the Church of England and later legal

battles to invalidate the colonial charters of institutions tied to the former religious

establishment.46 So extreme was Virginia’s hostility to ecclesiastical corporations that the state

forbade the incorporation of all churches, an example that was later followed by West Virginia,

William and Mary College (whose charter the Jeffersonians first tried to destroy).

Arkansas, and Missouri.47 South Carolina, by contrast, issued many charters to local churches

but otherwise chartered few voluntary groups that ordinary people joined. Even as the Bible Belt

stretched over the South during the Second Great Awakening, the large national evangelical

organizations that elsewhere enlisted numerous Protestant ministers and lay activists

incorporated few Southern state chapters or auxiliary societies (exceptions were the Virginia and

North Carolina Bible Societies and the American Colonization Society chartered in Maryland).48

        Apart from local churches, the Southern voluntary associations that received the most

charters either catered to the elite, like Masonic lodges, literary societies, and private academies,

or existed primarily to protect property, like fire companies.49 This narrow granting of charters,

   The cities of Baltimore and Charleston conformed more to a Northern pattern in having several incorporated
charitable organizations. On the early general law incorporating Virginia fire companies, also see Joseph Stancliff
Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of the American Corporation, vol. 2, p.17. On Virginia incorporated
academies, see Bell, Church, State, and Education, p. 168. South Carolina passed almost 450 acts of incorporation
for voluntary groups between 1775 and 1835, of which 50% were churches and denominational organizations;
14.5% academies, seminaries, and colleges; 11% library, literary, and other cultural societies; 7% Masonic and other
fraternal mutual aid associations; 5.5 % militia and fire companies; 4% free schools and charities for the poor; 3%
professional, agricultural, and commerce societies; and 5% other or unknown. [South Carolina] Statutes At Large,
Vol. 8 (1840), cited in footnote 34. Our sampling of Georgia’s Session Laws between1789-1810 and 1820-1830
reveals much the same pattern. On Masonic lodges, our surveys found that seven of the thirteen states to incorporate
Grand Lodges by 1825 were Southern: South Carolina (1791, 1814, 1818); Georgia (1796; 1822); North Carolina
(1797); Louisiana (1816); Mississippi (1819); Maryland (1821); and Alabama (1821). The Northern states were

especially when taken together with Virginia’s and Maryland’s repudiation of British charitable

law (which traditionally enabled religious, educational, and charitable groups to receive bequests

without needing to be incorporated) may help to explain why so few Southern charitable and

religious voluntary associations amassed resources and perpetuated themselves over time.50

Within the terms of Jeffersonian ideology, political hostility to corporations was justified on

high-minded egalitarian principles. But the reluctance of the South to grant extra associational

rights to churches and charities probably served the interests of the elite more than those of

ordinary citizens. By retaining state control over poor relief and curbing the rights of evangelical

groups, the planter class effectively reduced the potential of organized opposition to its social

and political dominance.

         In the North, the chartering of colleges, academies, and cultural institutions founded by

wealthy Federalists bred popular resentment just like the Federalist control of banks.51

Jeffersonian anti-corporate ideology lost much of its force, however, once the Democratic

Republicans gained power and were able to incorporate voluntary associations of their own. In

New York, the Democratic Republican ascendency in the early 1800s shifted the pattern of

incorporation more towards fraternal groups of recent immigrants and artisans largely populated

by their partisans.52 These groups satisfied the standard expectation that corporations be socially

useful by pledging themselves to the “charitable” assistance of fellow members and their

families in need. Even the notoriously partisan Tammany Society of New York received a

charter in 1805 shortly after the Democratic Republicans won control of both houses of the state

legislature.53 Incorporated under terms that granted more freedom of self-governance than usual

for the period, the Tammany Society easily withstood an 1809 challenge to its charter by a

former member who accused the organization of betraying its official “charitable purpose” by

becoming “perverted to the worst purposes of faction.”54 Tammany’s leadership in turn

indignantly denounced this effort “to cancel its long list of good actions and wrest from it its

charter of incorporation, the basis of its stability and existence.”55 Far from consistently

opposing corporations, powerful Democratic Republicans regarded a thin veneer of charity as

sufficient to qualify an organization for a charter if enough lawmakers supported it on political

grounds. Revolutionary-era hostility towards corporations never entirely disappeared, but as

Democratic Republicans in the North jumped on the corporate bandwagon, the partisan quality

and the partisan Tammany Hall (the General Democratic Republican Committee of New York, which met in the
building owned by the Society) enabled the political machine in its heyday to dispense “charity” and raise private
funds without government oversight. See Mushkat, Tammany, pp. 10, 366. The Tammany charter was unusual in
this period in three important ways: in giving carte blanche to the group’s own constitution and by-laws to
determine the mode of elections, types of officers, and admissions requirements; in containing no term limit; and in
allowing the corporation to “take” and “receive” property as well as to purchase and hold it. The only significant
restriction was a $5000 property limit, which was an average amount for fraternal benefit societies of the period.
According to a 1807 New York almanac, the society had a two-part constitution, one “public,” relating to external
matters, the other “private,” relating to “all transactions which do not meet the public eye, and on which its code of
laws are founded.” Quoted from Longworth’s American Almanac, New York Register and City Directory for the
Thirty-Second Year of American Independence (New York: David Longworth, 1807), p. 78, as cited by Gustavus

of their objections to incorporation started to lose traction. In response to chronic demand,

legislators issued more and more charters to nonprofit groups, as well as to businesses, regardless

of which party or faction was in power.56

         Few organizations as blatantly partisan as the Tammany Society managed to secure

charters.57 Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, most of incorporated voluntary

groups fit into the conventionally privileged categories of religious, educational, and charitable

groups.58 To be sure, the stretched definition of “charity” now included fraternal associations

whose charitableness mainly consisted of offering financial benefits to their own members, but

even they could be regarded as contributing to the wider society by easing pressure on public

poor relief. The traditional view that chartered groups benefited the general welfare continued to

safeguard the legitimacy of the chartering process despite the political twists and turns of state

legislators. Indeed, suspicions that corrupt officials rewarded their partisan allies only reinforced

the widespread conviction socially and politically divisive groups should be ineligible for

corporate grants from the government. The Tammany Society, the glaring exception, received its

   A comparison of the numbers of special charters issued by New York and Massachusetts in the two years before
and after the state first had both a Democratic-Republican governor and legislative majority shows that that no
overall cutback occurred. In New York, where the Federalists lost power in 1802, the number remained constant for
businesses and rose by 400% for nonprofits (from 1 to 4: the small total number of nonprofit special charters is due
to New York’s general incorporation acts for churches, libraries, and academies); and in Massachusetts, where the
Democratic-Republicans seized control temporarily in 1810-11, chartering rose by 28.5% for businesses and 81%
for nonprofits (from 21 to 38). Averaging the numbers of special charters per year for 1800-05 and 1834-35, the
overall increase in incorporated voluntary associations between the two periods was120% in Massachusetts (from 12
per year to 26), 800% in New York (from 2 to18), and 100% in South Carolina (from 4 to 8).
57
   Other political groups in the early republic built on Tammany’s fraternal model, including the dozens of
Washington Benevolent Societies organized by young Federalists starting in 1808, but our searches in the
HeinOnline data base of state sessions laws and in published lists of Massachusetts and New York corporations
produced no evidence of their incorporation (contrary to Butterfield, Making of Tocqueville’s America, p. 50). As
we show below, partisan organizations became corporations in a few states at the end of the century.
58
   Fire companies and mutual aid associations (both loosely considered “charitable”) were the only sizable
exceptions to these traditional categories. There was minimal change in the percentages of special charters for
groups whose purposes were not either religious, educational, traditionally charitable (in the sense of aiding the poor
or disabled), mutual aid, or fire protection. In Massachusetts, these exceptional types – the most common of which
were agricultural and medical societies --constituted only 3% in 1800-1805 (out of a sample totaling 73) and 2% in
1834-35 (out of 53); in New York, 11% in 1800-1805 (out of 18) and none in 1834-1835 (out of 37); and in South
Carolina, 4% in 1800-1805 (out of 24) and 6.5 % in 1830-1835 (out of 46).

charter early enough in the political battle between Federalists and Democratic Republicans to

slip under the wire, and even it professed a charitable purpose when its charter came under fire.

In theory, if not always in practice, corporations were from the outset supposed to stay out of

politics.



Legislative Constraints on the Corporate Rights of Disfavored Groups, 1790-1820

        The notion that religious, educational, and charitable associations served the public good

also justified a measure of governmental control over them. Even in the case of Protestant

churches and other highly favored organizations, acts of incorporation often included limits on

the amount of property they could own or the number of years their charters remained valid.59

New York’s 1784 general act of incorporation for churches contained such detailed prescriptions

about ecclesiastical governance -- including procedures for democratically deciding which

church members could vote, how corporate trustees would be elected, and how to determine the

salaries of clergymen -- that leaders of Episcopal and Dutch Reformed churches mounted a

thirty-year campaign for changes that would accommodate their more hierarchical church

polities.60 Charitable and educational corporations serving the general public were typically

subject to additional governmental constraints. Massachusetts General Hospital, for example,

was required to offer free admission to the indigent, and many private colleges including

Harvard and Yale needed to reserve seats on their boards for public officials until the 1860s and

1870s.61

         Legislatures subjected the charter applications of associations run by socially and

politically marginal people to far more discriminatory treatment. Regardless of which party

dominated the state government, lawmakers often saw such organizations as raising the specter

of social disorder and were reluctant to extend the same entity and personhood rights that they

routinely granted to mainstream associations with similar goals. Catholic churches, for

example, were routinely compromised by the Protestant bias towards lay ecclesiastical control

that prevented high-ranking clergy from organizing as “corporations sole” -- a corporate form

that in Europe had long made it possible for bishops to rule over their dioceses.62 Instead,

Catholic parishes in the United States that incorporated were forced to entrust church property to

local groups of trustees who lacked official religious authority.63 More direct forms of

discrimination undercut the efforts of laborers, blacks, ethnic minorities, and women who formed

organizations to pursue otherwise acceptable educational and charitable purposes. For several

decades beginning in the 1790s, members of socially subordinate groups submitted a growing

number of petitions for charters. The Northeastern state legislatures ruling on these petitions

often either rejected them outright or attached special provisions to reduce the corporate rights

that charters ordinarily conferred.

        From the time of the Revolution, for example, labor groups experienced exceptional

difficulties procuring charters because of longstanding worries by public officials about their

potential to control wages. Two organizations of artisans formed in the late eighteenth century,

one in Boston to prevent apprentices from quitting before their contracts expired and the other in

New York to regulate the members’ “affairs and business,” were repeatedly denied charters on

the grounds that they were “combinations” aiming to set “extravagant prices for labor.”64 A

newspaper article written in 1792 by “A Friend to Equal Rights” bemoaned the fact that banks

received “every attention” whereas the mechanics’ “wish to be incorporated [has] been treated

with contempt and neglect.”65 It soon became clear that corporate status for these and other

labor organizations, as well as many associations of ethnic minorities, depended on persuading

state lawmakers, regardless of the party in power, that they were exclusively “charitable” mutual

benefit societies dedicated to providing aid to sick or impoverished members (or, when deceased,

their widows and children), and, occasionally, to offering instruction in their trades.66 In 1816,

when the New York Typographical Society attempted to deviate from this formula by adding to

   For citations to other New York labor charters granted between 1790 and 1820, see below. Our systematic
analysis focuses on New York since that state granted labor groups the most charters, but other states also
periodically passed restrictive charters for them in this period, for example: The Newburyport Mechanick
Association, in Massachusetts Session Laws, January Session, 1810, pp. 139-140 (“for charitable purposes; but …
for no other purpose whatsoever”); The Stanton Benevolent Mechanic Society, in Virginia Session Laws, 1818,
December Session, Ch. 93, pp. 138-139 (forbidden to pass bylaws “for regulating trade, or the wages of labor”). In
Pennsylvania, where the Bricklayers’ Company was incorporated in 1797 under the general law as a “charitable
society,” the group’s unpublished bylaws deviated from its charter by including “some general rules for measuring,
and standard prices for valuation,” suggesting a surreptitious purpose concealed from official view. See George L.

its list of objectives the goal of improving conditions of labor, the legislature rejected the bill,

passing it only two years later when this provision had been removed.67

         When labor groups managed to secure charters, the acts of incorporation often contained

threats of dire consequences should they stray from their declared purposes of mutual aid and

education. In New York, where the largest number of “mechanics” and journeymen groups were

incorporated before 1820 (largely owing to the power of Democratic Republicans), the three

earliest acts up to 1805 included the unusual requirement that the groups report to the Chancellor

to prove that funds were not being diverted to other purposes.68 A little later this reporting

requirement was dropped, but six of the thirteen New York charters issued between 1807 and

1818 contained extra provisions that specifically forbade the enactment of bylaws or rules

“respecting the rate of wages, or relative to [their] business.”69 In addition, virtually every

corporate grant made by the state to a labor group before 1820 imposed extreme punishments for

the pursuit of unapproved objectives. Whereas it was normal for states to reserve the right to

states that the initial bill contained a “provision permitting the association to regulate trade matters.” The official

clause” and that the revised petition contained a “modification” as to the corporation’s “intention.” Journal of the

dissolve corporations that exceeded their mandates, the charters given to labor groups stipulated

that the state could, in addition, confiscate all corporate property.70

        These unusually constricting conditions of incorporation imposed on artisans reflected a

more pervasive hostility towards organized labor that pervaded early nineteenth-century

American law. In response to several strikes by journeymen, American courts drew on

repressive features of the British common law to indict members of unincorporated labor groups

on charges of “criminal conspiracy” to fix wages.71 Although no state legislature outlawed

“combinations” of workmen by statute, as Parliament did in the 1790s, the acceptance of

criminal conspiracy law by the judiciary amounted to the denial of the basic right to associate.

The reluctance of legislators to incorporate labor groups left them more vulnerable to the court’s

hostility. When a lawyer for striking Philadelphia cordwainers during the first conspiracy trial of

1806 claimed that workers’ organizations had the same collective rights to make rules for their

members as a corporation, the argument went nowhere, nipped in the bud by prosecutor’s

rejoinder that “this body of journeymen are not an incorporated society [italics in original]

whatever may have been represented,” because corporate status depended upon having

“benevolent purposes.”72

        Charitable and educational associations organized in the Northeast by European ethnic

groups, African Americans, and women also encountered resistance when they attempted to

incorporate, albeit to a lesser extent, and they received similarly restrictive charter provisions.

groups and free blacks in the first decades of the nineteenth century contained the same threat of

property confiscation commonly directed at labor groups. If the group were to pursue any

“purposes other than those intended and contemplated by this act,” the bills stipulated, the

corporation would “cease” and its “estate real and personal” would “vest in the people of this

state.”73 The 1808 act that incorporated the New York Society for Promoting the Manumission

of Slaves for the purpose of facilitating the funding of its charity school for black children and

other “benevolent purposes” contained this provision as well.74 A report issued by the New

York’s Council of Revision was unusually explicit in expressing anxiety about chartering

immigrant groups. Explaining the veto of an act of incorporation for a German mutual aid

society, the councilors proclaimed that “it will be productive of the most fatal evils to the State”

to encourage “foreigners differing from the old citizens in language and manners, ignorant of our

Constitution and totally unacquainted with the principles of civil liberty” and would “establish a

precedent under which the emigrants from every nation in Europe, Asia, and Africa, who incline

to seek an asylum in this State …[will] claim similar establishments.”75

         An analogous fear of social disorder underlay the initial hesitation to charter charities run

by middle-class women. The Boston Female Asylum, founded in 1800, at first met frustration

when seeking to incorporate in 1803. In the vitriolic words of a newspaper critic, “the



73
   77% (7 out of 9) of European ethnic and all (2 out of 2) of free black fraternal benefit groups incorporated prior to
1820 contained this language. A comparison to other types of New York “religious and charitable” corporations,
1780-1848, based on a random sample of 71 organizations from the General Index, pp. 171-174, found this
provision in 60% of other (non-labor, non-ethnic) fraternal groups; 60% of non-fraternal charities; and in none of the
religious or educational societies. A word search in HeinOnline sessions laws found this language in many state
franchises like turnpikes which operated on public land. Otherwise, the provision was virtually nonexistent in
charters of business corporations. At least one early charter of an ethnic benefit association, the German Society in
New York City, incorporated in 1804, included in addition a reporting requirement like those in the first charters
granted to labor benefit groups. New York Session Laws, 27th leg., 1804, Ch. 64, p. 609.

consequences, which will naturally result from it, must be hostile to the peace of society, and to

the regularity and harmony of families.”76 When the charter was finally secured, it contained a

passage compensating for the fact that married women could not be sued, requiring that wives

who handled organizational funds procure their husbands’ consent and that their husbands take

responsibility for any property of the organization they handled. Another section held that the

treasurer always be a single woman with enough personal resources to “give bond, with

sufficient surety or sureties” to cover “all money and property of said society coming to her

hands.” 77 Charters of women’s charitable groups in Massachusetts contained this language

routinely for decades.78 Pennsylvania charters of the period similarly stipulated that only single

women could serve as treasurers, a provision that protected husbands from suits but also

prevented wives from assuming positions of fiscal leadership.79 But the corporate rights of

women depended on the specific language of charters, and states did not always so readily defer

to the law of coverture. In New York, the acts that incorporated women’s organizations between

1800 and 1840 typically exempted the husbands of members from financial responsibility, an

approach that contrasted with Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and presumably meant to

encourage men to allow wives to participate.80 Either way, lawmakers remained convinced for

decades that husbands required an extra layer of protection from the distinctive risks posed by

incorporated associations of women.81

         Despite the legal disadvantages of marriage, middle-class women in most places quickly

overcame the initial resistance to their organizing. Aided by emergent cultural assumptions about

the superiority of female virtue, women’s groups that stuck to activities like the distribution of

Bibles and the care and moral uplift of indigent mothers and children secured charters in large

numbers during the first half of the nineteenth century.82 By the 1830s, the provisions designed

to protect husbands from suits had, moreover, largely been dropped.83 State legislatures

concerned about the inadequacy of public poor relief not only welcomed the help of respectable

women but also became more likely to give charters to working-class and immigrant mutual-aid

societies without attaching special restrictions.84 The socially stabilizing effects of charitable

and self-help organizations largely overrode the initial fears of lawmakers that artisans, ethnic

minorities, and women would use corporate rights to subvert the social order. This is not to say

81
   It is puzzling why states included these various provisions at all. The rule of limited liability for members of
corporations was gradually becoming an established feature of American law during this period and presumably
would have offered husbands automatic protection against suits by corporate creditors. Many charters for business
corporations specified the liability of members, thereby overriding the rule, but none of these charters did so. One
possible explanation for the provisions is that coverture raised extra doubts about the sufficiency of the rule to
protect husbands, particularly since American courts did not fully establish it until the mid-1820s. The phrasing of
some of the charters also suggests another concern not covered by limited liability: that a wife’s possible
mishandling of funds risked a suit by the corporation itself (rather than a suit by a creditor against the corporation).
Charters addressing a wife’s possible “neglect or malfeasance” include the New York charters, cited above, and in a
charter for the Savannah Female Asylum, in Georgia Session Laws, 1809, Annual Session, Section 6, p. 60. On the

   The Massachusetts provisions, which appeared consistently in at least five charters between 1803 and 1816, were
eliminated for seemingly the first time in a charter of 1821 (Massachusetts Session Laws, May Session, 1821, Ch.

that government officials had altogether lost their distaste for chartering organizations that

professed beneficial purposes and yet stirred public controversies.85 But the barriers to

incorporation that previously stood in the way of otherwise acceptable organizations composed

of low status members largely, if not fully, came down.



Judicial Constraints on the Corporate Right of Self-Governance, 1800-1850

         In the early nineteenth century courts, as well as legislatures, had powers over

corporations that they could use to constrain the rights of politically suspicious voluntary

associations. Virtually all the suits involving incorporated groups that rose to the appellate level

during this period originated in internal conflicts over matters of governance. They were brought

by members (or ex-members), not creditors or outside purveyors, whose complaints were about

organizational rules, not debts or damages. States routinely gave corporations the right to enact

bylaws that were legally binding on members, but charters rarely offered explicit guidance on

governance apart from mandating the election of officers. Judges therefore had room to interpret

whether an organization’s right to self-governance permitted the enactment of a particular

regulation or procedure. As virtually all of these cases reveal, courts proved particularly inclined

to take an aggrieved member seriously when the complaint touched on issues of wider political

significance or the organization’s activities threatened to disturb the status quo.86 Whereas


85
   Our discussion of the late nineteenth century will return to the subject of ethnic discrimination. In the 1830s and
40s, the best examples of states’ political use of their chartering powers are decisions by Vermont, Rhode Island,
and Massachusetts to revoke or revise charters previously given to Masonic lodges at the peak of the Anti-Masonic
crusade; and Massachusetts’ shelving of a petition for incorporation by a Jesuit college in the midst of Protestant
nativist reactions against the Irish immigration of the 1840s. On the Masonic charters, see Neem, Creating, pp. 112-
13; Vermont Session Laws, 1830, Ch. 42, p. 54; and Rhode Island Session Laws, January, 1834, pp. 54-56. On the
the Jesuit college, see Brownson’s Quarterly Review, New Series, vol. 3, no. 3 (1849) pp. 372-97.
86
   Of the eight early appellate cases we found in which judges overturned the internal governance procedures of
voluntary associations (most of them in the 1800’s and 1810’s), seven involved either New England church-state
controversies or disputes within politically controversial Pennsylvania and South Carolina religious and fraternal
corporations. The only case we found with no evident political significance was Commonwealth v. Pennsylvania
                                                                                                                     30


voluntary associations without charters were usually free to govern themselves unless they

advocated breaking the law, suspect voluntary groups that became incorporated traded the upside

of other corporate benefits, like property ownership, for the downside of potential judicial

interference.

         Despite the constitutional guarantee of freedom of worship, the conviction that

corporations were accountable to the government even threatened the autonomy of churches. In

New England, where the colonial ecclesiastical establishments hung on for decades, the idea that

the state should oversee the governance of church corporations died especially hard. The

Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1807 went so far as to overturn the people of Tyringham’s

decision to fire the minister of their incorporated church because they no longer adhered to his

orthodox beliefs. The bench forbade the removal of a minister without proof that he had grossly

violated his office, despite the state’s 1780 constitutional provision giving “all societies

incorporated for religious purposes” the right to elect clergymen.87 In Connecticut, court

decisions in 1793 and 1816 similarly sought to protect the Congregational Standing Order by

restricting the corporate right of parish majorities to run their own churches.88

         Ecclesiastical disestablishment in New England soon eliminated the official privileges of

Congregationalists, but corporate status nonetheless continued to offer a justification for judges



Beneficial Institution, 2 Serge. & Rawle 141 (1815). A contrasting interpretation of judicial intent is offered in
Kevin Butterfield’s Making of Tocqueville’s America, in which Binns and several Philadelphia mutual aids cases of
the 1810s are described as examples of courts protecting the individual rights of members. See Butterfield, Making
of Tocqueville’s America, pp. 68-76,151-162. Apart from Binns, however, only two of the cases resulted in actual
verdicts, with notably mixed results: Commonwealth v. Pennsylvania Beneficial Institution, noted above, favored the
individual, but the decision in The Commonwealth vs. The Philanthropic Society, 5 Binn. 486 (1813) favored the
corporation. This chapter not only underscores the political nature of the early judicial interventions but also argues,
contrary to Butterfield, that American courts in later decadesp increasingly deferred to the governance rights of
associations, not individuals.

who favored Congregationalism to intervene in religious disputes. The best example is the well-

known Vermont case Smith v. Nelson of 1846, in which the Vermont’s Supreme Court refused to

enforce the Presbyterian synod’s dismissal of a minister chosen by a local Presbyterian church.89

Reversing a contrary lower court ruling, the justices defended the preferences of the church

against the decision of the higher ecclesiastical body on the grounds that the church was a

“corporate body” in which members were entitled to elect their own leaders. In the eyes of the

court, the synod possessed no legal governance power despite the denomination’s own rules. The

description of the local church as a corporation apparently derived from New England custom

rather than from any concrete evidence of registration. Technically, the battles over

disestablishment were over, but behind the justices’ distaste for the Presbyterian organizational

hierarchy, and its reflexive support for local church autonomy, clearly lurked a lingering

Congregationalist bias.

        Even in Pennsylvania, where religious freedom had prevailed since the colony’s

founding, the corporate status of churches provided an opening for state intervention. Two

church cases decided in 1815 and 1817 stand out as particularly egregious examples of judicial

meddling in the internal governance of nonprofit corporations. Whereas the examples from New

York and New England reflected longstanding rivalries between denominations over matters of

church polity, these Pennsylvania cases reflected conflicts over race and ethnicity that extended

well beyond ecclesiastical disputes. The growth of Philadelphia’s population of free blacks and

the arrival of Irish and German immigrants exacerbated deep-seated social tensions that played

out in the religious organizations formed by minority groups. In 1794 the African American

members of Philadelphia’s Methodist Church formed their own house of worship, the Bethel

Church of African Methodists, in response to acts of discrimination such as being forced to sit in

the back. White leaders in the original church corporation continued, however, to control the

church’s property and the selection and pay of its visiting preachers.90 Under the leadership of

its minister Richard Allen, Bethel tried in 1807 to amend its loosely worded charter of 1796, but

when an expelled member, Robert Green, petitioned for a writ of mandamus to restore him to

membership (a legal action specific to corporations), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court treated the

church as subject to the corporate bylaws of the original Methodist Church “by which the

African society is governed.”91 Green had been thrown out of the church by Allen and Bethel’s

deacons for breaking a standard Methodist rule against suing another member. Since

Pennsylvania gave basic corporate rights to all churches, including the power “to make rules,

bylaws, and ordinances and to do everything needful for the good government and affairs of the

said corporations,” the legality of the rule was not itself in doubt.92 Rather, Green and his white

allies maintained that Bethel’s officers lacked the authority to enforce the church’s rules. Only if

the majority of the parent corporation’s membership had explicitly transferred the power of

expulsion “by the fundamental articles, or some by-law founded on these articles,” the court

agreed, would the decision by “a select number” be legal.93

        In 1817, the Pennsylvania Court went to similarly remarkable lengths to sort out the

irregularities in a disputed election within Philadelphia’s German Lutheran church that caused an

eruption of “tumult and violence.”94 Once again, the church was split between bitterly opposed

factions and the conflict reflected deep social divisions within the city. German immigrant

members who wanted church services conducted in their native language had won the election,

and the more assimilated, English-speaking members enlisted a state prosecutor to challenge the

legality of the vote. The lower court issued a blatantly anti-immigrant ruling, contending that

unnaturalized foreign residents had no more right to vote in church corporations than they did in

the wider polity. Upon appeal, the justices in the Supreme Court rejected that argument by

noting the essential difference between “religious and political incorporations,” but they, too,

ruled against the immigrants. Rather than rely on any specific provision of the church’s charter,

which called for elections but said nothing about voting procedures, the court ruled that the

election had in principle violated the terms of incorporation. The justices, deriving their notion

of a fair election from other corporations as well as political life, especially objected to the fact

that the immigrant faction had distributed marked ballots to their constituency (a practice that,

ironically, American political parties would make standard within two decades). Had the church

not been incorporated, it is clear that the case would never have found its way into court. The

same bench dismissed a similar case brought by a faction of Methodists because their church had

not become a corporation sufficiently in advance of the suit.95

        The use of corporate status to justify intervention can also be seen in early nineteenth-

century cases involving controversial fraternal associations. Like churches, fraternal societies

were more fully private than most other types of nonprofit corporations in this period. Not only

were their benefits directed primarily to their own members rather than a wider public, but,

unlike churches, their selective admissions policies and secret practices meant that their internal

affairs were almost entirely removed from outside scrutiny. Both their exclusiveness and their

visible displays of high-minded patriotism upon civic occasions conferred social status to those

who belonged, and, in most parts of the country, Masonic lodges and numerous smaller

fraternities attracted growing numbers of elite and upwardly mobile middle-class men. Their

pledges of mutual assistance gave a charitable dimension to their purposes that frequently

enabled them, like groups of artisans, to secure charters. But along with corporate status came

the ability of disgruntled members who disagreed with the leadership to bring their grievances

into courts.96

        Oaths of secrecy kept such suits to a minimum, but at least two cases about the internal

governance rights of fraternal associations rose to the level of state supreme courts, one in

Pennsylvania in 1810 and one in South Carolina in 1813. As in the cases involving church

corporations, the courts conceived of their role as enforcing corporate charters. The involvement

of the legal system was, once again, socially and politically charged because the trials

jeopardized the reputations and relationships of prominent citizens.

        In Commonwealth v. St. Patrick’s Society, John Binns, a member of an Irish fraternal

group in Philadelphia who had been thrown out in 1807 for “vilifying” another member, went to

court to challenge his expulsion.97 The man whom Binns had insulted was no less than the

society’s president, William Duane.98 As the editor of Philadelphia’s leading Jeffersonian

newspaper, The Aurora, Duane had long been a leader of Philadelphia’s Irish radicals and

frequently spoke out against the Federalist judiciary and the English common law. Binns, a

recent Irish immigrant, was allied with rural Republicans and had recently challenged Duane’s

authority by moving to Philadelphia and founding a rival newspaper supporting the aspiring

“country” candidate for governor, Simon Snyder. As tensions mounted, Duane and his allies

successfully ousted Binns from several other Irish associations without charters, but since St.

Patrick’s was a corporation, Binns possessed legal leverage to retaliate. By 1810, when the case

finally came before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Binns’ political fortunes had risen with

Snyder’s election in 1808, and Duane’s campaign against the court system had petered out after

the government enacted a few minor reforms.99 Technically, the justices’ decision to adjudicate

this dispute stemmed from the society’s limited rights as a corporation, not from Duane’s hostile

stance towards the bench or Binns’ increased influence. Even though St. Patrick’s members had

approved a bylaw forbidding rude behavior long before the expulsion of Binns, the justices

adhered to a narrow, literal reading of the corporation’s right to self-governance and reinstated

Binns’ membership.100 Any expulsion was invalid, the court held, unless the offending member

broke the law of the state, violated a rule that explicitly appeared in the charter, or interfered

directly with the objects of the society. Rejecting the corporation’s argument that cooperation

among members was essential to the group’s mission, the opinion declared that “vilifying a

member, or a private quarrel, is totally unconnected with the affairs of the society, and therefore

its punishment cannot be necessary for the good government of the corporation.”101

        For decades, the Binns precedent carried considerable weight in court decisions about

expulsions from incorporated voluntary associations. The same Pennsylvania court upheld an

expulsion for fraud in 1813, distinguishing the facts from the Binns precedent in part because the

group’s charter -- rather than merely its bylaws -- explicitly forbade “scandalous and improper”

behavior.102 Perhaps in response to Binns, New York’s General Society of Mechanics and

Tradesmen also added such a provision when renewing its 1792 charter in 1811, declaring that

“notorious, scandalous, wicked practice” was subject to expulsion.103 In Connecticut, an

expulsion case of 1827 similarly hinged on the precise terms of incorporation. The court

reinstated an ousted trustee of a private school corporation because its charter had not authorized

expulsion for “disrespectful and contemptuous language towards his associates.”104

        In a South Carolina case, which, like Binns, involved a prominent fraternal association

whose members were closely tied to the political world, the Chancery Court enforced a charter

belonging to the Grand Lodge of South-Carolina Ancient York Masons in a manner that

similarly overrode its internally chosen leadership. 105 South Carolina at the time contained two

competing Grand Lodges, the consequence of a mid-eighteenth-century split within international

Masonry. Both lodges incorporated shortly after the Revolution. At the root of the case was an

agreement by the rival Grand Masters to mend the schism by merging the two organizations

refused to reverse expulsions from fraternal associations unless the former member had lost promised death or sick
benefits and the organization had violated its own governance rules.

under the name the Grand Lodge of South-Carolina. The leaders polled all the subordinate

lodges, which unanimously approved the merger, and then petitioned the state to repeal both the

earlier acts of incorporation and issue a new one. In the meantime, however, a group of lodges

affiliated with the Ancient York Masons bristled at the top-down enactment of “inauthentic”

practices and defected from the consolidated body. The dissidents reorganized themselves into a

separate body and appropriated the name of their former Grand Lodge, the South-Carolina

Ancient York Masons. With the controversy intensifying, the state legislature voted against

dissolving the old corporations and incorporating the new Grand Lodge, but since the continuing

existence of the umbrella group did not require a new charter, each of the two groups claimed to

be the legitimate successor of one or both of the original corporations.

            The conflict came to a head when a debt originally owed to the Ancient York Masons

was ordered by a lower court to be paid to the new Grand Lodge of South Carolina. The

dissident Ancient Yorks launched a suit contesting this decision, and the Chancery Court saw

this occasion as a chance to test the legitimacy of the merger. Going far beyond the matter of the

debt, the Chancellor evaluated the contested rules and rituals within the terms of Masonry itself,

taking care to refer to arcane texts like the Ahiman Rezons in his written decision.106 His

attention to such minutia suggests the seriousness with which he took the Masonic split (it is

reasonable to suspect that he, like others in the South Carolina elite, had a personal stake in the

controversy). The opinion, whose logic is largely incomprehensible to an outsider, landed

firmly on the side of the Ancient Yorks, concluding that the referendum organized by the Grand

Masters had been based on deception. The original corporation of the Ancient York Masons had

never been legally dissolved, and the new Grand Lodge had no right to collect the debt because it

was “not a corporate body known to the law.”107

         As these examples indicate, the incorporation of voluntary associations during the early

decades of the republic could be both a blessing and a curse. Incorporation gave organizations

valuable entity and personhood rights, but it also required them to submit to the state’s definition

and enforcement of charter rights. Justices adjudicating suits could take issue with the decisions

of internally chosen leaders on matters ranging from personal behavior to electoral procedures to

institutional tradition. Voluntary associations that were not incorporated were rarely, if ever,

subjected to this kind of judicial scrutiny, unless, like labor groups, their members could be

accused of committing crimes. At a time when individual citizens enjoyed an increasing right to

associate and officials generally lacked the administrative capacity to monitor groups on a

routine basis, the government wielded little power over associations. It was the entity right of

corporations to legal standing that brought them into the courts and gave justices an opportunity

to discipline them.

         These cases of judicial intervention also underscore the special vulnerability of voluntary

associations regarded as socially or politically controversial.108 Courts were most inclined to

interfere with the self-governance rights of groups posing threats to the status quo because of the

traditional view of corporations as creatures of the state. Especially when a dispute between

members of an organization reflected broader social divisions, a judicial decision to curb the

108
    Controversial business corporations like banks were, of course, also widely perceived as violating the public
good, but for a variety of reasons too complex to pursue here, business corporations were not as vulnerable to
judicial scrutiny as nonprofit ones. On New York courts’ tendency to ignore business violations of charter terms, see
Hilt, “Early American Corporations and the State,” pp. 20, 32. Our own research for a book in progress suggests that
courts entertained complaints by minority stockholders against corporate managers only in cases of egregious
financial fraud.

power of corporate leaders could be justified as a defense of the general welfare. This was true

even in the case of corporations that authorities ordinarily viewed as publicly beneficial, like the

South Carolina Masonic Lodges or the German Lutheran Church, when complaints against

internal procedures bore on larger conflicts that authorities wished to contain.

         Controversial voluntary associations thus needed to overcome three sets of state-imposed

obstacles before they could exercise the entity and personhood rights ordinarily received by

conventionally acceptable voluntary associations that became corporations. First, they needed to

surmount the legislative barriers blocking access to incorporation; second, they needed to secure

charters without unusually restrictive provisions; and third, they needed to avoid judicial

decisions that curbed their right to self-governance. These obstacles prevented the very groups

that were the most likely to challenge the government from competing on an equal basis with

groups that enjoyed the unreserved approval of courts and legislatures.



Widening of Access Combined with Persistent Constraints, 1830-1900

         Over the course of several decades around the middle of nineteenth century, American

lawmakers significantly widened access to the entity and personhood rights of corporations.

Most states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West ended their nearly exclusive reliance on special

charters by enacting more general incorporation laws making it easier for designated categories

of businesses and voluntary associations to become incorporated and removing the taint of

favoritism by giving the same set of rights to organizations within each category.109 The general


109
   The South, which had always incorporated fewer voluntary associations, for the most part stuck to special
charters. Of the seventeen states we have identified that passed multi-purpose general acts for nonprofit groups
between 1840 and 1860, twelve were in the Northeast or Midwest and one in the West (California, one of only two
Western states at that time). Alabama and North Carolina were the only states to join the eleven-state Confederacy
that had passed such an act before 1860; the non-Confederate border states of Maryland and Kentucky did so as
well. References to the acts, listed in chronological order, are included in the following footnotes. There was less
regional variation in the case of businesses: for example, general laws for manufacturing firms had been passed
                                                                                                              40


laws of this period also moved beyond the earlier focus on narrow types of associations such as

churches and libraries to pull together broader categories like “religious,” “educational,”

“benevolent,” and “charitable” into single pieces of legislation. Despite this general easing of

access, however, the types of groups included within these privileged categories still conformed

to the earlier pattern. Oppositional groups pursuing social and political change generally

experienced the same difficulties acquiring corporate rights as they had in the era of special

charters.

        In 1848, New York set the new standards for incorporation by enacting the most

sweeping general act to date. Passed in response to a provision in the Jacksonian-inspired

Constitution of 1846 that mandated general laws for all corporations, it allowed for the

incorporation of “benevolent, charitable, scientific and missionary societies.”110 Before this, the

state’s general incorporation laws covered only a few specific types of voluntary organizations

other than churches -- most notably, colleges and academies, libraries, bible societies, and

medical societies. The state had required special charters for all charities, mutual aid societies,

and fraternal orders, as well as most kinds of religious associations, educational and cultural

groups, and scientific and professional organizations. The loosely defined categories covered by

the general law of 1848 therefore made incorporation much easier for an enormous range and

number of voluntary associations. Nonetheless, because New York’s Constitution still permitted

the legislature to issue special charters if “the objects of the corporation cannot be attained under


throughout the country by 1860. See, in this volume, Eric Hilt, “General Incorporation and the Shift toward Open
Access in the Nineteenth-Century United States.”

Pennsylvania (amending its earlier act), Indiana, and Maine: “An Act relating to Orphans’ Court and Other
Purposes,” Pennsylvania, 1840, Act No. 258, Sections 13-16, pp. 5-7; “An Act to authorize the formation of
Voluntary Associations,” Indiana, 1846, 31st Session, Chap. 45, pp. 97-99; “An Act to Authorize the incorporation

general laws,” the state continued to reward politically favored groups by granting them

permission to exceed the property limits written into the 1848 law.111 Despite this loophole, the

sheer comprehensiveness of the New York law became an important model for other states to

follow. Between 1850 and 1860, California, Ohio, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey,

Kentucky, Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, and Wisconsin passed similarly multi-pronged

incorporation laws encompassing a vast number of acceptable nonprofit groups.112

         A handful of these states for the first time even used the generic term “voluntary

associations” in the titles of acts to signal their wide breadth.113 In 1874, Pennsylvania moved

still farther in this direction, dividing its law of corporations into two sections: those “for profit”

and those “not for profit.”114 The not-for-profit category consolidated under one heading a

uniform set of rules for ten different types of organizations ranging from charities to yacht

clubs.115 Only a glimmer of the earlier notion that corporations should contribute to the public

good still survived. Now it was permissible to form corporations for purely private purposes,

and judges needed merely to verify that a corporation’s purpose was legal and “not injurious to

the community.” This trend towards greater generality and greater permissiveness continued in

most states well into the twentieth century, facilitating the registration of more and more kinds of

American voluntary associations as nonprofit corporations.116

        But it is still crucial to recognize that this wider access to corporate rights never

benefitted all types of voluntary associations equally. The seemingly inclusive terms that the

general laws used to define eligibility, like “charitable,” still embraced only a subset of voluntary

associations, and because the laws never stipulated which types they disqualified, the excluded

groups remained largely hidden from view. The anti-Catholic bias against “corporations sole”

silently remained a part of American corporate law for decades.117 States also persisted in

denying corporate rights to a great number of activist voluntary associations outside the social

and political mainstream, including labor unions and radical reform organizations. Laws like

New York’s of 1848 that offered easy incorporation to seemingly broad categories of

“charitable,” “benevolent,” and “educational” groups implicitly left out oppositional ones. This

tacit exclusion meant that such groups still needed to submit to the political judgments of elected

officials by petitioning for special charters when they sought corporate rights.

        The exclusion of antislavery groups provides an especially telling example of persistent

political discrimination. In addition to being excluded from the categories covered in general

incorporation laws, they also had difficulty acquiring and utilizing special charters. Several

antislavery societies in the North successfully petitioned for acts of incorporation shortly after

the Revolution, but, as we have seen, legislators made sure that their main goals of assisting

newly freed blacks fell squarely under the rubrics of education and charity. 118 The first national

antislavery organization, the American Colonization Society founded in 1816 and incorporated

by Maryland in 1831, never espoused a program of legal change but instead sought to send

voluntarily manumitted slaves to Africa.119 Despite the Society’s conservative, evangelical

purposes, Southern states in the 1830s began to challenge its corporate status as part of the

backlash to the Nat Turner Rebellion. In 1837, following a spirited debate, the U.S. Congress

refused to incorporate the group within Washington D.C.; and Virginia similarly denied its bid

for incorporation the same year. 120 Although Maryland reaffirmed its support in 1837 by

reissuing a charter significantly raising the group’s property limit, the standing of the Maryland

charter in other slave states continued to come under assault in a series of court cases questioning

the validity of wills in which masters bequeathed their slaves to the Society rather than passing

them onto their heirs.121 Until the 1850’s, Southern appellate courts generally upheld the

organization’s corporate right to receive the slave property, but the grounds of these decisions

became progressively narrow as the Northern antislavery movement gained ground and Southern

states resorted to enacting statutes that specifically outlawed the bequest of slaves for the

purposes of emancipating them.122 In a ruling of 1857, the Georgia court argued definitively that

a corporation could not inherit slaves like a natural person and that a state was not obligated to

honor the rights of a “foreign” corporation whose aims were “repugnant to its policy [and]

prejudicial to its interests.”123 This string of pro-slavery decisions is particularly notable for

occurring after the Supreme Court’s 1844 Girard Will decision of 1844 establishing the validity

of charitable bequests even if the recipient was not a corporation.

         At the same time as slave-holding states were thwarting the corporate rights of the

American Colonization Society, the Northern antislavery groups advocating immediate

emancipation almost never received charters. The only two abolitionist groups to surface in our

searches of session laws in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio fell squarely

under the rubric of education and religion: the Infant School Association in Boston “for the

education of colored youth,” incorporated by Massachusetts in 1836 (an effort planned but never

executed by Garrisonian abolitionists); and an avowedly anti-slavery Baptist Church in

Columbus, Ohio chartered in 1851 under the state’s general law for the incorporation of

churches.124 Other churches with abolitionist leanings undoubtedly incorporated as well, of

course, without broadcasting their antislavery views in their names. How often other kinds of

abolitionist associations tried to incorporate and failed is virtually impossible to determine, since

few examples of failed applications surface in documents. When they do, however, the extent of

legislative opposition becomes apparent. For example, the diary of an agent employed by the

Free Will Baptists reveals that in 1833 the New Hampshire legislature denied a petition to

incorporate the denominational publishers who produced a highly successful newspaper

(subscriptions had rapidly grown to nearly 5,000) because a majority of the state’s legislators

regarded the paper as “a vehicle of abolitionism.” That the group running the press was a

religious denomination, whose church and evangelical associations received charters without

difficulty, was not enough to convince hostile lawmakers.125 The Free Will Baptist Printing

Establishment’s trustees “regularly presented their petition every year” and met “the same

repulse, for the same reason” until 1846, when the balance of political power in New Hampshire

shifted towards the antislavery cause.126

         Ordinarily, abolitionists and other radical activists may have had little reason to

incorporate their associations. They amassed only small amounts of property from contributors

and hardly ever received legacies.127 Nor did they have much occasion to benefit from the

corporate right to legal standing since their organizations rarely, if ever, had occasion to be

parties in civil suits; and corporate status was irrelevant in criminal prosecutions since the

charges were against individuals.128 Yet the few exceptional charters granted to antislavery

groups between the 1830s and 50s indicate that incorporation was occasionally valuable. More

striking, the protracted failure of the Free Will Baptist publishers to receive a charter

demonstrates that lawmakers, even in relatively liberal New England, deliberately refused to

incorporate politically controversial groups. That states passed only a small number of acts of

incorporation for abolitionists and other radicals needs to be attributed to resistance as much as

to apathy.

         Instances of failed attempts to incorporate become even harder to trace after state

legislatures ceased having control of the process. Under general incorporation laws, the review

of applications usually fell to administrative officials at the level of counties rather than states.

In New York and Pennsylvania, however, where general incorporation laws required judicial

approval, unsuccessful groups at times appealed their rejections in the states’ highest courts.129

which had over a thousand auxiliaries by the late 1830’s, raised more than $150,000 over a six year period, but still
struggled to meet operating expenses. It received only one sizeable bequest, depleted in five years. The only bequest
to be legally challenged was litigated after the Civil War, and, as in the Henry George case, the Massachusetts court
directed the money away from William Lloyd Garrison’s paper and women’s rights advocates because their
purposes were politically radical rather than charitable. Jackson v. Phillips, 96 Mass. 539 (1867).

twentieth centuries, and their outcomes indicate an ongoing pattern of discrimination,

particularly against immigrant and religious minority groups. In Pennsylvania, for example,

where the general law still contained a long list of eligible categories, courts in 1891 rejected the

bid for incorporation of one social club on the grounds that its all-Chinese board of directors

might not adhere to its declared purposes and of another because “the law has not provided for

corporate capacity” to assist in “the cultivation and improvement of German manners and

customs.”130 By 1897, a series of such rulings had established the precedent that all groups

incorporated in the state had to conduct their affairs in English.131 A judge in Pennsylvania also

rejected the application of Christian Scientists on the grounds that their church’s opposition to

medical treatment posed a hazard to public health.132 In New York, after the 1895 Membership

Corporations Law repealed nearly a hundred state laws passed between 1796 and 1894 and

generously covered virtually any nonprofit group, judges typically resorted to seemingly

technical reasons for denying the applications of disfavored groups.133 A panel ruling in 1896,

for example, refused to incorporate a Jewish organization because it proposed meeting on

Sundays, despite the fact that other corporations in the city already did so with impunity.134

         The denial of applications for incorporation submitted by controversial groups remained

a remarkably persistent (if poorly documented) practice in many parts of the country into the

mid-twentieth century. As late as 1957, nine states with broadly written laws still made

applications subject to the review of judges or administrative officials who could withhold

certification at their discretion.135 According to Norman Silber’s history of nonprofit

corporations, which concentrates on the twentieth century, rejected applications were rarely

appealed except in Pennsylvania and New York, but cases “were reported occasionally in many

states, including Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa,

Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Louisiana, New Jersey, Tennessee,

Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin, and more numerously in Illinois [and] Ohio.”136

         In addition to the evidence provided by sporadic court rulings, documentation of the

persistently selective granting of corporate rights in the late nineteenth century can be found in

the long lists of nonprofit corporations published by the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New

York, and Ohio.137 Compared to the lists produced in the era of special charters prior to the Civil

War, the only significant change was a greater number of incorporated recreational and social

clubs. Otherwise, despite the progressive liberalization of general laws and the granting of more

and more charters, the overwhelming majority of nonprofit corporations continued to fit into the

same limited categories as before: Protestant religious organizations; charities assisting the poor

book American Legal Reports. However, he provides no other details on these cases, many of which may be from

and disabled; educational, cultural, and medical institutions; civic organizations like fire

companies; and the major fraternal orders.

         Even though it is well known that many social and political reform groups were active in

the second half of the century, temperance organizations were the only ones to attain corporate

status with any frequency. Their disproportionate success reflects both their close ties to

Protestant churches and the weakness of their largely Catholic and immigrant opponents. Ethnic

divisions over the consumption of alcohol were at play in an 1880 Michigan case, for example,

in which a man who had borrowed money from a German society successfully argued that its

suit to recover the debt was invalid because any organization that opposed the state’s temperance

law had no right to corporate legal standing.138 In several states, general laws of incorporation

added extra regulations to ensure that social clubs would not slip through the cracks of laws

restricting the sale of alcohol.139 The size, respectability, and political clout of the temperance

movement, qualities that made it virtually unique among the many activist groups seeking social

and political change, go a long way towards explaining its success at achieving corporate rights.

         Because states could differ in their assessment of which reform groups were dangerous,

organizations seeking incorporation at times succeeded in one state and then attempted to operate

in more hostile territory. Despite the negligible representation of politically controversial groups

on state rosters, we know that some received charters from cases in state supreme courts where

the opponents of a “foreign corporation” sought to block its local activities.140 The American

    Most foreign corporation cases involving voluntary associations did not reflect serious objections to the purpose
of the organization as much as territorial competition between it and a rival organization or conflicts over resources
between parts of the same organization. When in 1882, for example, a member of a Michigan chapter of a national
fraternal organization refused to pay an assessment levied by its “supreme lodge” incorporated in Kentucky, the
1882 Michigan Court overturned his expulsion and warned the Michigan Grand Lodge not to “subject itself, or its
members to a foreign authority in this way.” See Lamphere v. Grand Lodge 47 Mich. 429 (1882), quote at p. 430.

Colonization Society’s legal battles in Southern states in the antebellum period, discussed earlier,

partly revolved around disagreements about whether, as a Maryland corporation, the

organization could wield corporate rights elsewhere. The best known instances of this kind of

repressive use of state corporate law occurred in the next century, in the context of escalating

racial conflict in the 1920s and 1950s. State courts in Kansas and Virginia in the mid-1920s

denied the right of the Ku Klux Klan to operate in their states because it was a foreign

corporation incorporated in Georgia. In Virginia, the court determined that the Klan’s sale of its

paraphernalia constituted commercial transactions, forcing the corporation to pay a fine and

relinquish the nonprofit status it had acquired in Georgia.141 The Kansas attorney general

attempted to prevent the organization from organizing local chapters by refusing to register it as

a Kansas corporation, an effort that cost him his reelection (his successor gave it permission). 142

Southern states fighting desegregation in the 1950s similarly sought to oust the NAACP and

CORE, both chartered in New York.143 By then, the Supreme Court had come to view arguments

about foreign corporations as antiquated. But for over a century, despite the passage of

seemingly liberal general incorporation laws, the strategic refusal by legislatures, courts, and

government officials to incorporate voluntary associations supplied a weapon to repress

politically polarizing activist groups – even when other states had already incorporated them.

        In the case of these kinds of activist reform groups, the political motivations behind state

restrictions of their entity and personhood rights seem quite clear. Less obvious, perhaps, are the

political assumptions behind the thousands of legislative decisions to charter groups that could

be unequivocally viewed as “religious, educational, and charitable.” As Justice Bird knew when

he defended the 1888 decision to impede the advocacy of Henry George’s ideas, much hinged on

the question, “What is a charity?” For him and other authorities at the time, groups promoting

social equality fell on one side of this dividing line, whereas groups viewing the sale of alcohol

as a sin fell on the other. That the line itself was politically drawn must have been evident to the

losing parties in isolated court cases. The dominant conservative consensus, however, was that

“charity” was politically neutral (as were religion and education) and that corporations should be

so as well, an assumption that conveniently buried the political judgments behind the use of these

categories.144



Stronger Rights for Favored Groups, 1840-1900

         The politically acceptable groups that typically benefited from greater access to

incorporation also benefited from another mid-century development: the growth of corporate

independence from governmental control. States not only facilitated the formation of nonprofit

corporations by passing general laws, but also loosened the strings previously attached to the

corporate form. Whereas legislatures and courts in the first decades of the century often

disciplined suspect organizations by setting limits on the rights that charters conferred, states in

the late nineteenth-century relied more exclusively on denying access to incorporation altogether.

The growing numbers of voluntary associations that acquired entity and personhood rights under

the general laws enjoyed these rights more fully and more freely than before. This change is

particularly apparent in relation to the associational right of self-governance, which, as we saw

144
    By contrast, property tax exemptions, which benefited the same kinds of groups and directly cost taxpayers,
elicited outspoken criticism at various times in the nineteenth century. The fact that these critics repeatedly failed to
sway lawmakers is another example of the political intransigence of these categories. On these efforts, see Stephen
Diamond, "Efficiency and Benevolence: Philanthropic Tax Exemptions in 19th-Century America,” in Evelyn Brody,
ed., Property-Tax Exemption for Charities (Washington, D.C.: Urban institute Press, 2002), pp. 115-144.

earlier, judges routinely overrode when thwarting the leaders of controversial groups. Starting

around the middle of the century, judges almost always left matters of internal governance to the

corporations themselves.

         The shift away from government oversight of incorporated voluntary associations can

partly be seen in the altered language of legislative acts. Previously, in the era of special

charters, states mandated a number of governance rules. For example, they often required

voluntary associations, like businesses, to hold annual elections of officers. At times, charters

also set the month of elections, demanded that members be notified, and stipulated the specific

titles and responsibilities of the officers. These electoral requirements remained standard

throughout the century for business corporations but gradually faded away for nonprofit groups.

Already in the 1820s New Jersey’s and New York’s general laws specifically exempted religious

and library corporations from following the standard rules about the election of boards and

officers that applied to business corporations.145 Ohio in 1852 similarly exempted religious, fire,

literary, and benevolent corporations from requirements to issue public reports.146 By the 1870s

Massachusetts had lifted the requirement that nonprofit corporations, like business corporations,

annually elect a board of directors. A long list of nonprofit groups, ranging from temperance

associations to sports clubs, were permitted to shift what had earlier been “the power of

directors” to “a board of trustees, managers, executive committee, prudential committee,

until at least 1877. New York’s Revised Statutes (1829), Vol. 1, Ch. 18, Title 4, stated that many specific rules
about elections and other matters did not apply to incorporated libraries and religious societies (Sect. 11, p. 605). Of
the four Titles within this Chapter on the regulation of New York corporations, only the most general one, Title 3,
applied to all incorporated voluntary associations. It was notably looser in all its requirements than Title 1 (on
turnpikes), Title 2 (on banks and insurance companies), and Title 4 (which focused mostly on stock companies).
Religious societies and schools were similarly made exceptions to another set of New York rules guiding
corporations in equity suits and dissolutions (Revised Statutes (1829), Vol. 2, Ch. 8, Title 4, Articles 1-3).

wardens and vestry, or other officers.”147 Even the pioneering regulatory board created in 1867

by New York to oversee the state’s charities left the vast majority of private religious and secular

charitable enterprises free of supervision, restricting its oversight to groups that received

government funding.148 Ceilings on income and property remained the only common constraints

on the rights of incorporated voluntary associations, and by the end of the nineteenth century

some states had eliminated even those.149 Significantly, at a time when states and the federal

government were beginning to impose industry-wide regulations on railroads and other types of

businesses, the vast majority of nonprofit groups, whether incorporated or not, entered what was

virtually a laissez-faire zone.150

        The stronger governance rights that legislatures granted to incorporated voluntary

associations were steadily reinforced by a series of nineteenth-century judicial decisions. In 1826

the eminent jurist James Kent wrote that the Dartmouth decision had already thrown “an

impregnable barrier” around the rights of “literary, charitable, religious, and commercial

    In this respect, the United States presents a striking contrast with Germany, where the rights of voluntary
associations continued to be far more restrictive than the rights of businesses. See Brooks and Guinnane, “The Right
to Associate and the Rights of Associations.” General incorporation acts for American businesses often contained
governance rules and other prescriptions that were missing from acts for nonprofit groups. See Naomi R.
Lamoreaux, “Revisiting American Exceptionalism: Democracy and the Regulation of Corporate Governance in
Nineteenth-Century Pennsylvania,” in Enterprising America: Businesses, Banks, and Credit Markets in Historical
Perspective, ed. William J. Collins and Robert A. Margo (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2015), pp. 25-72;
and in thise volume, Hilt, “General Incorporation,” pp. 2, 17-18. On the late nineteenth-century shift towards
regulating businesses by passing general laws applying to each industry (in contrast to the earlier reliance on
incorporation acts), see Daniel A. Crane, “The Dissociation of Incorporation and Regulation in the Progressive Era
and the New Deal," in Corporations and American Democracy, ed. Naomi R. Lamoreaux and William Novak

institutions” by guaranteeing their charters’ “solidity and inviolability.”151 Despite the frequent

insertion of reservation clauses meant to enable legislatures to alter charters (thereby getting

around Dartmouth), legislatures almost never tried to change the charters of private nonprofit

corporations, and courts in the 1830s and 40s defeated their few attempts to do so.152 As time

went on, moreover, judges came to regard the self-governance rules made by associations as

inviolable as the language of their charters. The Pennsylvania Court in 1837 swung decisively

away from the 1810 Binns decision when it upheld the right of a mutual benefit society to oust a

member for violating its bylaw against intoxication on the simple grounds that, as “a private

corporation,” it was authorized to follow its own rules.153 The application of the Binns precedent

contracted to a narrow defense of individual contractual rights. Only when membership came

with promised insurance benefits that were lost upon expulsion did judges became concerned

about the rights of members whose group had expelled them for offensive conduct, and they

ruled on behalf of an expelled member only when they could prove that the disciplinary

procedure that took away his benefits deviated from the common practice of the group.154

Otherwise, American courts recognized camaraderie as a justifiable condition of continued

    This process was gradual. Kevin Butterfield identifies a similar shift towards contractualism as early as the
1830’s; Making of Tocqueville’s America, pp. 81-4, 151, 173-180, 219-220. This process was gradual. As late as the
1860’s at least two cases still awarded reinstatement to expelled members: Evans v. Philadelphia Club (PA 1865) 50
Pa. 107 (a late use of the Binns precedent, stating that expulsion was not necessitated by the purpose of the
corporation); The State ex rel. of James J. Waring v. The Georgia Medical Society (GA 1869) 38 Ga. 608 (a
Reconstruction case overturning the Georgia Medical Society’s expulsion of a doctor whose activities on behalf of
blacks had been deemed “ungentlemanly.”) For a few selected cases from across the country that exemplify the shift
towards contractualism, see the citations here and in the following notes: Anacosta Tribe v. Murbach (MD 1859) 13

participation and supported decisions to terminate membership for misbehavior even when

valuable benefits were lost. In a notable case of 1896, an Illinois court upheld the expulsion of a

disagreeable member of the Women’s Catholic Order of Foresters despite her potential loss of

financial benefits, reasoning that property interests were not sufficient justification for suits by

expelled members because many mutual benefit organizations were also “social and fraternal in

their nature.”155 In 1897, the U.S. Circuit Court in D.C. declared that social and benevolent clubs

had the right to expel members for “conduct unbecoming a gentleman” as long as the provision

appeared in their bylaws.156

        These late nineteenth-century expulsion cases almost always concerned corporations, but

corporate status became notably less central to the decisions of American courts once judges

backed away from supporting abused members and took the same hands-off approach to the

governance of corporations that had always been taken with respect to unincorporated groups.

Justices also began to insist that the equity action of mandamus, traditionally available to a

member of a corporation wishing to overturn an expulsion, could no longer be used as a way to

regain benefits.157 A former member of the Chicago Board of Trade was denied the right to

contest his ouster because the organization was not a business but a “voluntary association.” “It

is true,” the court conceded, that the Board was a corporation like “churches, Masonic bodies,

and odd fellow and temperance lodges; but we presume no one would imagine that a court could

take cognizance of a case arising in either of those organizations, to compel them to restore to

membership a person suspended or expelled from the privileges of the organization.”158

Nonprofit corporations could now discipline their members for violating internal rules with little

fear of state scrutiny (as had always been the case for unincorporated groups). Contrary to the

experience of socially and politically suspect groups in the first half of the century, corporate

status no longer meant accepting a potential loss of control over internal governance in return for

the advantages of other associational rights, like property ownership, that charters routinely

secured.

        As a corollary to this growing right of self-governance, incorporated voluntary

associations gained several additional rights in the nineteenth century that further enhanced their

autonomy. A few of these rights, moreover, including the right of limited liability, extended

beyond the ones granted to business corporations. By 1830, the default common-law rule that

members of corporations enjoyed protection from liability for corporate debts had become well-

established in American courts, but states could override this common-law rule by passing

statutes to the contrary.159 In the case of business corporations, special charters and general

incorporation laws often imposed significantly higher levels of shareholder liability (for

example, double or triple the par value of their shares).160 In the case of nonprofit corporations,

however, special charters generally overlooked the issue of liability entirely, implicitly

defaulting to the common law rule. General incorporation laws that covered both businesses

and nonprofit groups similarly left the common law rule intact by stating that their sections on

liability applied only to businesses. The laws of Missouri and Kansas made it clear, for example,

that “none of the provisions of this article, imposing liabilities on the stockholders and directors

of corporations, shall extend to literary or benevolent institutions.”161 In our survey of the general

acts passed in the middle of the century for nonprofit corporations, we found only four states

(less than a quarter of the total) that imposed liability on members or directors. Two of them

(New Hampshire and Florida) had reversed themselves by 1870, and the other two, Ohio and

New York, made only trustees or directors, not ordinary members, liable.162

         In 1876, the right of nonprofit corporations to shield themselves from damaging suits was

reinforced by the introduction of the doctrine of “charitable immunity” into American law. In

the landmark case McDonald v. Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Supreme

Court invalidated the suit of a patient who had been injured during surgery performed by an

unauthorized hospital employee. In the words of the opinion, “A corporation, established for the

maintenance of a public charitable hospital, which has exercised due care in the selection of its

agents, is not liable for injury to a patient caused by their negligence.”163 The English precedents

for this ruling dated back to the 1840s, but whereas in England these decisions had already begun

to lose traction by the 1870s, the doctrine of charitable immunity began to spread rapidly across

the United States. In cases that for the most part concerned hospitals, courts repeatedly ruled that

shielding charities from tort suits at once served the public interest and prevented charitable

funds from being diverted from their intended use. According to the scholars Bradley C. Canon

1938.”164 Only in 1942 did the tide of legal opinion begin to shift the other way.165

        Another example of the wide latitude given to nonprofit corporations was their

exceptional right to hold stock of other corporations. This form of investment was usually denied

to business corporations (the major exception being insurance companies) until New Jersey

radically broke from precedent and permitted it for all corporations in 1889-90. Nonprofits had,

however, routinely bought stock of other corporations since the middle of the century. By 1855,

this development had become significant enough for Joseph Angell and Samuel Ames to observe

in the fifth edition of their classic treatise, “There are large classes of corporations which may

and do rightfully invest their capital or funds in the stock of other corporations, for the purpose

of secure and profitable investment.” These classes, the passage went on, consisted primarily of

“religious and charitable corporations, and corporations for literary and scientific purposes.”166

        Certain nonprofit corporations, unlike business corporations, also gained the right to

control subsidiary corporations. Grand lodges of fraternal orders routinely exercised power over

their lower affiliate lodges, a practice that dated back to the supremacy of the Masonic Grand

Lodge of London in the eighteenth century. The early acts of incorporation for Masons passed by

South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, and Alabama explicitly authorized Grand Lodges to assume

jurisdiction over their affiliated local lodges.167 Even the states that did not mandate the

subordination of local lodges tacitly deferred to the order’s top-down governance structure by

allowing corporations to establish their own rules. Although the eruption of the Anti-Masonic

movement in the late 1820s led to the temporary revocation of Masonic charters in Vermont,

Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, all three states reincorporated them by 1860, and general

incorporation acts passed between 1846 and 1858 by many Midwestern and Southern states --

including Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Georgia – contained specific

provisions for the incorporation of Masons, Odd Fellows, and Sons of Temperance that

implicitly sanctioned the rule of the state-level bodies over local ones.168 In a Massachusetts case

of 1880 involving two rival lodges of the Royal Arch Masons, the state Supreme Court firmly

upheld the right of Grand Lodge corporations to exercise power over their lesser chartered

affiliates.169 Grand Lodges that lacked corporate status, by contrast, could not count on legal

recognition of their right to rule subordinate lodges. Important rulings in New York in 1857 and

Indiana in 1885 prohibited unincorporated Grand Lodges of the Odd Fellows and the Knights of

Pythias from appropriating property owned by local lodges that had split off or been kicked out

of the order by their superiors.170

        Over time, some organizations without charters gained a few of the entity and

personhood rights ordinarily held only by corporations. Unincorporated local churches had long

exercised the right to receive and hold at least limited amounts of property in perpetuity, and

landmark court cases in the 1870s established that higher church bodies did not need to be

corporations to secure their governance powers over lower ones.171 In the middle of the

nineteenth century, a growing number of states further extended the property rights not only of

churches but also of other conventional religious, educational, and charitable groups even if they

lacked corporate charters. The main catalyst for this development was the 1844 decision by the

United States Supreme Court in the Girard’s Will Case that recognized British charitable trust

law as part of American common law, thereby according these kinds of groups the right to

receive bequests and build permanent endowments in states without statutes to the contrary.172

Several states after 1850 in addition gave all voluntary associations, whether or not they were

incorporated, an associational right to stand as parties in suits.173

         Despite these late nineteenth-century developments, voluntary associations without

corporate status continued to suffer important comparative disadvantages under American law.

Most states at the end of the century still did not give unincorporated groups the right to sue and

be sued, and in places that did, legal standing could prove a double-edged sword to controversial

groups, such as labor unions, by making them more vulnerable to judicial repression. Nor did the

great access to charitable bequests automatically benefit unincorporated associations, as we saw



171
    By the 1840s, states often gave churches corporate rights whether they were incorporated or not. See, for
example, Christian Society in Plymouth v. Macomber, 46 Mass. 155 (1842) (confirming a longstanding statutory
rule in Massachusetts); Cahill v. Bigger, 47 Ky. 211 (confirming that in Kentucky an unincorporated church had
equity rights to property deeded originally to individual deacons). For church cases affirming the authority of
denominational rules (and thereby narrowing or disputing the decision in the 1846 case Smith v. Nelson discussed
above), see especially: Watson v. Jones (U.S. Supreme Court 1871). 80 U.S. 679; and Connitt v. Reformed
Protestant Dutch Church (NY 1873) 54 N.Y. 551. Even Virginia, which passed statutes in the post-revolutionary
period disallowing charitable bequests, passed laws in the 1840s designating churches and fraternal lodges as
property-holding trusts. The Code of Virginia (Richmond: Ritchie, 1849), Title 22, Chs. 76-77, pp. 357-369.

in the case of Henry George’s book fund. Other important rights acquired by nonprofit

corporations during this period never extended to unincorporated groups, including the right to

charitable immunity and the right to control subsidiary organizations. On balance, the legal

changes of the late nineteenth century compounded the advantages of corporations while only

partly increasing the advantages of other associations. Not only did corporations gain new

rights, but they also shed previous constraints on their rights, such as low property limits and

judicial threats to self-governance. The extraordinarily wide latitude the government now gave to

nonprofit corporations therefore made the inability of disfavored groups to qualify for corporate

status all the more discriminatory.



Constraints on the Associational Rights of Labor Unions and Political Parties, 1860-1900

       For the most part, the politics behind the unequal dispensation of associational rights in

the late nineteenth century remained hidden from public view. Decisions by officials to deny

corporate rights were buried inside of hundreds of obscure state statutes and court rulings, and

the groups damaged by them tended to be small and marginal. In the case of two exceptionally

visible and contentious groups, however, the politics behind these decisions behind became

glaringly evident around the turn of the century. For a brief period of time, both labor unions

and political parties straddled the political fence dividing voluntary associations that received

corporate rights from those that did not.

       With rare exceptions, political parties and labor unions did not become corporations in

the nineteenth century, and they still do not today. Indeed, since 1900 several ways that the

government treats them differently from nonprofit corporations have been written into federal

laws dealing with tax exemptions, campaign regulations, and collective bargaining. But what is
                                                                                                               62


clear today was not so clear in the late nineteenth century. As states became more permissive in

granting corporate status to voluntary groups, the longstanding prohibition on incorporating

political parties and labor unions was, for a few decades, thrown into doubt.

        For labor organizations, like other voluntary associations, increases in membership and

financial resources enhanced the appeal of corporate legal and property rights. When unions

began to confront interstate railroads and other national business corporations after the Civil

War, they rapidly expanded beyond specific trades and localities, amassed substantial strike

funds, and branched out to run co-operative shops and stores. Between the 1860s and 1880s

several of the largest labor unions made political demands to incorporate alongside their other

(now far better-known) legislative goals like the eight-hour day and the exclusion of Chinese

workers.174 Longstanding resistance finally gave way with the support of several prominent

elected officials. At the instigation of the legislative committee of the Federation of Organized

Trades and Labor Unions, which had in 1883 elected Samuel Gompers its president,

Congressman Thompson Murch, a pro-union politician from Maine, shepherded an 1886 bill

through Congress enabling the incorporation of national trade unions in the District of

Columbia.175 Among the allowable corporate purposes listed in the statute was “the regulation of

[members’] wages and their hours and conditions of labor” and any “other object or objects for

which working people may lawfully combine.”176 Within a few years, several states enabled the

incorporation of unions by enacting similar general laws: Maryland (1884), Michigan (1885),

Massachusetts still imposed more stringent conditions on unions than on other nonprofit

corporations, but most of these states allowed unions to incorporate on the same terms as other

nonprofit groups (as did New York, the following decade, in its sweeping Membership

Corporation Law).178

         No sooner had they gained permission to incorporate, however, than most unions

changed their position and declined to do so. The main reason for this change of heart was the

series of anti-union decisions by American courts that occurred between 1885 and 1900. These

rulings effectively gutted the influential 1842 decision in Commonwealth v. Hunt that had

repudiated the British law of conspiracy and regarded labor unions as similar to other kinds of

voluntary associations.179 Emboldened by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the

Sherman Act of 1890, conservative judges devised a new version of conspiracy doctrine that

applied, if not to organizing per se, to basic union strategies like picketing, boycotting, and even,

most broadly, the calling of strikes leading to “restraint of trade.”180 Corporate status did not help

in these cases. Justices used their equity power of injunction to order the arrest and

imprisonment of labor activists, whether their unions were incorporated or not. Moreover,

several court decisions of the 1890s showed how the legal standing of corporations could

backfire by making unions more vulnerable to crippling lawsuits.181

        It soon became clear that unincorporated unions had distinct advantages in states that

stuck to the old common law rule that groups needed corporate status to stand as parties in court.

In Massachusetts, for example, the state Supreme Court in 1906 invalidated a conspiracy suit

against unions of bricklayers and masons because “there is no such entity known to the law as an

unincorporated association, and consequently it cannot be made a party defendant.” For a suit

against an unincorporated voluntary association to have standing, the Court went on, every

member “must be joined as a party defendant” or, following equity rules, several members could

be named as the party as long as the plaintiff could show that these individuals were

representatives of the entire group.182 The requirement to identify everyone in a union who

supported a strike or else demonstrate that a group of leaders had the consensual support of every

member was, from a practical point of view, nearly impossible.

        Even though several other states had by then passed laws granting unincorporated

voluntary associations the legal personhood rights to sue and be sued, cases involving the illegal

actions of only a subset of individual members still foundered if the suit was against the

organization. A stream of decisions by the New York Supreme Court beginning in 1892 held

that the state’s 1880 statute enabling unincorporated associations to be parties in suits did not

supersede the requirement that every member be equally liable as an individual – a condition

requiring such detailed knowledge about specific actions and identities that large unions in New

York were effectively immune from lawsuits for over a century.183 Other states, however, such

as New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio, and Michigan, decided this question differently, either by

court rulings or by passing more explicit laws imposing corporate-like liability on

unincorporated groups.184 Whether or not they incorporated, unions in the late nineteenth century

apparently lost more than they gained when they acquired an associational right to legal

standing. In this respect, they experienced the same disadvantages as the controversial nonprofit

corporations in the first half of the nineteenth century whose rights to self-governance were

subverted by conservative courts. Making matters still worse, Congress in 1898 added to the

judicial damage by mandating that unions incorporating under the federal law of 1886 expel

workers who used “violence, threats, or intimidation” to prevent others from working during

strikes, boycotts, or lockouts.185 Not surprisingly, when Louis Brandeis sought to persuade

Samuel Gompers that the labor movement should seize the opportunity of acquiring corporate

rights, Gompers responded without hesitation, “No, thank you!”186

Co., 259 U.S. 344 (1922). By 1980 only four states – Massachusetts, Illinois, Mississippi, and West Virginia -- still
followed the common law rule that unincorporated associations could not sue or be sued (as reported in the case in
which Massachusetts finally abandoned the rule, DiLuzio v. United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers 435

         For political parties, like unions, the widening access to incorporation during the second

half of the nineteenth century briefly opened up an opportunity to expand their associational

rights that ended up being decisively closed. During the period of expansion, New York, long

the home of the Tammany Society corporation, unsurprisingly went the farthest in granting

corporate rights to politically partisan groups. Tammany’s leaders, by then at the heart of the

Democratic political machine, were able in the 1850s and 1870s to brush off renewed questions

about the legitimacy of the Society’s 1805 special charter as a charitable group, and in 1867 they

even successfully petitioned the legislature to increase the corporation’s property limit.187

Around the same time, New York extended similar rights to other groups. In 1875 it revised its

general incorporation law in 1875 to include “political, economic, patriot” societies and clubs

along with athletic, social, musical and other recreational ones.188 Then it followed with a

separate act in 1886 allowing for the incorporation of “political clubs” that omitted an earlier

provision for visitorial powers by the Supreme Court that applied to other nonprofit groups.189

The New York Membership Corporations Law of 1895 revoked these earlier laws and

abandoned the long string of adjectives that previously defined corporate eligibility, but its

inclusive language still left open the possibility of parties or partisan organizations

incorporating.190 As we will see, the courts soon cut that remaining possibility off.

        No state other than New York seems to have explicitly included political groups in a

general incorporation law. Nonetheless, scattered evidence suggests that “Democratic” and

“Republican” clubs received special acts of incorporation in several states during the late

nineteenth century, including New Jersey, Maryland, South Carolina, Tennessee and

Kentucky.191 It is not possible to know simply from the names of these groups whether they

were affiliated with political parties -- they could have been educational or civic groups

upholding broader “democratic” and “republican” principles. At least one of them, however, the

Republican State League of Kentucky, stated on its petition for incorporation in 1886 that its

objects were “to advocate, promote and maintain the principles of the Republican Party.”192

        This fledgling development of political corporations quickly fell victim to an onslaught of

electoral reforms that changed the legal status of political parties.193 Previously, states had left

parties essentially free of regulatory control. Partisan electoral practices had since the Jacksonian

era regularly included the nomination of candidates at closed party conventions and the

distribution of pre-marked ballots at polling places. At the end of the nineteenth century,

Progressive politicians asserted state regulatory authority over elections, passing laws that

mandated direct primaries and secret ballots in an effort to clip the power of party machines. At

least thirty states had by 1900 specified procedures for the conduct of conventions and primary

elections.194 At the same time, states moved against partisan corporations, either categorically

    This evidence is based on searches in the HeinOnline Sessions Law data base, which yielded acts of

denying the incorporation of political clubs or tightening their control over nonprofit

corporations with partisan purposes.

         In Pennsylvania, courts seized on the legal rationale that the 1874 general act had not

explicitly included political groups in its list of qualified organizations. A precedent-setting

lower court opinion of 1889 held that clubs of Democrats and Republicans could incorporate

only if they described themselves purely as social organizations and not political ones.195 The

suspicion that a purportedly social and educational club was truly a partisan group similarly

thwarted the bid by a Republican club for a charter in 1897, with the judge declaring

emphatically that “the law does not authorize the incorporation of political clubs, and in all

reported cases the courts have refused charters where the articles of association disclosed a

political purpose.”196

         In 1900, New York took much the same step. Despite the legislature’s recent passage of

incorporation laws suggesting the contrary, the New York Supreme Court’s interpretation of the

state’s Primary Election Law of 1899 held that parties were no longer to be regarded as private

associations but as parts of the state. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Parker refused to

allow the Democratic General Committee of Kings County to expel an elected delegate because

he was disloyal to the principles of the party.197 The opinion differentiated the case from another

one tried by the same court in 1890, in which the justices decided that a party committee, as a

voluntary association, was free to conduct itself however it wished.198 The intervening passage

of the election reform law, however, had rendered that decision irrelevant. As Parker put it, “the

voluntary character of the county general committee has been destroyed.”199 Justice Cullin, who

argued that the Kings County Democratic Committee had the same rights as a corporation, stood

alone in dissent.200 In other states where political party groups retained access to incorporation,

moreover, corporate status lost its characteristic ability to confer autonomy from the state. In

Missouri, political groups still sought corporate status in the early years of the twentieth century,

but the legislature passed a statute in 1907 mandating the strict scrutiny of all “leagues,

committees, associations, or societies” that published material about candidates for public office.

Whether “incorporated or unincorporated,” the law made clear, such political groups had to fully

disclose all their sources of information, submit detailed reports on the amount of money they

raised, and provide the names and addresses of their contributors.201

         By the turn of the century, political parties no longer could operate with minimal

interference from the state. They had moved from being unregulated voluntary associations,

typically without corporate status, to being, much like earlier corporations, closely regulated

extensions of the state. Of course, political parties had never been privately organized in the

same way as most other voluntary groups. Politicians stood at their helms, and partisan positions

structured the work of public officials inside the government as well as informing the views of

private citizens within the electorate. Because parties were so deeply intertwined with the

incorporation (Missouri, like New York and Pennsylvania, was unusual for requiring judicial approval under its
general act of incorporation for voluntary groups). These applications date back to the mid-nineteenth century, but
explicitly partisan organizations did not request incorporation in significant numbers until 1901 (the state’s general
law of incorporation of 1879 specifically excluded groups with political purposes, but this language was dropped in
the 1889 version. [Missouri] Revised Statutes, 1879, § 978, p. 280; and 1889 Revised Statutes, 1889, Article 10, §
2829, p. 721 )]. The Missouri regulatory law of 1907 coincided with Congressional passage of the Tillman Act
forbidding corporate involvement in political campaigns.

government, meaningful constraints on their freedom were necessary to lower the high risks of

political corruption (Tammany Society, again, being a case in point). Theoretically, states or the

federal government could have regulated parties as corporations by adding provisions to

incorporation laws, but the state of Missouri proved to be unusual in taking this route. In

Pennsylvania and New York, where the general laws for nonprofit corporations were ambiguous

about the eligibility of partisan groups, justices chose to invalidate political corporations outright.

        It was in this context that Congress passed the Tillman Act of 1907 forbidding corporate

involvement in political campaigns.202 The Act was a reaction against corrupt political activities

of business corporations, specifically the insurance industry, not voluntary associations.

Understandably, the political influence of for-profit corporations was perceived as especially

dangerous, both because they commanded greater wealth than nonprofits and because the

government more actively regulated them. But it would be a mistake to think that the resurgence

of anti-corporate feeling that underlay the act was entirely directed towards business. The

Tillman Act expressed the same normative logic as the denial of corporate status to political

parties: corporations and politics should not mix.

        In the case of both political parties and labor unions, access to corporate rights widened at

roughly the same time as governments took other legal steps to curb their associational rights.

In some ways, the outcome by the turn of the twentieth century was very different for these two

types of groups. Unions remained unrecognized as legal entities, preferring to negotiate with

businesses without the backing of the state because of the dangers of judicial intervention.

Political parties, by contrast, assumed the legal status of entities through the government’s

enactment of campaign legislation, thereby losing their earlier freedom from state control. At the

same time, however, the common failure of both types of groups to gain the extensive

associational rights ordinarily held by corporations reveals an underlying similarity between

them. Both unions and political parties were socially and politically polarizing. They came

closer to incorporating than many other contentious groups of the period, in large part because of

their wide public acceptance and official support, but each of them ended the period besieged by

politically powerful foes. Their stories illustrate how difficult it was for polarizing groups to

acquire strong associational rights even after the great expansion of access to corporate status. In

the end, both groups acquired a set of associational rights via government regulation – parties

during the Progressive era, and unions during the New Deal – albeit they both still lacked, for

better and worse, the extraordinary degree of autonomy that nonprofit corporations had already

achieved by the end of the nineteenth century.203



        Conclusion

        From the Revolution to the turn of the twentieth century, public officials generally agreed

that corporations should stay out of politics at the same as they made essentially political

decisions about which voluntary associations could incorporate and what rights corporations

would receive. During the first decades of the nineteenth century, when politicians routinely

rewarded their partisan allies with charters, the nonprofit organizations that succeeded in

becoming corporations needed to appear, at least on the surface, to be nonpartisan. Churches,

colleges, mutual benefit societies, and other “educational or charitable” groups were ostensibly

worthy of charters because they served the common welfare, whereas groups that fostered social

and political change served only a dissident faction. Later in the century, the allocation of

charters generally ceased to be determined either by partisan loyalty or by the requirement that

corporations serve the common welfare. Yet fundamentally political decisions still defined

which groups had access to incorporation, and on what terms.

         As we have seen, the largest categories of groups chronically deprived of corporate rights

consisted of political parties, labor unions, and social reform societies. Organizations formed by

(or on behalf of) religious and ethnic minorities also experienced difficulty becoming

incorporated, more frequently at the beginning of the century than at the end. Meanwhile, the

overwhelming majority of voluntary associations that become corporations throughout the

century were uncontroversial, mainstream groups whose access to corporate rights frequently

depended on their acquiescence to the social and political status quo. This distinction between

politically acceptable and politically unacceptable voluntary associations persisted despite the

mid-century widening of access to corporate status; access to the corporate form remained

restricted to uncontroversial categories of associations. Although some organizations without

corporate status became able by the late nineteenth century to claim limited entity and

personhood rights, particularly the right to property, they, too, needed to conform to recognized

definitions of religion or “charity” (like the ones used for and against the Henry George book

fund).

         At the same time as this pattern of exclusion persisted, moreover, the rights of acceptable

nonprofit corporations grew even stronger, a development that made corporate status all the more

valuable. By the end of the century, the multiple benefits of incorporation included not only the

legal protections needed to accumulate large amounts of property and avoid membership

liability, but the ability to own stocks and control subsidiary corporations. In addition, the

reduced risk of judicial intervention in internal disputes bolstered the standard corporate right of
                                                                                                                  73


self-governance. As courts and legislatures paved the way to this enlarged field of potential

advantages, the state’s discriminatory role as gatekeeper still functioned much as it did in the

earlier era of special charters. Tocqueville to the contrary, the widespread freedom of individuals

to associate in American civil society never meant that the associations they formed were equally

free.

         This nineteenth-century history might lead one to think that removing the barriers to

corporate status would reduce the politicization of associational rights. Developments since

then, however, suggest otherwise.204 States in the mid-twentieth century eliminated almost all of

the restrictive categories and veto powers built into earlier general incorporation laws. Today,

nonprofit corporations can be organized by virtually anyone for virtually any purpose. The

opening of nearly complete access to incorporation has not, however, completely equalized

access to associational rights. Important vestiges of the nineteenth-century distinctions between

favored and disfavored groups survive, most notably in the federal tax code.205 The same types

of elite and religiously and culturally conservative nonprofit organizations that have always

found it easy to incorporate have disproportionately benefited from the right of their donors to

make tax-deductible contributions – a right that remains out of reach to “political” organizations

as well as to otherwise eligible “charitable” organizations without the resources to comply with

    On this shift, see especially Silber, A Corporate Form of Freedom. Already in the colonial period many churches
and other privileged categories of voluntary associations (and businesses) benefitted from tax-exempt status,
benefits that persisted through the nineteenth century. Until the inauguration of the federal income tax at the
beginning of the twentieth centuries, tax exemptions typically pertained only to property taxes on a group’s land and
did not confer any benefits to donors.

IRS requirements.206 Despite the fact that most nonprofit groups are permitted to claim

exemptions on all or part of the organization’s own income, the qualifications for this benefit still

varies substantially among different types of organizations. A labor union officially recognized

by the NLRB, for example, may take a deduction for its aid to striking workers whereas another

labor organization distributing aid to union members for the same authorized strike cannot.207

More well known is the right of nonprofit groups with political leanings, including organizations

registering in the “social welfare” category that permits legislative lobbying and limited election

spending, to conceal the identities of their donors in their tax filings. Political parties and PACs

classified as “political” (because their activities are “primarily” electoral), however, must

publicly disclose the names of their contributors.208 With these “extra” associational rights of

tax-deductibility and donor anonymity hanging in the balance, it is not surprising that IRS

employees, much like Judge Bird in 1888, struggle to distinguish between “charitable,” “social

    The most relevant sections of the Internal Revenue Code are sections 501(c)(3) (“Religious and Charitable “),

207
     This rule emerged from a 1976 IRS decision to deny a deduction to a group of workers belonging to “various”
unions who started a strike fund. The disqualification was based on the fact that it was composed of “private
persons” without the “authority” to represent its members in collective bargaining. IRS Publications, “IRC 501(c)(5)
Organizations,” p. J-16, at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicj03.pdf. Presumably meant to discourage union
members from forming non-union support organizations, seems to contradict the IRS definition of a qualified “labor
organization” as not restricted to unions (p. J-4), as well as other rulings in 1959 and 1974 that enabled non-union
groups to qualify for deductions (pp. J-5 and J-6). For a current treatise confirming that, in practice, “labor
organization” refers only to unions and union-controlled organizations (without explicitly stating that NLRB
certification is necessary), see Bruce R. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations, 11th ed. (Hoboken, N.J.:
Wiley & Sons, 2016) § 16.1, pp. 445-48. On the history behind the NLRB’s official recognition of unions, including
its costs to classes of excluded workers, see the chapter in this volume by Margaret Levi, Tania Melo, Barry

Since the U.S. Supreme Courts Citizen’s United decision in 2011 opened the doors to corporate campaign spending,
groups have extra incentives to file as “social welfare” organizations because they can report donations to
SuperPACs using the names of the organization rather than the names of the original donors. On these currently
controversial issues, see “Left and Right Object to I.R.S. Plan to Restrict Nonprofits’ Political Activity,” New York

welfare,” and “political” purposes. Henry George and his followers could today easily become a

nonprofit corporation with an entity right to receive property, but their association would most

likely still lack the full range of associational rights conferred by the law.

       In the century following the American Revolution, access to basic corporate rights clearly

provided advantages to the typically mainstream voluntary associations that most often acquired

them. A corollary of the systematic denial of such rights to politically dissidents and socially

marginal groups was to keep their associations relatively small and ephemeral. Tocqueville

himself may be forgiven for celebrating the liberty of United States citizens to associate. His

failure to perceive the unequal rights granted by the state to the voluntary associations they

formed, however, need no longer obscure our historical understanding of American civil society.
