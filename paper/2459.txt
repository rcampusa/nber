                    Trigger Strategies and Price Dynamics in
                       Equity and Foreign Exchange Markets




                                    ABSTRACT



        Trigger   strategists may be defined as actors i r asset markets
who buy or sell when the price reaches a pr edeter ml ned level; they
include participants in portfolio insurance schemes in equity
markets and central banks who i nterverie to defend an exchange rate
target zone. This paper presents an approach to rnodel.l ing the
effects of trigger strategists, with emphasis on how target zones
affect    market expectations. It is shown that. commitment to defend
a target zone will generate stabilizing expectations within the
band,    which may generate a "target zone honeymoon". an extended
period in which the announcement of a target zone stabilizes
exchange rates without any riced for action on the                    part    of

authorities. However, an imperfectly credible target zone is
vulnerable to crises in which the market tests the authorities'
resolve.

       A striking feature of financial markets in the lQBOs         is the
presence    of important participants who follow what we can call
ger        strategies -- that   is, who commit themselves to buy or
sell when the price    reaches some pr c—deter ml   ned 1 evol. I ri equity

markets the trigger strategy is followed by private investors
participating in portfolio insurance schemes, who order their
computers to sell stock when the price drops below a specified
level. In foreign exchange markets the trigger strategy is
followed by central banks, who intervene when the exchange rate
reaches the limit of a target zone.
     There are many questi ens that. riced to be answered r egar di ng
trigger strategies. When followed by private agents, are such
strategies rati orial? When followed by central banks, are they

welfare—improving? However, the first question we need to ask is a
descriptive one: how does the presence of trigger strategists
affect the dynamics of market behavior? Ever this is a highly
disputed question i ri practice. Many     observers     blame   port fall C)
insurance   schemes for the rnassi ye collapse of world equity prices
in October 187 others dismiss the idea. Defenders of' the
European Monetary System claim that the presence of intervention
limits gives rise t.o stabilizing expectations critics believe
that   the limits create targets for speculative attacks arid are
ultimately destabilizing.
     This paper presents an approach to modelling the effects of
trigger strategies on price dynamics. The underlying method is to
determine an equilibrium relationship between the "fundamentals"
that drive an asset market and asset prices. The presence of a
large group of trigger strategists alters this equilibrium in

                                   1
certain characteristic ways, which turn out to have a surprisingly
simple geometrical interpretation in terms of the concavity or
convexity of the relationship between fundamentals and prices.
Similar issues have been discussed in earlier work on price
dynamics, notably that of Flood and Garber (1983), but the
particular approach taken here is new, and seems to yield simpler

r esul ts.

      The paper begins by laying out a simple model of pricing in

an equity    market, then shows how this pricing    is   altered by   the
presenceof a large group of portfolio insurers. It then turns to
the more difficult case of' exchange rate determinati on under a
target zone regime, including the case where the commitment of
central banks to defense of that zone is imperfectly credible.
While   these  exampl es are of consi der- able interest in their own
                two

right, the paper has a broader purpose as well: the method
developed       here seems likely to be useful in a variety of
applications.

PROGRAM TRADING AND EQUITY PRICES



A   model of equity prim.

        We begin by laying out a simple model of' the determination of
prices in an equity market. This model is in the tradition of
financial market modelling associated with Tobin (1969): that         is,

it is a model of portfolio balance in which asset demands are

presumed     to arise   from some maximizing behavior, but are riot

explicitly      derived from utility maximization under uncertainty. In

                                     2
particular, we will consider only the effects of changes over time
in expected returns in affecting asset. demands, ignoring the
possible effects of changes in higher moments of the return.
        Consider, then, an asset which we take to represent the
aggregate of an equity market. This asset. yields a dividend per
period of     which fluctuates over time according to a process to
be described below. The asset has a price    so that the expected
rate of return from holding the asset from period t to period t±1
is



Cl)   nt
                               +

                                            — 1




where                is the expected price in t±1 as of period t.
        The        owners of equity consist of two kinds of people:
portfolio          insurers, and other investors. The non--insurers are
willing to hold a value of equity that depends on the expected
rate of return:



C2) PtQ =
                   HCrr)

where Q is the number of stocks they hold.
        To facilitate analysis, we approximate (2) by a log-linear
function, so that



(3)        +   q    =      +           —
                                                  + 'Ct+l   -




where lower—case letters represent natural logarithms. This may be
rewritten

                                                     3

      We     next introduce the                 portfolio insurers. They are assumed to

initially            hold a block of stocks, which they                      will sell whenever

the     price drops below a predetermined level                                     p)E.     Thus in
equilibrium            the          non—insurers must hold the rest of the stocks
until the price first                      drops below p*, and              all of the stocks
thereafter:



CS)   q=     q    -   q3E       if minCp) > p9E
        = q                     if minCp) < p*

where        q       is the logarithm of the                       total number            of stocks
outstanding.
        To       complete           the model ,    we need to      specify    how            which is

the   only       "fundamental" in the model, changes over time. It will be

assumed that              r follows a           random walk, of the         form


(6) r+1 =             r +6                 with    probability 0.5
                 =
                      r     -   6          with    probability 0.5


        This discrete random walk may appear somewhat special.
However,         it may         be defended at three levels. First, it                     can   be used

to approximate as closely as one likes a continuous diffusion
process, which is a popular assumption in the finance literature;
note that the variance of r          is simply 62 n. .econd, the
                                                        —



absence of drift or more complex dynamics in the fundamental can

                                                       4
be viewed as a way to eliminate all dynamic complications arising

from sources other than trigger strategies. and thus as a useful
way to concentrate on the problem at hand. Finally, the discrete
random walk assumed here is more convenient. than a continuous
process when we come to deal with the lack      of "smoothness" that we
will see is a characteristic feature of markets containing trigger

strategists.
       We have now laid out the basic elements of the model. The
next   step is to analyze the dynamics of prices.

ectati ons and price            behavior



       To   analyze the dynamics of price behavior, we must. move away
from representing variables as functions of time. Instead, we
think of the fundamental as taking on values corresponding to
"steps" of width           6.     Let step 0 represent the position
corresponding to the value of rt at some arbitrary date. Then any
subsequent realization of r can be labelled by the number of steps
i it is from this reference r, with

(7) rCi+1) = rCi)    + 6



       Whatwe now want to look for is a relationship between the
returns r(i) and the price of equity pCi). That is, we are looking
for a function that relates fundamentals to prices. If we can find
a function that will provide incentives to investors to behave in
the way the function predicts, we will in fact have found an
equilibrium.

                                           5
      As a first step, let us imagine what would happen if the
investors who are not portfolio insurers had static expectations,
notexpecting the price of the equity to change in any predictable
way. If     =      then from (4) we have



CS) pCi) = Ci + (D   1(ct   —
                                q   +   (rCi))

      This would lead to the situation illustrated in Figure 1. As
long as the portfolio insurers were still in the market, the price
                                          11
of equity would fluctuate along the line E E , defined by the

equation pCi) =      Cl     +       )1(a       -   Cq-q)   -   j?rCi)).   Once the
portfolio insurers had left the market, the price would fluctuate
along the line            defined by pCi) = Cl + (D 1Cct - q -             (rCi)).
The price after the por tfol i a insurers have left must be lower for

any given dividend rate, because the other investors have to be
given an incentive to hold a larger quantity of stock.

      In this static expectations world, it is easy to see how
portfolio insurance schemes can cause a stock market crash.
Suppose that initially the insurers are present, so that the price

fluctuates    along E1E1. Then          at some point the random motion of r
will bring the market to the point C, precipitating the exit of
the insurers and pushing the market into the other regime: that
is, a    small (perhaps infinitesimal) negative shock to the
fundamentals produces the Collapse of the Dow CD.

      This   may be a pretty good story f or what happened on October

19. However, in    general      we would not expect market dynamics to be
so simple, because the non—programmatic investors have an obvious
incentive to     foresee such events. Thus we next turn to the

                                           6
question of what happens if the market has rational expectations,
which take into account the effects of portfolio insurance schemes
on future prices.

         is helpful to define a new variable: the deviation of the
        It

equity price from what it would have been if expectations were
static. This may be written as

(9)    dCi)     pCi) — Cl   +   (D1Cc   —
                                            q   —
                                                    rCi))

        Now from any step i        there    is      an    equal probability that the
market       will move to steps i-i arid 1+1. Using this, together with
equation C4), we can write a difference equation in dCi):


(10) dCi) =      Cr/2)CdCi+1) + dCi—1))/C1               +   +
               = Cp/2)CdCi+1) + dCi—1))


        Notice    that this is not a difference equation over time: it
is    a difference equation defined over "steps". Its solution will
determine the value of'         p as a funtion of i and thus implictly as a
function of the fundamental rCi).

        The difference equation ClOD has two roots, both real with no

imaginary parts:


(11)    p1 = Cl + Cl   —    2)1/2)/     > 1



        p2
               Cl - Cl -    2)12)/      =
                                            1/p1 < 1

        The equilibrium relationship between i and d(i) must take the


                                            7
form


                 i   +    i
(12) dC1)      Ap1       Bp

where A and B may change when the regime shifts from one with the
portfolio insurers present to one in which they are gone.
       To determine equilibrium values of A and B, we need one
further, though reasonable assumption. This is that dCi), the
deviation of the price from its static expectations level, is
bounded to some maximum values both positive and negative. (Any
non-infinite bound will do). This is effectively a "no speculative

bubbles"    assumption, of the kind now very familiar, and it is made
without apology.
       Given this assumption, we may quickly determine the
equilibrium for the regime after the portfolio insurers have sold
out. Under this regime, i may take on any value, and will if we
give it long enough to walk randomly around. This means, however,
that for any nonzero A or B we will see dCi) exceeding its bound:
as i   goes to + we have         becoming unbounded, while as i goes to

—   we have          =
                         1/pt doing the same. So in the post—insurance
regime the only          equilibrium is where d(i) =     0   always. This
corresponds to the case where the price always lies on the line
£22.
  E in Figure 1.
       Until   the portfolio insurers drop out, however, we may have a
more i nt.er esti ng equi ii br I urn. The reason is that under this regime
i has a lower bound — the point at which the portfolio i risurers
leave the market. It is still possible that           can range up to +i,

so that to rule out speculative bubbles we must have A          0, but it



                                      8
 is still possible to have a nonzero B. Thus in the regime where
insurers have not yet sold out we have

C13) dCi) =   p2dCi—1)


      Thefundamentals-price relationship in this regime is tied
down by the fact that when the price falls below the trigger
level, there is a transition to the other regime. So the overall
picture must be as shown in Figure 2. The curve labelled
describes the behavior of prices while the portfolio insurers are
still in the market.     Eventually random   walking of r will bring the
market to C, leading the insurers to drop        out. After- that point,
the market's behavior will he described by the schedule labelled
£2.




The geometry of jjg strateq equilibrium


      The equilibrium illustrated in Figure 2 has             a useful
interpretation   that will be crucial in understanding the more
complex case of a target zone system treated in the remainder of
the paper. Notice that in the case where portfolio insurers have

not yet dropped out, the equity price lies below that which would
prevail with static expectations --     that   is, it must be the case
that the price is expected to fall. But how is this possible,
given that earnings follow a random walk? The answer lies in the
concaviti of the relationship between r and p. Because of the
curvature of the relationship, Jensen's inequality applies and the
expected change in p is negative. This observation can be turned


                                   9
around: whenever p lies below its static—expectations locus, the
fundamentals—price relationship must be concave (and whenever p
lies above, it must be convex). This provides a rule for    quickly
analyzing the qualitative characteristics of price behavior in
trigger strategy equilibria, as we will see in the target zone
case   as well.

       Note also what happens at point C, where the portfolio
insurers drop      out.   When the non—insurers have rational
expectations,     there is no step drop in        p;   instead, the
pre--programmed sale of assets is willingly purchased. The reason

for    this is the change in the curvature of the fundamentals—price
relationship. Just before the sell-out, this relationship is
concave; just after, it becomes linear. The expected change in p
therefore goes from negative to zero, implying a willingness of
investors other than participants in portfolio insurance schemes
to hold more equities -- with the equilibrium being constructed so
that. what they are willing to buy exactly matches what the
portfolio   insurers proceed to sell.



EXCHANGE RATE BEHAVIOR WITHIN A TARGET ZONE


     We now turn to the more elaborate issue of how the presence
of an exchange rate target. zone —— a band within which the
exchange rate is supposed to remain, and which central banks are
expected to somehow defend if necessary —— affects     exchange rate
behavior. Clearly the fact that the exchange rate will not be
allowed to go outside the band must have an effect on expectations
within the band; we would expect that as the exchange rate nears

                                  10
the top of the band it will be perceived that it has more room to
go down than up, and conversely at the bottom of the band. This in
turn should produce stabilizing expectations that tend to keep the
exchange     rate within the band even when the band is not   actively
being       defended. The objective here is to take these vague
expectations and justify them with a clear model. As we will see,
the possibility of an imperfectly credible target zone, and the
corresponding risk of crisis, can also be accommodated within this
framework.



The basic model



       As   in the equity market model, we consider a situation where
the exchange rate reflects both fundamentals and expected
appreciation and depreciation. In the target zone model ,     however,
it is also useful to make a distinction between the "shadow"
exchange rate, which is the exchange rate that would prevail at
each   moment if there were no action taken by the central banks,
arid the actual exchange rate. Inside the target zone the shadow
rate and the actual coincide, but when the shadow rate lies
outside the band the actual rate is constrained to lie at the
band's upper or lower limit.

       Expressed in natural logarithms, the shadow rate is
determined as follows:



(14)   s=x       +        —




where x represents the "fundamentals"      that   ultimately drive the


                                   11
exchange rate. A pure monetarist approach might identify x with
domestic credit, which is allowed to be reflected in money inside
the band but is offset by intervention when the limits are
reached; however, the model need not be construed in this
particular fashion, and x could represent the sum of a more
general set of influences.

        The   relationship      between fundamentals, expected future rate,

and shadow exchange rate may be rewritten



(15) S =      (l/C1+e))x + Ce/(l+e))s+1
          =           +
              Cl—X)xt   xtst+l

        We assume that the fundamental x follows a di.screte random
walk;



(16) x41 x + 6                with probability   0.5
                x     -   6   with probability 0.5


        Finally, the actual exchange rate depends on the shadow
exchange rate and on the            target zone. We assume that the exchange
rate is not allowed to go            above a maximum value of s or below a
minimum       value of s. The determination of the actual rate is
therefore described by

C17) s = s        if s >
          =      if   s >       >

          =sifs < s



                                          12
         Exactly how this band is enforced will not, be specified.
Again in a purely monetary model we could envisage unsterilized
intervention that, offsets domestic credit creation when the
exchange rate hits the limits of the band, but the general
framework can be considered to apply to other policy measures as
wel 1.

         It will be helpful if we choose units so that the target zone
is centered around a zero logarithm of the exchange rate:


(18) s = -- s



         We can then conveniently label the step" corresponding to a
zero x as zero, so that (again using the notation that. relates
variables t.o steps rather than time periods)

 19 XCI) =        16


Exchange rate behavior inside the get zone


         Inside   the target zone the actual exchange rate is equal to
its   shadow value. What we want to do is find a function relating
the exchange rate to I, which is then implicitly a relationshup
between s and x. If t.here were static expectations, sCi) would

simply equal x(i);        this   provides a useful reference line. Define
dCi) as the difference between the exchange rate and the
fundamental s,



(20) dCi)         sd) —   x(i)

                                       13
Then from (1) and (16) we have


(21) d(i) =   (/2)dCi+1)              +   (X/2)dCi--1)


     This difference equation has two positive, real roots:



(22) p1 =   X1(1        +   (1   -   X2)1"2J   > 1

     p2 =               — ci - 2)1/2]          =
                                                   l/p1   < 1



     Any solution inside the band must take the form



(23) dCi)         Ap        Bp

     This may be simplified by exploiting the symmetry we have
imposed on the problem. Since the band is centered around zero,
and since there is no drift in the assumed process generating
fundamentals, the exchange rate should be symmetric around zero.
In particular, sCO) must equal zero. This can only be true if B =

-A, so that the solution takes the form


(24) dCi) =                 -
                  A(p           pJ

      We    can confirm that this is indeed a symmetric function,   by
noting that


(2) dC—i) = AUp1' - p21]
              =
                  A[p -

                                                   14
                 -dCi)


        We   can immediately make a guess about what   the   relationship
between fundamentals and the exchange rate must look like; this is
shown  in Figure 3. Within the band the exchange rate must lie
along an S-shaped curve, lying below the 45° line in the upper
half of the band, above the 45° line in the lower half. In the
right hand part of the S the curve is concave, providing through
Jensen's inequality the expected decline in the exchange rate that
in turn keeps the curve below the 45° line. In the left hand part
of the S the curve is convex, providing the expected rise that
keeps the rate above the line. A curve of precisely this shape
will be generated by equation (24) if A is negative: the deviation
of the exchange rate from xCi) will then be negative and growing
for i>O, and reversed for i<O.
     We know, then, the general shape of' the exchange rate curve
within the target zone. We can also see directly that the
expectation that the target zone will be defended does stabilize
exchange rates within the band. The slope of the S—curve is always

less    than 45°, so that changes in the fundamentals are reflected
less    than fully in the exchange rate; correspondingly, the
exchange     rate will remain within the band without intervention for
values of x that would have placed s outside the band in the
absence of a target zone.
        To go further, it is necessary to tie down the S—curve.
Algebraically,      this means determining A in equation C24).
Geometrically     (and economically),   what we need to do   is determine
the level of x (or equivalently the step i) at which the S-curve
intersects the band. That is, at what level of the fundamentals do
the authorities have to make good on their promise to defend an
exchange rate target zone?



Lui     down the ends of the S



       Let I be the step at which the S-curve intersects the upper
limit of the target zone. (It must correspondingly intersect the
lower limit   at   -I, but the symmetry of the problem allows us to
focus only on the upper end). The economic meaning of I is that
when the fundamental drifts up to x(I)            the   exchange rate would
overstep the bounds of the zone unless the authorities intervene.
This   implies that I is the lowest value of i such that

(26) sCI) > s

     Consider the elements determining the shadow exchange rate at
the upper boundary of the target zone. The shadow exchange rate is
a weighted average of the fundamentals, the exchange rate at the
next lower step, and the exchange rate at the next higher step:

(27) sCI)     (i—X)x(I) + CX/2)sCI—l)      +   CX/2)s(I+l)

       This may be restated as a relationship between deviations
from the fundamental level, as

(28) d(I) =   CX/2)d(I—1)   +   Ck/2)dCi+1)



                                      16
where d(I) = sCI)        —
                             xCI).
       Now step I-i lies inside the band, and therefore is
determined by (24). This implies that it can be related to d(I),
by the expression

(28)   dCI—1) =
                  dCI)Cp — p1)/(p — p)

       From step I to step 1+1 the actual     exchange rate does not
change: in both cases it lies at the top of the band, at s.
However, xCI+1) =        x(I)    ÷ 6. Thus



C30) dCI-f-1) =   dCI)       6



       So (28) can be rewritten


(31) d(I) =
              CX/2)fdCI)Cp1
                                     —
                                              p)   +       dCI)   —   6]


       We can now divide through by dCI) to get an expression for
d(I)/dCI); the equilibrium is the lowest value of I f or which this
ratio is   lower than one. We have


(32)   dCI)/d(I) = (X/2)ECp1 — p)/Cp — p)              +    1 — 6/dCI)J


       The shape of (32) is illustrated in Figure 4. Define                f   as   the
step   at which xCi) = s. Then at I close to I, d(I) is negative and

close to zero, so that the third term in (32) becomes unboundedly
large. On   the other side, as I goes to infinity the third term
vanishes and the expression approaches a limit of

                                         17
C X/2) (1           < 1
            i/p13

The curve must therefore cross 1 from above, giving us an
equilibrium I.



A numerical example


       Figure 5 shows a computation of the         relationship   between

fundamentals and exchange rates based upon some quasi—realistic
parameters. The assumptions are as follows:



Period length: 0.01 years
X:    0.9975 (implies that 1 percent annual rate of expected
             depreciation reduces actual exchange rate by 4
                percent).
6: 0.02 (implies annual standard deviation of          exchange rate in
            absence   of target zone of 20 percent).

5:    0, 10 (target zone 20 percent wide, 10 percent above and below
            reference exchange rate)


       In the absence of a target zone the exchange rate would
simply move up and down the 45° line in Figure 5. It would cross
the    boundaries of the indicated band at "steps" 5 and —5, that is,
when the fundamental x got 10 percent.    its starting point. The
                                            of f

commitment     to defending the target zone creates stabilizing
expectations that greatly widen the range of fundamentals that
lead    to an outcome within the band. Specifically, the crossing


                                     18
point I turns out to occur at step 17          that is, when the
fundamentals are 34 percent away from their starting point.
     Because of its strong effect in stabilizing expectations, a
commitment to a target zone that is regarded as credible is likely
to succeed in stabilizing the exchange rate for an extended period
without   actually requiring any action from the authorities. One
measure of this stabilizing effect is the expected length of time
that the exchange rate will remain inside the band without
intervention. In this numerical example, there is a 50 percent
probability that in the absence of a target zone the exchange rate
would lie outside a 20 percent—wide band within 19 periods --   that
is, within 0. 19 years, or about 10 weeks. With a totally credible
commitment by the authorities to defend such a 20 percent zone,
there is a 50 percent probability that no action on the
authorities' part will be necessary for 219 periods, or mor-e than

two years!
     This seems to suggest that announcing a commitment to defend
a target zone is a highly attractive action for politicians, since
large rewards in exchange rate stability will result immediately,
while the bill in terms of policy actions will not come due for
some time. We can think of this as the "target zone honeymoon"; it

is similar in a way to the initial capital inflows that result
when a country with a crawling peg slows the crawl in an effort to
reduce inflation (Connolly and Taylor 1984). A substantial
honeymoon effect may well have taken place in 1987, when markets
probably gave politicians more credit f or a willingness to act
than they deserved. However, in general we would expect the market
to discount promises to some extent, so that the next question is


                                19
what happens when the target zone is only partially credible.


Credibility and crises


       Suppose that the market believes that there is only a
probability     that    the announced target zone will actually be
defended if challenged, and that with probability 1- the exchange
rate will actually be allowed t. move beyond the band. This will
clearly affect the dynamics of the exchange rate within the band:

stabilizing expectations will be weaker, and the expected length
of time before the authorities' resolve is challenged will be
shorter.

       Let     be the step on which the target zone is tested in the

case of partial credibility. What happens at this step is that an
incipient movement of the exchange rate beyond the band either
does or does not bring forth the promised defense. If the defense
is    provided, the authorities are now credible, and the exchange
rate jumps to its full credibility level sCI). If the defense is
not provided, the market has discovered that it is living under a
free float, and the exchange rate jumps to its floating level
xCI). Thus the expected exchange rate at l, which must equal
the shadow rate at-    that point, is

                = ØsCI)     +
                                Cl-)X(Ipc)

The    challenge to the target zone therefore takes place at the
lowest i f or which              > s. With the expected exchange rate
tied down at I and —I, the exchange rate behavior between

                                     20
these bounds is described by a "squeezed" S—curve obeying equation
(24) and connecting these end points.
     Figure 6 shows the exchange rate's behavior in our numerical
example when the market believes that there is only a O percent
chance that the authorities will actually defend the target zone.
The 10 percent band is now challenged after only 8 steps fr-om
zero, that is, after fundamentals have moved .16 percent away from
their starting point. There is still significant stabilization of
the exchange rate within the band, but the expected longevity of
the "target zone honeymoon" is greatly reduced: there is now a O
percent chance that the band will be challenged within 49 periods,
or about 6 months.

        An interesting feature of the functioning of an          imperfectly
credible     target zone is that more or less continuous movement of
the fundamental determinants of the exchange rate gives rise to a
discontinuous movement of the exchange rate itself: when the
exchange rate drifts up to the edge of the zone, there is a
"crisis" in which the exchange rate jumps. The reason why such
crises are not ruled out by rational expectations is that the
exchange rate may jump either way —         into   the band or out of it ——
with     the expected jump being zero.             However, the role of
i   rnper fecti y cr edi bi e target zones in   generating   crises may   hel p
explain why there are occasional eras of turbulence" under
managed exchange rates, a point noted by Mussa (1979).

CONCLtJSI ONS



        This paper has offered a general method for analyzing markets

                                      21
containing trigger strategists, arid two   applications,   of which the

analysis of target zones is the more extensive and probably the

most important.
        The method is to look for an equilibrium relationship between

the fundamental determinants of an asset price and its actual
price. Surprisingly, the curvature of this relationship plays a
crucial role, with concavity or convexity creating the
expectations of rising or falling asset prices that drive
deviations    from the static expectations case.
        The application to exchange r-ate target zones reveals
three    important features of such zones that are widely understood
but not reflected in formal analysis. First, the presence of a
commitment by authorities to keep the exchange rate within a band
tends to stabilize the movement of the exchange rate even inside
that band. Second, announcement of a target zone will normally
provide a "target zone honeymoon": an extended period of time in
which stabilizing expectations keep the exchange rate within the
band without any need f or official action. Third, an imperfectly
credible target zone system will give rise to crises in which the
market challenges the commitment of the authorities to defend the

zone.

        The   models offered in   this paper are of course highly
simplified     and abstract. However, the conclusions seem plausible.
and the method used here can be applied to more complex and
realistic models in the future.
