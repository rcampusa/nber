                                         ABSTRACT

We construct and estimate an endogenous growth model with debt and equity financing frictions
to understand the relation between business cycle fluctuations and long-term growth. The
presence of spillover effects from R&D imply an endogenous relation between productivity
growth and the state of the economy. A large contractionary shock to equity financing in the 2001
recession led to a persistent growth slowdown that was more severe than in the 2008 recession.
Equity (debt) financing shocks are more important for explaining R&D (physical) investment.
Therefore, these two financing shocks affect the economy over different horizons.

    Abstract

    We construct and estimate an endogenous growth model with debt and equity financing frictions
    to understand the relation between business cycle fluctuations and long-term growth. The presence
    of spillover effects from R&D imply an endogenous relation between productivity growth and the
    state of the economy. A large contractionary shock to equity financing in the 2001 recession led
    to a persistent growth slowdown that was more severe than in the 2008 recession. Equity (debt)
    financing shocks are more important for explaining R&D (physical) investment. Therefore, these
    two financing shocks affect the economy over different horizons.

1   1. Introduction

2         Macroeconomic growth rates exhibit low-frequency patterns often associated with innovation
3   and technological change. The advent of electricity and the introduction of computers are each
4   associated with persistent waves in the trend component of productivity.1 Aggregate patterns in
5   innovative activity, as measured by research and development (R&D) expenditures, are closely
6   related to waves in external equity financing. For example, the R&D boom in the 1990s was
7   fueled by an expansion in the supply of equity finance, while the sharp decline in R&D in the early

8    2000s coincided with a contraction in supply.2 Despite the efforts in the growth literature, there
9    is no consensus on the macroeconomic or financial origins of prolonged productivity slowdowns
10   and the subsequent recoveries. In particular, there is substantial disagreement in projecting the
11   long-run effects of the recent Great Recession on economic growth (e.g., Summers (2013)).3
12          In this paper we quantitatively explore the role of macroeconomic and financial shocks for
13   understanding economic growth and business cycle fluctuations in a Dynamic Stochastic General
14   Equilibrium (DSGE) model (e.g., Christiano et al. (2005)) with two key departures. First, our
15   model features endogenous technological progress through vertical innovations (e.g., Aghion and
16   Howitt (1992), Grossman and Helpman (1991), Barlevy (2004b), and Peretto (1999)) and endoge-
17   nous utilization of existing technologies. In equilibrium, total factor productivity (TFP) growth is
18   endogenously related to knowledge accumulation through R&D and technology utilization rates.
19   The presence of spillover effects from knowledge accumulation provides a link between business
20   cycle fluctuations and long-term growth.
21          Second, the model incorporates explicit roles for firms’ debt and equity financing along with
22   frictions associated with adjusting capital structure following Jermann and Quadrini (2012). Debt
23   is preferred over equity due to a tax advantage, however borrowing is limited by an enforcement
24   constraint. The intangible nature of the knowledge stock implies that it provides poor collateral
25   to creditors (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny (1992)). We capture this link between asset tangibility and
26   liquidation values by assuming that only physical capital is pledgeable as collateral in the debt
27   contract. We also model financial shocks that affect the ease to which firms can access external
28   financing. The equity financing shock is captured by disturbances to the cost function for net
29   equity payouts. Following Jermann and Quadrini (2012), the debt financing shock is modeled as
30   disturbances to liquidation values in the enforcement constraint for the debt contract.
31          We conduct a structural estimation of the model using standard macroeconomic data, together
32   with the newly-released series for R&D investment and the series for net debt issuance and net
33   equity financing. Thus, our results are disciplined by the joint observation of macroeconomic
34   dynamics and financing flows. Given that only physical capital (and not knowledge capital) is

        2
         Brown et al. (2009) provide micro-evidence showing shifts in the supply of external equity finance can explain
     most of the 1990s boom in R&D.

         Benigno and Fornaro (2015), Gordon (2014), and Fernald (2014) are examples that provide opposing views.



                                                             2
35   pledgeable as collateral, shocks to liquidation values have a stronger impact on the marginal value
36   of physical investment relative to R&D investment. Consequently, we find that the debt financing
37   shocks are relatively more important for explaining physical investment dynamics, while equity
38   financing shocks are relatively more important for explaining R&D investment dynamics. Due to
39   the presence of spillover effects from the accumulation of the knowledge stock, shocks that have
40   a sizable effect on R&D investment also have a significant impact on growth rates in the long run.
41   Therefore, accounting for the tangibility of assets in the enforcement constraint and the produc-
42   tion externalities implies that debt financing shocks have immediate effects on macroeconomic
43   variables, while the effect of equity financing shocks builds over time.
44      Our model-implied TFP can be decomposed into an exogenous and an endogenous component.
45   The exogenous component is represented by a stationary TFP shock. The endogenous component
46   can be further decomposed into knowledge accumulation and technology utilization. Both of these
47   components provide a link between TFP and the state of the economy. We interpret technology
48   utilization as the absorptive capacity of the firm with respect to the ability to adapt raw knowledge
49   to the production process. The stock of knowledge is accumulated through R&D investment, then
50   resources are expended for the stock of knowledge to be utilized in production. Given that it is
51   more difficult to make large adjustments to a stock (knowledge capital) rather than a flow (technol-
52   ogy utilization) input, we find that higher-frequency disturbances are absorbed by the technology
53   utilization margin. In the estimated model, the endogenous component of TFP explains most of
54   the variability in TFP growth through technology utilization. In contrast, the accumulation of
55   knowledge is primarily related to long-run trends in TFP growth.
56      Accounting for these two margins of technology adjustment, R&D accumulation and technol-
57   ogy utilization, has important implications for the consequences of a recession, especially over
58   longer horizons. We find that the Great Recession was associated with a large drop in utilization
59   rates, while R&D was not equally affected. In contrast, during the 2001 recession there was a
60   significant decline in R&D investment after the bust of the information technology (IT) boom.
61   Controlling for the size of the two recessions, the decline in R&D investment – and therefore
62   knowledge accumulation – was substantially more pronounced in the 2001 recession than in the
63   2008 recession. Also, the decline in knowledge accumulation started in the 2001 recession, while
64   the 2008 recession exacerbated the pre-existing downward trend.


                                                      3
65      Consequently, while the 2008 recession was substantially more severe in the short-term, our
66   model suggests that trend growth was less affected during the Great Recession compared to the
67   2001 recession when controlling for the relative size of the two recessions. Importantly, the decline
68   in R&D and the low frequency component of TFP growth started with the 2001 recession, which
69   accords with the empirical evidence from Fernald (2014). The current model projections suggest
70   that long-run growth prospects remained relatively stable during the 2008 recession, however, our
71   results also imply that if market conditions did not improve, R&D would eventually start declining.
72      We then move to interpret these results in light of the different sources of financing. Specifi-
73   cally, we use two counterfactual simulations to account for the different behavior of the economy
74   during the two recessions. The 2001 recession coincided with the end of the IT boom, an event
75   that particularly affected high tech firms (i.e., high R&D intensity firms) that rely on equity issues
76   to finance R&D investment. Our model captures this fact through the dynamics of the equity fi-
77   nancing shock. We compare the actual data with a counterfactual simulation in which all shocks
78   are set to zero starting from the first quarter of 2000, except for the shocks to equity financing that
79   are instead left unchanged. This exercise shows that the bulk of the decline in knowledge growth
80   that started with the 2001 recession can be captured by a sequence of contractionary shocks to
81   equity financing that is consistent with microevidence (e.g., Brown et al. (2009)). The large ad-
82   verse shocks to equity financing that coincided with the 2001 recession led to a persistent decline
83   in R&D, which in the context of our model implies a long-lasting adverse effect on trend growth.
84      In contrast, the 2008 recession originated from a severe financial crisis. We then show that
85   a counterfactual experiment in which all shocks are set to zero – except for the debt financing
86   shock – closely tracks the large decline in real activity during the Great Recession, but that it
87   only had a limited impact on the accumulation of knowledge. This is consistent with our im-
88   pulse response analysis that shows that shocks to collateral values have an immediate impact on
89   investment in physical capital and R&D. However, the impact on R&D, and therefore long-term
90   growth prospects, is less pronounced than when the economic contraction originates from a shock
91   to equity financing.
92      Further, counterfactual experiments suggest that during the Great Recession, accommodative
93   monetary and fiscal policies helped to stabilize both R&D rates and the utilization of existing tech-
94   nology, which has important consequences on the trend component of productivity. In a model


                                                       4
 95   with exogenous growth, TFP and trend growth do not depend on policymakers’ actions. As a re-
 96   sult, these models generally imply a steady and relatively fast return to the trend, independent from
 97   the actions undertaken by the fiscal and monetary authorities. Instead, in the present model sus-
 98   taining demand during a severe recession can deeply affect the medium- and long-term outcomes
 99   for the economy. This result has important implications for the role of policy intervention dur-
100   ing recessions. For example, we believe that the link between policy interventions and growth is
101   particularly salient in light of the recent debate on the consequences of performing fiscal consolida-
102   tions during recessions (Alesina and Ardagna (2010) and Guajardo et al. (2014) provide opposing
103   views).
104      The endogenous growth mechanism generates positive responses in consumption and invest-
105   ment to debt financing shocks, which is sometimes a challenge in DSGE models (e.g., Barro and
106   King (1984)). In standard DSGE models, positive investment shocks often lead to a decline (or an
107   initial decline) in consumption, while investment, hours, and output increase. In our model, the
108   investment shocks are amplified, as they affect TFP growth through the knowledge accumulation
109   and endogenous TFP channels. Thus, a positive investment shock increases output more than in
110   the standard models without the endogenous technology margins, which helps our model generate
111   a positive consumption response. Finally, monetary policy shocks induce positive comovement
112   between measured productivity and inflation, consistent with evidence from Evans and dos Santos
113   (2002).
114      Our approach of estimating a structural model helps to elucidate the link between R&D,
115   growth, and business cycle dynamics. Due to data limitations, it would be hard to learn about
116   the impact of R&D by only looking at its effect on growth decades later. Instead, our endogenous
117   growth framework imposes joint economic restrictions on the evolution of macroeconomic quan-
118   tities at short- and long-horizons. Therefore, conditional on the model, the dynamics at business
119   cycle frequencies are also informative about the low-frequency behavior of the economy. This is
120   because, given a parametric specification, the deep parameters that govern high- and low-frequency
121   movements are invariant and can be inferred by examining fluctuations at all frequencies.
122      This paper is related to the literature linking business cycles to growth. Barlevy (2004a) and
123   Barlevy (2007) show that the welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations are higher in an endoge-
124   nous growth framework due to the adverse effects of uncertainty on trend growth. Basu et al.

125   (2006) explore the impact of technological change on labor and capital inputs over the business
126   cycle. Kung and Schmid (2014) examine the asset pricing implications of a stochastic endogenous
127   growth model and relate the R&D-driven low-frequency cycles in growth to long-run risks. Kung
128   (2014) builds a New Keynesian model of endogenous growth and shows how the model can ra-
129   tionalize key term structure facts. In the context of the asset pricing literature on long-run risks
130   based on the work by Bansal and Yaron (2004), our results imply that financing shocks, typically
131   associated with business cycle fluctuations, are an important source of low-frequency movements
132   in consumption growth. Guerron-Quintana and Jinnai (2013) use a stochastic endogenous growth
133   model to analyze the effect of liquidity shocks on trend growth.
134       We also relate to papers examining the causes and long-term impact of the Great Recession.
135   Benigno and Fornaro (2015) analyzes how animal spirits can generate a long-lasting liquidity trap
136   in a New Keynesian growth model with multiple equilibria. Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014)
137   illustrate how a debt deleveraging shock can induce a persistent, or even permanent, economic
138   slowdown in a New Keynesian model with overlapping generations. Christiano et al. (2014a)
139   show how interactions of financial frictions with a zero lower bound constraint on nominal interest
140   rates in a DSGE framework can help explain the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates during
141   the Great Recession. Bianchi and Melosi (2014) link the outcomes of the Great Recession to
142   policy uncertainty. Our paper focuses on the effects of the Great Recession through the R&D and
143   technology adoption margins, and thus, we view our contribution as complementary to the existing
144   literature.
145       The financial frictions in our DSGE model relate to a vast literature (see, among many others,
146   Bernanke et al. (1999), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), and Christiano et al. (2014b). We closely
147   follow Jermann and Quadrini (2012) in modeling the financial frictions and financial shocks that
148   affect the substitution between debt and equity. Explicitly accounting for the differences in collater-
149   alizability between physical and knowledge capital relates to Garcia-Macia (2017). We differ from
150   these papers by incorporating an endogenous growth margin, which allows us to study the impact
151   of external financing shocks on macroeconomic variables, including TFP and R&D, at different
152   horizons.
153       This paper makes two methodological contributions with respect to the existing literature. We
154   embed an endogenous growth framework in a medium-size DSGE model with nominal rigidities.


                                                        6
155   Second, we structurally estimate the model using Bayesian methods. To the best of our knowl-
156   edge, this is the first paper that estimates a quantitative model of the business cycle augmented
157   with endogenous growth and technology utilization by using data on the amount of R&D invest-
158   ment. In this respect, our work is related to, but differs from the seminal contribution of Comin
159   and Gertler (2006) and the subsequent work by Anzoategui et al. (2016) across several dimensions.
160   First, our model incorporates financial constraints and external financing shocks. These explicit
161   financial elements allow us to have different interpretations of the 2001 and 2008 recessions, and
162   in particular, for explaining the divergence in R&D dynamics during the two events. Our inter-
163   pretation of the two recessions relate to differences in debt and equity financing conditions, while
164   Anzoategui et al. (2016) relate to differences in R&D productivity. Second, we make use of the
165   recently released series for quarterly R&D investment to inform us on the process of knowledge
166   accumulation. Finally, these papers use an endogenous growth framework with horizontal innova-
167   tions (i.e., expanding variety model of Romer (1990)) whereas we use a growth model with vertical
168   innovations.
169      The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the model. Section 3 presents the
170   estimates. Section 4 studies the Great Recession and the 2001 Recession in light of our model.
171   Section 5 present an analysis of the model across different frequency intervals. Section 6 concludes.


172   2. Model

173      The benchmark model is a medium-scale DSGE model with endogenous growth and tech-
174   nology utilization. The endogenous growth production setting of within-firm vertical innovations
175   follows Kung (2014), the financial structure is modeled following Jermann and Quadrini (2012),
176   and the additional macroeconomic frictions and shocks are standard in the literature and taken
177   from Christiano et al. (2005).

196   where λw is the wage mark-up. Employment agencies purchase labor from the households, package
197   the labor inputs, and sell it to the intermediate goods firms. The first-order condition from profit
198   maximization yields the following demand schedule:

                                                                       1`λw

200   The aggregate wage index paid by the intermediate firms for the packaged labor input Lt is given
201   by the following rule:

203   The household sets wages subject to nominal rigidities. In particular, a fraction 1 ´ ζw can readjust
204   wages. The remaining households that cannot readjust wages will set them according the following
205   indexation rule, W j,t “ W j,t´1 pΠt´1 Mn,t´1 qιw pΠ ¨ Mn q1´ιw , where Mn,t ” Nt {Nt´1 , Mn is the steady-

208   2.2. Firms

209       A representative firm produces the final consumption goods in a perfectly competitive market.
210   The firm uses a continuum of differentiated intermediate goods, Y j,t , as input in the CES production
211   technology:
                                                          ˆż 1                   ˙λ f,t

213   where λ f,t is the markup over marginal cost for intermediate goods firms and evolves in logs as an
214   AR(1) process, logpλ f,t q “ p1 ´ ρλ f q logpλ f q ` ρλ f logpλ f,t´1 q ` σλ f λ f ,t , where λ f ,t „ Np0, 1q.
215       The profit maximization problem of the firm yields the following isoelastic demand schedule


216                                            Y j,t “ Yt pP j,t {Pt q´λ f,t {pλ f,t ´1q ,


217   where Pt is the price of the final goods and P j,t is the price of intermediate good j. The price of
218   final goods is obtained by integrating over the intermediate goods prices.
219       The intermediate good j is produced by a price-setting monopolist using the following produc-
220   tion function:
221                                            Y j,t “ pukj,t K j,t qα pZ j,t L j,t q1´α ,

222   and measured TFP at the firm level is Z j,t ” At punj,t N j,t qη punt Nt q1´η , where K j,t is physical capital,
223   N j,t is knowledge capital, ukj,t is the physical capital utilization rate, unj,t is the technology utilization
                   ş1                                                                      ş1
224   rate, unt ” 0 unj,t d j is the aggregate technology utilization rate, Nt ” 0 N j,t d j is the aggregate
225   stock of R&D capital, and p1 ´ ηq P r0, 1s represents the degree of spillovers over the utilized
226   stock of knowledge. This specification of technology spillovers assumes that there are positive
227   externalities from the creation of new knowledge and the increased utilization of the knowledge
228   stock. Increased utilization requires increased maintenance costs in terms of investment goods per
229   unit of physical or knowledge capital measured by the function ai pui q, for i “ k, n (in the steady-
230   state ai pui q “ 0). We interpret technology utilization as the absorptive capacity of the firm with
231   respect to the ability to adapt raw knowledge to the production process (e.g., Cohen and Levinthal
232   (1990)).

                                                                    9
233          The variable At represents a stationary aggregate productivity shock that is common across
234   firms and evolves in logs as an AR(1) process, at “ p1´ρa qa‹ `ρa at´1 `σa a,t , where at ” logpAt q,
235   a,t „ Np0, 1q is an i.i.d. shock, and a‹ is the unconditional mean of at .
236          The intermediate firm j accumulates physical capital according to the following law of motion:


237                                    K j,t`1 “ p1 ´ δk qK j,t ` r1 ´ Ψk pI j,t {I j,t´1 qs I j,t ,


238   where δk is the depreciation rate, I j,t is physical investment, Ψk is a convex adjustment cost function
239   (in the steady-state Ψk “ 0 “ Ψ1k ). Knowledge capital is accumulated by firm j according to:


240                                   N j,t`1 “ p1 ´ δn qN j,t ` r1 ´ Ψn pS j,t {S j,t´1 qs S j,t ,


241   where δn is the depreciation rate, S j,t is R&D investment, and Ψn is a convex adjustment cost
242   function (in the steady-state, Ψn “ 0 “ Ψ1n ).
243          Intermediate firms face nominal price adjustment costs following Rotemberg’s approach:

                                                                                          ι p ˘2

                                                                `
244




245   where φR is the magnitude of the costs, ι p is the degree of indexation of prices, Π is steady-state
246   inflation and Πt´1 is the inflation in the previous period.
247          The financial structure of intermediate firms is modeled following Jermann and Quadrini (2012).
248   Firms use equity and debt to finance their operations. Debt is preferred to equity because of
249   the tax advantage (e.g., Hennessy and Whited (2005)). The effective gross rate paid by firms is
250   Rt “ 1 ` rt p1 ´ τq, where τ captures the tax benefits of debt.
251          Firms also face adjustment costs for net equity payouts that affect the substitution between debt
252   and equity financing:


253                                 ΓD pD j,t , D j,t´1 q “ 0.5φD pD j,t {D j,t´1 ´ ζD,t ∆Dq2 Yt ,


254   where ∆D is the steady-state growth of the net equity payout and φD is the magnitude of the costs.4

         4
             The growth rate specification for the equity payout adjustment costs is well-defined in our estimation as the net


                                                                   10
255   The variable ζD,t represents a mean one shock to the target growth rate of net equity payouts and
256   evolves as, logpζD,t q “ ρζD logpζD,t´1 q ` σζD ζD ,t , where ζD ,t „ Np0, 1q. We refer to ζD,t as an equity
257   financing shock. This shock captures unspecified changes in aggregate market conditions affecting
258   equity payouts/financing, which is in similar spirit as Belo et al. (2016).
259       The firms use intra- and intertemporal debt. The intraperiod debt, Xt , is used to finance pay-
260   ments made before the realization of revenues at the beginning of the period and is repaid at the
261   end of the period with zero interest. The size of the intraperiod loan is equal to


262             X j,t “ Wt L j,t ` Pt I j,t {ζΥ,t ` Pt S j,t ` Pt ΓP pP j,t , P j,t´1 q ` Pt D j,t ` Pt ΓD pD j,t , D j,t´1 q

263                                                           `Pt ak pukj,t qKt ` Pt an punj,t qNt ` B j,t`1 {Rt ´ B j,t .
264




265   The budget constraint of the firm is:


266             Wt L j,t ` Pt I j,t {ζΥ,t ` Pt S j,t ` Pt ΓP pP j,t , P j,t´1 q ` Pt D j,t ` Pt ΓD pD j,t , D j,t´1 q “

                                                    P j,t Y j,t ´ Pt ak pukj,t qKt ` an punj,t qNt ` B j,t`1 {Rt ´ B j,t .
                                                                    `                             ˘
267
268




269   Therefore, the size of the intraperiod loan is equal to the revenues, X j,t “ P j,t Y j,t . The intra-
270   and intertemporal debt capacity of the firms is constrained by the limited enforceability of debt
271   contracts. In particular, firms can default on their debt obligations after the realization of revenues
272   but before repaying the intraperiod loan. It assumed that the lender will not be able to recover the
273   funds raised by the intraperiod loan in the event of default.
274       We allow for changes in the relative price of physical investment to capture technological
275   progress that affects the rate of transformation between consumption and investment, but that is
276   not directly linked to the accumulation of knowledge through R&D investment. The currency
277   price of the consumption good is Pt , the currency price of a unit of investment good is Pt ζΥ,t
                                                                                                   ´1
                                                                                                       . The
278   law of motion for ζΥ,t
                         ´1
                             is given by, logpζΥ,t q “ ρζΥ logpζΥ,t´1 q ` σζΥ ζΥ ,t , where Υ,t „ Np0, 1q.
279   Variation in the relative price of investment is needed mostly to correctly measure the process of
280   physical capital accumulation that occurred in the US starting from World War II.
281       The intangible nature of knowledge capital implies that it provides poor collateral to creditors.

      equity payout series is positive in our data sample.


                                                                    11
282   We capture this notion, in reduced-form, by assuming that knowledge capital, N j,t , has a zero
283   liquidation value in the event of default while the liquidation value of physical capital, K j,t , is
284   positive, but uncertain, at the time of contracting. Uncertainty in the liquidation value of physical
285   capital is modeled as follows. With probability ζB,t the lender can recover the full value of physical
286   capital, but with probability 1 ´ ζB,t the recovery rate is zero. As shown in Jermann and Quadrini
287   (2012), the renegotiation process between the firm and lender implies the following enforcement
288   constraint:
289                                   X j,t ď ζB,t rK j,t`1 ´ B j,t`1 {pPt p1 ` rt qqs .

290   We label ζB,t as a debt financing shock. This shock is interpreted as unspecified disturbances in
291   aggregate market conditions affecting liquidation values for physical capital, and therefore debt
292   capacity. The law of motion for ζB,t is given by, logpζB,t q “ p1 ´ ρζB qζB ` ρζB logpζB,t´1 q ` σζB ζB ,t ,
293   where ζB ,t „ Np0, 1q.
294       The intermediate firms maximize shareholder value subject to the real and financial constraints
295   outlined above. A detailed characterization of the intermediate firm’s program is outlined in Sec-
296   tion 1 of the Online Appendix.

297   2.3. Market Clearing and Fiscal Authority

298       The market clearing condition for this economy is Ct ` ζΥ,t
                                                                  ´1
                                                                      It ` S t `Gt “ YtG , where Gt denotes
299   government expenditures and YtG is measured GDP (i.e., YtG “ Yt ´ak pukt qKt ´an punt qNt ´ΓP,t ´ΓD,t ).
300   The government raises lump-sum taxes to finance government expenditures and the tax shield for
301   firms:
302                                   Pt T t “ PtGt ` Bt`1 p1{Rt ´ 1{p1 ` rt qq .

303   Government expenditure follows an exogenous law of motion, ĝt “ ρg ĝt´1 ` σg g,t , where g,t „

305   2.4. Monetary Policy

306       The central bank sets the nominal interest rate according to a feedback rule:

                                                                     ”                                 ı1´ρr
                                                                ρr
307              p1 ` rt q{p1 ` rq “ pp1 ` rt´1 q{p1 ` rqq               pΠt {Π˚t qφπ           4φdy
                                                                                        p∆Yt {∆Yq              eσr r,t ,



                                                             12
308   where 1 ` r, and ∆Y are the steady-state values of the nominal interest rate and output growth,
309   respectively; Π˚t is the inflation target. The central bank responds to deviations in inflation and
310   annualized output growth from their respective target levels. Unanticipated deviations from the
311   interest rate rule are captured by r,t „ Np0, 1q.
312      The target for inflation, Π˚t , is assumed to follow an autoregressive process, π˚t “ p1 ´ ρπ q π˚ `
313   ρπ π˚t´1 ` σπ π,t , where π˚t “ logpΠ˚t q, π˚ “ logpΠq is the steady state inflation target, and π,t „
314   Np0, 1q. We allow for changes in the target to accommodate the possibility that the inflationary
315   stance of the Federal Reserve has changed over time. An alternative approach would consist of
316   explicitly modeling changes in monetary policy as in Bianchi (2013). While we regard this as an
317   interesting path for future research, at this stage it would add an unnecessary layer of complexity.

318   2.5. TFP Decomposition

319      Imposing the symmetric equilibrium conditions, the aggregate variable output Yrt can be ex-
320   pressed as:
321                                             Yrt “ pZt Lt q1´α Ktα ,

322   where aggregate measured TFP, Zt , is endogenous and depends on technology utilization and the
323   knowledge stock:
324                                                Zt ” At unt Nt .

325   As in Comin and Gertler (2006) and Kung and Schmid (2014), the trend component in TFP, Nt , is
326   endogenous and time-varying. For the discussion of the results below, we define at ” logpAt q as
327   the exogenous stationary shock to TFP, unt is the technology utilization rate, Nt is the knowledge
328   stock.

329   2.6. Solving the Model

330      The trend component in TFP, Nt , is endogenous. In order to induce stationarity, aggregate
331   variables, such as, consumption, R&D, investment, output and government expenditures, are nor-
332   malized by Nt . Once the model is rewritten in terms of stationary variables, the nonstochastic
333   steady state can be computed, which includes the endogenous trend growth rate, ∆N. After obtain-
334   ing the non-stochastic steady state values, we log-linearly approximate the equations around the



                                                           13
335   steady-state values (the linearized equations are in the Online Appendix). In the linearized approx-
336   imation, we follow Jermann and Quadrini (2012) and conjecture that the enforcement constraint is
337   always binding.5


338   3. Estimates

339          This section presents the main estimation results. We estimate the model using a Metropolis
340   Hastings algorithm. As observables, we use eleven series of U.S. quarterly data: real GDP per
341   capita, annualized quarterly inflation, the federal funds rate (FFR), real consumption per capita,
342   physical investment in terms of consumption units, R&D investment in terms of consumption
343   units, hours, the growth rate of real wages, the relative price of investment, net debt issuance, and
344   net equity payout.
345          All macroeconomic variables, except for inflation and the FFR, enter as log differences and
346   are downloaded from the BEA website and the Federal Reserve website. The sample spans from
347   1955:Q1 to 2011:Q3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that makes use of
348   the newly released series for quarterly R&D in a structural estimation. Following Jermann and
349   Quadrini (2012), the two financial series are calculated using data from the flow of funds accounts
350   of the Federal Reserve Board. Net equity payout is calculated as ‘Nonfinancial corporate business;
351   net dividends paid’ minus ‘Nonfinancial corporate business; corporate equities; liability’. Net debt
352   issuance is ‘Nonfinancial corporate business; debt securities and loans; liability’. Both series are
353   divided by business value added.

354   3.1. Parameter Estimates

355          Table 1 reports priors, modes, and 90% error bands for the model parameters. The priors are
356   diffuse and in line with the literature. For the parameters that characterize the endogenous growth
357   mechanism, we choose diffuse priors and take an agnostic view on their likely values, given that
358   there is no previous evidence to guide us. We also specify a prior on the steady-state trend growth
359   rate: 100∆N „ N p.45, .05q. Given that steady state growth in the model is a function of several
360   model parameters, this choice translates in a joint prior on these model parameters.

         5
             The constraint is always binding given a sufficiently large tax advantage τ and sufficiently small shocks.



                                                                  14
361      The posterior parameter estimates suggest a significant degree of price stickiness and habit
362   formation consistent with the literature (e.g., Altig et al. (2011) and Del Negro et al. (2007)). We
363   find higher adjustment costs for the knowledge stock relative to the capital stock (i.e., Ψ2n ą Ψ2k ),
364   which helps to capture the fact that R&D expenditure dynamics are more persistent than physical
365   investment dynamics. On the other hand, the low value of a2n implies that the technology utilization
366   rate is very responsive to changes in the marginal return on the knowledge stock. We interpret these
367   two findings as implying that R&D needs to be carried on consistently over time in order to produce
368   significant results and that the important margin for technology adjustment in the short-run relies
369   on varying the utilization rate for the knowledge stock. The estimated value for the knowledge
370   spillover parameter, η, implies that the R&D spillover is around 2.59 times the private return,
371   1 ´ η, in line with microevidence from Griliches (1992) and Bloom et al. (2013).
372      The estimated parameters governing the debt financing shock are consistent with the values
373   from Jermann and Quadrini (2012). Both the debt and equity financing shocks are quite persistent,
374   however, the equity financing shock is more volatile than the debt financing shock, capturing the
375   large swings in equity payouts and issuance over the sample. The estimated parameter governing
376   the tax advantage of debt, τ, is similar to the calibrated value from Jermann and Quadrini (2012).
377      Given that in the model we have less shocks than observables (10 versus 11), we include ob-
378   servation errors on all variables, except for the FFR and the relative price of investment. Figure 1
379   in the Online Appendix reports the path of the actual variables together with the path implied by
380   the model. We find that observation errors play a minor role for all variables. Their importance is
381   more visible for the net equity payout series, but even in this case, the majority of the fluctuations
382   are explained well by the model, and only very high frequency fluctuations are explained by the
383   observation error.

384   3.2. Impulse responses

385      This section illustrates the key model mechanisms through impulse response functions. This
386   analysis provides a foundation for analyzing the 2001 and 2008 recessions through the lens of
387   our model (explored below in Section 4). Before proceeding, recall that the model-implied TFP
388   consists of three different components: The stationary technology shock, the technology utilization




                                                       15
389   rate, and the knowledge stock. Namely:


390                                  T FPt “       At        ˚      unt        ˚      Nt .
                                               Tech. Shock       Utilization       Knowledge


391   The product of technology utilization and adopted knowledge is labeled as the endogenous com-
392   ponent of TFP, Ne,t “ unt Nt , which includes the endogenous trend component. The stationary tech-
393   nology shock, At , is the exogenous component of TFP. These definitions imply that TFP growth
394   and the endogenous component of TFP can be expressed as:


                                      ∆t f pt “         ∆at ` ∆ne,t ,
                                                     ∆Exogenous   ∆Endogenous

395   where we have used lower case letters to denote the logs of the corresponding economic variables.
396      Figure 1 displays impulse response functions from a negative debt financing shock (contraction
397   in debt financing). A negative shock reduces the collateral value of physical capital and tightens
398   the enforcement constraint. Given the frictions in substituting between debt and equity, tighter
399   financial constraints reduce demand for factor inputs and utilization rates, which is reflected in
400   the fall in physical investment, R&D investment, and eventually, in labor hours. The fall in R&D
401   and technology utilization reduces measured TFP, and lowers trend growth due to the presence of
402   aggregate knowledge spillovers. The sizable and immediate drop in TFP makes the debt financing
403   shock act as a cost-push shock, increasing inflation on impact. Overall, the decline in production
404   inputs reduces output and consumption. Importantly, the decline in physical investment is more
405   substantial than the fall in R&D. This is due to the assumption that only physical capital, and
406   not knowledge capital, is collateralizable. Therefore, the marginal value of an additional unit of
407   physical investment is directly tied to its impact on the enforcement constraint through the ex-post
408   liquidation value of the firm, in contrast to R&D investment, which does not impact liquidation val-
409   ues directly. Consequently, physical investment is more responsive to shocks affecting liquidation
410   values.
411      The model also produces positive comovement in consumption and investment, which is a
412   challenge for standard medium-size DSGE models such as Christiano et al. (2005). For example,



                                                             16
413   after a negative debt financing shock, the drop in R&D and technology utilization magnify the
414   output response by affecting both the level and trend components of TFP persistently. Lower
415   current and future levels of output consequently induce a similar consumption response. The
416   positive comovement of macroeconomic quantities to debt financing shocks allow these shocks
417   to be an important driver of business cycles movements.
418      Figure 2 plots impulse response functions to a positive equity financing shock (contraction in
419   equity financing). This shock induces a different response of the macroeconomy compared to the
420   debt financing shock that unfolds over a significantly longer period of time. A positive shock to the
421   net equity payout target (in the adjustment cost function) increases equity payouts to households.
422   An increase in equity payouts reduces the resources available to the firm for production inputs, and
423   is exacerbated by costs affecting the substitution between debt and equity. As a result, demand falls
424   for production inputs, reflected by a drop in physical investment, R&D investment, labor hours,
425   and utilization rates. The fall in production inputs translates into a decline in TFP and output.
426      In contrast to a contractionary debt financing shock, consumption increases on impact to a
427   contractionary equity financing shock due to the large initial increase in financial income from
428   higher equity payouts. However, consumption eventually declines as aggregate income declines
429   persistently. Furthermore, R&D investment is affected more by an equity financing shock than
430   physical investment, which is the opposite relation of the responses to a debt financing shock.
431   Given that the dynamics of physical investment are closely tied to debt through the enforcement
432   constraint, but not R&D investment, R&D is more responsive to shocks affecting equity financing
433   (and internal cash flows). As the equity financing shock has a larger impact on R&D, the effect on
434   trend growth is also more pronounced due to the presence of spillover effects from R&D. Thus,
435   the equity financing shock has an effect that grows over the time horizon, which is in contrast to
436   the debt financing shock which generates an immediate contraction in the macroeconomy. These
437   key differences in the responses to the equity and debt financing shocks are important for capturing
438   salient features of the 2001 and 2008 recessions, which are explored in Section 4.
439      Figure 3 displays the impulse response functions to a contractionary monetary policy shock. A
440   tightening of monetary policy increases the FFR and lowers the price level. Due to sticky prices,
441   aggregate demand falls and the real rate rises, which discourages investment in physical capital and
442   R&D. The decline in R&D and the endogenous component of TFP leads to a decline in TFP after


                                                       17
443   a contractionary monetary policy shock, consistent with empirical evidence from Evans and dos
444   Santos (2002). Further, the drop in R&D lowers the trend component of TFP due to the endogenous
445   growth channel.


446   4. A Tale of Two Recessions

447      The most recent recession has generated concerns about the possibility of a prolonged slow-
448   down. Following the speech delivered by Larry Summers (Summers (2013)), some economists
449   have become interested in the possibility of a “secular stagnation” similar to the one that character-
450   ized the aftermath of the Great Depression according to Hansen (1939). Eggertsson and Mehrotra
451   (2014) build a model that can deliver secular stagnation as a result of household deleveraging or a
452   decline in the population growth rate. Gordon (2014) argues that the US might be heading toward a
453   prolonged period of reduced growth. On the other hand, using projections from a calibrated model,
454   Fernald (2014) finds that trend growth remained stable after the Great Recession.
455      Our model provides a useful framework to address these concerns from a quantitative point of
456   view, given the strong linkages between business cycle fluctuations and long term growth. Thus, in
457   this section we use our model to understand the differences between the two most recent recessions
458   in 2001 and 2008. Figure 4 analyzes the Great Recession through the lens of our model. The solid
459   blue line reports smoothed estimates at the posterior mode for investment, knowledge growth,
460   and the endogenous component of TFP over the past 15 years. The red dashed line describes
461   a counterfactual simulation in which all policy shocks are set to zero since the beginning of the
462   financial crisis. Specifically, starting from the first quarter of 2008 we set the filtered government
463   expenditure shocks, monetary policy shocks, and inflation target shocks to zero.
464      The first aspect that emerges from this analysis is that while the 2008 recession implied a signif-
465   icant fall in physical investment, the growth rate for the knowledge stock was less affected. Instead,
466   the fall in investment was associated with a significant and persistent decline in the technology uti-
467   lization rate to account for the decline in the marginal return of the knowledge input. As a result,
468   the endogenous component of TFP fell significantly. Interestingly, this pattern was reversed during
469   the 2001 recession. In the 2001 recession, the economy experienced a relatively small fall in phys-
470   ical investment, a substantial fall in the growth rate of knowledge (after the large accumulation
471   of R&D during the IT boom in the 1990’s), and only a relatively modest decline in endogenous

                                                       18
472   TFP. The knowledge growth rate did not fully recover, but instead, stabilized at a lower level un-
473   til the 2008 recession. The decline in the growth rate of knowledge during the 2008 recession is
474   relatively smaller when taking into account that the 2008 recession was significantly more severe.
475   Specifically, over the period 2001:Q1-2001:Q4, R&D investment declined by ´6.99%, while over
476   the period 2007:Q4-2009:Q2 the decline in R&D investment was ´3.35%. The difference in these
477   figures appears even larger when considering that during the 2001 recession the decline in Capital
478   investment was around a tenth of its decline over the 2008 recession (´2.52% vs. ´29.70%).
479          In what follows, we show that these events can be interpreted from the perspective of changes in
480   the market conditions to external equity and debt financing. The 2001 recession coincided with the
481   end of the IT boom and significant contraction in the supply of equity finance. Notably, this event
482   particularly affected young tech firms (i.e., high R&D intensity firms that were the main driver of
483   the 90’s R&D boom) that primarily use external equity as a marginal source of funds. Our model
484   captures this fact through the behavior of the equity financing shock. Figure 5 compares the actual
485   data with a counterfactual simulation in which all shocks are set to zero starting from 2000:Q1
486   except for the equity financing shocks that are instead left unchanged. Note that the counterfactual
487   simulation captures remarkably well the decline in knowledge growth that started with the 2001
488   recession.
489          As illustrated in the previous section through impulse responses, contractionary shocks to eq-
490   uity financing lead to a persistent decline in the accumulation of knowledge that unfolds over
491   several periods. Since R&D projects are often characterized by a high degree of asymmetric in-
492   formation and low asset tangibility, debt financing is more limited – this dimension is captured
493   in the model by the assumption that the knowledge stock cannot be used as collateral in the debt
494   contract. The large adverse shocks to equity financing that coincided with the 2001 recession led
495   to a persistent decline in R&D, which implies a long-lasting adverse effect on trend growth.
496          In contrast, the 2008 recession originated from a severe financial crisis that more significantly
497   impacted debt capital markets.6 Figure 6 considers a similar exercise as above, but instead focuses
498   on the 2008 recession in the context of the debt financing shock. The solid blue line corresponds
499   to the actual data, while the red dashed line reports a counterfactual in which all shocks are set to

         6
             Net debt issuance decreased 150% while net equity payouts decreased by 80%.



                                                              19
500   zero starting from 2008:Q1, except for the debt financing shock. Note that the counterfactual series
501   captures very well the behavior of the growth of the investment in physical capital and the growth
502   of the endogenous component of TFP. On the other hand, it misses the large decline in knowledge
503   growth. As discussed in the impulse responses, debt financing shocks have a smaller effect on R&D
504   investment relative to physical investment. As a consequence, the decline in the marginal return
505   for the technology input (from the decline in investment) was mostly absorbed by sharp decline
506   technology utilization rather than a reduction in R&D. Accordingly, the level of endogenous TFP
507   fell precipitously, but the trend component of endogenous TFP was not as adversely affected by
508   the shock.
509       Therefore, our estimated model delivers two distinct interpretations for the 2001 and 2008
510   recessions. The results are disciplined by the fact that we use measures of debt and equity financing
511   as in Jermann and Quadrini (2012), in addition to macroeconomic variables, including R&D flows.
512   Nevertheless, it is interesting to show that our story lines up with the evidence that can be extracted
513   from series not directly used in our estimation exercise.
514       The top panel of Figure 7 plots the R&D series for high tech firms (dash-dot black line), non-
515   high tech firms (dashed blue line), and all firms (solid red line) as a percentage of GDP. Observe
516   that the R&D of the tech firms drive most of the fluctuations in aggregate R&D dynamics and these
517   firms have steadily increased their share of R&D expenditures relative to non-tech firms since the
518   1980’s. Thus, shocks to the financial constraints of high tech firms have important consequences
519   for aggregate innovation dynamics. The middle panel plots R&D expenditures (dashed blue line),
520   cash flow (solid red line), and net equity payout (dashed black line) as a percentage of GDP for tech
521   firms, while the bottom panel plots the same series for non-tech firms.7 From the middle panel, we
522   can see that the persistent decline in R&D for tech firms following the 2001 recession coincides
523   with a sharp decline in cash flow and an increase in net equity payout. In contrast, the drop in
524   R&D after the 2008 recession was only short-lived as there was a quick rebound in R&D, cash
525   flows fell significantly less than during the 2001 recession, and net equity payout was less volatile.
526   For non-tech firms, the three series are relatively stable compared to the tech firms, reaffirming the
527   fact that tech firms are the key drivers of innovation over the past three to four decades.

          7
            Section 3 in the Online Appendix provides details on the construction of the data series. Tech firms are defined as
      firms with the following SIC code: 283, 357, 366, 367, 382, 384 or 737.


                                                                20
528      This analysis above has important implications for assessing the long-term consequences of the
529   Great Recession. The decline in TFP experienced during the 2008 recession is largely explained
530   by a reduction in technology utilization, as opposed to a fall in knowledge accumulation. However,
531   while the adverse effects of the Great Recession on knowledge accumulation was not commensu-
532   rate to its sizable impact on the rest of the economy, such as physical investment, the relatively
533   moderate contraction in R&D investment still exacerbated a pre-existing decline in trend growth
534   that started with the 2001 recession. Furthermore, as shown by our impulse responses, a slowdown
535   in the technology utilization rate persists for many years, suggesting that a significant amount of
536   time is required for economic growth prospects to return to steady-state. During this time, in-
537   centives for engaging in R&D are also affected, and therefore, a longer recession exacerbates the
538   long-term consequences on growth. Thus, our analysis should not be interpreted as saying that the
539   2008 recession was inconsequential for long-term dynamics.
540      In this respect, it is interesting to analyze the role of policymakers’ behavior. Modeling uncon-
541   ventional monetary policy or changes in policy rules is beyond the scope of the paper. However, it
542   is still instructive to study the implications of policy shocks. Given that we do not explicitly model
543   the zero lower bound and forward guidance, our model captures the prolonged period of near zero
544   interest rates as expansionary monetary policy. The counterfactual simulation reported in Figure
545   4 shows that absent monetary and fiscal policy shocks, the growth rate of knowledge would have
546   been only mildly affected, but the extent of the recovery in investment and technology utilization
547   would have been much more contained.
548      These results have important implications for the role of policy interventions during recessions.
549   In models with exogenous growth, TFP and trend growth does not depend on policymakers’ ac-
550   tions. As a result, these models generally predict a steady and relatively fast return to the long-term
551   trend, independent from the actions undertaken by the fiscal and monetary authorities. Instead, in
552   the present model sustaining demand during a severe recession can deeply affect the medium- and
553   long-term consequences for the economy. Of course, policymakers cannot intervene each period to
554   permanently alter the trend growth rate of the economy. This would violate the notion of the equi-
555   librium steady-state and be subject to the Lucas critique. However, policymakers can substantially
556   reduce the long-term consequences of a recession.

557   5. Additional Implications

558      In this section, we decompose the behavior of the different components of TFP, provide external
559   validity for the technology utilization margin, and show that our model mechanisms are robust to
560   alternative model specifications and in different data samples.

561   5.1. Different TFP Components

562      The endogenous component of TFP (Ne,t ” unt ˚ Nt ) captures the bulk of the fluctuations in
563   the model-implied measured TFP growth, through changes in the stationary technology utilization
564   margin (unt ), while the long-term trend growth component, the knowledge stock (Nt ), is quite sta-
565   ble and persistent. The level of technology utilization is a persistent stationary process, but the
566   growth rate exhibits business cycle fluctuations that are able to explain a significant portion of
567   the high-frequency TFP growth fluctuations. Therefore, technology utilization provides a growth
568   propagation mechanism at higher frequencies while knowledge accumulation provides a growth
569   propagation mechanism at lower frequencies. In principle, the exogenous component of TFP (at )
570   could account for all business cycle fluctuations in TFP growth. However, our estimation favors the
571   endogenous technology utilization margin over the exogenous TFP shock for explaining business
572   cycle fluctuations in TFP growth. Evidently, the data prefers the positive co-movement between
573   TFP and business cycle dynamics induced by changes in technology utilization.
574      Table 2 decomposes the model-implied variance of the observed variables and the components
575   of the model-implied TFP across three frequency intervals. Long-term frequencies correspond
576   to cycles of more than 50 years, medium-term frequencies are associated with cycles between 8
577   and 50 years, whereas business cycle frequencies correspond to cycles of a duration between 0.5
578   and 8 years. For all the observed variables, the volatility at medium-term frequencies plays a
579   significant role. In fact, for the FFR, labor hours, and R&D growth more than 50% of volatility is
580   explained by medium-term fluctuations. Furthermore, for consumption growth, investment growth,
581   and GDP growth, the variance of the medium-term and business cycle components are quite similar
582   in magnitude, providing further evidence of the importance of studying jointly business cycle and
583   lower frequency fluctuations. Quite interestingly, medium-term fluctuations are also important for
584   explaining financial cycles. Not surprisingly, a large fraction of the estimated variation for net
585   equity payouts occurs at low frequencies, in line with the observed behavior of this variable over

                                                      22
586   the sample (see Figure 1 in the Online Appendix).
587      For the model-implied TFP, the decomposition across frequencies varies mostly because of the
588   dynamics of its endogenous components, technology utilization and the knowledge stock. The
589   growth rate of TFP and the endogenous component of TFP exhibit fluctuations mostly at business
590   cycle frequencies primarily through variation in the technology utilization margin. On the other
591   hand, the fluctuations in the growth rate of the knowledge stock occur mostly at low frequencies,
592   and to some extent, at medium-term frequencies, which is attributed to the high R&D adjustment
593   costs.
594      Overall, most of the variation in the model-implied TFP is attributed to the movements in the
595   endogenous TFP component, and the fraction is more significant at lower frequencies. Figure
596   8 provides a visual characterization of this result by plotting the evolution of the model-implied
597   TFP growth (dashed black line), the endogenous component of TFP (solid blue line), and knowl-
598   edge growth (red dashed-dotted line). These series are obtained by extracting the corresponding
599   smoothed series based on the posterior mode estimates. Consistent with the variance decomposi-
600   tion, measured TFP growth appears substantially more volatile than the growth rate of knowledge
601   itself. In principle, such large fluctuations could be explained by changes in the exogenous com-
602   ponent of TFP. However, from visual inspection, it is evident that changes in the endogenous com-
603   ponent of TFP capture the bulk of the fluctuations in TFP growth mainly through adjustments in
604   technology utilization. In particular, the endogenous component tracks quite closely the medium-
605   term fluctuations in TFP, whereas the exogenous fluctuations are significantly smaller and are more
606   important at higher frequencies. In sum, this figure provides support for the finding that the most
607   important margin for explaining TFP growth dynamics consists of changes in endogenous TFP –
608   primarily through adjustments in technology utilization rates – as opposed to exogenous distur-
609   bances to technology captured by the stationary technology shock.

610   5.2. External Validity

611      We provide corroborating evidence for the important role played by the endogenous technology
612   utilization channel by comparing our latent utilization series with two empirical proxies, software
613   expenditures and investment in information processing equipment, both of which are obtained from
614   the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). As explained above, changes in technology utilization


                                                      23
615   represent the most important margin for producing significant variation in the endogenous com-
616   ponent of TFP growth, especially at business cycle and medium-term frequencies. We find that
617   the correlation between our technology utilization measure and software expenditures is 0.84 at
618   business cycle and medium-term frequencies while the correlation with investment in information
619   processing equipment is 0.50.8 Given that these two empirical measures are not directly used in
620   our estimation, these correlations provide external validity for our technology utilization margin.
621          Our technology utilization series also qualitatively replicates the low-frequency patterns of
622   the two empirical measures. Namely, the growth rate of software expenditures and information
623   processing equipment are higher in the first half of the sample. Despite not using these two data
624   series as observables, technology utilization in our model is also higher in the beginning of the
625   sample, to partially account for the opposing low-frequency trends in R&D and measured TFP
626   (i.e., TFP growth is higher in the first half of the sample while R&D growth is higher in the second
627   half). The finding that technology utilization is above trend over the first half of the sample is
628   consistent with several contributions that have studied US macroeconomic dynamics over the post
629   World-War II period. A popular narrative argues that the US economy was, on average, above
630   potential in the 1960s and 1970s, and that this resulted in a progressive increase in inflation (e.g.,
631   Orphanides (2002)). In our model, technology utilization responds positively to the state of the
632   economy. Thus, our finding that technology utilization contributed to higher TFP at the beginning
633   of the sample is internally consistent.

634   5.3. Alternative Specifications

635          Section 4 of the Online Appendix considers the estimation of an extension of the benchmark
636   model where the technology utilization rate is modeled as a slow-moving accumulation process,
637   unj,t “ p1 ´ ρn qunj,t ` ρn unj,t´1 , where unj,t are firm expenditures towards technology utilization and
638   p1 ´ ρn q captures the depreciation rate of utilized technology. In our benchmark model, we assume
639   a flow specification for technology utilization. Therefore, this extension assumes that technology
640   utilization depreciates partially rather than fully each period. Figures 3, 4, and 5 in the Online Ap-
641   pendix compare the impulse response functions from an estimated version of this extended model

         8
          The volatility of our utilization measure is also quantitatively similar to that of software expenditures both at
      business cycle and medium-term frequencies.



                                                               24
642   and from the benchmark model. Overall, both model specifications imply a similar propagation
643   of financial and macroeconomic shocks. Importantly, technology utilization is the main driver of
644   business cycle fluctuations in TFP growth in this extension, consistent with the benchmark model.
645          We favor the more parsimonious specification for technology utilization in the benchmark for
646   two primary reasons. First, given that the implications of the two models are quite similar, the
647   streamlined specification helps us to emphasize the role of the financial constraints and financial
648   shocks, which are the focal points of the paper. Second, the data prefers the flow specification for
649   technology utilization over the stock specification in our likelihood-based estimation. We reach
650   this conclusion as the marginal data density is larger and the observation errors are smaller in the
651   benchmark model relative to the extended model.
652          Given that there was an important Securities Exchange Committee (SEC) regulatory change
653   in 1982 that affected payout policy (e.g., Grullon and Michaely (2002)), we also estimate our
654   benchmark model in the post-1982 sample. Figures 6, 7, and 8 in the Online Appendix compare
655   the impulse response functions from the post-1982 estimation and the full sample estimation. The
656   responses, including that of the equity financing shock, are qualitatively similar between the two
657   samples, suggesting the robustness of our estimation results to the regulatory change. We also
658   compare our latent equity financing shock (the key driver of payout fluctuations in our model)
659   with an aggregate measure of external equity issuance costs from Belo et al. (2016) to provide
660   corroborating evidence.9 A higher value of their measure corresponds to lower equity issuance
661   costs. The correlation between our shock and the inverse of their measure is 0.69 over the entire
662   sample and 0.64 in the post-1982 sample.


663   6. Conclusions

664          In this paper, we build and estimate a medium-size DSGE model that features endogenous
665   technological progress and financial frictions. Total factor productivity in our model consists of
666   two endogenous components, the knowledge stock and technology utilization, that drive macroe-
667   conomic fluctuations across different frequencies. Positive externalities from knowledge accu-
668   mulation provide a economic channel linking macroeconomic and financial shocks to persistent

         9
          They construct their external equity issuance cost measure by relating it to the volume of external equity issuance
      and the debt-to-capital ratio in a factor structure.

                                                               25
669   movements in long-term growth prospects. In contrast, endogenous technology utilization pro-
670   vides a strong business cycle propagation mechanism. Due to differences in the liquidation values
671   of physical versus knowledge capital, we find that debt financing shocks have large and immediate
672   impact on the macroeconomy through physical investment, whereas equity financing shocks have
673   long-lasting effects on growth that build over time through the sizable effects on R&D investment.
674      We use our estimated model to interpret the two most recent recessions in 2001 and 2008, and
675   to quantitatively assess their long-run consequences on economic growth. First, we identify large
676   contractionary shocks to debt financing in the 2008 recession that led to a significant decline in
677   physical investment and endogenous TFP, however knowledge accumulation was less affected. In
678   the context of our growth model, this implies that the most recent recession had severe conse-
679   quences in the short- and medium-term, but long-run growth prospects remained relatively stable.
680   The opposite was true during the 2001 recession, which was milder in the short term, as physical
681   investment and technology utilization were less affected, but large contractionary shocks to equity
682   financing triggered a sizable and persistent decline in knowledge growth.

The solid blue line reports smoothed estimates at the posterior mode for Investment, knowledge growth, and the
endogenous part of TFP over the past 14 years. The red dashed line corresponds to a counterfactual simulation in
which monetary and fiscal shocks are removed starting from the first quarter of 2008.

Figure 7: Financing of R&D for High Tech and Non-High Tech Firms. This figure depicts the financing and R&D
patterns for tech firms and non tech firms. In Panel (a), the solid red line reports R&D investment as percentage of GDP
for all firms. The the dash-dot black line and dashed blue line show R&D investment as percentage of GDP for tech
and non tech firms, respectively. Panel (b) reports cash flow, R&D and net equity payout for tech firms (first figure)
and non tech firms (second figure). The red solid line shows cash flow as percentage of GDP, the dashed blue line
depicts R&D investment (as percentage of GDP) and the dash-dot black line shows net equity payout (as percentage of
GDP). Tech firms are firms with the SIC code: 283, 357, 366, 367, 382, 384 or 737. Section 3 of the Online Appendix
describes the data employed.
