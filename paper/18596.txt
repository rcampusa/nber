                                              ABSTRACT

Can directed technical change be used to combat climate change? We construct new firm-level panel
data on auto industry innovation distinguishing between "dirty" (internal combustion engine) and "clean"
(e.g. electric and hybrid) patents across 80 countries over several decades. We show that firms tend to
innovate relatively more in clean technologies when they face higher tax-inclusive fuel prices. Furthermore,
there is path dependence in the type of innovation both from aggregate spillovers and from the firm's
own innovation history. Using our model we simulate the increases in carbon taxes needed to allow
clean to overtake dirty technologies.

1     Introduction

With increasing concern over climate change there is much interest in how new technolo-
gies can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Many climate

change models assume exogenous technological change (e.g. Stern, 2006), but dealing
with the challenge of global warming almost certainly requires more climate change re-
lated innovation (e.g. Henderson and Newell, 2011). But what policies can be used to

achieve this?
    Recent models of climate change with endogenous technical progress suggest that the
market will generate insufficient innovation to reduce climate change and too much R&D

investment directed at “dirty” technologies. For example, in Acemoglu et al. (2012a)

there is path-dependence in the direction of technical change. Firms in economies that

have innovated a lot in dirty technologies in the past will find it more profitable to in-

novate in dirty technologies in the future. This path dependency feature when combined

with the environmental externality (whereby firms do not factor in the loss in aggregate

productivity or consumer utility induced by environmental degradation) will induce a

laissez-faire economy to produce and innovate too much in dirty technologies compared

to the social optimum. This in turn calls for government intervention to “redirect” tech-

nical change. For path dependance to occur, however, the associated clean products need

to be perceived as substitutes for dirty products by consumers. Autos are a good example

of this as electric and hybrid vehicles are potential substitutes for vehicles based on in-

ternal combustion engines (another example would be renewable energy plants vs. fossil

fuel plants). Furthermore, vehicles are major contributors to greenhouse gas emission.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2009 road transport accounted

for 4.88 GT of CO2 , which represented 16.5% of global CO2 emissions (transport as a

whole was responsible for 22.1%). Consequently, the automobile sector is the focus of our
paper. Note that even with such substitutable products as autos, however, there may be

decreasing returns to dirty innovation in which case the market would do part of the job

of redirecting technical change towards clean technologies. Thus, estimating the effects of



                                            2
a firm or country’s history of innovation on future innovation trajectories has to be part
of the dynamic evaluation of different climate change policies.
       In this paper, we construct a new panel dataset on auto innovations to examine

whether firms redirect technical change in response to fuel prices (our proxy for a carbon
tax) in the context of path dependent innovation. Our main data are drawn from the Eu-
ropean Patent Office’s (EPO) World Patent Statistical database (PATSTAT). These data

cover close to the population of all worldwide patents since the mid 1960s. To mitigate
the well-known problem that many patents are of very low value, our outcome measure
focuses on “triadic” patents which are those that have been taken out in all three of the

world’s major patents offices: the European Patent Office, the Japanese Patent Office
(JPO) and the United States Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO). We treat multiple

filings of an invention (a patent family) as one innovation.1 We show that our results are

robust to alternative ways to controlling for heterogeneous patent values such as using

wider categories of patents like “biadics”(US and EPO) or weighting by future citations.

Since 1978 when the EPO began there have been around 6,500 triadic patents filed in

“clean” auto technologies (electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells for hydrogen vehi-

cles, etc.) compared to about 18,500 triadic patents in “dirty” auto technologies, namely

those that affect internal combustion engines. Our database reports the name of patent

applicants which in turn allows us to match clean and dirty patents with distinct patent

holders each of whom has her own history of clean versus dirty patenting.2 We also know
the geographical location of the inventors listed on the patent so we can examine location

based knowledge spillovers.

       Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, higher fuel prices induce firms to
redirect technical change towards clean innovation and away from dirty innovation. Fuel

prices vary across countries and time primarily due to changes in fuel taxes and will have

a differential impact across auto firms because of firm-specific profile of market shares due
   1
     Triadic patents have been used extensively as a way to focus on high-value patents (Grupp et al.,
1996; Grupp, 1998; Dernis, Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, 2001; Dernis and Khan, 2004; Guellec and
van Pottelsberghe, 2004).
   2
     We do not consider radical innovations in upstream industries such as biofuels, for instance. To
explore this is beyond the scope of the current paper which takes the more positive approach of exploring
the determinants of clean innovation in vehicles.


                                                   3
to national tastes for home brands, etc. Second, a firm’s propensity to innovate in clean
technologies appears to be stimulated by its exposure to past clean technologies (and vice
versa for dirty technologies) consistent with the path-dependency hypothesis. We measure

this past exposure by (i) aggregate spillovers based on the initial (pre-regression sample)
location of the firm’s inventors across different countries combined with the changes over
time in the country-specific stocks of clean and dirty auto patents; and (ii) the firm’s own

lagged stocks of clean and dirty innovations. Using econometric models that include the
fuel price and both individual and aggregate spillover variables we find evidence in favor
of firm-specific and aggregate path dependency.

       Our paper focuses primarily on radically clean innovations (electric, hydrogen and hy-
brid cars) rather than on innovations in fuel efficiency (which we label “grey”innovation).

While the latter can also contribute to curbing climate change, our focus is motivated

by several considerations. First, innovations in fuel efficiency may be partly offset by the

resulting increase in driving (the “rebound effect”discussed in West, 2004, for example).

Second, there are technological limits on how energy efficient an internal combustion car

can be. Third, perfectly separating purely dirty innovations from these energy efficient

grey inventions is difficult. Nevertheless, we present regressions where we separate out

the grey innovations from the clean and purely dirty and find results that support our

model. The effect of higher fuel prices is positive on clean, negative on the purely dirty

with the effect on grey innovation in the middle.
       Our paper relates to three main strands of the literature. First, in the climate change

literature Nordhaus (1994) developed a dynamic Ramsey based model of climate change

(the DICE model), which added equations linking production to emissions. Subsequent
contributions examined the implications of risk and discounting for the optimal design of

environmental policy3 or have looked at the choice between taxes and quotas, building

on Weitzman (1974). Recently Golosov, Hassler, Krusell and Tsyvinski (2011) have ex-
tended this literature by solving for the optimal policy in a full dynamic stochastic general

equilibrium framework.
   3
    In particular see Stern (2006), Weitzman (2007, 2009), Dasgupta (2008), Nordhaus (2007), von Below
and Persson (2008), Mendelsohn et al (2008), and Yohe, Tol and Anthoff (2009).


                                                  4
       Second, our paper relates to the literature on directed technical change, in particular
Acemoglu (1998, 2002; 2008) which itself was inspired by early contributions by Hicks
(1932) and Habakkuk (1962).4 An application of this idea is the empirical literature link-

ing environmental policy and directed technical change (surveyed in Popp, Newell and
Jaffe, 2009). In particular, Popp (2002) uses aggregate U.S. patent data from 1970 to
1994 to study the effect of energy prices on energy-efficient innovations. He finds a signif-

icant impact from both energy prices and past knowledge stocks on directed innovation.
However, since Popp uses aggregate data a concern is that his regressions also capture
macro-economic shocks correlated with both innovation and the energy price. Our work

uses international firm-level panel data which allows us to exploit differences in the extent
to which firms in different countries are affected by policy-induced shocks to the energy

price (e.g. from fuel taxes). We control for global macro shocks with a full set of time

dummies. Further evidence of directed technical change in the context of energy-saving

can be found in Newell, Jaffe and Stavins (1999) which focuses on the air-conditioning

industry, or in Crabb and Johnson (2010) who also look at energy-efficient automotive

technology. However, neither of these papers use multi-country data nor analyze whether

there is path dependency in the direction of technical change. Hassler, Krussell and Olovs-

son (2011) find evidence for a trend increase in energy saving technologies following oil

price shocks. They measure the energy-saving bias of technology as essentially a residual

which is attractive as it side-steps the need to classify patents into distinct classes. The
advantage of our technology variables is that they are more directly related to the inno-

vation we want to measure. Finally, Acemoglu, Akcigit, Hanley and Kerr (2012) calibrate

a microeconomic model of directed technical change to derive quantitative estimates of
the optimal climate change policy.

       Third, we draw on the extensive literature in industrial organization that estimates the
   4
    The theoretical literature on directed technical change is well developed. See for example Messner
(1997), Grubler and Messner, (1998), Goulder and Schneider (1999), Manne and Richels (2002), Nordhaus
(2002), Van der Zwaan et al. (2002); Buonanno et al (2003), Nordhaus (2002), Sue Wing (2003), Gerlagh
(2008) and Gerlagh et al (2009). In contrast, directed technical change has rarely been empirically tested.
However, see Acemoglu and Linn (2004), Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008), Hascic et al (2008) and more
recently Hanlon (2012) who shows how relative price changes induced by the Union blockade during the
American Civil War induced British textile innovation in machines using Indian cotton.

demand for vehicles (energy efficient and otherwise) as a function of fuel prices and other
factors. For example, using around 86 million transactions Alcott and Wozny (2011) find
that fuel prices reduce demand for autos, but by less than an equivalent increase in the

vehicle price.5 Busse, Knittel and Zettelmeyer (2011) use similar data in a more reduced
form approach but, by contrast, find a much larger impact of fuel price on auto demand.
Although the magnitude of the fuel price effect on demand differs between studies, it is

generally accepted that there is an important effect of fuel prices on vehicle demand.
        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a simple model to guide our
empirical analysis and Section 3 presents the econometric methodology. The data is

presented in Section 4 with some descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the results,
discusses their robustness and some extensions. In Section 6 we explore the implications

of our results by simulating the aggregate evolution of future clean and dirty knowledge

stocks and analyzing how this evolution would be affected by changes in carbon taxes.

Section 7 concludes.


2         Theoretical Model

In this section we present a simple model to guide our empirical analysis. This model

rationalizes path dependence in firms’ own knowledge stock as well as the impact of a

change in the price of fuel on clean and dirty innovation. We then show how one can

add knowledge spillovers and energy efficiency innovations (“grey innovations”) to our
framework.

2.1        Basic framework

We consider a one-period model of an economy where consumers derive utility from an

outside good and from motor vehicle services. Utility is quasi-linear with respect to the
outside good C0 (chosen as the numeraire) and β is the elasticity of consumption of motor
vehicle services with respect to its index price. This parameter measures the degree of

substitutability between motor vehicle services and the outside good.
    5
    They argue that this is a behavioral bias causing consumers to undervalue fuel price changes. Readers
are referred to this paper for an extensive review of the literature on fuel prices and the demand for autos.



                                                     6
       To consume motor vehicle services, consumers need to buy cars and fuel (call it a
“dirty car bundle”) or cars and electricity (call it a “clean car bundle ”). Utility is then
given by:
                                                                                                              ε    β−1

where the consumption of variety i of clean cars together with the corresponding clean
energy (electricity) is:6

                                            Yci = min (yci , ξc eci ) ;

the consumption of variety i of dirty cars together with the corresponding dirty energy
(fuel) is:

                                            Ydi = min (ydi , ξd edi ) ;

where ezi is the amount of energy consumed for variety i of type-z car where z = c, d,

i.e. z = Clean, Dirty; ε is the elasticity of substitution between the clean and dirty cars

and σ is the elasticity of substitution among varieties within each type of car. Finally, ξc

(respectively ξd ) is the energy efficiency of clean (respectively dirty) cars.

       We assume that 1 < ε ≤ σ, so that clean cars are more substitutable with each other

than with dirty cars, and that ε > β: the elasticity of substitution between clean and

dirty cars is larger than the price elasticity for motor vehicle services.

       We denote by fc the price of electricity and fd the price of fuel. In the first part of
the analysis innovation will be cost saving for producers, but later we investigate energy
saving innovation. Cars are produced by local monopolists, and each monopolistic firm

i produces a fixed number of clean and/or dirty varieties. The monopoly producer of
variety i of a type-z car produces Azi cars using one unit of outside good as input.
       To complete the description of the model, we need to specify the innovation technology.

We assume that at the beginning of the period, by incurring total R&D cost 12 ψx2zi in the
   6
    The analysis can be easily extended to the case where we allow a less stark form of complementarity.
For example, consider a CES instead of Leontief form:
                                                 ρ−1            ρ−1      ρ
                                  Yzi = (yziρ + (ξz ezi )        ρ     ) ρ−1 , ρ < 1.




                                                            7
outside good the producer of variety i of type-z car can increase productivity according
to:
                               Azi = (1 + xzi ) Azi0 for z ∈ {c, d} ,                                      (1)

where Azi0 is the initial productivity for producing that type of cars.7

      The timing is very simple: at the beginning of the period producers invest in R&D
and innovate; at the end of the period, given their productivities resulting from R&D
activities, producers make production decisions to maximize profits.

2.2       Solving the model
2.2.1     Equilibrium profits

Define the price indexes for dirty and clean car bundles as:
                                                                  1

                        Pz =                   pzi +                   , for z ∈ {c, d} .
                                   0                 ξz

      The inverse demand curves for clean and dirty cars, which simply result from utility

maximization subject to budget constraint, are given by:
                                −σ
                              fz                         ε−β

                              ξz

      For given (end-of-period) productivity Azi , the producer of variety i of type-z car

solves:
                                                                    1
                                       πzi = max{pzi yzi −             yzi }

where yzi for z ∈ {c, d} is given by (2).

      This yields the following expression for the equilibrium profit of the corresponding car
producer:

     Innovation in dirty technologies as modeled here is not directed at improving energy efficiency.
Efficiency-enhancing innovations will be introduced in subsection 2.3 below.

2.2.2      Equilibrium innovation efforts and path-dependence

Moving back to the beginning of period the equilibrium innovation intensities xzi solve

                                                   1
                                          max{πzi − ψx2zi }
                                           xzi     2

where πzi is given by equation (3) and Azi satisfies the growth equation (1). For ψ
sufficiently large the solution to this maximization problem is uniquely given by the first
order condition. The resulting xzi satisfies:
                                                               −σ
                                  1                1         fz
                    xzi ∝                                  +        .                                 (4)
                           Azi0 (1 + xzi )2 Azi0 (1 + xzi ) ξz

       In particular, the equilibrium innovation intensities xzi increases in the firm’s corre-
sponding technology stocks Azi0 as long as the elasticity of substitution σ is sufficiently

large or if the price of fuel fz represents a sufficiently small share of the total costs of a

car.8 Then, there is path dependence with respect to the firm’s own innovation history.

       The ambiguity of the effect of the firm’s own technology stock Azi0 on the firm’s

innovation incentives reflects two counteracting forces of a higher Azi0 . On the one hand,
                    1
the term            reflects the negative marginal effect this has on the price charged
             Azi0 (1+xzi )2
                                                                 −σ
                                                     1         fz
by the producer; on the other hand, the term Azi0 (1+x  zi )
                                                             + ξz
                                                                      reflects the positive

marginal effect of a higher Azi0 on the demand for bundle (i, z). This latter effect is

strongest when the price of fuel fz represents a sufficiently small share of the total costs
of a car or when the elasticity of substitution σ between variety (i, z) and other varieties

of the z-type cars is sufficiently large, which in turn implies that a lower price allows
producer (i, z) to capture more market share from other (j, z) producers.
   8
     The precise condition is Azi0(σ−1)         fz
                                     (1+zci ) > ξz . A back of the envelope calculation shows that this
condition is likely to be satisfied in practice. In our set-up the price of a new car is given by
          σ  1        1 fz
pzi = σ−1   Azi
                 + σ−1  ξz , so that  the price ratio between fuel expenditure and a new car is equal
                                 
to x = fξzz / σ−1σ   1      1 fz
                   Azi + σ−1 ξz . The average price of a new car in the US is $26,850 with a fuel
efficiency of 33.8 miles per gallon and Americans drive on average 14,500 miles per year (source:
http://www.bts.gov/publications/national transportation statistics/). Assuming that fuel costs $4 a gal-
lon (with a price increasing at the Hotelling rate), and that a car lasts for 10 years, we obtain a price
ratio of x = 0.64. Simple algebra gives that fξzz / (σ−1)         σ
                                                      Azi = (σ−1)( σ−1 −1) which is equal to 0.70, so that
                                                                    x
fz     σ−1
ξz < Azi , when the elasticity of substitution σ is equal to 3. An elasticity of substitution of 3 seems
to be a low value: in the model the elasticity of substitution is the same as the price elasticity for car
varieties, which Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) estimated to lie between 5.05 and 37.49 (depending
on the car variety).

2.2.3      Redirecting innovation through changes in the fuel price

We now investigate the impact of a change in the fuel price on clean and dirty innovations.
Totally differentiating equation (4) for z = c with respect to the fuel price, and then using
                      dX
the notation X
             b=
                       X

                                             Pc1−ε                        Pd1−ε

                                                                                    cd ,                (5)
                                        Pc + Pd1−ε                    Pc1−ε + Pd1−ε
                                           −σ 
           d         1          1         fz
where ω ≡ dxzi ln (1+x )2 Aci0 (1+xci ) + ξz       < 1.9
                             zi

       For sufficiently small innovation intensities, one can neglect the indirect impact of an
increase in fuel price via the innovation response of other firms, so that Pbc ≈ 0.10 Then

we approximately have:
                                                        Pd1−ε
                                       ci ∝ (ε − β)
                                      xc                          P
                                                                  cd .
                                                    Pc1−ε + Pd1−ε
       This in turn implies that the equilibrium intensity of clean innovation increases with

fuel price since we assumed ε ≥ β. Intuitively, a higher fuel price makes dirty car bundles

more expensive; this in turn might favor the demand either for clean car bundles or for

the outside good. It will boost the demand for clean car bundles if the elasticity of

substitution between dirty and clean car bundles is higher than the price elasticity of

motor-vehicle services as a whole, as we assumed.

       Similarly, we get:
                                            fd
                                                        !
                                                                   P 1−ε        P 1−ε
                                                                                             
                                            ξd
          (1 − ω) xc

                                                 fd d
                                                            − ε 1−ε c 1−ε + β 1−ε d 1−ε           P
                                                                                                  cd    (6)
                                      Adi
                                            +    ξd
                                                               P c + Pd      Pc + P d

once we neglect the indirect impact of a change in fuel price on the price indexes working
through the innovation response.

       The first term captures a reallocation effect among varieties of dirty cars, from most
to least productive dirty car producers. This term is indeed equal to zero if all firms had
the same dirty technologies, otherwise it has the sign of fbd for the least productive dirty

firms and the opposite sign for the most productive dirty firms.
   9
     That ω be less than 1 follows from the fact that at the equilibrium the left-hand side of (4) crosses
the right-hand side from below.
  10
     Another reason to neglect this indirect impact is that firms typically operate in several markets, with
different exposures to each market for each firm. Therefore the allocation of innovation of the competitors
does not depend only on the fuel price in a given country but also on the fuel price in other countries.


                                                            10
       The second term captures a substitution effect between clean and dirty car producers.
This term has the opposite sign from that of fbd : namely, an increase in fuel price reduces
the benefit of dirty innovation both because it induces substitution towards clean cars

and because it reduces the overall consumption of cars.
       Overall, an increase in fuel price should decrease dirty innovation intensity (as long
as the firm’s initial productivity in dirty technologies is not too low compared to that of

other firms) and it should increase clean innovation intensity.

2.3       Extensions

Knowledge spillovers. In the empirical part of the paper we investigate not only the
effects of firms’ own past knowledge but also the effects of aggregate knowledge spillovers

across firms in the country where innovation occurs. To introduce the possibility of such

aggregate spillovers in our model, suppose the existence for each firm i of knowledge

spillovers from a set Ωi of neighboring varieties of cars of the same type z = c, d, so that

abstracting from innovation firm i’s initial productivity is:

                                      ezi0 = Azi0 (1 + η(Azi0 ))
                                      A

where
                                                     Z
                                            Azi0 =         Azj0 dj
                                                     Ωi
                                      11
and η is an increasing function.

       Equilibrium innovation xzi is now given by:
                                                                               !−σ

                         xzi ∝                                          +                         (7)

which again is increasing in the aggregate initial knowledge variable Azi0 if σ is sufficiently

large.
       “Grey” innovation. Innovations in the car industry may also involve improvements

in energy efficiency. Innovations that increase energy efficiency for clean cars would not

react differently to an increase in fuel price than cost reducing innovations.
  11
    Our modeling of knowledge spillovers is dictated by our empirical estimation strategy, whereby for
each patenting firms we compute the stock of patents generated by scientists who are geographically
close.

                                                     11
       Now, let us analyze innovations that improve dirty energy efficiency. More specifically,
suppose that at the beginning of every period, a firm can increase its energy efficiency
from ξdi0 to

                                                ξdi = (1 + xξi ) ξdi0

if it spends 21 ψx2ξi units of the outside good in R&D. We refer to this type of innovations
as “grey” innovations.

       For sufficiently high ψ, i.e for small innovation intensity the solution to the maximiza-
tion problem is uniquely defined by the first order condition, totally differentiating the
latter with respect to the fuel price leads to:
                            fd
                                       ! 
                                                  1−ε              1−ε     
                            ξ                   P c              P d
          ξi ∝ σ Pd − 1              fb − ε 1−ε

        xc        c

                                                                             cd + fbd .

                                           P c    + P d      P c   + P d


       This expression is similar to equation (6) except for the last term which captures a

direct positive effect of an increase in the fuel price on energy efficiency innovation. The

overall impact of an increase in the fuel price on grey innovation is therefore ambiguous,

whereas we saw that it is unambiguously positive on clean innovation. The reason for the

ambiguous effect is that on the one hand an increase in fuel price both, reduces the demand

for dirty cars and therefore the profitability of producing (and therefore innovating) in

the dirty sector altogether, but on the other hand it induces dirty firms to save more on

fuel energy by improving dirty energy efficiency.

       We use the expression “grey” as the impact of these innovations on the environment is
also ambiguous.12 On the one hand these innovations increase energy efficiency and there-

fore reduce the amount of fuel consumption per car; on the other hand these innovations

make fossil fuel cars cheaper, thereby increasing total consumption of these cars.13

2.4      Summarizing our main predictions

We have presented a simple model of clean versus dirty innovation, in which we predict
that:


    1. producers have a higher propensity to innovate in clean relative to dirty technologies

        the larger the fuel price fd .

    2. for σ sufficiently high or the price of fuel fd sufficiently small, producers have a
        higher propensity to innovate in clean technologies:

        (i) the higher A0c and the lower A0d , i.e. the higher their initial stock of clean
        compared to dirty technologies (lagged own innovation stocks);

        (ii) the higher the aggregate level of clean (or the lower the aggregate level of dirty)

        technology in neighboring varieties (spillovers).


    We now confront these three predictions with our panel data on clean and dirty inno-

vation in the auto industry.

                       P ATClean,it = exp(βC,P ln F Pit−1 + AC,it−1 ) + uC,it                          (8)

where P ATClean,it is the number of patents applied for in clean technologies by firm i in

year t; ACit is the firm’s knowledge stock relevant for clean innovation, which depends both
upon its own stocks of past clean and dirty innovation and the aggregate spillovers from
other firms (discussed below); uC,it is an error term; exp(.) is the exponential operator;

and F Pit is fuel price (the empirical equivalent of fd in the theory section). We lag prices
Van Dender, 2007), however some studies have estimated much larger rebound effects (87% in West,
2004).
  14
     In our regressions we use an equivalent equation for dirty technologies. We initially discuss only one
of these equations to simplify the notation.

                                                    13
and knowledge by a year to reflect delayed response and also mitigate contemporaneous
feedback effects.15 In the robustness section we show this form is reasonable comparing
it to alternative dynamic representations using other lag structures and the Popp (2002)

approach.
       The fuel price has independent variation across time and countries primarily because of
country-specific taxes and we show the robustness of our results to using fuel taxes instead

of prices. The profile of car sales across countries differs across auto firms. For example,
GM has some “home bias” towards the US market whereas Toyota has a “home bias”
towards the Japanese market, i.e. they sell more in these countries than one would expect

from country observables alone. Thus, different firms are likely to be differently exposed
to tax changes in different countries and the fuel price has a firm-specific component. This

firm-specific difference in market shares could be because of product differentiation and

heterogeneous tastes or it may be because of government policies to promote domestic

firms (e.g. trade barriers). To take this heterogeneity into account we use the firm’s (pre-

sample) history of patent filing to assess the relative importance of the various markets the

firm is operating in and construct firm-specific weights on fuel prices for the corresponding

market. Simply put, an unexpected increase in Japanese fuel taxes will have a more

salient impact on car makers with a bigger market share in Japan than those with a

smaller market share. We discuss this in more detail in Section 4.

       We parameterize the firm’s total knowledge stock as:


           ACit = βC,1 ln SP ILLC,it + βC,2 ln SP ILLD,it + βC,3 ln KC,it + βC,4 ln KD,it                 (9)


       The firm’s knowledge will likely depend on its own past history of innovation and we

denote this as KClean,it (own stock of clean innovation) and KDirty,it (own stock of dirty
innovation).16 In addition to building on its own past innovations firms will also “stand on
  15
      In principle, the price should be the firm’s expectation of the future evolution of the fuel price based
on the information set at time of making the innovation investment decision. Fuel prices appear to be
well approximated by a random walk process (e.g. Anderson et al, 2011a,b), so given our assumption that
decisions are made on t − 1 information, lagged prices should be a sufficient statistic for this expectation.
   16
      We construct stocks using the perpetual inventory method, but show robustness to using patent
flows and to considering alternative assumptions over knowledge depreciation rates. Some firms have
zero lagged knowledge stock in some periods, so we also add in three dummy indicator variables for when
lagged clean stock is zero, lagged dirty stock is zero or both are zero.


                                                     14
the shoulders of giants”, so we allow their knowledge stock to depend on spillovers from
other firms both in clean (SP ILLC,it ) and dirty technologies (SP ILLD,it ). We use stocks
of economy wide patents to construct these country-specific spillover measures. Drawing

on the evidence that knowledge has a local component (e.g. Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Hen-
derson, 1993) we use the firm’s distribution of inventors across countries to weight the
country spillover stocks. In other words, if the firm has many inventors in the US regard-

less of whether the headquarters of the firm is in Tokyo or Detroit, then the knowledge
stock in the US is given a higher weight (see Section 4).
      There are of course other factors that may influence innovation in addition to fuel prices

and the past history of innovation. These include policy measures such as government
R&D subsidies for clean innovation and regulations over emissions and the size and wealth

of the countries a firm is expecting to sell to (proxied by GDP per capita and GDP) which

we denote by the vector wC,it . We also allow for unobservable factors by introducing a

firm fixed effect (ηC,i ), a full set of time dummies (TCt ) and an error term (uC,it ) that is

uncorrelated with the right hand side variables. Adding these extra terms and substituting

equation (9) into (8) gives us our main empirical equation for clean innovation:

         P ATClean,it = exp(βC,P ln F Pit−1 + βC,1 ln SP ILLC,it−1 + βC,2 ln SP ILLD,it−1

                      + βC,3 ln KC,it−1 + βC,4 ln KD,it−1

                      + βC,w wit + TC,t )ηC,i + uC,it                                               (10)

      Symmetrically, we can derive an equation for dirty innovation:

        P ATDirty,it = exp(βD,P ln F Pit−1 + βD,1 ln SP ILLC,it−1 + βD,2 ln SP ILLD,it−1

                     + βD,3 ln KC,it−1 + βD,4 ln KD,it−1

                     + βD,w wit + TD,t )ηD,i + uD,it                                                (11)

      The theory yields predictions on the signs of the coefficients in these two equations. If
higher fuel prices induces more clean than dirty innovation then the marginal effect of the

fuel price must be larger on clean innovation than on dirty innovation: βC,P > βD,P and we

would expect that βC,P > 0 and βD,P < 0.17 Next, for there to be path dependence in the
 17
      Note that these two stronger second conditions are not necessary for induced (redirected) technical

                                                    15
direction of innovation it should be the case that (ceteris paribus) firms that are exposed
to more dirty spillovers become more prone to conduct dirty innovation in the future:
i.e. βD,2 > 0 and βD,2 > βC,2 . In the clean innovation equation we have βC,1 > 0 and

βC,1 > βD,1 . And path dependence should involve similar effects working through a firm’s
own accumulated knowledge: βD,4 > 0 and βD,4 > βC,4 . (βC,3 > 0 and βC,3 > βD,3 .) Also,
we would expect that the positive effect of dirty spillovers and dirty knowledge stocks

on dirty innovation be larger than the effects of clean spillovers and clean knowledge
stocks: βD,2 > βD,1 and βD,4 > βD,3 . The reverse predictions should all apply for the clean
equation: βC,2 < βC,1 and βC,3 > βC,4

3.2     Dynamic count data models with fixed effects

To estimate equation (10) and (11) we use:


                                   P ATzit = exp (xit βz ) ηzi + uzit                                 (12)


where z ∈ {Dirty, Clean} and xit is the vector of regressors. We compare a number of

econometric techniques to account for firm level fixed effects ηzi in these Poisson models.

Our baseline is an econometric model we label CFX, the Control Function Fixed Effect

estimator. It builds on the pre-sample mean scaling estimator proposed in Blundell,

Griffith and Van Reenen (1999), henceforth BGVR.18 BGVR suggest conditioning on

the pre-sample average of the dependent variable to proxy out the fixed effect. Like

BGVR, CFX uses a control function approach to deal with the fixed effect but rather than

using information from the pre-sample period in the control function, we simultaneously
estimate the main regression equation and a second equation allowing us to identify the

control function from future data (similar to the idea of taking orthogonal deviations in

the linear panel data literature, see Arellano, 2003). The full details on this are provided
in Appendix A, but in a nutshell, we use CFX to deal with a potential concern with

the BGVR approach, namely that it requires long pre-sample history of realizations of

the dependant variable. However, in our data - particularly for clean - patenting is
change as the absolute sign of the price effects will depend on the elasticity of substitution between cars
and other goods.

concentrated towards the end of our sample period. Below, we provide results using both
the CFX and BGVR method as well as two other common approaches. First, we use
the Hausman, Hall and Griliches (1984) method (the count data equivalent to the within

groups estimator) even though this requires strict exogeneity, which is inconsistent with
models including functions of the lagged dependent variable as we have in equations (10)
and (11). Second, we implement some simple linear within groups models adding an

arbitrary constant to the dependent variable before taking logarithms. We show that
all these approaches deliver similar qualitative results, although CFX provides the best
overall fit.


4       Data
4.1     Main dataset

Our main data are drawn from the World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) main-

tained by the European Patent Office.19 Patent documents are categorized using the

International Patent Classification (IPC) and national classification systems. We extract

all the patents relating to “clean” and “dirty” technologies in the automotive industry.

    Clean is identified by patents whose technology class is specifically related to electric,

hybrid and hydrogen vehicles. Our selection of relevant IPC codes for clean technologies

relies heavily on previous work by the OECD.20 The precise description of the IPC codes

used to identify relevant patents can be found in Table 1 Panel A. Some typical IPC

classification codes included in the clean category are B60L11 (”Electric propulsion with
power supplied within the vehicle”) and B60K6 (”Arrangement or mounting of hybrid

propulsion systems comprising electric motors and internal combustion engines”.) US

patent #645604121 is an example of a clean patent from our dataset: it describes a
”Power supply system for electric vehicle”. It was first filed by Yamaha Motor in Japan

in 1998 and was then filed at the European Patent Office and at the USPTO in 1999.

The front page and technical diagram of the patent is shown in Appendix Figure A1.

     We use the publication numbers in this and the following patent examples.


                                             17
      “Dirty” includes patents with an IPC that is related to the internal combustion engine.
These can be found in various sub-categories of the F02 group, for example F02B (”Com-
bustion engines in general”), F02F (”Cylinders, pistons or casings for combustion engines)

or F02N (”Starting of combustion engines”). The full list of IPC codes used to identify
dirty patents is in Table 1 Panel B. Each of these groups includes several dozen sub-classes
and an example of the full list of sub-classes for the F02F group is shown in Appendix

Figure A2. The dirty category typically includes patents covering the various parts that
make up an internal combustion engine. For example, EPO patent #0967381 protects a
”Cylinder head of an internal-combustion engine” and USPTO patent #5844336 protects

a ”Starter for an internal combustion engine”.
      As noted above, an important feature of the dirty category is that some patents

included in this group aim at improving the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines,

making the dirty technology less dirty. We refer to these fuel-efficiency patents as “Grey”

patents. In our baseline results, grey patents are included in the dirty category, but we

also disaggregate the category to estimate models separately for grey and “Pure Dirty”

innovations separately (as well as splitting up the knowledge stocks along these lines on

the right hand side of the regressions). To select IPC codes for grey technologies, we use

recent work at the European Patent Office related to the new climate change mitigation

patent classification (see Veefkind et al. 2012). We complement this with information

from interviews with engineers working in the automobile industry.22 The list of IPC
codes is shown in Panel C of Table 1. An example of a grey patent is EPO patent

#0979940, which protects a ”Method and device for controlling fuel injection into an

internal combustion engine” Electronic fuel injection technologies constantly monitor and
control the amount of fuel burnt in the engine, with a view to reduce the amount of fuel

unnecessarily burnt, thus optimizing fuel consumption. Appendix Figure A3 has the front

page and technical diagram of this patent.
      Alongside the grey fuel efficiency innovations there are many purely dirty patents,

such as EPO patent #0402091, which covers a ”Four-cycle twelve cylinder engine” (see

      We are especially indebted to Christian Hue de la Colombe for many extremely helpful discussions.




                                                   18
Appendix Figure A4). Fuel consumption is proportional to the number and the volume
of cylinders: the average car sold in Europe has four cylinders whereas it is six in the US.
A twelve cylinder engine is much more powerful than a four or six cylinders engine, but

this comes at the cost of increased fuel consumption. Twelve cylinder engines are used by
many car makers for their top-range models, including Aston Martin, Audi, BMW and
Rolls Royce. These cars typically run about 15 miles/gallon, while the average new car

sold in the US in 2011 obtains 33.8 miles/gallon.23
       To measure innovation, we use a count of patents by application/filing date. The
advantages and limitations of patenting as a measure of innovation have been extensively

discussed.24 For our purposes, there are three advantages of using patents. First, they are
available at a highly technologically disaggregated level. We can distinguish innovations

in the auto industry according to specific technologies whereas R&D investment cannot

be easily disaggregated. Second, R&D is not reported for small and medium sized firms

in Europe nor for privately listed firms in the US (they are exempt from the accounting

requirement to report R&D). Third, the auto sector is innovation intensive where patents

are perceived as an effective means of protection against imitation, something which is not

true in all sectors (Cohen et al., 2000).25 These considerations make patents a reasonably

good indicator of innovative activity in the auto sector.

       Patents do suffer from a number of limitations. Patents are not the only way to protect

innovations, although a large fraction of the most economically significant innovations
appear to have been patented (Dernis et al., 2001). Another problem is that patent values

are highly heterogeneous with most patents having a very low valuation. Finally, the

number of patents that are granted for a given innovation varies significantly across patent
  23
     See http://www.fueleconomy.gov for details on car consumption and
   http://www.bts.gov/publications/national transportation statistics/html/table 04 23.html for US av-
erage. Note grey technical change appears to account for a minority of innovation in the internal com-
bustion engines. For example, between 1980 and 2004 the fuel efficiency of passenger cars increased by
only 6.5%, while horsepower increased by 80% (Knittel, 2011).
  24
     See Griliches (1990) and for a recent overview, OECD (2009). Dating by application is conventional
in the empirical innovation literature as it is much more closely timed with when the R&D was performed
than the grant date.
  25
     Cohen et al. (2000) conducted a survey questionnaire administered to 1,478 R&D labs in the U.S.
manufacturing sector. They rank sectors according to how effective patents are considered as a means of
protection against imitation, and find that the top three industries according to this criterion are medical
equipment and drugs, special purpose machinery and automobile.

offices with concerns over increasing laxity in recent years particularly in the USPTO (e.g.
Jaffe and Lerner, 2004).
                                                                           26
       To mitigate these problems, we focus on “triadic” patents                which are those patents

that have been taken out in all three of the world’s major patents offices in the US,
Europe and Japan (USPTO, EPO and JPO).27 Focusing on triadic patents has a number
of advantages. First, triadic patents provide us with a common measure of innovation

worldwide, which is robust to administrative idiosyncracies of the various patent offices.
For example, if the same invention is covered by one patent in the US and by two patents in
Japan, all of which are part of the same triadic patent family, we will count it as one single

invention. Secondly, triadic patents cover only the most valuable inventions which explains
why they have been used so extensively to capture high-quality patents.28 Thirdly, triadic

patents typically protect inventions that have a potential worldwide application so these

patents are thus relatively independent of the countries in which they are filed.

       Our data set includes 6,419 “clean” and 18,652 “dirty” triadic patents.29 Since the

EPO was created in 1978 our triadic patent data only starts in that year. The last year

of fully comprehensive triadic data is 2005, so this is our end year.30 Our basic dataset

consists of all those applicants (both firms and individuals) who applied for at least one of

these clean or dirty auto patents. We identify 3,423 distinct patent holders, which breaks

down into 2,427 companies and 996 individuals. For every patent holder we subsequently

identify all the patents they filed. We also extract other pieces of information based on
  26
     To identify triadic patents we use the INPADOC dataset in PATSTAT. For details on the construction
of patent families see Martinez, 2010.
  27
     Following standard practice we use all patents filed at the EPO and JPO and granted by the USPTO.
This is because the USPTO only published patent applications that were subsequently granted until 2001
(when they changed policy in line with the other major patent offices). For consistency we thus consider
only triadic patents granted by the USPTO both before and after 2001. For the official definition of triadic
patents and how triadic patent families are constructed, see Dernis and Kahn, 2004, and Martinez, 2010.
  28
     It has been empirically demonstrated that the number of countries in which a patent is filed is
correlated with other indicators of patent value. See, for example, Lanjouw et al, 1998, Harhoff et al,
2003). Grupp et al. (1996); Grupp (1998); Dernis, Guellec and van Pottelsberghe (2001); Dernis and
Khan (2004); Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, (2004)
  29
     In total, the PATSTAT data set includes 213,668 “clean” and 762,708 “dirty” patent applications
across all 80 patents offices. Thus by using triadic patents we focus on the high end of the quality
distribution.
  30
     The number of triadic patent in all technologies (i.e. including patents that are neither clean nor
dirty) starts falling in 2006. This is because of time lags between application and grant date at the
USPTO.

this sample which we use to construct weights for prices and spillovers. For example, we
identify all the other patents filed by holders of at least one clean or dirty triadic patent,
which represents a total of 4,467,362 patent applications.

4.2       Tax-inclusive fuel prices

To estimate the impact of a carbon tax on innovation in clean and dirty technologies, we

use information on fuel prices (F Pct ) and fuel taxes. Data on tax-inclusive fuel prices are
available from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for 25 major countries from 1978
onwards.31 We construct a time-varying country-level fuel price defined as the average

of diesel and gasoline prices. The average fuel price across countries for our regression
sample period 1986-2005 is shown in Panel A of Figure 1. Prices fell from the mid to late

1980s then rose peaking just before the Dot-Com bust of 2000-01.Prices then fell before

recovering after 2003. Average fuel taxes have followed a broadly similar pattern falling

in late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s and falling back in the 2000s (Panel B of Figure

1). What is more striking, however, is the high variability across countries of changes

in the fuel price over time, much of it being driven by cross-country differences in tax

policies (see Figures 2 and 3).

      Fuel prices are available only at the country-year level, whereas our dependent variable

has firm level variation that we would like to exploit. A related issue is that the auto

market is global and government policies abroad might be at least as important for firms’
innovation decisions as domestic policies in the company’s headquarter country. We allow

fuel prices to have a different effect across firms by noting that some geographical markets

matter more than others for reasons that are idiosyncratic to an auto firm. Firstly, auto
manufacturers have different styles of vehicles reflecting their heterogenous capabilities

and branding that are differentially popular depending on local tastes (e.g. Berry et al,

1995; Goldberg, 1995; Verboven, 1999). Second, there is typically some home bias towards
“national champions” auto manufacturers in national tastes and government policies. For

example, the recent auto bailouts in Detroit where paid for by US taxpayers whereas the

bailout of Peugeot has been shouldered by the French. The upshot of this is that auto
 31
      The IEA reports some incomplete data for an additional 13 countries.


                                                   21
firms display heterogeneous current and expected market shares across nations and their
R&D decisions will be more influenced by prices and policies in some countries than in
others.

   To operationalize this idea we construct a fuel price variable for each firm as a weighted
average of fuel prices across countries based on a proxy of where the firm expects its future
market to be. Our price index for firm i at time t is defined as:
                                               X
                                                    FP
                                  ln F Pit =       wic0 ln F Pct                           (13)
                                               c

                                                                 FP
where F Pct is the tax-inclusive fuel price discussed above and wic0 is a firm-specific weight
(this is time invariant and uses information only prior to the regression sample period).

The weight is determined by the importance of county c as a market outlet for firm i, so
           FP
we define wic0 as the fraction of firm i’s patents taken out in country c. The rationale for

doing this is that a firm will seek intellectual property protection in jurisdictions where

it believes it will need to sell in the future (even if it licenses the technology, the value of

license will depend on whether it has obtained intellectual property protection in relevant

growth markets). For every patent applied for, we know that the patenting firm has paid

the cost of legal protection in a discrete number of countries. For example, a firm may

choose to enforce its rights in all EU countries or only in a subset of EU countries, say

Germany and the UK. Similarly, the firm may decide to apply for patent protection in the

US but not in smaller markets. Assuming that the country distribution of a firm’s patent

portfolio is a good indicator of the firm’s expectation of where its markets will be in the

future, we can use this distribution to construct a firm-specific fuel price, F Pit , whose

value is computed as the weighted mean of the ln(fuel prices) in the relevant markets,
              FP
with weights wic0 equal to the shares of the corresponding countries in the firm’s patent

portfolio. For example, if a firm had filed 30 patents, 20 in the US and 10 in Japan, the

price changes in the US would get a weight of two-thirds and the Japanese price changes
a weight of one third. In order to reflect the greater importance of larger countries, we

also weight by each country’s average GDP.

   We calculate the weights using the patent portfolio of each company averaged over
the 1965-1985 “pre-sample” period, whereas we run regressions over the period 1986-2005.

                                               22
This is to make sure that the weights are weakly exogenous as patent location could be
influenced by shocks to innovation. Choosing 1985 as the cut-off is to ensure there is
enough time pre-sample to construct the weights. We perform robustness tests using

different pre-sample periods to check that nothing is driven by the precise year of cut-
off (e.g. use 1965-1990 as the pre-sample period and estimate the regressions from 1991
onwards).32

       Why not use an alternative weighting scheme which simply reflects where firms cur-
rently sell their products (e.g. as in Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen, 2012)? First,
we believe that the information on where firms choose to take patent protection is a poten-

tially better measure because it reflects their expectations of where their future markets
will be. Second, there is a data constraint: although sales distributions by geographic

area are available for larger firms they are not available for smaller firms - and there are

many patents from these smaller firms. We show our weights compared to sales weights

for some of the largest car firms in Appendix Table A1 - Toyota, VW, Ford, Honda and

Peugeot. The correlation is generally high suggesting that the weights we choose do a

reasonable job at reflecting market shares.33

4.3       Firm lagged Patent stocks and spillovers

Firm patent stocks are calculated in a straightforward manner using the patent flows

(P ATz,it ) described above. Following Cockburn and Griliches (1988) and Peri (2005), the

patent stock is calculated using the perpetual inventory method:


                                  Kz,it = P ATz,it + (1 − δ)Kz,it−1                                   (14)


where z ∈ {Dirty, Clean}. We take δ, the depreciation of R&D capital, to be 20%, as is

often assumed in the literature, but we check the robustness of our results to other values
of the depreciation parameter.

       To construct aggregate spillovers for a firm, we use information on the geographical

     Our approach to weighting is conservative and may cause us to underestimate the importance of fuel
prices for innovation decisions. If firms reduce patent protection in countries where fuel taxes rise, this
will generate a measurement error biasing the estimated coefficients towards zero.
  33
     One exception is that VW appears to have a much higher patent share in Germany (its home country)
than its sales would suggest.

location of the various inventors in that firm. These are geographically located regardless
of nationality of the firm’s headquarters or the location of the office where the patent was
filed (e.g. the patents of Toyota’s scientists working in US research labs are part of this

US spillover pool). Implicit in our approach is the view that the geographical location
of an inventor is likely to be a key determinant of knowledge spillovers rather than the
jurisdiction over which the patent is taken out (which matters more as a signal of where

the market for sales is likely to be). Many papers have documented the importance of
the geographical component of knowledge spillovers in patents and other indicators (e.g.
Henderson, Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 1993, 2005 and Griffith, Lee and Van Reenen, 2011).

       To construct a firm-specific spillover pool we use an analogous empirical strategy to
                                               S
that for the fuel price. The spillover weight wic0 is the share of all firm i’s inventors (i.e.

where the inventor worked) in country c between 1965 and 1985. This weight is distinct
      P
from wic0 in equation (13) as it is based on the location of inventors who are more likely

to benefit from research conducted locally. Importantly, the distribution of the patent

portfolio across countries and the distribution of inventors vary considerably across firms.

This is illustrated for the US in Appendix Figure A5.

       The spillover for firm i is:

                                                    X
                                                           S
                                    SP ILLz,it =          wic0 SP ILLz,ct                         (15)
                                                     c

where SP ILLz,ct is the spillover pool in country c at time t. This is defined as:

                                                         X
                                                                 S
                                       SP ILLz,ct =             wjc0 Kz,jt                        (16)
                                                         j6=i

The spillover pool of a country is the sum of all other firms’ patent stocks with a weight
that depends on how many inventors the other firm has in that country.34

       As noted above, a common problem with patent data is that the value of patents is
highly heterogeneous. We mitigate this problem by conditioning on triadic patents, which
  34
       An alternative approach would be to define the country level spillover as
                                                        X
                                         SP ILLz,ct =      Kz,jct                                 (17)
                                                            j

where Kz,jct = P ATz,jct + (1 − δ)Kz,jct−1 and P ATz,jct is the number of patents filed by inventors of
company j located in country c at year t. Empirically these two methods give very similar results.

screen out the very low value patents. But we also perform two other checks. First, we
weight patents by the number of future citations. Second, we use “biadic” patents filed
at the EPO and at the USPTO, following Henderson and Cockburn (1993) who argued

that patents were important if they had been applied in at least two of the three major
economic regions. Our results are robust to these two variants.

4.4       Descriptive statistics

Figure 4 shows that aggregate triadic clean and dirty patents have been rising over time.
Dirty patents increased steadily between 1978 and 1988 and then again between 1992 and

2000, but have been decreasing during the last five years of our dataset. The number of
clean patents was low for a decade until 1992, then began rising particularly after 1995

(at an average annual growth rate of 23%), peaking at 724 in 2002 alone, before falling

back slightly. Consequently, while the number of clean patents represented only 10% of

the number of dirty patents filed annually during the 1980s this reached 60% by 2005.

Descriptive statistics for our dataset used in the regressions are shown in Table 2. In any

given year, the average number of dirty patents is 0.22 and the average number of clean

patents is 0.08.

      Appendix B discusses more descriptives showing more of the cross-country distribution

of patent filing (Table A2) and citation patterns (Table A3) which are consistent with

spillovers being much stronger within the two categories (clean or dirty) than between
them.

      Table A4 displays the top 10 patenters in clean technologies between 1978 and 2005 and

Table A5 shows the equivalent for dirty technologies. Japanese and German companies
predominate although most top companies’ portfolios include both clean and dirty (the

only exception is Samsung SDI, a battery specialist). Recall that this is based on triadic

patents and US companies tend to file disproportionately more patents in the US than
in Europe and Japan. Tables A6 to A9 report top clean and dirty patenters at the EPO

and at the USPTO separately. General Motors is the third largest patenter of clean
                                                                                         35
technologies at the USPTO whereas it is not even in the top 10 at the EPO.

5     Results
5.1     Main Results

Our main results are shown in Table 3. The first three columns use the number of clean
patents (a flow) in a firm as the dependent variable and the last three columns uses the
flow of dirty patents. All estimates include firm fixed effects using the Control Function

Fixed Effect (CFX) approach (described in Section 3), year dummies and GDP per capita.
Column (1) shows that the coefficient on the (tax inclusive) fuel price is positive and
significant. The elasticity of 0.97 implies that a 10% higher fuel price is associated with

about 10% more clean patents. The coefficients on spillovers and lagged patent stocks
take signs consistent with the path dependency hypothesis. Firms who are more exposed

to larger stocks of clean innovation by other firms’ (“clean spillovers”, SP ILLC,it−1 ) are

significantly more likely to produce clean patents, whereas those benefiting more from

dirty spillovers (SP ILLD,it−1 ) are significantly less likely to innovate in clean technologies.

If the coefficients can be interpreted causally, increasing the clean spillover stock by 10%

increases a firm’s clean innovation by 2.7%. By contrast, an increase in the exposure to

dirty spillovers by 10% reduces clean innovation by 1.7%.

    In addition to path dependency at the economy level through spillovers, there is also

path dependency at the firm level. Column (1) of Table 3 suggests that firms which have

innovated in clean innovation in the past (KC,it−1 ) are much more likely to continue to
innovate in clean technologies in the future, with a significant elasticity of 0.306. Inter-

estingly, a firm’s own history of dirty innovation (KD,it−1 ) is also associated with more

clean innovation with an elasticity of 0.139. This coefficient is, however, much smaller
than the corresponding coefficient on past dirty innovation stocks in the dirty innovation

equation (column (4)) which is four times as large (0.557). In other words, firms with

a history of dirty innovation are more likely to innovate in the future in either clean or
dirty (compared to those with little innovation), but this effect is much stronger for dirty
patenting, computing a Herfindahl Index for patenting over 1978 to 2005 for clean innovation we find a
Herfindahl of 0.023 and for dirty we find a HHI of 0.038, implying low concentration. The top 10 patent
holders in clean account for 35.6% of patents over 1978 to 2005 whereas the corresponding figure is 46.6%
for dirty.

innovations than for clean innovation leading to path dependence. Moreover, note that
in column (1) the coefficient on a firm’s past dirty innovation stock on future clean inno-
vation (0.139) is much smaller than the effect of past clean innovations on future clean

innovation (0.306).36
       Columns (2) and (3) of Table 3 include a measure of R&D subsidies for clean tech-
nologies and a control for emission regulations. R&D subsidies are from the IEA’s Energy

Technology Research Database and the emissions regulations index are from Dechezlepre-
tre, Perkins and Neumayer (2010) with details in Appendix B. In contrast to the proxy
for carbon taxes (fuel prices) neither of these additional policy variables is statistically

significant and the coefficients on the other variables do not change much. The absence
of an R&D subsidy effect is surprising, but we suggest why in Table 4.

       Columns (4)-(6) of Table 3 repeat the specification in the first three columns but use

dirty patents as the dependent variable instead of clean. The coefficient on fuel prices

is negative and significant in all columns. In column (4) a 10% increase in fuel prices

is associated with about a 6% decrease in dirty innovation. The estimates on spillovers

and knowledge stocks are symmetric to those in the clean equation. Exposure to dirty

spillovers fosters future dirty innovation, whereas clean spillovers reduces dirty patenting.

The coefficients suggest that a firm’s own history of either dirty of clean patenting has a

positive effect on further dirty patenting, but the effect of past dirty patenting is stronger

on future dirty innovation than past clean.
       In summary, Table 3 offers considerable support for our model. First, higher fuel

prices significantly encourage clean innovation and significantly discourage dirty innova-

tion. Second there is path dependency in the direction of technical change: countries and
firms that have a history of relatively more clean (dirty) innovation are more likely to

innovate in clean (dirty) technologies in the future.
  36
    This effect is not predicted by the theory but could arise from cross-technology knowledge spillovers
(the cost coefficient ψ could depend on the amount of accumulated knowledge in clean and in dirty).

5.2     Grey Innovations

      Our dirty category includes innovations relating to improvements in the energy effi-
ciency of internal combustion engines. We labeled these “grey” innovations and consider

disaggregating the dirty category into these grey and purely dirty innovations. As noted
in the theory Section the effect of fuel prices are more ambiguous in this middle grey
category. On the one hand, there are incentives to substitute research away from purely

dirty into grey innovation when the fuel price rises. On the other hand, there is also
an incentive to switch away from the internal combustion engines completely (including
grey) towards alternative clean vehicles.

   Table 4 presents the results and shows that, as expected, the coefficient on the fuel
price for grey innovation in the second column (0.282) lies between the coefficients on clean

(positive at 0.848 in column (1)) and purely dirty (very negative at -0.832 in column (3)).

This is consistent with fuel prices having a positive effect on energy efficient innovation,

although smaller and insignificant when compared to the effect of fuel prices on purely

clean innovations. Another interesting feature of the results is that the coefficient on R&D

subsidies is positive and significant in the grey innovation equation whereas it continues

to be insignificant in the clean and purely dirty equations. This is consistent with the fact

that the majority of these government subsidies are for energy efficiency (see Appendix

B) rather than more radical clean technologies.

   Since we have also disaggregated the spillover stocks and the firm’s own past innovation
stocks into the three categories now we have six variables reflecting path dependency on

the right hand side of the regression. The coefficients on these variables take a broadly

sensible pattern, but precision has fallen as there is likely to be some collinearity issues
with a large number of highly correlated variables.

   Given how demanding this specification is we find the overall results from Table 4

encouraging and consistent with the theory.




                                             28
5.3       Extensions and robustness

Table 5 considers the alternative econometric approaches for dynamic count data models
with firm fixed effects discussed in Section 3. First, we follow Hausman, Hall and Griliches

(“HHG”) in column (1) for clean patents and column (3) for dirty patents. The signs of
coefficients are generally the same as in our baseline model of Table 3, but the marginal
effect of fuel price is much greater in absolute magnitude for dirty innovation and smaller

(and insignificant) for clean. Indeed the magnitude of the estimated elasticity for dirty
patents seems unreasonably large (-2.457). We suspect that the assumption of strict
exogeneity underlying HHG is problematic in our context, as we have a highly dynamic

specification. Columns (2) and (4) implement the Blundell et al (1999, BGVR) estimator.
The pattern of the spillover effects and dynamics remain similar to the baseline regression,

and we still obtain a positive and significant effect of fuel prices on clean innovation

and a negative and significant effect on dirty innovation. The fuel price coefficients are

comparable to the baseline case.37
       The final two columns of Table 5 uses relative patenting ln(1 + P ATClean,it ) - ln(1 +

P ATDirty,it ) as the dependent variable in an OLS regression with firm dummies (i.e. the

linear within groups estimator). Column (5) shows that there is a significant and positive

effect of fuel prices on relative innovation. Column (6) shows that this result is robust to

including a full set of country by year fixed effects to absorb any potential country specific
time varying policy variables.38
       Could the results somehow be driven by firms who were not patenting prior to 1986?

Table 6 repeats the baseline regressions for our three count data models (BGVR, HHG
and CFX) restricting the sample to firms with at least one patent before 1986. This leads
to only small changes in the coefficients and no change in the overall qualitative patterns.

       Oil prices are broadly global, so most of the country-specific variation over time in
  37
     However, notice that we find larger values for the effects of clean knowledge stocks on clean patenting
and dirty knowledge stocks on dirty patenting than in both the baseline CFX and the HHG specification.
This could mean that the BGVR approach is not fully controlling for all the fixed effects by relying on
pre-sample patenting only.
  38
     The country here is based on the headquarters whereas the previous country variables like fuel price
with weighted averages using patent weights. Note that it is computationally infeasible to include the
full set of country by time dummies in the non-linear count data models.



                                                    29
fuel prices comes from differential taxation. Consequently, Table 7 substitutes fuel taxes
for fuel prices showing again a similar pattern of results. One difference is that the
point estimates of the fuel price response are smaller in absolute terms for both types of

innovation. This is to be expected as demand is driven by the final price the consumer
pays rather than the fuel tax itself.
       We experimented with changing the cut-off year to 1990 and ran the regressions 1991-

2005 using data from 1965-1990 to construct the weights. The results in Table 8 are quite
comparable to our baseline, although standard errors are a little larger as we would expect
from using a smaller sample for the regressions.

       Table 9 reports alternative dynamic specifications for fuel prices. The first five columns
are for clean and use fuel prices dated in the current year in column (1), lagged one year

in our (baseline) of column (2), lagged two years in column (3) and lagged three years

in column (4). In column (5) we construct a geometrically weighted average of past fuel

price levels as proposed by Popp(2002).39 We repeat these specifications in the last five

columns but use dirty patents instead. With all these approaches we find price coefficients

that are very similar to our earlier estimates with a positive elasticity of clean patents

with respect to fuel price of around unity and a negative elasticity of dirty patents of
                 40
around -0.6.

       We conducted other robustness tests reported in Appendix A. First, our outcome

variable is Triadic patents, those filed at all three main patent offices in the world (USPTO,
EPO and JPO). A concern is that this screens out too many of the lower value patents.

To address this we ran our regressions based on biadic rather than triadic patents; i.e. we

included all patents into the construction of the innovation and knowledge stock variables
that are filed at the EPO and the USPTO but not necessarily the JPO. Table A10

shows that the results are robust to this experiment. Second, we constructed the patent
  39
     Popp (2002) uses an adaptive expectations model
                                                   Pn of prices, in which the expected future price of
energy is a weighted average of past prices: Pit∗ = k=0 λk Pi,t−k . The parameter λ captures the speed at
which agents adjust their expectations based on the gap between the predicted and the realized values.
For comparison purposes we use the same adjustment factor of λ = 0.83 as in Popp (2002).
  40
     We tried to pin down more precisely the dynamic response structure by including multiple lags of
price simultaneously but autocorrelation in prices made it difficult as all coefficients tended to be zero,
as in Popp (2002).




                                                    30
stock variables - including the spillover variables - using citation weighted counts from all
worldwide patents (Table A11). This led to qualitatively similarly results, e.g. the fuel
price response is larger for clean patents than for dirty patents.41 Third, we experimented

with a wide range of other country specific variables and report that the results are robust
to these additional covariates.42 For example, in Table A12 we included total GDP in
addition to GDP per capita. The coefficient on GDP is insignificant and the basic pattern

of our results is robust to this extra control (see Table A12).


6       Simulation results

       To obtain a better sense of the aggregate magnitude of the results we report a number

of counterfactual experiments. We explore the implications of our econometric models for

the evolution of future clean and dirty knowledge stocks and how this is affected by an

increase in the fuel price (generated, for example, by an international carbon tax). We

recursively compute values of expected patenting under different policy scenarios, use

those to update the knowledge stock variables (including the spillover variables) and feed

these into the next iteration. Hence if we split the right hand side variables xit into

variables that are functions of the lagged knowledge stock (kit ) and other variables such

as the fuel price (pit ), we can write xit = [kit , pit ] and a particular iteration in period T

greater than t as defined by:

                it+T are potentially counterfactual values of the policy and other control

variables. Our results imply that there is path dependence in the type of innovation

pursued, both through internal knowledge stock effects as well as external spillovers.
Here we explore how important this path dependence is in quantitative terms by studying
the evolution of both clean and dirty knowledge stock implied by our fitted models into

the future. We do this for every firm in the dataset and then aggregate across the world
economy in each period.
       More specifically, we are looking for conditions under which the clean knowledge stock

for the aggregate economy exceeds the dirty knowledge stock. In line with Acemoglu et al.
(2012a) this would be a requirement for clean technologies to be able to compete with
dirty ones, even without policy intervention. Our projections should be considered as a

rough exploration into the importance of carbon taxes and path dependency rather than
precise forecasts of future innovation.
       We focus on the period up to 2030 with 2020 as a focal point. This is somewhat

arbitrary but in line with scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA)43 suggesting
that globally fossil fuel use must peak by 2020 to avoid highly risky climate change. It is

also consistent with the European Commission’s 2020 targets.44

       We first check the within sample performance of the model by implementing simulation

runs providing recursively generated knowledge stocks over the regression sample period

(1986-2005) in Appendix Figure A6.45 Clean and dirty patent stocks are reported on the

y-axis. Comparing predicted aggregate patents to the actual values suggests that our

preferred CFX model does a reasonably good job at tracking the aggregate changes in

clean and dirty patenting (Panel A). The alternative BGVR and HHG estimates are not

terrible but do less well in later years (Panels B and C).

       Figure 5 reports simulations based on the regressions from Table 6 columns (1) and
(4) for years through to 2030. In Panel A we report the baseline case keeping fuel prices

(and time dummies) at their 2005 values.46 The regressions imply a strong enough path

dependency for the gap between dirty and clean knowledge stocks to remain far apart
for a considerable period of time. Clean innovation catches up with dirty only well after

2030.47 To what extent can carbon taxes speed up this convergence process? We examine

  45
     For the simulations we restrict the sample to the firms where we have pre sample information. In this
way we do not have to make further assumptions as to how changes in the spillover and policy variables
would affect firms where these variables are essentially missing.
  46
     We assume per capita GDP grows at 1.5% p.a., but report alternative assumptions in Figure 6.
  47
     Catch up occurs because of delayed reaction to fuel price hikes leading up to 2005 and GDP per

the effects of a permanent worldwide increase in fuel prices in 2006 (and fixed at this
level thereafter) of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% in Panels B through F respectively. In
Panel B we see that the gap between clean and dirty becomes smaller with a fuel price

increase of 10% both because there is more clean innovation and because there is less
dirty innovation. However, parity is achieved between clean and dirty only after 2030. It
would take an increase of 40% in fuel prices in order to achieve parity in 2020 according

to our model (Panel E). This is a pretty large increase - comparable with the increase
that took place in the 1990s in Figure 1.
    One criticism of the simulation is that we would expect such a large increase in the fuel

prices to have a negative effect on GDP per capita due to deadweight costs of taxation,
adjustment costs and so on. This in turn could slow down the growth of clean innovation

(e.g. Gans, 2012). To obtain some insight into the magnitude of these effects, Figure 6

considers the 40% fuel tax hike scenario coupled with a negative effect on GDP per capita

growth. Panel A reproduces the baseline case where there is no effect on GDP (as in

Figure 5 Panel E). Panel B considers a fall in the growth rate by 0.25 percentage point

(e.g. from 1.5% to 1.25%). This postpones the crossover year because income growth has

a stronger positive effect on clean innovation than dirty innovation in our estimates. But

the effect is rather small, moving the crossover year from 2020 to 2022, only two years.

Larger tax-driven falls in GDP per capita growth postpone things further, but it would

take a full one percentage point a year fall in the growth rate to postpone the crossover
year beyond 2030. We view it as unlikely that fuel taxes would knock a percentage point

off annual growth for 15 years or more and this also ignores the damaging effects of

global warming itself on economic growth over the medium run. We therefore take some
comfort from Figure 6 that incorporating output effects would not dramatically change

the conclusions from Figure 5.

    In Figure 7 we explore the importance of path dependence for the simulations. First
we repeat the baseline specifications allowing for all dynamic adjustments in the cases

of no fuel price change (Panel A) and of a 40% increase (Panel B). In panels C and D

and own knowledge stocks - at their 2005 levels. As a consequence both clean and dirty
innovation and thus the growth rate of knowledge stocks reduces markedly as firms no

longer benefit from standing on the shoulders of either their own or others’ past innovation
success. Also note that in Panel C where we keep prices fixed the gap between clean and
dirty is now much narrower than in the equivalent Panel A. Despite this, the 40% increase

in fuel prices in Panel D is much less effective than in Panel B where the dynamic effects
from knowledge stocks are switched on. This illustrates that path dependency is a double
edged sword as pointed out by Acemoglu et al (2012a). In the absence of effective policies

it creates a kind of lock-in for dirty innovation. But if effective policies are introduced
like a carbon tax or R&D subsidy, path dependency can help reinforce the growth of

clean innovation as the economy accumulates clean knowledge more rapidly. Hence, if we

switch off the two path dependency channel, innovation trends become less responsive to

tax policy.


7     Conclusion

In this paper we have combined several patent datasets to analyze directed technical

change in the auto sector, which is a key industry of concern for climate change. We use

patenting data from 3,423 firms and individuals between 1965 and 2005 across 80 patent

offices. Consistent with what theory predicts we find that “clean” innovation is stimulated
by increases in the tax-inclusive fuel prices (our proxy for a carbon tax) whereas dirty

innovation is depressed. We exploit the fact that prices evolve differentially across time

in countries in our dataset and that firms are differentially exposed to these price changes
because of their heterogeneous expected sales in geographic markets.

    Our second key result is that there is strong evidence for “path dependency” in the

sense that firms more exposed to clean innovation are more likely to direct their research
energies to clean innovation in the future (a directed knowledge spillover effect). Similarly,

firms with a history of dirty innovation in the past are more likely to focus on dirty

innovation in the future. The fact that such path dependency holds for clean (as well as


                                             34
dirty) innovation highlights the desirability of acting sooner to shift incentives for climate
change innovation. Since the stock of dirty innovation is greater than clean, the path
dependency effect will tend to lock economies into high carbon emissions, even after the

introduction of a mild carbon tax or R&D subsidies for clean. So this may make the case
for stronger action now, which could be relaxed in the future as the economy’s stock of
knowledge shifts in more of a clean direction. Increases to carbon prices can bring about

a change in direction. For example, our baseline results suggest an increase of 40% of fuel
prices with respect to the 2005 fuel price will allow clean innovation stocks to overtake
dirty stocks after fifteen years.

   Our analysis could be extended in several ways. First, we could extend the analysis
of output effects beyond the macro adjustments in the simulations of Table 6 to examine

the firm-level effects. This would require a large extension in terms of using data on

sales, however. Second, we could use our framework to simulate other policies, such as

country specific changes in carbon taxes (or R&D subsidies) to see how this would affect

the innovation profiles in specific countries rather than just globally. Third, the same

basic approach could be taken to look at other sectors than automobiles such as the

energy sector as in Acemoglu et al (2012b). Finally, we could use micro data to estimate

the relative efficiency of R&D investments in clean versus dirty innovation, and also the

elasticity of substitution between the two types of production technologies. As argued in

Acemoglu et al (2012a), these parameters play as important a role as the discount rate
in characterizing the optimal environmental policy.

A      Econometric Models
We separately examine clean and dirty patent counts using a standard Poisson model

                                  P ATzit = exp (xit βz ) ηzi + uzit                        (19)

where z∈ {Dirty, Clean} and xit is a vector of regressors including functions of the lagged
dependent variable. For identification we assume E(uzit |xit ) = 0.48 We consider four
alternative estimation techniques that allow for the possibility of firm level fixed effects
ηzit in the propensity to patent. The standard approach is Hausman, Hall and Griliches
(1984, HHG) who suggest a transformation akin to the within groups estimator in the
linear panel data context. In GMM terms, their estimator can be expressed as relying
on the following moment condition for identification (e.g. Blundell, Griffith, Windmeijer,
2002):                                          ¯ zi 
                                               P AT
                                                             
                           E    P ATzit − µzit           xkit = 0
                                                 µ̄zi
for all variable in xit where µzit = exp (xit βz ) and a bar represents the average of a
variable over time for a specific firm. Note that
                                                  ¯ zi
                                               P AT             µzit
                              P ATzit − µzit           = uzit −      ūzit
                                                 µ̄zi           µ̄zi
implying that we require strict exogeneity, i.e. the shock uzit must be uncorrelated with
xit not only contemporaneously, but in all periods; i.e. E {uzit |xiτ } = 0 for all t and τ .
When using regressors that depend on past realizations of the dependent variable such as
the knowledge capital stocks, this assumption is violated.
    Blundell, Griffith and Van Reenen (1999, BGVR) proposed an alternative estimator
which is robust to relaxing the strict exogeneity assumption. It relies on introducing
a control function term for the fixed effects, which is identified from realizations of the
dependent variable in a pre-sample period. Hence, the idea is to think of the fixed effect
as the combination of a control term φ (·) and an error, ωi .
                                      ¯ zi0 , I P AT
                                                  ¯ zi0 = 0 + ωi

                         ηzi = φ ln P AT

where P AT¯ zi0 is the average amount of patenting by firm i in the pre-sample period.
                                             ¯ zi0 + φz2 I P AT
                                                             ¯ zi0 = 0 , pre-determined
                                                                       
BGVR show that with φ (·) = exp φzl ln P AT
xit 49 and stationarity in the dynamic system implied by equation (19) estimates of βz are
  48
   Note that we can equivalently represent the model in terms of a multiplicative shock νzit with
E(νzit |xit ) = 1. We would have
                                                    uzit
                                    νzit = 1 +
                                               exp (xit βz ) ηzi
  and our assumptions concerning uzit imply E(νzit |xit ) = 1.
  49
    i.e. E {uiτ |xit } = 0 f or τ ≥ t.


                                                   41
unbiased as the duration of the pre-sample period becomes large. Thus, effectively we
estimate the following model:
                                           ¯ zi0 + φz2 I P AT
                                                           ¯ zi0 = 0 + uzit
                                                                   
            P ATzit = exp xit β + φzl ln P AT

The BGVR approach requires the realizations of the dependent variable in the pre-sample
period to be representative of a firm’s behavior over the sample period. Formally, the series
must be mean stationary (conditionally on the time dummies). It is easy to see why this
might be violated in particular for clean patents, whose realizations are concentrated
towards the end of our sample period. Consequently, for many firms we do not observe
any clean patenting in the pre-sample period which could inform us about variations in
their fixed propensity to patent in clean.
     To address this problem we propose a new estimator in the same spirit of using a control
function as in BGVR. However, rather than using information from the pre-sample period
to calibrate the control function, we simultaneously exploit future data. We estimate the
main regression equation as well as a second equation allowing us to identify the control
function from future data. The key idea is the following. In general, a control term
φ̆zit (·) will lead to consistent estimates, if the resulting error term ω̌zit = ηzit − φ̆zit (·) is
orthogonal to xit ; i.e. E {ω̌zit |xit } = 0. Note, that given a parameter vector β we can
obtain such an estimate by regressing50

and we can interpret φ̆zit (xit ) as the expectation of the fixed effects given xit :

                                              φ̆z (xit ) = E {ηi |xit }
As in the standard case we parameterize φ̆z (xit ) as an exponential function,51

                                              φ̆z (xit ) = exp (xzit γ)

.
         Notice, that given this control function we can transform our main regression equation
as
                        P ATzit                                           ω̆zit           uzit
                                     = exp (xit βz ) + exp (xit βz )                +                  (22)
                        φ̆z (xit )                                     φ̆z (xit )       φ̆z (xit )
where we replaced ηi by φ̆zit (xit ) + ω̆zit and divided by φ̆zit (xit ). Because the xit are
pre-determined, given the definition of ω̆zit and recalling the definition µzit = exp (xit βz )
we have that
    50
     For notational simplicity we write the following equation with just one
                                                                           PTfuture  term. In practice we can
                                                                       1         P ATziτ
improve efficiency by regressing on an average of future values T −t+1       τ =t µ ziτ  . In our regressions
reported above we identify the control function from averages over the current and one future period; i.e.
T =t+1
  51
     In theory we can even allow a more flexible specification where the conditional expectation varies
over time; i.e. φ̆zt (xit ) = Et {ηi |xit }. This could reflect firms learning more about their fixed effect
over time for instance. In practice this increases the number of parameters to be estimated greatly and
becomes computationally very burdensome. In our baseline results we therefore fix φ̆z (·) over time.

   Hence, we have two equations that depend on each other as well as two sets of moment
conditions. We can consequently estimate equations (20) and (22) as a system of two
simultaneous equations using the sample analog of the following moments
                            (       P ATzit

                                             − φ̆z (xit )
We refer to this approach below as the control function fixed effects estimator (CFX).
   In addition to these three dynamic count data approaches we also explore the common
practice of implementing equation (19) as a linear panel data estimator by taking logs of
the dependent variable after simply adding the value of unity (an arbitrary constant); i.e.
the regression equation becomes:

                                ln (1 + P ATzit ) = xit βz + αzi + εzit

Although this model has undesirable features like generating negative predicted values
of patenting it is attractive because it is straightforward to estimate a relative clean vs.
dirty regression; i.e.


  ln (1 + P ATClean,it ) − ln (1 + P ATDirty,it ) = xit (βClean − βDirty )                             (24)
                                                        + (αClean,i − αDirty,i ) + (εClean,it − εDirty,it )
                                                                                                        (25)

   We show in the results section that the results are qualitatively similar no matter
which precise estimation technique we use.


B      Data Appendix
B.1      Basic dataset
As described in the main text we draw from PATSTAT data all patent filings relating to
IPC classes over clean and dirty auto innovation as defined in Table 1 and illustrated in
Appendix Figure A1-A4.52 Our patent data is drawn from the World Patent Statistical
Database (PATSTAT) maintained by the European Patent Office. We use the September
2009 version of PATSTAT. The innovation outcomes we use as the dependent variable and
in the construction of the spillovers and own lagged innovation stocks are triadic patents
(filed in all three of USPTO, EPO or JPO). For the weights (see below) we use a wider
definition to patenting.
     If a single patent filing has multiple IPC codes we include it so long as at least one of
the IPC codes relates to clean or dirty innovation.53 Patents are coded by whichever firm
  52
     To identify clean and dirty innovations filed at the US patent office we use the same IPC codes as
the ones used for EPO and JPO patents. However, the USPTO has only recently adopted the IPC
classification so a few older US patents do not have IPC codes. We therefore complement IPC codes with
their US equivalents using the IPC/US concordance table available on the USPTO website
  53
     In the small number of cases where a patent had both a dirty and a clean IPC code we coded the
patent to be clean, but nothing hinges on this.

                                                        43
first applied so we ignore traded patents, but these are rare: less than 3% of triadic patents
are traded. As is standard in the literature, patents are dated by their application/filing
date as this is close to the time when the R&D was performed.

B.2     Identifying unique patent holders
The PATSTAT database reports the name of patent applicants, but a common problem
with patent data is that the name of patentees often varies, because of spelling mis-
takes, typographical errors and name variants. To identify unique patent holders we
use the ECOOM-EUROSTAT-EPO PATSTAT Person Augmented Table (EEE-PPAT)
database, available at http://www.ecoom.be/nl/eee-ppat, which provides a dictionary of
harmonized patent applicants’ names produced through a computer algorithm followed
by visual inspection. We then manually check the name match, which allows us to put
together companies that a typical computer algorithm would consider distinct. For exam-
ple we match Ford Motor Company with Ford Werke, its German subsidiary. As a result,
we are able to reduce the number of distinct patent holders of clean and dirty patents
from 20,916 to 3,423; 2,427 of which are companies and 996 are individuals.

B.3     Firm-level weights
B.3.1    Weights based on patent portfolios
As explained above in the main text, the firm-specific fuel price is computed as the
weighted geometric mean of the fuel prices across countries with weights reflecting the
shares of the corresponding countries in the firm’s patent portfolio. Our price variable is
thus defined as:                           X
                                                FP
                               ln F P it =    wic0 ln F P ct                          (26)
                                              c
                                                                         FP
where F P ct is the tax-inclusive fuel price in country c at time t and wic0 is the firm-specific
weight for country c. In order to make sure that the computed exposures are an exogenous
source of variation across firms, the weights are calculated using the patent portfolio of
each company over the 1965-1985 “pre-sample” period (with the regressions performed
on the 1986-2005 period). We cross check the 1985 cut-off in the robustness section using
1965-1990 as the pre-sample period for weights and 1991-2005 for the regression sample.
    To make matters concrete consider the example of Hitachi, a large Japanese car parts
manufacturer, who filed 90,381 patents between 1965 and 1985. 63,175 of these filings
were in Japan, 8,315 in the US and 3,498 in Germany. The rest were in a large number of
other patent offices. Note that there are a larger number of filings than there are patents,
as one invention can be filed in multiple patent offices. For example, Hitachi’s patent
11464997 (this is the DOCDB family number) was developed by a Japanese inventor and
filed in 1980 both in Japan and in the US. This patent enters twice in the patent-portfolio
weight: once for Japan and once for US, since it indicates that both the US and Japan
matter for Hitachi. Hitachi’s 90,381 patents filed between 1965 and 1985 correspond
to only 70,526 distinct inventions (or patent families), some of which were patented in
several countries even though almost all of Hitachi’s R&D activities are conducted in
Japan (we use inventor location below for spillovers - see next section). In order to reflect
the greater importance of larger countries when constructing fuel price weights, we take
each country’s average GDP over 1965-1985 into account (although nothing hinges on this
for the results). The firm-specific weight for country c is thus equal to:



                                               44
                                               sF P GDPc

                                                c sic0 GDPc

where sFic0P is the share of country c in Hitachi’s patent portfolio between 1965 and 1985
and GDPc is the share of country c in the world’s GDP over 1965-1985. The weights
used for Hitachi are 68.8% for Japan, 23.9% for US and 2.7% for Germany. The weights
summed across all other countries was 4.6% so the total weights sum to 100
                                             FP
    We use the patent-portfolio weights, wic    , to construct the fuel price, fuel tax, GDP
per capita and emission regulations variables. Note that in constructing the weights we
use all patent filings from applicant firms who have filed at least one auto-related patent.
These are all applicants who have filed a dirty or clean patent as defined by Table 1 from
the OECD or in an IPC class defined as autos according to the OECD’s cross walk. We
could have also included patent filings by applicants who were part of the auto-related
firms who had never filed for a clean or dirty auto patent according to our definitions.
This would have increased our sample of patent filings from 4.5m to about 16m. We chose
not to do this as many of these patents are only distantly related to autos and so would
not be relevant for tracking the demand for cars. Going in the other direction, we could
narrow our definition to include only patents in IPC classes we deem as clean or dirty and
exclude all other patents by the same applicants. Building weights from this narrower
pool led to similar results to those presented in the main text.
    Although we have filings in 80 patent offices, the 25 countries we use for the fuel
price data are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and the USA.

B.3.2     Weights based on location of inventors
To construct the firm-specific spillover pools in clean and dirty knowledge we use an
analogous empirical strategy to that for the fuel price. The firm-specific spillover pool is
computed as the weighted geometric mean of the knowledge pools across countries with
weights reflecting the shares of the corresponding countries in the firm’s pool of inventors.
The spillover pool for firm i is calculated as:
                                            X
                                                 S
                               SP ILLzit =      wic0 SP ILLzct                          (28)
                                                  c

where z ∈ {Dirty, Clean} and SP ILLzct is the spillover pool in country c at time t,
                                                                 S
which can be firm specific (see below). The spillover weight wic0   is the share of all firm i’s
inventors (i.e. where the inventors worked when they discovered the invention) in country
c between 1965 and 1985.
                                                            FP
    This weight differs from the patent-portfolio weight wic0  described above in two ways.
First, instead of using information on where each patent was filed (for example, the
USPTO) we use the location of the patent inventors (who are more likely to benefit from
other research conducted locally). Inventor countries are counted fractionally, so if a
patent is filed by two inventors, one from Germany and one from the US, each country
will receive one half.54 Note that we use information on the country of residence of the
inventor, not on his nationality. This seems natural because the geographical location of
the inventor is likely to be the critical issue for knowledge spillovers.
  54
   We do this in order to avoid giving an artificially higher weight to a patent with multiple inventors
compared to one with just a single named inventor


                                                  45
    The second difference with respect to patent-portfolio weight is that each invention is
only counted once, no matter in how many patent offices it has been filed. This is to avoid
double counting. Returning to Hitachi’s patent 11464997 filed in 1980 both in Japan and
in the US, this patent enters twice in the patent-portfolio weight but only once in the
                                                                             FP
inventor location weight, as a Japan-developed invention. So although wHitachi,Japan     =
                   S
0.688 as above, wHitachi,Japan = 0.99. This indicates that although almost all Hitachi’s
R&D is based in Japan, it sells car parts to a much wider geographical market.
    The spillover pool SP ILLz,ct is defined as:
                                               X
                                                   S
                                SP ILLz,ct =     wjc Kz,jt                             (29)
                                                    j6=i

i.e. the spillover pool of a country is the sum of all other firms’ patent stocks with a weight
that depends on how many inventors the other firm has in that country. The aggregate
stocks in equation (29) are thus entirely based on firm level stocks. This allows us to
make out of sample simulations of aggregate stocks below using firm level equations only.
     As an alternative strategy we constructed country level spillover stocks by aggregating
over all patents of inventors based in that country:
                                                   X
                              SP ILLz,ct =                     Kz,cjt                      (30)
                                           j∈Inventors based in c

where Kz,jct = P ATz,it + (1 − δ)Kz,jt−1 and P ATz,jt are the patents filed that associated
with inventor j in year t. Empirically, both methods give very similar results. For con-
sistency with our simulation results we use the first method (Equation (29)) throughout
the paper.
    We also use the inventor weights to construct the amount of R&D in energy-efficient
transportation in country c at time t.

B.4     More descriptive statistics on patents filing and citations
For every patent in our data set, we know whether the invention has also been filed (prior
to or following the first filing of the patent at USPTO, EPO or JPO) at any other patent
office included in PATSTAT (over 80 offices). Table A2 provides information on the
geographical coverage of clean and dirty innovations for some of the main patent offices.
Interestingly, 31% of clean inventions are also patented in China. This is almost twice
the rate for dirty inventions (18%). Germany’s specialization in traditional combustion
engines is apparent from this table, with 61% of dirty patents protected in Germany but
only 41% of clean patents.
    When a patent is filed, it must include citations to earlier patents that are related to the
new invention. Citations to earlier patents are indicative of the accumulated knowledge
used by the inventor to develop the new invention (e.g. Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002).
There are 181,151 citations for all clean and dirty triadic patents included in our data set
(13.1 citations for the average patent). Among patents cited by clean patents, 47% are
clean, whereas 5% are dirty. The remaining 48% refer to other, neither clean nor dirty
(Table A3). If citations were not technology specific we would expect that the likelihood of
a citation to a dirty patent would be three times higher than towards a clean patent. The
likelihood of a clean on clean citations (47%) is almost as high as the likelihood of dirty
on dirty citations (59%). This suggests that within category spillovers are much higher
than between category spillovers. This is consistent with path-dependent innovation as
the theory suggests.

B.4.1   Other data
Fuel price and fuel tax come from the International Energy Agency’s Energy Prices and
Taxes database, available online at http://data.iea.org. We use Households End-Use
Prices in USD PPP/unit. Since data are available for both diesel and gasoline fuels, we
define fuel price as the average of diesel and gasoline prices.
    Data on public R&D expenditures comes from the IEA’s Energy Technology Research
and Development database, available online at http://data.iea.org. We use Total R&D
in Million USD (2010 prices and exchange rates). We use the data on public R&D
expenditures in ”Energy efficiency - transportation” (Flow 13). This includes: electric
cars, hybrid cars and stirling motors; analysis and optimization of energy consumption in
the transport sector; efficiency improvements in light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles,
non-road vehicles; public transport systems; engine-fuel optimization; use of alternative
fuels (liquid, gaseous); fuel additives; diesel engines. Note that the IEA also reports R&D
on ”Hydrogen and fuel cells”, in particular ”fuel cells for mobile applications” but the
data only start to be available in 2004, at the very end of our sample.
    Data for environmental standards governing maximum permissible levels of tailpipe
emissions for pollutants from new automobiles were sourced from a dataset originally
constructed by Perkins and Neumayer (2012). Countries’ regulatory stringency is coded
on a scale of 0 to 5. The basis of the classification scheme is the European Union’s (EU)
Euro emission standards which were originally implemented across member states in 1992
and have subsequently been tightened in a series of incremental steps. Countries are coded
0 if they had no national emissions standards in place for new vehicles, or if standards
were less stringent than the equivalent of Euro 1, during the year in question. Countries
where Euro 1 or its equivalent was legally enforceable are coded 1, and so on, with 5 for
countries having implemented the equivalent of the Euro 5 standard.
    Data on GDP, GDP per capita and population are taken from the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators, available at http://data.worldbank.org/. GDP and GDP
per capita are PPP and constant 2005 USD.
    Sales data used to compare the patent weights with sales distribution are from com-
pany accounts (see the URLs in notes to Table A1).

share	   of	   inventors	   located	   in	   the	   US	   for	   the	   same	   companies	   (on	   the	   x-­‐axis).	   The	   patent	   weight	   is	   used	   to	  
calculate	  the	  firm-­‐level	  fuel	  price	  and	  the	  inventor	  weight	  is	  used	  to	  calculate	  the	  firm-­‐level	  spillover	  variables.
