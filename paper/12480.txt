                                          ABSTRACT


The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act imposed work requirements
on welfare recipients. Using 1999-2001 data from Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we compared
the labor market and welfare experience of women with four employment barriers: poor mental
health, moderate to heavy drug and alcohol use, a child with a behavior problem, and a child under
the age of 3. Women with poor mental health and drug and alcohol users were much less likely to
move into work than other groups, and more likely to be sanctioned for noncompliance with welfare
requirements in 2000-2001 as federal work participation requirements increased.

I. Introduction



           It has been about ten years since Congress passed landmark legislation altering

the landscape of income assistance in the United States. The Personal Responsibility,

and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) replaced the entitlement

program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, with Temporary Assistance to Needy

Families (TANF), financed by block grants to the states, with the goals of increasing self-

sufficiency, reducing public program participation, and increasing incentives to work.

Key features of PRWORA toward those goals included: a 60-month lifetime limit on

receiving TANF benefits, work requirements for welfare recipients, and a federal

requirement that states impose sanctions (partial or full reduction of cash and in-kind

benefits for several months, or termination of benefits) for recipients who do not comply

with program requirements. 1 States have had the latitude to exempt up to 20 percent of

the pre-legislation caseload from requirements by deeming them unable to work. Typical

reasons for exemptions include caregiver responsibilities for young or disabled children,

for example, or health problems.

           In the early years after PRWORA, a consensus emerged among policy makers

and researchers that the legislation was a success based on an extensive literature

demonstrating reduced caseloads, more work among income support recipients, and

declines in the public program participation rate of single mothers (Blank 2002; Moffitt



1
    Under PRWORA, states are permitted to impose shorter lifetime limits, and stricter sanctions than those

described in the legislation, and some do. By 2002, states were required to meet 50% work participation

requirements. That is, 50% of the 1995 welfare caseload had to be engaged in work activity.



                                                                                                              1
2003) . Caseloads dropped by nearly 60 percent between 1996 and 2005 (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services 2006). Employment among single mothers

grew and poverty rates did not rise (Blank 2002). The economic expansion of the late

1990s played a role in this early success, but most agree that the reform had few if any of

the disastrous consequences feared by advocates for low-income families.

       The literature to date focuses on the average impact of welfare reform, though

recent work acknowledges that the mean impact likely misses variation in welfare

outcomes (Bitler, Gelbach and Hoynes 2005). The population receiving welfare is

heterogeneous and changing. Several studies from the mid-1990s document a wide range

of employment barriers among this population. These barriers include caregiver

responsibilities for family members (i.e. children or disabled), poor health, including

mental illness and substance abuse, and low human capital that hinder employment. Also

important are barriers such as a lack of transportation or child care that impede women

from maintaining employment (Danziger, Corcoran, Danziger and al. 2000; Gutman,

McKay, Ketterlinus and McLellan 2003; Zedlewski and Loprest 2001). Only a handful

of these barriers, such as caring for an infant, received explicit attention in PRWORA.

Despite the lack of federal attention to employment barriers, the presence of work

barriers has been widely discussed by state policy makers, welfare program

administrators, and advocates for low-income families. Many have predicted that over

time the TANF caseload would become increasingly disadvantaged as the most work-

ready recipients leave welfare, but research does support that prediction (Zedlewski

2003). In this paper, we focus on the response to PRWORA of two important groups of

recipients that carry work barriers related to mental illness and substance use disorders.




                                                                                             2
It is estimated that these groups represent 30 percent and 20 percent of TANF recipients,

respectively (Metsch and Pollack 2005; Zedlewski 1999).

       Most states recognize that some TANF recipients face substantial barriers to

employment, but states take dramatically different approaches to addressing these issues

depending on the nature of employment barriers. For example, federal legislation

exempts women from work requirements to care for an infant, and some states exempt

caregivers of older children. Some states screen for mental health disorders and

substance use disorders (SUDs) and allow treatment activity to count towards work

requirements. In some cases, work requirements are suspended completely while

recipients seek treatment. In other states, there is neither screening nor exemption from

work requirements for individuals with mental disorders or SUDs.

       There are several reasons why the states’ approaches to employment barriers in

TANF have attained additional policy salience recently. First, economic conditions and

the job opportunities for low skilled workers are not as favorable as they were following

the enactment of PRWORA in the late 1990s. Second, states will be under much greater

pressure to reduce caseloads and increase work among TANF recipients when work

participation targets are established based on 2005 caseloads, which are a fraction of the

1995 caseloads used in the early years of TANF. Third, the June 2006 interim final rules

and regulations for TANF reauthorization explicitly limit states’ flexibility to address

employment barriers in the TANF population by defining work activities more narrowly

than the original PRWORA legislation. For example, if a state allows mental health or

addiction treatment to count towards work activity, as some do now, the new regulations




                                                                                             3
would limit this exemption to a four week consecutive period, or six weeks out of a fiscal

year, defining this as job readiness and not work activity.



       In this paper, we ask, did the successes claimed for PRWORA extend to women

with groups that may have been disadvantaged by work barriers that received little

attention in the PRWORA legislation? Specifically, the goal of the paper is to: describe

the transitions into/out of work and income assistance for women with the following

employment barriers: mental health problems, moderate to heavy drug or alcohol use, a

child with a behavior problem, or a children under age 3 at home. We compare women

facing these barriers to women without any of these barriers, and we compare the work

and income assistance patterns of women across barrier groups. To make these

comparisons we examine several questions. Do women with these barriers respond to

work incentives during a period of increasingly binding work requirements, and an

improving economy? Do women with these barriers who use TANF get sanctioned for

noncompliance with welfare requirements more than other TANF recipients? We also

compare the barriers, since of those mentioned previously, only the presence of a young

child at home receives special attention in PRWORA, which allows states to exempt

recipients from work requirements when they are caring for an infant.

       Using longitudinal data on low-income women in Boston, Chicago, and San

Antonio in the 3-Cities study, we document several important patterns. First, women

with children under age three and women with a child who has a behavior problem

resemble other low-income women in terms of work status, welfare use, and the rate of

being sanctioned for noncompliance with welfare requirements. They work and use




                                                                                           4
TANF at rates that mirror women without these particular barriers. Second, women with

mental health problems and those who are moderate to heavy drug and alcohol users are

unlikely to move into work compared with other low-income women. They experience

greater rates of TANF use, lower rates of work, and are less likely to move out of a

“detached” state of neither work nor aid. Finally, though women with mental health

problems and drug and alcohol users appear to have been protected from sanctions in the

earlier time period, 1999, these women were much more likely than other groups to be

sanctioned, compared with other women on TANF, 12 to 18 months later. We consider

the implications of our findings for welfare program design.



II. Background

       Policies aimed at increasing work and reducing public income support have

particular importance for women with mental health problems and those who are

moderate to heavy users of drugs and alcohol since these women have a lower probability

of finding work, lower earnings conditional on working, and in same cases, they may

need additional time to obtain mental health or substance abuse treatment (Ettner, Frank

and Kessler 1997; Frank and Koss 2005). Women with mental health and substance

abuse problems have conflicting factors pushing them into work and aid. Because of the

lower likelihood of finding work, and because they earn less when working, compared to

similar women (Ettner, Frank and Kessler 1997; Frank and Koss 2005), they have fewer

incentives to work. However, because women with mental health and substance abuse

problems have historically had longer welfare spells (Loprest and Zedlewski 1999) they

are more likely to hit TANF time limits, and be pushed off of welfare sooner. If women



                                                                                           5
with employment barriers mirror the typical welfare recipient and act rationally by

leaving welfare in anticipation of time limits (Grogger 2003), we could expect looming

time limits to push women with employment barriers into work sooner.

       In 1999, approximately 28 percent of adult TANF recipients had poor mental

health status (Zedlewski 1999) and an estimated 20 percent of adult TANF recipients

reported recent use of illicit drugs, though less than 5 percent met criteria for drug

dependence, and about 9 percent met criteria for alcohol dependence (Metsch and Pollack

2005). Cross-sectional evidence from the National Survey of Drug Abuse in the mid

1990s showed that psychiatric disorders and cocaine use increased the likelihood of

welfare participation by 6 to 8 percentage points (Jayakody, Danziger and Pollack 2000).

Recent work based on the National Survey of Drug Abuse suggests that the rate of

welfare participation declined faster among users of illicit drugs compared to other low-

income women between 1996 and 2001 (Pollack and Reuter 2006), but this provides

limited evidence demonstrating how women with mental health problems and drug and

alcohol users have fared in the post-welfare reform era.

       Much of the extant evidence on women with employment barriers in the post-

PRWORA period comes from community-based samples of women. A rich source of

information on employment barriers is the Women’s Employment Study (WES), a

longitudinal survey of women residing in one Michigan county (Danziger, Corcoran,

Danziger and al. 2000; Danziger 2004; Jayakody, Danziger and Pollack 2000; Pollack,

Danziger, Jayakody and Seefeldt 2002). The WES provides cross sectional evidence that

women with depression and drug dependence are less likely to work 20 or more hours per

week (Danziger, Corcoran, Danziger and al. 2000) compared with otherwise similar




                                                                                            6
women. The longitudinal experience of these same women in Michigan shows that

women with mental health problems were no more likely to be disconnected from income

assistance and work compared with other women. In contrast, women in the study who

used heroin or cocaine were more likely to be disconnected from work and aid (Danziger

et al., forthcoming).

       A second community-based study sampled TANF recipients in Houston, Texas

(Montoya, Atkinson and Streuse 2001; Montoya, Bell, Atkinson, Nagy and Whitsett

2002; Montoya, Atkinson, Lichtiger and Whitsett 2003). This study of about 500 welfare

recipients reported that drug users and psychologically distressed recipients were slower

to move into work and their earnings profiles grow more slowly than other welfare

recipients in the post-PRWORA era (Montoya, Bell, Atkinson, Nagy and Whitsett 2002).

An important limitation of the study is that it observed only those women who applied for

TANF in the post-PRWORA period. Researchers have been quick to point out the

importance of changes in welfare entry to changing caseloads and labor market outcomes

(Grogger, Haider and Klerman 2003; Haider and Klerman 2005; Klerman and Haider

2004; Pollack and Reuter 2006), but most studies of employment barriers, like those in

Houston have focused on welfare exit only. To the extent that women do not apply for

welfare or are discouraged from completing the application process due to an

environment with stringent work requirements, time limits, sanctions, and policies

designed to exclude heavy drug and alcohol users from receiving cash benefits, we know

little about this important group of women.

       A series of studies on the CASAWORKS program, a multi-service intervention

for TANF recipients in 11 sites around the country provides additional evidence on work




                                                                                            7
barriers of recipients, and evidence regarding outcomes of women receiving a specific

intensive assessment and case management intervention (Gutman, Ketterlinus and

McLellan 2003; McLellan, Gutman, Lynch, McKay, Ketterlinus, Morgenstern and

Woolis 2003). It confirms that a diverse set of barriers to work are highly prevalent

among the welfare population, and the literature shows some improvement in work

outcomes among women receiving intensive case management. However, this work has

no control group, making comparisons of these women to other potential welfare

recipients around the country difficult.

       Another survey of low-income families in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, the

Welfare of Children and Families, or 3-Cities, provides rich information about women

living in poor neighborhoods in these cities in 1999-2001. An early study from the

survey described characteristics of women who were sanctioned in 1999 (Cherlin, Bogen,

Quane and Burton 2002), and later work examined the relationship between recipient

characteristics and work requirements, and whether these or other non-financial factors in

TANF affected TANF exit (Moffit 2003). Though work requirements had an important

affect on women’s work activity, Moffit (2003) demonstrated little relationship between

recipient characteristics and being subject to a work requirement. Like other literature

after PRWORA, this work tends to focus on the welfare population overall, though

Moffit (2003) demonstrated that those who were exempt from work requirements tended

to be exempt for health-related reasons. There is little evidence since PRWORA about the

role of employment barriers that received less attention in federal law, such as mental




                                                                                           8
health problems or substance abuse, 2 even though they are commonly cited barriers to

self-sufficiency in the welfare population and a focus of attention in recent Federal

regulations.

           Because state TANF programs vary greatly in approach to employment barriers

such as mental health and substance abuse, in contrast to the relatively uniform

agreement that mothers of infants should be exempt from work requirements, and

because of the attention to these barriers by both interest groups and policy makers, we

use data on welfare recipients from Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio to augment our

understanding of how women with different types of employment barriers respond to

work incentives after PROWRA.



III. Description of the data and sample characteristics

           We use panel data for 1999-2001 from the 3-Cities describing the circumstances

of low-income women living in Boston, Chicago and San Antonio (Winston, Angel,

Burton, Chase-Landsdale, Cherlin, Moffitt and Wilson 1999). The 3-Cities surveyed

nearly 2,400 families with children aged 0-4 or 10-14 in 1999 in low- and moderate-

income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio. The survey deliberately

over-sampled blacks and Hispanics, yielding roughly equal numbers of blacks and

2
    Women who use illicit drugs are of particular interest because many aspects of PRWORA and related

legislation of the mid 1990s targeted them. For example, PRWORA allows states to deny benefits to

convicted felons, the legislation allows state programs to test recipients for the presence of illicit drugs and

deny benefits on the basis of such tests (though few states perform suspicionless drug testing), and related

legislation abolished drug and alcohol disorders as qualifying disabilities for the receipt of SSI, eliminating

other potential sources of income assistance among women with SUDs.



                                                                                                               9
Hispanics with the remaining 10 percent of respondents reporting white non-Hispanic

race and ethnicity. For each “focal” child, the child’s female caregiver, usually the

mother, provided information on work, public program participation, mental health,

alcohol and drug use, child behavior and other information about work patterns, incomes,

and a rich set of outcomes. Each family’s income was below 200 percent of the federal

poverty level at the time of the Wave 1 interview, conducted between March and

December 1999. Wave 2 interviews were conducted with the same focal children and

caregivers between September 2000 and June 2001.

          Because many states did not fully implement welfare reform in 1997 and 1998,

we view the period between 1999 and 2001 as reflecting a period of tightening

constraints in the states as the first women reached lifetime limits and states

simultaneously began to feel the fiscal pressure of the recession that began in 2001. 3 We

compare how different women fared during a time of increasingly binding work

requirements and time limits. Specifically, we adopt a framework that compares changes

over time among women with and without various types of baseline employment barriers.

We interpret differences by barrier group over time as the differential response to welfare

reform by women with a particular employment barrier, such as poor mental health,

compared with other women likely to use welfare. We use the timing of the presence of a

barrier at the initial interview to explain subsequent work and program participation

outcomes, at the second interview.




3
    Ideally one would like data from before and after PRWORA, but similarly rich longitudinal data

spanning the 1990s do not exist.



                                                                                                     10
        For our analyses, we restrict the sample to women present in both waves,

excluding 348 female caregivers from our sample because the caregivers (n=152) or

someone else in their household (n=196) received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in

Wave 1. Once on SSI, which provides income assistance for poor disabled individuals,

recipients typically do not transition out of it, since strict eligibility requirements for SSI

stipulate that a recipient’s disability must prevent her from working (or performing usual

activities in the case of children) for at least 12 months or until death. We further

restricted the sample to the 1,637 female caregivers present in both waves.

Employment barriers

        The literature on welfare use and work documents a long list of possible barriers

to employment among likely recipients of welfare ranging from physical health problems,

mental health problems, problems with substance abuse, transportation, child care, low

levels of work experience and education, the need to care for young children or disabled

family members, to the presence of domestic violence in one’s household. We do not

consider the full range of possible employment barriers. Instead we focus on a set of

potentially important barriers that receive widely varying treatment across state TANF

programs. With these goals in mind, we chose to examine four barriers: the presence of

children under age 3, the presence of a child with a behavioral problem, the presence of

symptoms indicating poor mental health, and moderate to heavy drug and/or alcohol use

in the past 12 months.

        Regarding young children, there is a relatively clear consensus that welfare

recipients should receive exceptions from certain requirements when an infant is present

in the household. We contrast this barrier with poor mental health and heavy substance




                                                                                             11
use because there is widespread evidence that both reduce productivity, because state

welfare programs address these barriers very differently, and because these barriers have

received relatively little attention in academic studies despite debate between

PRWORA’s advocates and critics about the possible adverse consequences of PRWORA

for women with mental health problems and SUDs. 4 Furthermore, in light of recently

proposed regulations, states will soon lose the ability to exempt women with mental

health or substance use issues from work requirements, with the exception of a brief

period of treatment, not to exceed 4 weeks. States also provide exemptions to families

caring for disabled children, though it is less clear how states might deal with women

caring for a child with a behavior problem as opposed to a physical disability. The child

behavior barrier incorporates the widespread desire to link work exemptions to the care

of children, with the more ambiguous treatment of mental health problems across state

programs. Although we will refer to the group without the four barriers described here as

“barrier-free,” we realize that the women in our sample can and do experience any

number of other barriers.

           One strength of the 3-Cities data set is its rich information on public program use,

demographics, and living arrangements combined with rigorous measures of mental

health symptoms. Using the Brief Symptom Inventory, or BSI (Derogatis and Derogatis

1996), female caregivers are surveyed about 18 items relating to anxiety, depression, and

somatization. These items are converted into an overall measure of poor mental health,



4
    For an example of the discussion surrounding these barriers, see Legal Action Center. 1995. "State, local

welfare officials see important role for drugs and treatment in welfare reform." Unpublished, Zedlewski,

Sheila R., and Pamela Loprest. 2001. "Will TANF Work fo the Most Disadvantaged Families?"



                                                                                                           12
which is highly correlated with the existence of a diagnosable mental health disorder.

The cutoff measure of poor mental health, or “caseness” represents a fairly stringent

measure of poor mental health, and thus excludes many women with moderate mental

health issues. We use one, general, dichotomous measure of poor mental health in most

analyses, but we also show results with a continuous mental health measure. Other

studies have reported that 28 percent of the welfare population suffer from mental health

problems (Zedlewski and Loprest 2001), but the measure used here applies to less than

10 percent of the welfare caseload, a stringent cutoff for mental health problems. One

way to increase the precision of our estimates, and to provide information more generally

about the impact of mental health status is to use a continuous measure of mental health

as described above. For each analysis, we present the change in probability of an outcome

implied by moving from the mean natural log-transformed BSI score to one standard

deviation above the mean (something akin to the 28 percent estimate of mental health

problems in the welfare population).

       To measure child behavior problems, we use caregiver responses to a multi-item

Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach and Edlebroch 1979, 1978). This validated

instrument can be used to form a measure of whether children likely fall within the

clinical range for serious behavior problems.

       To develop a measure of moderate to heavy substance use, we use questions about

caregiver use of alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs in last 12 months. Women

were asked, “In the last 12 months, how often were you drunk?” Possible responses

include “never”, “once or twice”, “several times”, or “often”. Women were asked,

separately for marijuana and other illicit substances, “In the last 12 months, how often did




                                                                                         13
you use marijuana/other illicit drugs?” Possible responses were the same as those for

alcohol. Moderate to heavy use of alcohol and drugs equals 1 when respondents respond

“several times” or “often” to any of the three questions on alcohol, marijuana, and other

illicit drugs. We distinguish moderate to heavy use of alcohol and drugs from any use

because previous research suggests that only moderate to heavy substance use is

disruptive to labor market activities (Kaestner 1999). Furthermore, evidence suggests

self-reported moderate to heavy substance use is correlated with diagnoses of substance

use disorders (Epstein and Gfroerer 1994), something we confirmed in a national

population-based survey of drug use. 5



Descriptive characteristics of women

          Table 1 describes basic characteristics of 3-Cities respondents both unweighted

and weighted to make respondents representative of the sample frame of women in low-

income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio. For the remainder of the

paper, all analyses presented are weighted. Work status changed markedly over the brief

period between Wave 1 when 42.7 percent of the sample was working and Wave 2, when

55.3 percent of the weighted sample worked. At the same time, TANF receipt in this

sample nearly halved, from 25.8 percent to 14.7 percent. Among our sample, 23.9

percent were sanctioned in Wave 1 and 21.1 percent were sanctioned in Wave 2. Nearly

63 percent of women reported the most common employment barrier, having a child

    Among low-income women (those with under $20,000 in household income) in the 2002 National Survey

of Drug Use and Health, the authors’ calculations indicate that use measures similar to those described here

have a correlation coefficient of .45 with diagnostic measures of abuse or dependence of alcohol, drugs, or

both.



                                                                                                         14
under age 3 in the household, and 17.5 percent had a child with a behavior problem. Less

common barriers were mental health problems, 7.8 percent, and moderate to heavy use of

marijuana, drugs, or alcohol, about 9.4 percent. By Wave 2, 5.4 percent of women in our

sample reported that they, or someone in the household, received SSI.

       Table 2 shows information on TANF use, work, and income by survey Wave and

contemporaneous employment barrier status. In 1999, the barrier groups look relatively

similar on TANF use (about 14-17 months in last 2 years), but they have used TANF

more than their barrier-free counterparts, who used an average of 10.3 months of TANF

in the last 2 years. Respondent income from all sources differs little in Wave 1, though

women with young children, mental health, or drug/alcohol use have the lowest income.

What is striking in Table 2 is the difference in sanction rates both across employment

barriers and between waves. In Wave 1, women with Mental Health Problems appear to

be protected from sanctions relative to other groups, with sanction rates of 15 percent

compared with 27 percent among women with children under age 3. In Wave 2 however,

61 percent of women with a mental health problem report being sanctioned. A similar,

but less striking pattern is observed among women who used drugs and/or alcohol.

Similar to national trends, household income, respondent earned income, and work rose

in the 18 months after 1999, within each barrier group.



Welfare Environment in Boston, Chicago and San Antonio

       The 3 cities were chosen deliberately to differ from each other in terms of the

environment and implementation of welfare reform. For example, Massachusetts

obtained a waiver for its welfare program in 1995, and the waiver only recently expired




                                                                                           15
in September, 2005. On paper, Massachusetts’ waiver imposed stringent work

requirements, requiring work activity within 60 days of welfare receipt. It further

restricted welfare receipt to 24 months out any 5-year period. Massachusetts imposed

sanctions for failure to comply with work requirements, failure to cooperate with child

support enforcement, or failure to meet child immunization schedules. In practice,

however, the Massachusetts waiver exempts much of the caseload, including caregivers

of children up to age 6, from work requirements and time limits (Kirby, Pavetti, Maguire

and Clark 1997). In 2004, 74 percent of the Massachusetts caseload was exempt from

both time limits and work requirements (Joblessness and Urban Poverty Research

Program 2004). Because of high exemption rates, Boston can be thought of as an

example of a city that has not yet fully weathered welfare reform.

       Chicago has more stringent requirements for its TANF recipients. Illinois

requires work activity at some point within 2 years of receiving benefits. It enforces the

60-month time limit on benefits, but work and school activities do not count against

lifetime limit. Important features of the Illinois TANF program include: families with

children under age 1 and caregivers of disabled children or other disabled family

members are exempt from work requirements, and, in contrast to the other cities, mental

health and substance abuse treatment count as allowable work activity for up to 24

months (Administration for Children & Families 2002).

       San Antonio has the most stringent welfare climate. Texas is a work first state

that requires immediate work activity. Like most states, Texas has a 60-month lifetime

limit on benefits, but Texas imposes the most stringent time limits of the 3 cities. Time

limits on continuous benefits are 12, 24, or 36 months depending on the age of children in




                                                                                            16
the family and other household characteristics. After continuous benefit time limits are

reached, there is a 5-year “freeze out” period when individuals may not access TANF

(Rowe and Roberts 2004). There are some exemptions for caregivers with children up to

age 4. In Texas, drug felons can be denied benefits, as stipulated by PRWORA, and there

is no screening for mental health or substance use disorders (Legal Action Center 2002).

During the study period, Texas imposed sanctions on adult caregivers only, for a period

of at least 6 months. Recently Texas has imposed more stringent full-family sanctions,

including the temporary termination of in-kind benefits such as Medicaid.

           Economically, the poverty rates in the three cities do not differ as much as one

might think. Poverty rates ranged from 15 percent in Chicago to 19 percent in San

Antonio, and child poverty was 26 to 30 percent in the three cities (Winston, Angel,

Burton, Chase-Landsdale, Cherlin, Moffitt and Wilson 1999). Chicago and Boston were

similar, with the lowest poverty rates, and San Antonio had slightly higher poverty rates

of the three cities. During the 1990s, Massachusetts showed the strongest employment

growth among the three states (Joblessness and Urban Poverty Research Program 2004).

           Figures 1-3 depict welfare use in each city with Kaplan-Meier survival curves of

TANF spell length by employment barrier group. The figure shows continuous months

on TANF during the first TANF spell respondents’ experienced after welfare reform. 6

The figures show the heterogeneity in the welfare response across the three cities. In

Boston, for example, women with young children resemble other groups in the first 12

6
    We measure this period as June 1996, or 12 months before the first Texas families hit Texas’ 12 month

time limit under its state waiver, December 1996, or 24 months before the first Massachusetts families hit

the 24 month time limit, and 60 months before the first Illinois families hit time the lifetime limit, as

reported by the Administration on Children and Families.



                                                                                                            17
months of TANF receipt, but they are more likely to remain on TANF in later months.

This stands in contrast to San Antonio, where women with children under 3 move quickly

off of welfare, similar in nature to work showing that women with young children

respond most to time limits (Grogger 2003). In Chicago, women with children under age

3 differ little from other low-income women in their welfare use.

       In Boston and San Antonio, women who have children with behavior problems

exit TANF more rapidly than other groups. The other pattern that stands out is the lack

of movement off TANF among women with mental health or substance use barriers in

Chicago. Chicago seems to have longer continuous spells of TANF compared with the

other cities. Next we describe our analyses that consider TANF use, work, and the

likelihood of being detached from work and aid among all women in our sample, and not

just those using TANF.



IV. Work, income support, and being detached

       Ideally, we would specify a model of four work-income support states (work only,

work and income assistance, income assistance only, or none of the above) as a function

of all employment barriers simultaneously. A complete model would include effects for

employment barriers entered alone and interacted with each other to reflect the common

situation of multiple barriers. In practice, the limited sample size will not yield precise

estimates using this strategy. We take two steps to address this problem. First, we

collapse the two “work” categories into one category indicating that respondents are

working now. In practice, only about 3-5 percent of respondents report working and

receiving TANF simultaneously. Second, we estimate a separate model for each




                                                                                              18
employment barrier.          We estimate multinomial logit models of work and income

assistance of the following form:

                                  ⎛ Pr ( yW 2 = m | employment _ barrierW 1 , xW 1 ) ⎞
(1)        ln Ω m|work ( X ) = ln⎜⎜                                                     ⎟⎟ = xβ m|work
                                  ⎝ Pr ( yW 2 = work | employment _ barrierW 1 , xW 1 ) ⎠

The relative likelihood (compared with working) of receiving income assistance or

neither working nor receiving income assistance in Wave 2 is specified to be a function

of the following non-mutually exclusive respondent employment barriers in Wave 1:

               •   Respondent has poor mental health (n=124),

               •   Respondent is moderate to heavy use of alcohol and/or drugs (n=153),

               •   Respondent has a child under the age of 3 in the household (n=904),

               •   Respondent has a child with a serious behavior problem in the household

                   (n=352), or

               •   Respondent has none of the above barriers, or is “barrier-free” (n=468).

           We estimate separate specifications for each employment barrier to increase the

precision of our estimates. One should note several characteristics of this approach.

First, the reference group differs for each employment barrier. For example, the

reference group in a model of the impact of poor total mental health is everyone without a

mental health barrier. This includes women with no barriers and women with one or

more of the remaining three barriers. 7 Second, because many women have more than

one barrier, the coefficient estimates on a barrier such as mental health reflect both that

the direct effect of a mental health problem on work and aid, and the impact of having


7
    We also estimated models with a constant reference group, those women with no barriers. We found

similar results qualitatively and quantitatively, but the standard errors are much larger in these results.



                                                                                                              19
other barriers in addition to a mental health problem. From the standpoint of a welfare

administrator who seeks to efficiently target clients least able to fulfill work

requirements, the interpretation of effects may not pose any problem. Instead of

identifying multiple barriers, they might simply identify the single barrier that is most

indicative of an employment problem. We also estimated models including all four

barriers simultaneously, and find qualitatively similar patterns to those presented here,

with larger standard errors.

       We deliberately estimate models with parsimonious sets of covariates, depicted in

the vector X in equation 1, because some cell sizes are very small and thus we have

relatively few degrees of freedom. The covariates in X included: marital status (yes, no),

race and ethnicity (black non-Hispanic or Hispanic of any race, with white non-Hispanic

omitted), whether a respondent had a high school degree, city dummies (Boston omitted),

whether or not the respondent is a U.S. citizen, and the presence of preschool-aged kids,

or children under age 5, in the household (this covariate was omitted in models of the

effect of having a child under age 3 in the household). By conditioning our labor market

outcomes in Wave 2 on employment barriers and other Wave 1 characteristics, we

mitigate the potential for reverse causation, or the possibility that a respondent’s

movements in or out of work and TANF/SSI caused employment barriers such as poor

mental health, alcohol and drug use, or child behavior problems. To aid interpretation of

our results, we report results by transforming the model’s estimated coefficients into the

average predicted probability of work, aid, or neither (being detached) implied by a given

barrier, using the actual sample covariates.




                                                                                            20
       In some specifications, we explicitly estimate the transition from Wave 1 work,

TANF or neither to work, TANF/SSI or the detached state in Wave 2. To accomplish

this, we add terms to equation 1 for whether a respondent collected TANF in Wave 1,

whether a respondent was detached from work and aid in Wave 1, and interactions

between these variables and the barrier group of interest in equation 1. Each

specification is used to derive a transition matrix, or the predicted probability of

transitioning into work, aid, or neither in Wave 2, given Wave 1 work, aid, or detached

status. We show the implied transition probabilities both with and without each

employment barrier, adjusting for the covariates described earlier.



Results on Wave 2 work and income assistance

       Tables 3 and 4 show coefficients from the multinomial logit models of TANF/SSI

receipt or being detached compared with the probability of working, with and without

covariates. Each pair of columns comes from a different model comparing a different

barrier group to the rest of the sample. Women in the barrier-free group are slightly less

likely to be on TANF or SSI in Wave 2, but overall, this group does not differ

significantly from the remaining women in the sample. Women with mental health or

substance use problems, in contrast, are much more likely to be on TANF in Wave 2

relative to work, and these differences are statistically significant at conventional levels.

Women with either young children, or children with behavioral problems do not differ

significantly from other women in the sample with respect to their use of income

assistance or the likelihood that they will be detached from work or welfare in Wave 2.




                                                                                            21
       Table 5 summarizes the magnitude of these differences across barrier groups by

presenting the predicted probabilities of work, TANF/SSI, or being detached based on the

multinomial logit models with covariates shown in Table 4. Women with mental health

problems are least likely to be working in Wave 2, when 27 percent of them work and 54

percent collect income assistance, compared with 59 percent of the barrier-free women

who work in Wave 2. Women who use alcohol and/or drugs are also relatively likely to

be on TANF and less likely to be working. About 39 percent of these women work in

Wave 2, when 34 percent receive TANF or SSI. There is no difference in the work

patterns between barrier-free women and women with child-related barriers. This result

is interesting in light of the fact that women with young children are most likely to

receive exemptions from work requirements. Based on similar models using the

continuous BSI measure described earlier, a one standard deviation increase in the Wave

1 mental health scale (a deterioration in mental health), coincides with a 10.2 percentage

point increase in the use of TANF or SSI in Wave 2. The continuous mental health scale

is highly significant in the multinomial models predicting income support or no support

relative to work.



Transitions between work, aid, and being detached from work and income assistance

       Table 6 presents the coefficient of interest on multinomial models used to

estimate the adjusted transition matrix by barrier group. The signs of the coefficients

suggest that women experience a high degree of inertia during the period between waves.

That is, the most significant predictor of where women will end up in Wave 2 is where

they started in Wave 1. Two other results stand out. The interaction of Wave 1 TANF




                                                                                          22
and a mental health problem suggests that these women are much more likely to remain

on TANF compared with other women. In contrast, women with a drug or alcohol

barrier who start out in the detached state are significantly less likely to move onto TANF

than other women.

       Table 7 presents the adjusted transition probabilities by barrier group based on the

results in table 6, and it reports implied probabilities based on models using the

continuous mental health measure. Among those on TANF, 81 percent of women with

mental health problems stayed on TANF, compared with 38 percent in the barrier-free

group. A one standard deviation increase in the BSI score coincided with a statistically

significant 13.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of remaining on TANF among

those on TANF in Wave 1. Among women using drugs and alcohol, 51 percent of those

on TANF in Wave 1 remained there. For women in the mental health and drug/alcohol

groups, there is very little movement out of the detached state. Among women starting

out in the detached state, 71 percent of women with mental health problems and 64

percent of women with drug and alcohol problems remain detached compared with 42

percent in the barrier-free group. The women with child-related barriers show

remarkably little difference from the barrier-free group since 37 percent of women with

children who have behavior problems and 35 percent of women with children under age 3

remained on TANF in both waves.



V. Employment barriers and sanctions

       A cornerstone of PRWORA is that state welfare programs must impose sanctions

on recipients who do not comply with program requirements. One might expect higher




                                                                                           23
rates of sanctions among women in all of the employment barrier groups examined here,

particularly those that are not explicitly exempt from certain program requirements by

state TANF rules. We examined whether the probability of sanction differs by type of

employment barrier. Earlier evidence from the 3-Cities study documents that nearly one

fifth of respondents receiving TANF after Wave 1 were sanctioned (Moffit 2003).

Cherlin et al. (2002) studied sanctions during the Wave 1 interview in some detail,

determining that women with health problems, more children in the household, and

spousal interference in the household experienced greater rates of sanctions than other

women. The study examined use of marijuana and other illicit drugs, finding that

individuals reporting any marijuana use were also more likely to be sanctioned. This

work did not distinguish between light and moderate to heavy use of illicit drugs, nor did

it examine how sanctions related to alcohol use. Some evidence suggests that women

who use illicit drugs or alcohol are more likely to be sanctioned than other welfare

recipients (Metsch and Pollack 2005), and mental health advocates fear the same is true

for women with mental health disorders, but much of the evidence to date is anecdotal.

This debate would be enhanced by considering how rates of sanction, and the relationship

of sanctions to employment barriers, change over time.

       We computed the probability of being sanctioned, given recent welfare use in

each wave, as a function of Wave 1 employment barriers. To address the fact that fewer

women were using TANF by Wave 2, and thus the caseload differed between waves, we

restricted the sample to women who used TANF sometime since Wave 1 (n=548). This

approach allowed us to describe how the sanction environment changed over the study




                                                                                          24
period for women with a given employment barrier. We estimated the probability of a

full or partial-sanction (SANCTION) using the equation:

(2)     Pr( SANCTION)Wt = f (employment _ barrier, X , months _ on _ welfare)W 1 ,

where the specification and covariates in X match those in equation 1, and

months_on_welfare measures the months a respondent was on welfare beginning 24

months prior to the Wave 1 interview and ending with the Wave 2 interview, and f(.) is a

logit function. We estimated this separately for Waves 1 and 2, using the covariates

measured at Wave 1, and limiting the sample to 548 women present in both waves with

any TANF use after Wave 1.



Sanction results

       Recall from Table 2 that the rate of sanctions among women with mental health or

drug and alcohol problems increased dramatically between waves. Based on logit models

of whether women were sanctioned in Wave 1 or Wave 2 as a function of Wave 1 work

barriers, Table 8 reports the coefficient, standard error, and the predicted probability of

being sanctioned by barrier group. These results were estimated somewhat imprecisely,

but confirm the broad pattern shown in Table 2. Although women with mental health and

drug and alcohol users were less likely to be sanctioned in Wave 1 relative to other

groups, the rates of sanctioning increased substantially in Wave 2. Women with a mental

health problem had only a 3.8 percent chance of being sanctioned in Wave 1, but a 26.4

percent chance in Wave 2. Based on the continuous BSI measure, a one standard

deviation rise in the BSI accompanied an 8.5 percentage point increase in the probability

of being sanctioned compared with women at the mean BSI measure. Women who use



                                                                                              25
drugs and alcohol faced an adjusted probability of sanction of 13.3 percent in Wave 1 and

28.6 percent in Wave 2. This pattern of increasing sanctions between Waves 1 and 2 was

reversed among the barrier-free group, and among women with children who have

behavior problems.

           Although our models can describe the rate of sanctions as a function of

employment barriers, the results do not yield information on the magnitude of deleterious

effects of the sanctions, and the relatively small cell sizes for some barrier groups

preclude a detailed analysis of how subgroups of women fare. Prior work based on about

100 women in Wave 1 of the 3 Cities study who did not recover benefits after being

sanctioned revealed that caregivers handled this loss of income by either obtaining a job

or cutting down on necessities (Cherlin, Bogen, Quane and Burton 2002). For women

with mental health and substance use barriers, few transitioned from TANF into work,

and thus the latter approach seems more likely.



Multiple barriers

           In many settings women on welfare have been shown to have multiple

employment barriers. 8 In fact, the vast majority of women in our sample have more than

one barrier. We have estimated most of our specifications with interaction terms between

mental health problems and each of the remaining three barriers. We included similar

interaction terms for substance use problems and other barriers. From these models, one

can compare women who have no barriers, women with either a MH or SA problem only,

women with MH and SA (which commonly occur together) and women who have MH or

SA combined with each of the remaining barriers. However, a notable drawback to this
8
    See for example Zedlewski and Loprest 2001, Zedlewski 1999 or Gutman et al. 2003.


                                                                                        26
approach is that individual cell sizes (i.e. substance use barrier alone, or substance abuse

and mental health) are small, with 20 or fewer women in some cases. Though the overall

patterns support what we find elsewhere, the results are highly sensitive to our choice of

specification and unstable, so we omit the results here.



VI. Conclusions and Implications

       Our findings on welfare reform and employment barriers document several

important patterns. Women with child-related barriers transition into work in ways that

differ little from women without child, mental health, or drug use barriers. Federal

legislation provides exemptions from work requirements for the parents of infants, and

many state welfare programs expand this further for other young children and to care for

children with health problems. In contrast, many states offer no exemptions from work

requirements for mental health problems and substance abuse, and the states that do offer

exemptions will be limited in their ability to make exceptions if the regulations for TANF

reauthorization remain unchanged.

       Our second set of results demonstrated that women with mental health problems

and women who use drugs or alcohol heavily stayed on TANF longer than otherwise

similar women, and in later periods were sanctioned more frequently than other groups.

Women in the “detached” state who had mental health or substance use barriers

transitioned slowly from this state. In the unprecedented boom economy of the late

1990s and an era when women faced many new penalties for not going to work, women

with mental health and substance use barriers showed little behavioral response to those

incentives. For this subgroup of women, welfare-to-work policies neither moved them



                                                                                           27
into work nor protected them from financial hardship of having TANF benefits

sanctioned.

       Our work raises attention to one dimension of the optimal welfare program

design, sanctions of benefits for women who fail to meet program requirements. Unless

states explicitly wish to punish welfare recipients, optimal work requirements and

sanctions should target those groups that are most responsive to these policies. In other

words, among the welfare population, incentives to work, including sanctions, are best

targeted at women with relatively elastic labor supply. In an era where both policy and

the economic expansion of the late 1990s combined with PRWORA’s regulations created

unprecedented incentives for low-skilled single mothers to work, women with mental

health and substance users changed their behavior little. They continued to collect TANF

and did not work, even as the probability of being sanctioned increased after 1999.

Rather than creating behavioral change, sanctions imposed on unresponsive groups are

punitive.

       Until now, the federal government has been agnostic about recognizing

“exceptional” circumstances in welfare reform. States have taken very different

approaches toward granting exceptions to the work requirement features of welfare

reform, and if anything, new federal regulations regarding TANF reauthorization will

reduce the flexibility of states to address the needs of women with employment barriers.

Our results raise questions regarding whether the program incentives can motivate the

desired behaviors for important subpopulations of TANF recipients. The failure to

observe the desired response raises questions about the efficiency and fairness of

applying the same policy provisions to all population segments over time.

*This measures the change in predicted probability of work, aid, or being detached for a 1 SD rise in the log-transformed Brief Symptom Inventory measure
compared to mean.
 Percentages reported here are predicted probabilities based on multinomial logit models in table 4 of the likelihood of TANF/SSI or neither TANF/SSI nor work
(being detached) relative to work. All models control for covariates in Table 3, except for Child<3 models which omit covariate for preschool aged children
(under age 5).

*Continuous mental health measure is the natural log transformation of the Brief
Symptom Inventory. The predicted probability in brackets for this continuous measure
shows the change in the probability of sanction for a 1 SD rise in this measure compared
to the mean.
Note: Sample includes women using any TANF between waves 1 and 2. Model adjusts
for covariates in table 3 and months on TANF. a=significant at 10% level.
