                    Seigniorage, Inflation,
                        and Reputation



                           ABSTRACT




This paper derives a reputational equilibrium for inflation in a
model in which the government obtains valuable sei gniorage by
issuing fiat money in exchange for real resources.    One
insightful result is that, with contemporaneous perc eption of
actual government behavior and immediate adjustment of real cash
balances to new information, the Friedman elasticity solution for
maximal seigniorage is the reputational equilibrium. More
generally, the analysis shows that the objective of maximal
seigniorage produces an equilibrium inflation rate equal either
to a generalization of the Friedman elasticity solution or to the
rate at which the government discounts future seigniorage
adjusted for the growth rate, whichever is la rger.   Thus, the
model formalizes the conjecture that episodes of inflation rates
in excess of the Friedman solution are attribu table to high
discount rates for future seigniorage.   Adding aversion to high
expected inflation to the model, this analysis also rationalizes
the observation that- inflation rates are usual ly less than
Friedman's elasticity solution.

     A useful positive theory of inflation not only must explain

why governments commonly expand the stock of fiat money at an
inflationary rate, but must account also for wide variations in
inflation over time and place.    The observation that governments
desire seigniorage, which they obtain by issuing fiat money in
exchange for real resources, directs attention to a potentially
important element in such a theory.     The importance of

seigniorage in public finance extends back to ancient times.
Fischer (1982) presents data for 120 countries that summarizes
the importance of seigniorage in recent years.     A convenient way
to begin to analyze seigniorage as a motivation for inflation is
to ask the following question:    If •a government wanted to

maximize the present value of its flow of seigniorage, at what
rate would it issue fiat money?

     The essential analytical problem in answering this question
concerns the formulation of the government's choice set,
especially as it involves the determination of expected inflation
and the relation between expected inflation and actual money
issue.   An old strategy——see, for example, Friedman

(1942, 1971)——treats the expected inflation rate, Ep, as a policy
variable, and assumes that the government issues money at the
rate that validates its choice of Ep.    Using this framework,
Friedman obtains his elasticity formula.     Specifically, if the
elasticity of the stock demand for real cash balances with

respect to the expected inflation rate is —Ep/h, where h is a
positive parameter, a government seeking to maximize seigniorage
would set Ep equal to h—g, where g is the growth rate of cash
                               —2—

balance demand, and would issue money at the rate, h.      This

policy would produce an actual inflation rate, p, equal to h—g,
and, for the case of g equal to zero, would imply an elasticity
of demand equal to minus unity.

     Estimates of the inflation rate that would correspond to the

Friedman elasticity solution for maximal—seigniorge differ
widely.   For example, for the case of g equal to zero, Friedman

(1971) suggests a range of 5% to 50% per annum, whereas Cagan
(1956) suggests a range of 11% to 44% per month and Barro (1972),

using an explicit inventory—theoretic analysis of money demand,
calculates an average value of about 150% per month.    In any

event, it seems clear that actual inflation rates are usually

less than the Friedman elasticity solution, but that in some
historical cases the actual inflation rate has exceeded the
Friedman answer.

     An easy way to extend the Friedman framework to account for
inflation rates less than the Friedman elasticity solution is to
assume that most governments, for whatever reason, are averse to

high expected inflation rates and, hence, forego maximal
seigniorage.   Inflation rates in excess of the Friedman
elasticity solution are a bigger problem for this analysis.
Friedman (1971) suggests that such episodes reflect unusually

high discount rates for future seigniorage, which induce

governments to obtain more seigniorage now at the expense of less
seigniorage later by taking advantage of lags in the response of
real cash balances to accelerated money issue.   Friedman,

however, considers neither the possiblity that inflationary
                                           —3

expectations would anticipate this potential government behavior

nor the associated implications of high discount rates for an

inflationary equil ibrium.

        More recent analytical developments derive from related

reservations about the treatment of expectations in the Friedman
framework.       Calvo (1978) stresses that the Friedman elasticity

solution describes policies that are not time consistent and,
hence, would be relevant only if a government could bind itself
to fulfill its commitment regarding future inflation rates.                   In

reality, such an irrevocable commitment is not feasible.                   Indeed,
it would seem to contradict the concept of sovereignty.

Accordingly, it is wrong to treat inflationary expectations as a
policy variable.

        Calvo formalizes this limitation on policy by assuming that

the government regards inflationary expectations as given and not

subject to its choice or influence.                 Using this framework, Calvo
finds that a desire to maximize seigniorage woul d lead to money
issue at the fastest          phy s i call y   possible rate.    This policy would
produce an inflation rate                      which is presumably much larger
than h—g.       oreover, if the given inflati onary expectations are
rational, the Calvo a nalysis impl ies that expected inflation
would equal       p   ,   and that bo th th e real s tock of cash demanded

and real ized seignioraqe would be small, at least relative to the

Outcome under the Friedman elastic ity sol Ut             jon.
        Alt hough the infeasibility of policy commitmen ts would seem

to be a fundamental consideration in the analysis of seigniorage,

Calvo   'S   alternative to Friedman's analys is clearly is not
                                —4

descriptively realistic.   Even in hyperinflationS governments
rarely issue money at the fastest physically possible rate.

Moreover, in the Calvo framework, aversion to high expected
inflation cannot explain low inflation because the government

takes inflationary expectations as given.    In response to this

problem, Barro (1983) assumes that governments are averse to
inflation, whether expected or not, and he derives a variation on

the Calvo result in which the inflation rate is less than p by an

amount that depends on the strength of this aversion relative to

the desire for seigniorage. s Barro recognizes, however, a
weakness in his theory is the lack of a convincing rationale for

strong aversion to unexpected inflation.
     The present paper reconsiders the maximal seigniorage
question within a more general model of the determi nation of

expected inflation and the relation between expected inflation

and actual money issue.    In this model, inflationary expectations

are not a proximate policy variable as in the Friedman framework,
but are also not independent of the choice of money issue as in

the Calvo/Barro framework.     Instead, the model assumes that

policy actions and inflationary expectations are linked through

the government's reputation.    Given this linkage, the Calvo/Barro

outcome, although time consistent, would be myopic and,
consequently, would not be the actual result of a foresighted

government's desire to maximize the present value of its

seigniorage, even if the government cannot explicitly bind itself

to fulfill commitments.    The answer to the maximal—seigniorage

question instead takes the form of a reputational equilibrium in

which policy is both time consistent and foresighted.

           In what follows, section I develops the basic analytical
framework.        Sections II and III replicate Friedman's analysis and
Calvo's analysis.        Section IV formulates the model of reputation
arid derives the reputational equilibrium.       Finally, section V
summarizes the main properties of this equilibrium and discusses

some extensions that would characterize a full positive theory of
inflation.



I.        Analytical Framework

          The maximal—seigniorage question assumes that the
government's objective for period t is to maximize


(1)          S= E exp(_rti)s+t
                i=O


where       St is the present value of current arid future seigniorage,
s. is the seigniorage obtained in period          t+i, r is the annual
rate at which the government discounts future seigniorage, and
t    is    the length of a period in units of years.   The government's
proximate control variable is current fiat money issue, and its
objective implies that it takes account of the effects of current
money issue on both current seigniorage and future seigniorage.

The analysis assumes that the fastest physically possible rate of
money issue, although finite, is very large.

          As the analysis below shows, an important potential

explanation for differences in inflation rates is that different
governments have different discount rates.        A dramatic example is
that a government fighting a major war, especially one that
                                       —6

threatened its survival, would be likely to have a relatively
high discount rate.          For simplicity, the present analysis treats
the discount rate as constant over time, although the same

results would also apply if the discount rate followed a random
walk.     In general, correctly allowing for the possibility of
changes in the discount rate over time would present a more

ambitious modelling problem than does the present comparison of
the implications of different constant discount rates.                       (For more
on this issue, see Grossman (1984)).

        Assuming that fiat money is produced at zero cost,
seigniorage in period t is the purchasing power of the

government's current fiat money issue.                   Current seigniorage is
expressable equivalently as an increasing funct ion of the current
inflation rate and current real cash balances.                   Specificiaily,




              Mt_ Mt_i   -                    M

where    Mt is the stock of fiat money is period t,                       is the price

level in period t, and             is the annual inflation rate in period
                              Pt
t, i.e.(i/T)ln(P/PlJ.              Equation (2) implies th at the analysis
can formulate the governme nt's problem either as the choice of

current money issue given a constraint on the pa th of the price

level or as the choice of the current inflation rate given a

constraint on the path of real money balances.                  The latter
formulation is aigebrai.cai ly more Convenient.                Let        denote the
annual inflation rate that corresponds to the fastest physically

possible rate of money issue.
                                    —7

        To model the constraint on real cash balances, assume that
the demand for real cash balances depends logarithmically on the

expected inflation rate, and that the price level adjusts to
equate actual real cash balances to the quantity demanded.        Thus,

      satisfies


                         EtlPt+l)
(3)        =   exptgt—


where     Etipt+i is the public's expectation of p÷ conditional
on its perception of government behavior formed in period t-l,
and g is an annual growth rate that captures the effects of all

other factors, e.g. population and income growth and developments
in financial technology, that influence the demand for real cash
balances.      The analysis treats g and the parameter h as fixed and
focuses on inflationary expectations as the link between policy,
i.e. the inflation rate, and real cash balances.        (Nichols (1974)
analyses the use of financial regulations to influence parameters
like g and h.)

        This formulation of demand reflects the observation that the

holders of real cash balances are atomistic agents who cannot
individually influence the government behavior that produces
inflation.        Consequently, the demand for real cash balances does
not incorporate any strategic elements, and the government plays
what is analogous to a game against nature.

        The assumption that the expectation relevant for current

demand is based on a perception formed last period provides a
simple way to model a lag in either the perception of actual
                                                     —8

government behavior or in the ad justment of real cash balances.
In this analyses, the length of the adjustment lag determines
t,    the       length of a single time period.                       Consideration of the
effects of different values of                        t   reveals      the significance of this
lag.

        Substituting equations (3) and (2) into equation (1) gives

                                                                                           h



For constant values of inflation and inflationary expectations, p

and     Ep, equation (4) becomes, given r>g,

       The final component needed to complete the analytical
framework is the determination of inflationary expectations.                                   The

analysis assumes that these expectations are based on the
public's perception of the strategy that the government employs
in attempting to maximize seigniorage.                              The different answers to
the maximal—seigniorage question discussed in the following
sections reflect differences in these strategies.

II.   Friedman's Analysis

      Suppose that the government could commit itself irrevocably
to a desired path of future inflation rates.                  Such a commitment
would determine inflationary expectations.                  In this case, given

the fixed noristochastic structure of the model                 the maximal—
seigniorage problem would amount to choosing                  Ep and p to
maximize S subject to the constraint that p must equal                         Ep.

The critical values for this problem, obtained by replacing p by
Ep in equation (5) and setting                dSt/dEp equal to zero, are


                              ln(l+th)
(6)      p'   =   Ep'   =     —_______

                                       — g.


      Equation          (6)    is a generalization of the Friedman elasticity
solution for the maximal seigniorage question.                  In the 1     im it   as

I goes    to zero,            p' as g iven by equation (6) approache s h—g,
which is exactly Friedma n's answer.                 Substituting     p'   for both Ep

and p in equation (5) gi yes the value of S implied by the
commi tment to the inflat ion rate             p'.

      (Auernheimer (1974) modified Friedman's analysis to deal

with a nonsteady state i n which the government need not verify
the predetermined inflat ionary expectations of the initial

period, but is committed to verify its choice of inflationary

expectations for subsequent periods.                 Auernhe imer's analysis
would also apply to a gover nment considering an initial issue of

fiat money in exc hange for real resources.                 Auernheimer derived
the answer that the chosen value of                  Ep and p for these
subsequent periods would be somewhat less than                  p'.    )
                                 — 10 —



III.     Calvo's Analysis

        In reality, governments do not, and by their nature probably
cannot, irrevocably commit themselves to specific inflation
rates, or to any other policy rules.      Indeed, the power to

abrogate commitments without having to answer to a higher
authority seems to be an essential property of sovereignty.

Consequently, the Friedman strategy of treating inflationary
expectations as a choice variable does not seem to provide a
relevant analysis of seigniorage.

        In developing an alternative to Friedman's strategy, Calvo
supposes that,    in addition to being incapable of credible

commitments, the government ignores any effect that its current

actions have on expectations of its future actions.        In this

case, given the fixed nonstochastic structure of the model, the

maximal seigniorage problem would amount to choosing       p to
maximize S, taking Ep as given.       Equation (5)   implies that the
partial derivative     aS/ap is positive for all finite values
of p.     Thus, the critical value of p for this problem is , which
is the Calvo answer to the maximal—seigniorage question.          It says
that,    if the government took inflationary expectations as given,

the desire to maximize seigniorage would lead it to inflate at
the fastest possible rate, independently of the path of
inflationary expectations.

        Assuming that the public correctly perceives how the
government behaves,     Ep in this case would also equal     p.      Thus,
substituting       for both   Ep and p in equation (5) gives the
value of     St implied by the Calvo analyses.   In the limit for an
                                   — 11



increasingly large value of         ,   this   value of   St approaches
zero.    Calvo's analysis shows that the result of taking

inflationary expectations as give.n is "suboptimal" in the sense

that any inflation rate less than         p (but greater than —g) would

yield more seigniorage, if the government could convince the
public to expect that inflation rate.           The Friedman answer p',   is

an example of such an inflation rate.



IV.     Reputattonal Equilibrium
        As discussed above, both theoretical considerations as well
as the facts of inflationary experience suggest that the Friedman

analysis and the Calvo analysis are each missing essential
elements of the correct answer to the maxtmal—seigniorage

question.     To capture these elements, suppose that, although the

government cannot directly control inflationary expectations by
committing itself to future inflation rates, its current actions
nevertheless influence expectations about its future actions.
The linkage between current actions and expectations is the

government's reputation.     Given this linkage, a foresighted
government would consider how its current actions affect its

reputation and how its reputation affects its future ability to

obtain seigniorage.     Only a government that ignored its
reputation wOuld behave as in the Calvo analysis, but such

behavior would be myopic.
        To model the determination of the government's reputation,

assume that the public presumes that the government's behavior
will always be foresighted as long as the government has never
                                         — 12



acted myopically in the past.             If, however, the government ever
acts myopically, then the public withdraws this presumption and
expects myopic behavior in the future.                      These assumptions imply
that


                                 =
(7) for t        0,   Etlpt+l        p   and

         for t > 0, either Et_lpt+l =          P

                                     i              =   p   for all j =

                      or   Et_ipt+i = p            otherwise,



where the initial issue of fiat money is in period t=—1 (making
p       the first observation of inflation) and                  p   is the inflation
rate that a foresighted seigniorage maximizing government would
choose.      Given the fixed nonstochastic structure of the model,
    *
p       is independent of t.

         The essential properties of this model of reputation are
that private agents are backward looking in determining the
expected mode of government behavior, foresighted or myopic, but
are forward looking in determining the expected inflation rate.
The potential loss of reputation for being foresighted creates

the distinction between foresighted and myopic behavior and,

also, by penalizing myopic behavior with a sharp reduction in the
demand for real cash balances, provides an incentive for
foresighted behavior.          This potential penalty emerges
automatically from the actions of individual, atomistic holders
of cash balances, who form inflationary expectations according to
                                                — 13



equation (7).                The potential penalty does not require a willful
enforcement decision by members of the public.                              This property
reflects the observation that the government plays what is
analogous to a game against nature.                            (A possible extension in
this model of reputation might include assumptions about actions

that a government could take in order to regain a lost
reputation.)

               Given this model of reputation, the problem for                      a

foresighted seigniorage—max im                 t z i ng   government is to choose p, as
part of an implicit program                                      so as to max imize
S, subject to equation (7)                      This choice establ ishes a
reputational equilibrium in which,                        if   the government val         ida te S

inflationary expectations, the present value of seignior age is at

least as large as it would be if the g overnment were to attempt

to produce a temporarily la rge flow of seigniorage by ma king the

inflation rate higher than the public expects.                              Thus,       in the

reputational equilibrium, a truly fore sighted government always
validates inflationary expec tations by setting                                  equal to
                                                                            Pt

equilibria, then                         p        equals   p'.         Alternately, if        p'   is not in this

set,       p        is the member of this set closest to                             p'. This result obtains
because             St       decreases monotonically as Ep diverges from p', given
that inflationary expectations are validated.

          Because                p       is independent of t,               the analyses can focus on period

satisfies

where S is the value of                                S0 that results from setting                p0 equal
to p       and           S0 is the value of                 S0               would result from setting
                                                                     :hat
p0 equal to                  p       .       Substituting        p     for     Ep and p in equation (5)
yields

                         h           1 — exp —T(r—g)]


          To calculate , observe that, by setting                                      p0 equals to         ,   the
government obtains in period zero an amount of seigniorage given by


      =   exp-                   j{i -           exp[-r(+g)]}.

At the same time this action causes the government to lose its good
reputation.                  Consequently, future seigniorage, beginning in period
one, corresponds to the result of Calvo's analysis.                                           Thus, S0 equals
the value of                     S0 obtained by substituting                       for both        Ep and p in
equation (5), but with the component s replaced by s0.                                               This
calculation yields

Comparison of these limiting values, recalling also that
urn         p'       =   h—g, and given that                    is larger than h—g, reveals that
t   +0                                                          *
condition (8)                   is   satisfied for          p           equal to       p'.   In other words, in
this limiting case, the inflation rate                                          p'   is the reputational
equilibrium.

            This result obtains because, with continuous adjustment of real

cash balances, the model of reputation given by equation (7) implies
that by setting                      p0 equal to            the government would cause an
immediate reduction of real cash balances to the level associated with
myopic behavior.                      Consequently, even though inflationary expectations
                                                 *
are initially                   equal to     p       ,   the unanti.cipated inflation associated
with setting                p0 equal to p would not produce any extra seigniorage
even in the short run.

            This experiment of allowing                             t       to approach zero, because it   is

equivalent to letting the demand for real cash balances in period                                           t

depend on                Etpt+l rather than on                      EtiPt+i, shows that a lag in e ither

the perception of actual government behavior or in the adjustment of
real cash balances is essential for explaining inflation rates in excess

of p'.       Remarkably, with             t   equal to zero, the comparison of          S0 and

   does not involve r.              Thus, p' would be the reputational equilib r 1. urn

in this case no matter how high is the government's discount rate.                             (In

this respect, the effect of unexpected inflation on seigntorage is
fundamentally different from its effect on the real cost of servicing
nominal debts that mature in the future.                    If the government's

objectives included minimization of such real debt servicing costs,

the reputational equilibrium for inflation would depend on the
government's discount rate, even with no lags in perception or

adjustment.)

      Consider next the implications for condition (8), with a positive

value of       t,   of allowing the maximum inflation rate,             , to         be very

large.      Although the value of               S0 does not depend on   j:;,
                                                                               the
spec i f   ication of           implies

              p0


In effect, by setting               p0 equal to        p, the government initially

obtains as seigniorage the entire value of the initial real cash
balances that the public holds on the presumption that the government

is foresighted.         Future seigniorage however, is zero.

Accordingly, in this case condition (8) becomes


1 — exp _Tp+g*          >   1
1 — exp —tIr—gj
                                      *
which is equivalent to               p +g       r—g.

          In   this case,    p       equal to p' would imply p'+g                  )   r—g,

Thus, with a positive lag in the adjustment of real cash balances,

but with a very large value of                  ,   the Friedman answer for maximal
seigniorage still is the reputat ional equilibrium if                                  p'+g   is at
least as large as           r— g.      A high value of              p'+g, which implies a high
value of h and a low value of                  r,   is important because it there ases
the amounts of future seigniorage associated with                              p'       relative to the
initial seigniorage associated with setting                             p0 equal to p.        A 1 ow
value of r—g is important because it increases the importance of this

future seigniorage relative to initial seigniorage in the present
value calculation.

          If   p'+g     r—g does not hold, p'           is not in th e set of poss ible
                                                                    *

V.      Summary and Extensions

         An expected inflation rate in the set of poten tial reputational

equilibria has the property that the present value of seigniorage is
at least as large if the government validates this expectation as it

would be if the government were to attempt to prod uce a temporarily
                                — 18



large flow of seigniorage by making the inflation rate higher than the
public expects.   A foresighted seigniorage—Inaximizing government

choses from this set the inflation rate that produces the highest
present value of seigniorage.    This inflation rate is the reputational
equilibrium.

     The above analysis derives the reputational equilibrium based on
a model of reputation in which the public presumes that government

behavior will be foresighted as long as the government has never
behaved myopically.   If, however, the government were ever to behave
myopically, the public expects myopic behavior in the future.        This

expectation would eliminate or reduce possibilities for future
seigniorage.

     Given the model of reputation, the analysis derives two
sufficient conditions under whi ch the reputattonal equilibrium is the
inflation rate that generalizes the Friedman elasticity solution to

the maximal—seigniorage problem.       One sufficient condition is that the
public perceives actual governme nt behavior contemporaneously and

adjusts real cash balances immed tately to new information.      The other
sufficient condition is that the government's discount rate does not

exceed the growth rate of money demand by more than this inflation
rate plus the growth rate.   The se conditions imply that, either if the

effect of the potential loss of reputat ion is immediate or if the
discount rate is low enough rela tive to other parameters      the

government's concern for its reputation produces results that are
isomorphic to Friedman's impi tcit presumption of irrevocable

comm itNents.
                                      — 19



        The analysis also shows that, given a lag in either perception or

adjustment, a sufficiently large discount rate causes the reputational

equilibrium for a seigniorage —maximizing government •to be an inflation

rate higher than the generali zed Friedman elasticity solution.

Specificiall y,    if the generalized Friedman elasticit y solution is not
in the set o f possible reputa tional equilibria, the reputat tonal

equilibrium is the inflation rate that, when added to the growth rate,

exactly equa is the difference between the discount rate arid          the   g   rowth
rate.     This   inflation rate is the member of the set of potential
repu tat ional   equilibria that is closest to the gene ralized Friedman

elasticity solution.

        These results imply that different rates of in flation are

associated with differences in the slope and growth of demand for real

cash balances and with differences in the rate at which future

seign iorage is discoun ted.    One obvious extension of the analysis,
along lines suggested by Friedman, would assume that, for whatever

reaso n, the government is averse to a high expected inflation rate.

This extension would rationalize the observation that actual inflation

rates typically seem to be less than the reputational equilibrium
implied by the single objective of maximizing seigniorage.

        Another worthwhile extensi on would incorporate into the analys is

reasons other than a desire for seigniorage that might tempt the

government to try to make the         i   nflation rate higher than the public
expects.     In a related analys s along these lines, Barro and Gordon
                                 1.




(1983) analyse a reputational eq uilibrium for inflation that focuses

on increasing aggregate employment and reducing the real cost of
                               — 20   —




servicing   the public debt as objectives of government policy.   Adding
these additional motivations for unexpected inflation to the above
analyses would have the same effect as a longer lag in the adjustment

of real cash balances or a larger discount rate for future seigniorge
in raising the inflation rate that is the reputatiorial equilibrium.

     A more ambitious extension of the analysis would be to model
relevant parameters like the discount rate for future seigniorage as
stochastic processes.   This development would permit explicit analysis
of variations in the inflation rate over time.
