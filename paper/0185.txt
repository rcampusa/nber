      Dynamic issues in the analysis of wages and labor supply have been

recognized for some time. Friedman (1957, 1962) developed the concepts of

permanent and transitory income and their role in consumption, including labor

supply. Lewis (1957) outlined a concept of long—run trend, seasonal and

cyclical time series variation as well as cross sectional "differ til"

in hours of work. He says:

             • . the hours of labor supplied per head are made to depend

           chiefly upon long—run or permanent real wage rate and real
           property income prospects which would be little affected by
           short—run ('transitory') variations in real wages and real
           property income."

Mincer (1962 )   set   out a reconciliation of apparetly contradictory long—run

time series and cross sectional labor supply (participation) results for

married women. The reconciliation was based on the distinction between

permanent and transitory components of (husband's) income.

      Dynamic issues in the analysis of labor supply arise in a quite different

set of models. I want to mention two which are particularly related to this

paper. Lucas and Rapping (1969) are concerned with short run and long run
                                                                         1
aggregate labor supply functions in the context of a macroeconomic model.

While their results are all based on aggregate data they provide (section 2)

an excellent discussion of the context in which this microdata study is to

be placed. While their "operational supply hypothesis" incorporates a model

of adaptive wage expectations, they outline an alternative view "in terms of

a current real wage consisting of 'permanent' and 'transitory' components."

At the disaggregated level of local labor markets, Lucas and Prescott (1974)

provide a model which introduces local business cycles and serial correlation

in wage rates at the local level. While their purpose is quite different,

emphasizing job search, mobility and equilibrium unemployment, the notions
                                       —2.-




of spatially distinct markets and autocorrelated predetermined labor demand

discussed   there are fundamentally useful in interpreting dynamic labor supply
results.
        Another   distinct class of labor supply models has grown out of the work

of Beckman (l977).2 These studies of the labor supply of women emphasize the

joint determination of participation and hours of work and incorporate permanent

and transitory components of women's participation probability functions.


        Another study which has come to my attention recently is closely related

to parts of this paper. Hauseman and Wise (1976) present3a simultaneous

equation model for wages and hours observed each of two years. As in the model

presented   here, hours are taken to be a function of predetermined wages. Their
model   differs from the one reported here in several important ways.    First

only   two years of data are used so that serial correlation in transitory
variables cannot be separated from the permanent component. The permanent and
transitory labor supply elasticities are constrained to be equal. Their model
emphasize the important problem of estimation on data truncated with respect
to an endogenous variable while the one reported here does not. One potentially
severe problem with the data from the New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment
is the quality of the variables used. •The hours and especially wage variables

are constructed from less than ideal underlying measurements.4 The results

reported later will illustrate the importance of measurement error in both

observed earnings and observed hours.

        There are some important differences between previous studies and the
                                       —3—



 one reported here. First, the availability of panel data makes possible

 the estimation of the parameters of dynamic relationships in micro data which

 may help reconcile previous divergent cross sectional and aggregate time

 series results.5 The fully dynamic nature of many models has not yet been

 adequately exploited. One aspect of this is that transitory (short run)

variation in economic variables may not elicit the same behavioral response

as   permanent (long run) variation. This possibility introduces a whole new
class of models and estimation problems. The model reported here is possibly
the simplest such model.
        A second difference is an emphasis on the components of variation in economic

variables rather than simply the regression coefficient representing the effect

of predetermined variables. The components of variation in economic variables

become more interesting in panel data because more than the component "due to

X' can be studied.

        Another feature not common to many economic studies is estimation

explicitly based on     observed variables rather than "constructed" ones   •   This
allows the problem of measurement error to be tackled directly. The importance

of measurement error in hours, when earnings rather than the wage rate is observed,

has been widely documented.7 (See for example Mincer (1976) and Ghez and

Becker (1975).)

        The   purpose of this paper is to develop and test a dynamic labor supply
model which incorporates the essential features of these previous models. The
issues of permanent and transitory effects and of cross section versus time
series can be addressed much more directly given the recent availability        of panel
data   featuring repeated observation over extended periods of time of the same
                                     —4—




individuals. The labor supply model presented below emphasizes the effect

of permanent individual wage differences on permanent annual hours of work

and the effect of serially correlated transitory individual wage variation on

short run hours of work. Permanent and transitory deviations from the

aggregate labor supply functions are also allowed. A by—product is an analysis

of the relative roles of permanent and transitory components of both wages and

hours in the distribution of earnings.

      The next section provides a description of the essential features of the

model. Section III provides a detailed outline of the empirical model and

method of obtaining maxin likelihood estimates of parameters. Section IV

provides a discussion of the results including the components of variation in

wages, hours, and   earnings.   Comparisons are made by schooling group, by

experience group, by union status, and by wife's work status. Finally the

results are summarized in Section V.

                       II. A DYNAMIC LABOR SUPPLY MODEL


         The purpose of this section is to outline briefly the dynamic labor
 supply model developed more fórmafly in the next section and to introduce
 a   few caveats.

         The essential feature of the model is a two equation system relating the

wage rate and hours worked at each point in time. Wages are presumed to be

predetermined f row the viewpoint of each individual laborer. The wage rate

 (in logs) of any particular laborer at a particular point in time is composed

of several components: a year effect representing tear—to—year wage variation

common to all individuals; an individual specific permanent (long run) wage

level; and a serially correlated transitory (short run) deviation of that

individual's wage rate from its permanent level. The individual permanent

component is itself composed of the effect of measured and of unmeasured

individual characteristics which affect wages. The unmeasured permanent com-

ponent reflects the permanent characteristics of the local labor market in which

the person resides (if he doesn't move) as well as his own personal character-

istics. The transitory wage component measures the effect of local business

cycles and local labor market transitory variation as well as the effect of time

varying individual characteristics which are not measured or incorporated •into

the analysis.8

        Annual hours of work is similarly composed of several components a year

effect representing year—to—year variation in hoUrs commcn to all individuals;

a labor supply response to permanent wage differences among persons; an indi-

vidual residual or deviation from the aggregate long run labor supply function;

an individual response     to the personal transitory wage deviation from its
permanent   level; and a   residual serially correlated transitory term representing
involuntary   transitory variation in hours (not on the aggregate transitory response
                                      —6—



function). Three concepts of the hours—wage relationship are distinguished.

The first corresponds to .ggregate tine series on wages and hours for the

population under study. In the aggregate the forces of supply and demand for

labor jointly determine wages and hours. The determinants of this aggregate

relationship are not modeled here.9 The other concepts relate to labor supply

decisions by individuals facing exogenously determined wages rates and wage rate

deviations over time, given the aggregate level of wages. It is assumed through-

out that each individual takes his wage rate as partly exogenous and partly

predetermined by decisions made earlier in life. He may however respond dif-

ferently to transitory than to permanent wage differences. All individuals are

assumed to have the same transitory labor supply elasticity and the same degree

of serial correlation in transitory variables.

      The well known labor supply (labor—leisure choice) models would presumably

predict the negative income effect to be larger for a permanent wage difference

than for a transitory one. The (positive) substitution effect is more likely to

dominate    for a transitory wage deviation than for a permanent one. A crucial
factor however is the degree of serial correlation in the transitory wage
variation over time for the same person. The greater the serial correlation
the more a transitory wage change appears to be a permanent one.

      This    formulation of the model begs several issues. First the model
implicitly assumes costless shifts in annual      hours   in response to wage changes.
Institutional   arrangements may   make   such shifts more costly° It should be kept
in mind    that other employee—firm arrangements may exist. For example, some

workers may be faced with a fixed salary (annual earnings) but variable annual

hours. Working when the need arises may be a condition of employment, at a

fixed salary. In such a case the average annual wage rate (considered empirically)

will be negatively related to annual hours of work. Many examples can
                                    —7—



 be found. At the other extreme some serviceworkers may      may face   fixed working
hours but a random average hourly wage rate. Salesmen and self—employed

barbers might be illustrations. In this case the
                                                     transitory elasticity would be
zero. These possibilities cloud the interpretation of measured labor

supply relationships.


        The model ignores taxes (and thus marginal versus average wage rates) and

non—pecuniary inducements to work In fact, the model is estimated using

observations on hours and earnings, rather than wages. The wage variation

parameters   are inferred from annual earnings and annual hours and thus refer to
average annual hourly wage rates. The whole dynamic issue      of expectations and

anticipations   is ignored. (See Lucas and Rapping (1969). The issue of life
cycle   joint planning of hours and wages (human capital investment) does not

enter explicitly.     The model ignores an important set of issues

including the decision to participate and the interrelationship among the
decisions of members of a family or household unit. This eliminates perhaps       the

most (positively) responsive segments of the potential labor force, women

and retired persons. Only prime age white males (not retired, disabled or

fulltime student) are considered.

        Given these caveats let us proceed to the formal   model.

                          fl.   THE FORMAL EMPIRICAL MODEL



     The purpose of this section is to more formally outline the dynamic labor
supply model and the resulting implicatibns of dynamic earning variation. First
the dynamic wage function is outlined. Second, the dynamic properties of annual
hours,   induced by wage variation and exogenous to wage variation, are outlined.

Third, the dynamic properties of the resulting earnings function are explored.

Finally, the model is fully combined into matrix form          and the maximum likelihood
procedure     is discussed. The empirical model analyzes the covariance structure

over time of the log of real annual earnings in 1970 dollars and the log of

annual hours of work. Measurement error in these variables is introduced into

the estimation procedure. It is assumed throughout that the random variables

0w oh 1w h and X are independently distributed. A path diagram for the

model, for four years, is presented in Figure 1. Notation for variables and

parameters are presented in Table 1.                       -




a.    Wages

       The real average (annual) hourly wage rate (W, in logs) is assumed to be

predetermined but a function of measured individual characteristics, f.           The

wage rate of individual i in year t       is   composed of a year component    common

to all individuals, an individual specific permanent wage W, and a transitory

component         i.e.,

This correlation is clearly a monotonically declining function of the time

distance between the years and asymptotically approaches

       This dynamic wage equation is precisely the form of the dynamic earnings

function assumed in Lillard and Weiss (1977) and Lillard and Willis (1977).

In those studies time varying       were included so that potentially transitory

variation is explained as well. The approach taken here is to generalize the

structure to the more fundamental wage and hours variables which determine earnings.


b. Hours

       The individual annual hours equation similarly is composed of permanent

and transitory components,


(10)
                                       —11—




Three concepts of hours—wage relationship are distinguished. The first

corresponds to aggregate time series observations on hours and wages, i.e.

       and     .   In   the aggregate the forces of supply and demand for labor

will jointly determine wages and hours. The other concepts relate to labor

supply decisions by individuals facing exogenously determined wage rates and

wage rate variations over time, given the aggregate level of wages in the

economy. It is assumed throughout that each individual takes his wage rate as

partly exogenous and partly predetermined by decisions made earlier in the life

cycle. He may however respond differently to transitory than to permanent wage

differences. We thus have an aggregate time series relationship common to all

men, an across individual permanent relationship, and an individualized

response to personal time series variation.

        The permanent hours component is the sum of a long run labor supply

function and an individual intercept term,

term captures the effect of unmeasured individual chaacteris tics affecting

long run labor supply and perhaps permanent exposure to involuntary spells of

unemployment. Since ii and H are in logs,        represents the long run labor supply

elasticity.

        The transitory hours component is itself composed of two parts; one part

is serially correlated transitory variation induced by short run wage variation

and the other is an independent source of transitory hours variation,

The independent transitory variation may be itself serially correlated,

The independent transitory variation reflects the operation of local labor

market conditions and business cycles which affect ttansitory involuntary

hours variation. Again since W and H are in logs, e is the short run

labor supply elasticity. The covariance structure of annual hours over time

for a given individual is

        Clearly permanent wage variation contributes to permanent covariation

in annual hours through long run labor supply, and serially correlated transitory

wage variation contributes to serial correlation in transitory annual hours

through the short run labor supply response. The serial correlation in annual

hours is then a mixture of two                      first    order autocorrelated series.

        Analogously to wages, the share of within year, annual hours variation

which represents permanent differences among individuals is given by

                          H H
However correlations among years for annual hours are more complex than in the

case of wages. The correlation between any two years t          and   r is

                                22 2         2 2

       The covariance structure between hours and wages over time is due solely

to the labor supply responses and crrelation among X variables

       For the purpose of estimation, measurement error in observed hours,

hit =         +           is introduced. It is assumed that measurement error is dis-
        Hit
tributed independently from year to year with zero mean and variance            .   This
source of variation then contributes only additively to the diagonal elements

of the observed covariance matrix for log hours.


c. Earnings

       In the data annual hours and annual earnings are observed rather than the

average annual wage rate. In addition, the roles of wages, hours and labor

supply in the distribution of earnings over time is an interesting issue in

its own right.

       Since W and H are in logs, the log of annual earnings is their sum,


(25)          Yit =   Hit +Wj.
                                                       —15—




Correspondingly the permanent earnings component is

                   P_ P             P



and the transitory earnings component is


 27'/          T _Ti+               it
                                     t,iT




Straightforwardly, the covariance structure of (log) earnings over time is


(28)           E =              + (l-l-e)2z        + (a2 +(1+8)2 +2(l+8)ah'z              W)

and the covariance between hours and earnings over time is



(29)                   =         + (l+6)E          +   (?      +s(l+s)d2 + (l+2S) hz h

        Again for the purpose of estimation, measurement error is introduced in

observed earnings,                      =      +               It is again assumed serially independent with
                                        2

d.     Estimqtion of Parameters

        This   model specifies              a particular set of linear structural relationships

among unobservable latent variables and observed variables as well as their

relationship to a set of predetermined variables. First the system is re—written

in matrix form and it is illustrated that the system generates the covariance

structure outlined above. In this form                           the   system clearly represents a form
of   LISREL model described in Joreskog (forthcoming). The parameters are then
amenable to estimation by the LISREL                          III maximum likelihood program of

Joreskog and Sorbom (1976) assuming i
                                                              h w h,   6   and 6 are normally distributed.

       Since the t' and wT are serially correlated it is convenient to make the

standard transformation to the ri vector. Define

                        IV. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES



     In   this section I present estimates of the parameters of the dynamic

labor supply model discussed in the previous section and discuss the implications

of those estimates. First, several hypotheses are tested with respect to

measurement error and equality of the long run and short run elasticitieS.

Second, for the model finally selected, estimates of the predicted covariance

structure are compared with the actual ones. For these parameter estimates

the various aspects of true wage, hour and earnings dynamics are explored

fully. The importance of the various sources of earnings inequality are

compared. Finally parameter estimates are compared across several subsamples

including schooling groups, experience groups, union membership status, and

wife's work status.


a. The Michigan Income Dynamics Panel

     The University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics represents a

panel of seven contiguous years, 1967—73. The survey included 5,517 households,

about 2,000 from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity and an additional

3,000 from a cross section of U.S. families. Since the SEO subsample selected

by the Survey Research Center for inclusion in the panel was not random with

respect to income, this group is excluded from consideration. A detailed

description of the data is provided in Morgan (1964). The parameters of the

model are estimated for the 1,041 persons identif fed as a white male head of

household (including single persons) be&ween the ages 18 and 58 in 1967 who were

not disabled, retired or a fulltime student during the period and who reported

positive annual hours and earnings each year. All earnings values are in real

1970 dollars. The mean years of schooling is 12.12 and the mean years of

experience (age minus years of schooling minus 5) in 1970 is 24.11.
                                       —20—




b.   Parameter Estimates
     Individual   year means of log earnings (        + rp,   log hours () and log
wages (rfl) are presented in Table 2 along with their respective antilogs.

These parameter estimates do not vary across the various submodels because

they correspond to simple ineans4 These wage and hour figures correspond

roughly to aggregate time series observationsP They are however for a restricted

subgroup of the population, prime age (18 to 58 in 1967) white males who were

not disabled, retired or fun time students, and who had positive annual hours

and annual earnings, each year of the seven year period 1967—73. Perhaps

the most positively responsive groups with respect to labor supply are omitted,

especially those who would enter the labor force to work positive hours. Perhaps

most importantly the values of    and F for a panel necessarily incorporate mean
                                          16
experience effects as well as time effects.

     Estimates   of all other parameters of the i9odel are presented
in Table 3. The full model is compared with three alternative restricted
models. The first tests the hypothesis that the long—run and short—run labor
supply   elasticities are equal, S =   8.     The hypothesis is clearly not rejected.

The long—run and short—run labor supply elasticities are not different. As

will be illustrated this result is robust over many subsamples. This is in

strong contrast to many previous studies. As will be noted later the serial

correlation in transitory wage rates is .823. It appears that the serial

correlation in transitory wage rates is high enough -to induce workers to behave

as if they were permanent changes.

        The other estimates concern the importance of measurement error in observed

hours and earnings. These sources of variation are clearly significant indi-

vidually and combined. While measurement error in earnings is significant,

controlling for it has relatively little impact on parameter estimates except

to    reduce estimated wage components and increase estimated serial correlation.
Measurement error accounts for 6.6 percent of total variation in observed log

earnings. The       components of earnings variation are:

            ;2
             2"
                        ;2
                         Y
                           +
           .296 =   .276 + .020


       Measurement error in observed annual hours is even more significant and

controlling for it has a larger impact on parameter estimates. The most

important effect on parameter estimates is to eliminate the negative bias imparted

to the short—run labor supply elasticity when only hours and earnings are

observed rather than the wage being observed directly.       This source of bias

is widely cited in the iiteratureJ7 It also reduces the estimates of

all   variance parameters and both serial correlation coefficients. Measurement
error   accoun for 17.4 percent of total variation in observed log annual

hours. The components of hours variation are:

 model (including measurement error) with    =   U   The estimated model
parameters reproduce the actual covariance patterns remarkably well. A first
order autoregressive process was assumed for both transitory wages and exogenous
 (not wage induced) transitory hours covariation over time. The resulting total

hours and earning   covariation over tine is correspondingly a weighted sum of
these   two autoregressive series plus the permanent component. The prediction

errors in each are quite small. The covariance between hours and earnings

actually observed also exhibit the declining covariance property predicted by

the labor supply model in conjunction with permanent and serially correlated

transitory wage and exogenous hours variation. It is, in fact, this covariance

structure which primarily determines the estimates of S and 0 .    It is quite
a strong result to find that the permanent level of covariation in hours and

earnings and the rate of decline in the covariation toward that permanent level

imply that S and 0 are equal.



c. Mean Effects of Schooling and Experience

     Before turning to the components of variance consider the mean effects of

schooling and experience on wages, hours and earnings. The estimated values

of the effect of schooling and experience on wages      and the effect on

exogenous hours     are present in Table 5 along with some other calculated

coefficients. The total effect of schooling and experience on annual hours

is given by h 03w and the total effect on annual earnings is       cs1 +(l+5)a"
                                      —23—




     An additional year of schooling increases wages 7.9 percent and exogenous

annual hours by 1.6 percent. The combined effect of a year of schooling on

annual hours, given the labor supply elasticity —.160, is an increase of .3

percent. An additional year of schooling increases annual earnings, through

exogenous hours, wages and induced hours, by 8.2 percent. The.082 is

precisely the coefficient of schooling in a simple earnings function including

experience and time dummies estimated by OLS on the pooled data. The experience

coefficients are also the same.      However, the precise sources are made evident
by this estimation procedure.

     Years of experience have the usual quadratic effect on wages and earnings

resulting   in a   concave experience—wage or experience—earnings profile. The

experience—exogenous     hours profile has   a much larger positive slope (is more

concave)   than the total experience hours profile including the    negative

reaction   to the increased wage rate over the life cycle.
     Schooling     and experience !texplainll 37.6 percent of permanent wage (W)

variation and 23.9 percent to total wage (W) variation. They explain 9.8 percent

of permanent exogenous hours variation and 5.9 percent of total exogenous

wage Variation. When the labor supply response is included,

they explain only 3.0 percent of permanent hours (H1') variation,

1.7 percent of total true hours (H) variation, and 1.4 percent of observed (h)

variation. Schooling and experience account for 42.0 percent of permanent

earnings (P) variation, 27.1 percent of total trueeanings (Y) variation, and

25.3 percent of observed earnings variation.


d. Wage Dynamics

    Of total wage variation within any year 63.6 percent represents permanent

differences among individuals. The components of within year wage variations are:

           2                2          2
          a     =       a        + a

                                       wT

         .280   = .178 + .102


Of the permanent component 37.6 percent is explained by schooling and experience.



                    =


         .178 =                 .067       + .111



     The serial correlation coefficient in transitory wages y is .823. The

covariance between wages in any two years t and t          is   given by


                                2 + 2         ttI
               tt                      w

                    = A78 + 102(823)It—tI



The covariance declines asymptotically but slowly to .178 as the years become

further apart. These covariances were reported in Table 3.


e. Hours Dynamics

    Total true hours variation, exogenous hours variation, and labor supply

wage induced variation are discussed in turn. Permanent hours (1)          variation
accounts for 61.4 percent of total true hours (H) variation.

 f.   Earning Dynamics and Sources of Earnings Inequality

      The variance in the log of earnings is often used    as   a measure of inequality.

 (See Mincer (1974), Chiswick (1974), Atkinson (1970).)     The decompositions
afforded by this model yield a fairly complete analysis of these sources of
earnings inequality.
      First,    measurement error accounts for 6.6 percent of observed earnings

inequality. True earnings inequality is the desired measure. Of total true

log earnings variation 64.5 percent represents permanent differences among

individuals (white malesY8 The components of earnings variation are

                     Y


           .276   = .178   + .098

Of the permanent earnings variation, 23.0 percent is due to permanent exogenous

hours differences, 70.8 percent is due to permanent wage differences and the

induced permanent hours variation and the remaining 6.2 percent Is due to

the correlation between exogenous permanent hours and permanent wages.

Of the remaining transitory variation in true earnings 27.5 percent is due to

exogenous transitory hours.

      Alternatively         total true earnings variation can be decomposed into exogenous

hours and wage (plus induced hours) variation. A substantial 24.5 percent

of earnings inequality is due to exogenous variation in hours, 60 percent of

which is permanent.

g..   Comparison of Schooling Groups

      Separate parameter estimates are obtained for                   the   three schooling groups:

(1) less than 12 years of school; (2) a high school degree, 12 years; and

(3) more than-a high school degree. Sample sizes would not permit smaller

groupings. The year means are presented in Table 6 and the components of

variance are presented in Table 7. The full set of estimates are in the Appendix.

      The permanent and transitory labor supply elasticities are not significantly

different in any of the schooling groups. The elasticities are remarkably

close across schooling groups, and are very close to the combined elasticity

 of —.160. Measurement error in both observed hours and observed earnings

 are quite significant and similar in magnitude to the combined estimate.

       Additional schooling appears to increase the wage at an increasing rate,

 6.8 percent per year for less than 12 years and 10.1 percent per year for

 greater than 12 years; but it increases permanent hours at a declining rate,

 2.3 percent per year for less than 12 years and 1.0 percent per year for

greater than twelve. The implied effect on permanent annual earnings,

   + (l+e)a', is correspondingly an increasing function of schooling, 7.8

percent per year for less than 12 years and 9.8 percent per year for greater

than 12 years (using the own groups 8 estimate). The experience effects are

all   very similar to the combined estimates.
     The components of wage variation vary systematically across schooling
groups. The s4e of the permanent unmeasured wage component, a2 , declines
substantially at the higher schooling group. This result holds true to a
lesser degree when the effect of schooling and experience are incorporated to
obtain total permanent wage variation,        While the size of the variance
                                               a .
in the random shock, a2    ,   is   U—shaped with increased schooling, the serial

correlation coefficient increases more than enough to offset the decline so

that the variation in transitory wages,              ,   actually   increases with schooling.
                                                w
There is clearly a tradeoff between the size of the permanent wage component

and the amount of autocorrelation.        Both increase the correlation among years.

They change in opposite directions across schooling groups resulting in

correlations which are quite similar. However the estimate of the. proportion

of wage variation which is permanent differs substantiall': 71.9 percent for

less than 12 years, 55.2 percent for 12 years, and 42.6 percent for greater

than 12 years.

      Exogenous hours is characterized by a U—shaped pattern for both

     and        and by a declining pattern for both 02h and a2    .   The
 6         II

U—shaped pattern for the permanent component is not surprising since high

school graduates should be a more homogenous group than the other two.

However, it appears that increased schooling results in a decline in transitory

variation in hours which is only slightly offset by an increase in auto...

correlation.

     Earnings variation is characterized by a U—shaped pattern of permanent

variation and a larger transitory component in the higher schooling group.

Of total true earnings variation the permanent component represents 62.1 percent

for less than 12 years of schooling, 53.2 percent for 12 years and 45.4 percent

for greater than 12 years.


h. Comparison of Experience (in 1970) Groups

     Parameter estimates are obtained for experience groups of ten year intervals

up to 30 years and for those men with more than 30 years of experience. The

year means are presented in Table S and the components of variance are presented

in Table 9. The full set of parameter estimates are presented in the Appendix.

     The growth of the means with time reflects the average effect of experience

within the intervals as well as time effects. The mean growth rate (trend) in

the wage declines monotonically from 7.3 percent for the young experience group to

2.0 percent for the experience group with more than 30 years of experience.

The aggregate trend in annual hours is characterized as expected by a slight rise

in hours worked for young workers, a fairly flat hours profile during the

middle years and a substantial decline of 1.3 percent per year on average for

those with more than thirty years experience. Correspondingly the aggregate

earnings trend declines monotonically even mote substantially than wages

from 7.8 percent for the youngest group to .7 percent for the oldest.

     While the trend Ft reflects the combined effect of a time trend and

experience as each person in the group grows older, the effect of (linear)

experience on the mean wage, W, within the group is characterized by a similar

pattern9 Additional experience increases the mean wage of individuals within

the same experience group by 5.8 percent per year for the younger, and by

approximately 1.6 percent per year within the two middle groups. It reduces

the mean wage by 1.5 percent per year for the oldest group. Exogenous hours

profiles increase at 3.2 percent per year for the youngest group, and remain

essentially flat over the remainder of the working life with a modest decline

within the oldest experience group. Correspondingly, annual earnings profiles

rise at 8.2 percent per year for the youngest group: 3.2 percent exogenous

experience—hours growth, 5.8 percent direct wage growth, and a .8 percent

hours reduction induced by the increased wage. Annual earnings rise at 1.4

percent per year through the middle yeats and eventually decline at 1.7 percent

per year for the oldest experience group. These experience patterns are

consistent with the pattens observed in the combined estimates.

    The schooling coefficient declines monotonically by almost 40 percent from

the youngest to the oldest experience group. This could be the result of a lessening

of the importance of schooling over the life cycle or of those persons with more

experience also being of older vintage combined with an increase in the importance

of schooling for more recent vintages. Results reported in Lillard (1977) suggest

that earnings—experience profiles diverge for the same cohort.

     The permanent and transitory labor supply elasticities are of similar

magnitudes across the groups. Again the two elasticities are not significantly

different from each other.

     The variance   of the permanent component in wages (both measured and un-
measured) increases   substantially and monotonically from low to high experience

levels. The variance for the youngest group is less than half of that for

the oldest two groups. The size of the transitory wage component declines

considerably in spite of a large rise in the serial correlation coefficient

from .549 to .852 from the youngest to oldest group. The resulting share of

wage variation which represents permanent wage differences increases from

56.0 percent for the youngest to 70.7 percent for the oldest. The permanent

and    transitory exogenous hours components are roughly constant across experience
groups. The resulting true annual earnings permanent variance component increases
ncnotonically,   and almost doubles, from the youngest to oldest experience

group. The transitory true earnings component is roughly constant across

experience groups (except for the 21—30 group due to both -a low transitbry

wage component and a low transitory exogenous hours component). The share of

the permanent earnings component goes from 49 .4 percent     for the young group
to    62.6 percent for the oldest.


i. Comparison of Union Groups

       Parameter estimates are obtained for three groups identified by their

degree of attachment to a labor union during the seven year period. The

first group never reported being a member   of   a labor union during the period.

The   second group reported being a member between 1 and 5 times and the third
group reported membership all six years that the question was asked        (the question

was   not asked in 1972). It should be kept in mind that union membership      is

certainly   a choice variable and subdividing    the sample by it may   introduce
some selectivity issues not discussed° The year means       are presented in Table 10
and the components of variance are presented in Table 11. A full set of
parameter estimates are in the Appendix.

       The wage differential between union (all) and non—union (none) workers

is about 14 percent and constant over the period. The aggregate trend in

 growth rates over the period 1967—73 were very similar across the groups.

 While those never in a union had slightly
                                              greater earnings growth it was due
 to greater hours reduction rather than to a differential wage growth.

      The effect of schooling on wages is three times larger for those never

 in a union than for those always in a union. For those in a union sometimes

 the effect of schooling is in between. Schooling has roughly the same effect

 for each group on exogenous hours. The mean schooling level is 12.8 years for

 those never in a union and 10.7 years for those always in a union.

     Wage growth with experience is substantially greater for those never in

a union, especially at younger ages. However union members increase their

exogenous annual hours of work at twice the rate (1.4 percent per year versus

.6 percent per year) of non—union workers. Mean experience is 23.6 years for

those never in a union and 27.0 years for those always in a union.

     There is considerably less wage variation among union members than among

those never union members. Total wage variation is .382 for non—union workers

and .080 for union members (nearly 80 percent smaller). The variance in

permanent wages for union members is only 16.3 percent as large as for non—union

workers. Among non—union workers schooling and experience account for 46.9 percent

of permanent wage variation and 31.7 percent of total wage variation. Among

union members schooling and experience account for 19.0 percent of permanent

wage variation and 10.0 percent of total wage variation. Transitory variation

among union members in wages is only 30.6 percent as large as the corresponding

variation for non—union workers. The serial correlation coefficient is the

same for both.

    The   exogenous   and total hours components are very similar across
                                    —33—




groups.    Those workers in a union sometimes have slightly lower permanent hours

and larger transitory hours components than the other two.

      There is, as a result of the large difference in wage variation, a large

difference in earnings variation among the groups. Total true earnings variance

for union members is only 29.7 percent as large as among non—union workers.

Permanent earnings variance is only 20.8 percent as large. Transitory earnings

variation is 45.4 percent as large. Among union members   permanent   earnings

differences account for 45.0 percent, while the share is 64.1 percent for non-

union workers.


j.   Comparison By Wife's Work Status
     The   married men in the sample are grouped by the work status of their
wives. One grOup had wives who did not work at all (None) during the 7    year

period 1967—73. Another group had wives who worked (positive annual hours

and annual earnings) each (All) of the 7 years. The third group had wives who

worked some (1—6 years) of the years but not all. The year means are presented

in Table 12 and the components of variance are presented in Table 13. A full

set of parameter estimates are in the Appendix.

     The aggregate wage differential between those men whose wives work all of

the time and those men whose wives don't work at all varies between 12 and

25 percent. Those whose wives don't work earn more. The earnings growth

over the period is the same for both groups. The earnings growth for the men

whose wives don't work comes from a greater wage rate increase accompanied

by a reduction in hours relative to men whose wives work all of the time.

     The effect of schooling and experience are not very different across the

groups. Schooling and experience each have a slightly greater effect on wages

for those whose wives don't work.

      The greatest difference between men by wife's work status is in the

components of wage variation. The permanent wage component for men whose

wives work all of the years is only 60 percent of that component for men

whose wives don't work at all. The transitory wage component is 66.7 percent

as large. Both permanent and transitory exogenous hours components are also

much smaller. The resulting       permanent earnings component and   transitory

earnings    component for men whose wives work all years are 63.0 percent and 76.7
percent respectively as large as the corresponding components for men whose

wives don't work at all.

      Another interesting result is obtained for those men whose wives work some

but not all of the years. Those men have a smaller permanent and larger

transitory    wage component (and earnings component) than either extreme group.
Serial correlation in the transitory component is slightly weaker       as well.

      Perhaps   the most   interesting result is that the transitory labor supply

elasticity    is significantly more positive, but still negative, than the
permanent   elasticity. The permanent labor supply elasticities are not different

from the overall value. All of these results taken together indicate a need

for further research on directly estimating the degree of complimentarity and

substitution among the labor supply of family members (husbands       and wives).
Potentially   the long run and short run cross elasticities are different.

See Kniesner (1976) for an informative theoretical analysis of cross substitution
effects and indirect empirical tests from cross section data (but with no
permanent and transitory distinction).

                               V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

        In this   paper,   I   present   a method for estimating permanent and

transitory response functions in panel data. The basic concept

developed here is an analysis of the structural relationships among

time varying economic variables, each of which has been decomposed

into permanent and serially correlated transitory components. The

permanent and transitory components can then be allowed to be related

by different structural parameters. The more serial correlation in a

transitory component, the more it will behave as a permanent one.

        The method is applied empirically to estimate the parameters of

a dynamic labor supply model. Wages are presumed to be predetermined

from the viewpoint of each individual laborer. The wage rate (in logs)

of any particular laborer at a particular point in time is composed of

several components: a year effect representing year—to—year wage

variation tommon to all individuals; an.individual specific permanent

(long run) wage level; and a serially correlated transitory (short run)

deviation of that individual's wage rate from its permanent level. The

individual   permanent component is         itself composed of the effect of

measured   and of unmeasured individual characteristics which affect wages.
Annual hours of work is similarly composed of several components: a
year    effect representing year—to—year variation in hours coon to all

individuals; a labor supply response to permanent wage differences among

persons;   an indivdual residual         or deviation from the aggregate long run

labor   supply function; an individual response to the personal transitory
wage deviation from its         permanent level; and a residual serially correlated
transitory term representing involuntary transitory variation in hours
                                     —36--




(not on the aggregate transitory response function). All individuals

are assumed to have the same transitory labor supply elasticity and the

same degree of serial correlation in transitory variables.

       The dynamic labor supply including errors of measurement can be

straight—forwardly   written as a LISREL model. Assuming normality for
the   relevant variables, maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

are obtained. Parameters are estimated for while males who are not

disabled, retired or full time students during the panel period 1967—73.

The   model is estimated using annual hours of work and annual earnings
in real 1970 dollars (equals, hours plus wages in logs) since wages are
not observed directly.
       First the significance of measurement   error is tested. It is quite

significant for both hours and earnings. Measurement error accounts for

6.6 percent of observed variation in annual earnings and 17.4 percent of

observed variation in annual hours of work. Controlling for measurement

error in hours eliminates the usual negative bias in the labor supply

elasticity widely cited in the literature when hours and earnings rather

than hours and wages are observed. The permanent and transitory labor

supply elasticities (response parameters) are found to be negative and

not significantly different from each other (—.160 when constrained to

be equal), while each is significantly different from zero. This equality

result holds in various subgroups as well, e.g. 'schooling groups,

experience groups and union status groups. The exception is husbands of

wives who work all 7 years. In the latter case the short—run elasticity

is more positive than the long—run elasticity but remains negative. It
                                   —37—




appears that serial correlation in transitory wages is high enough (.823)

to induce workers to behave as if they are permanent.

      The estimated regression coefficients of schooling and experience

on permanent wages and on exogenous permanent hours allows a decomposition

of the effect of these variables on anhual hours and annual earnings. The

effect of an additional year of schooling on annual hours in .3 percent

per year and on annual earnings is 8.2 percent per year. The effect on

the average hourly wage rate is 7.9 percent. Experience has a large

effect on the wage rate of 4.2 percent per year and on annual earningsof 4.1

percent per year, but has little effect on annual hours except for those

with little experience (positive) and for older workers (small negative).

      Of total wage variation within any year 63.6 percent represents

permanent   differences among individuals. Of the permanent component
37.6 percent is explained by schooling and experience.     The serial
correlation   coefficient in transitory wages is .823.

      Permanent hours variation accounts for 61.4 percent of total true

hours (net of measured error) variation. Of the permanent variation

3 percent is due to schooling and experience. Of the transitory variation

90 percent is due to exogenous hours variation (not induced by transitory

wages).

      Of total true (net of measurement error) log earnings

earnings variation 64.5 percent represents permanent differences among

individuals. Of the permanent earning component 42 percent is attributed

to   schooling and experience. Of the permanent earnings   variation 23.0
                                    —38—




percent is due to permanent exogenous hours differences, 70.8 percent is
due to permanent wage differences and the induced permanent hours variation
and the remaining 6.2 percent is due to the correlation between exogenous

permanent hours and permanent wages. Of the remaining transitory variation in

true earnings 27.5 percent is due to exogenous transitory hours.
                                                                       Alternatively
total true earnings variation can be decomposed into exogenous hours and wage

(plus induced hQurs) variation. A substantial 24.5 percent of earnings inequality

is due to exogenous variation in hours, 60 percent of which is permanent.

     The permanent and btnsitory   labor   supply elasticities are not significantly

different   by schooling group. The elasticities are remarkably close ac-ross
schooling   groups, and are very close- to the combined elasticity. The components

of wage variation vary systematically across schooling groups. The estimate

of the proportion of wage variation which is permanent differs substantially:

71.9 percent for less than 12 years, 55.2 percent for 12 years, and 42.6 percent

for greater than 12 years.

     The wage, hours and earnings patterns with respect to experience within

and across experience groups are consistent with the -estimates for the combined

group, but with more detail, for wage, hours and earnings. The schooling

coefficient declines monotonically by almost 40 percent from the youngest to

the oldest experience group. The variance of the permanent component in wages

and in earnings Q,oth measured and unmeasured) increases substantially and

monotonically from tow to high experience levels. The variance for the youngest

group is less than half of that for the oldest two     groups.   The size of the

transitory wage component declines considerably in spite of a large rise in the

serial correlation coefficient from .549 to .852 from the youngest to oldest
                                      —39—




group.     The resulting share of wage variation which represents permanent wage

difterences increases from 56.0 percent for the youngest to 70.7 percent for

the oldest. The transitory true earnings component is roughly constant across

experience    groups (except for the 21—30 group due to both a low transitory
wage component and a low transitory exogenous hours component). The share of
the permanent earnings component goes from 49.4 percent for the young group
to 62.6 percent for the oldest.
        The wage differential between union (all) and non—union (none) workers

is   about 14 percent and constant over the period. The aggregate trend in growth
rates over the period 1967—73 were very similar across the groups.     While those

never    in a union had slightly greater earnings growth it was due to greater
hours    reduction rather than to a differential wage growth. The effect of

schooling on wages is three times larger for those never in a union than for

those always in a union. Wage growth with experience is substantially greater

for those never in a union, especially at younger ages. However union members

increase their exogenous annual hours of work at twice the rate (1.4 percent

per year versus .6 percent per year) of non—union workers. Mean experience is

23.6 years for those never in a union and 27.0 years for those always in a union.

There is considerably less wage variation among union members than among those

never union members. Total wage variation is .382 for non—union workers and

.080 for union members (nearly 80 percent smaller). The variance in permanent

wages for union members is only 16.3 percent as large as •for non—union workers.

Anong non—union workers schooling and experience account for 46.9 percent

of permanent wage variation and 13.7 percent of total wage variation. Among

union members schooling and experience account for 19.0 percent of permanent

wage variation and 10.0 percent of total wage variation. Transitory variation
                                  —40—




among union members in wages is only 30.6 percent as large as the corresponding

variation for non—union workers. The serial correlation coefficient is the

same for both.

     There is, as a result of the large difference in wage variation, a large

difference in earnings variation among the groups. Total true earnings

variance for union members is only 29.7 percent as large as among non—union

workers, permanent earnings variance is only 20.8 percent as large. Transitory

earnings variation is 45.4 percent as large. Among union members permanent

earnings differences account for 45.0 percent, while the share is 64.1 percent

for non—union workers.

     The greatest difference between men by wife's work status is in the

components of wage variation. The permanent wage component for men whose

wives work all of the years is only 60 percent of that component for men

whose wives don't work at all. The transitory wage component is 66.7 percent

as large. Both permanent and transitory exogenous hours components are also

much smaller.    The resulting permanent earnings component and transitory

earnings component for men whose wives work all years are 63.0 percent and

76.7 percent respectively as large as the corresponding components for men

whose wives don't work at all.

     Another interesting result is obtained for those men whose wives work

some but not all of the years. Those men have a smaller permanent and larger

transitory wage component (and earnings component) than either extreme group.

Serial correlation in the transitory component is slightly weaker as well.

     Perhaps the most interesting result is that the transitory labor supply

elasticity is signigicantly more positive, but still negative, than the

permanent elasticity. The permanent labor supply elasticities are not different

from the overall value. All of these results taken together indicate a need
                                 —41—




for further research on directly estimating the degree of complimentarity
and substitution among the labor supply of family members (husbands and wives).

1. Lucas and Rapping (1969) also provide an excellent list of previous

     studies   in their   footnote (1).

2. This paper provides a nice summary of Hecknan's earlier work and citations

     to related work. See also Heckman and Willis (1977).

3. There are two sequentially related papers. This work is to my know-

     ledge the most closely related the study reported in this paper.

4. For example: "Wage in Period 1: Average of earnings divided by hours

     during the weeks prior to the second through fifth quarterly interviews.

     Only those weeks for which positive earnings were reported were used in

     the average."

5. Such a reconciliation is not my purpose in this paper. This study is meant

     to be suggestive of the potential for estimating even better dynamic models

     on panel data.

6.   For an exception see Lillard and Willis (1977) where the implications of

     permanent and serially correlated transitory earnings components for the

     analysis of dynamic aspects of earnings (poverty—not poverty) mobility are

     explicitly derived.

7. A later footnote will explore this issue more fully in the context of the

     usual remedies employed in cross section data.

8. Time varying variables could be introduced into the analysis but are not in

     this study. The dimension of the tILE      estimation   problem increases by T

     (number of years) for each time varying variable introduced. It increases

     by (T + 1) if the variable is allowed to have different permanent and

     transitory effects.
 9.   I do not attempt to model the aggregate relationship between            and Pt, but

      a recursive relationship analogous to the ones assumed in the other cases

      is explored empirically. That is,




      based on year means.

10. The effect of fixed costs of entry, but not changing hours, are discussed

      by Cogan (1977) and Hanock (1976). Rees (1973) discusses why employers

      might be interested in fixed or inflexible working hours.

11. Some of these issues are addressed in Hurd (1976) and in Boskin (1977) as

      well as the survey by Keeley (1977). For a family model see Kniesner (1976).

12. The larger transitory variance may be thought of as occurring in the first

      year of labor force experience. This assumption makes the process stationary

      and replaces the usual infinite history assumed in time series analysis.

13. The appearance of the elements li_2 and li_a2 and                      introduces two

      nonlinear constraints. The problem is circumvented in the results reported

      here   by allowing the two nonlinear elements to be estimated as free para-
      meters. Chi—sq degrees of freedom correspondingly reflect the extra
      parameters.   Alternative estimates obtained by iteratively constraining the

      elements /l—y     and li—s ,   where   i   and a were the estimated values from the

      last   iteration produced very similar estimates.
14. These parameters could be estimated along with the other parameters by maxi-
     mum likelihood. However, this would require introducing a prohibitive

      T(T—j) extra variables into the model and would not contribute much. Alternative

      estimates were obtained by constraining all year effects            and 4) to be

      zero. However the results are not discussed here. See Appendix for the estimates.

15.     and      are generated by aggregate labor supply and demand forces, but it
     may be instructive to estimate the aggregate labor supply elasticity

     implied if wages are assumed to be determined exogenously. The simple

     regression estimate of the parameter d in the relation                =
                                                                               dF + e
     equation (11), for the data in Table 2 is d = —.154.           While this estimate

     is very close to the estimates of          and S reported later, the resemblance

    does not hold in    within   subgroups.

16. See Weiss and Lillard (1977) and i(levmarkin and Quigley (1976) for a further

    caveat concerning the interpretations of measured time and experience effects

    when vintage effects are present.

17. It is informative to consider simple characterizations of the solutions to

    to the problem, of measurement error in hours when houré and earnings are

    observed, in cross section data suggested by Mincer (1976) and Ghez and

    Becker (1975).

         One approach suggested by Mincer is to regress current log hours

    (at t) on lagged values of log earnings minus log hours (both at time t —             s).
    When wages are truly fixed (W = W, V) and hours are fixed except for

    measurement error (h = H       +           not serially correlated), earnings are

    fixed except for measurement error            = W + H +.c,        also not serially

    correlated). The utdel is H = SW.          Under these assumptions theOLS

    regression coefficient, b, of              — h)    on ht has expected value given

    by
     •
               E(b) = S(1    + (a2 + y2)/) . The         expectation is only biased

    toward zero due to measurement error. For the model assumed in the last

    section   the expectation becomes (assuming B E 0)

               E(b) =   S
                            (u1WTkW)                    (except   s = 0)

                            (l+(cr +cy2)/q2)
     The existence of transitory wage component, serially correlated or not,

     introduces a source of negative bias.

          An approach used by Ghez and Becker was to use           the   OLS regression

     coefficient, a, of y on kin. Under the simple assumptions of the last

     paragraph


                 E(a) =
                          ihI(1+     (l±$)c

     Under the assumption of the model in the last section (assuming                E   6)

                              + (U
                                       +
                 E(a) = _________________________
                        1 + c + y2 + a2)/((1+8)2c2)
                                H


          Another approach     taken by     Borjas (1976) is to use   independent   current
     estimates   of the wage rate. This includes using "usual wage" to predict
     hours and using (earnings/hours) to predict hours last week.             His results

     lead to a positive labor supply response but are the very short run as

    hours last week.

18. The corresponding estimate of               based directly on the earnings data alone
                                           Py
    in Lillard and   Willis   (1977) was 71.1 percent. There are a few differences

    in approach worth noting. The previous estimate (1) made no attempt to

    control for measurement error in earnings, (2) was based on an analysis of

    OLS residuals (from the same earnings function implied by

    including only time dummies, schooling and experience plus race) rather than

    joint estimation by M.L., and (3) was not based on a separate analysis of

    whites, as the current results are, but instead included a dummy             intercept
    shift variable for non white observations.

    time effects when vintage (cohort) effects are important, see Weiss and

    Lillard (1977).
