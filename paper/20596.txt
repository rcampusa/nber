A Tale of Repetition: Lessons from Florida Restaurant Inspections

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the role of repetition in government regulation using Florida restaurant
inspection data from 2003 to 2010. In the raw data, inspectors new to inspected restaurants tend
to report 27%more violations than repeat inspectors. After ruling out regulatory capture and
endogenous inspector rotation as potential explanations, we find that the new-repeat gap is best
explained by the following two effects: first, restaurants target compliance in response to
heterogenous stringency and tastes of different inspectors; second, inspectors pay greater
attention in their first visit than in subsequent visits. After controlling for heterogenous inspector
criteria, we find that a new inspector reports 13-18% more violations than the second visit of the
previous inspector, likely due to a higher level of attention. Counterfactual simulations highlight
the importance of inspector training and rotation in regulatory outcomes.

1    Introduction

From nuclear power to food safety, government employees inspect economic entities on a
regular basis. Such an inspection introduces a classical double-moral-hazard problem: on
the one hand, government-employed inspectors may not detect or report every violation as
the principal desires; on the other hand, regulated firms may not comply with every rule
set by the principal. Theorists have made many suggestions to alleviate the moral hazard
problem, including outcome-based contracts,1 targeted auditing, reduction of information
rents, high penalties for corrupt inspectors, or intentional selection of biased employees,2
but they are often difficult to implement due to such constraints as rigid compensation
schemes and limited resources.
    This paper focuses on inspector repetition/rotation, a feature that exists in almost all
inspection programs but is rarely studied in the literature. In the program we study, the
Florida Division of Hotels and Restaurants (DHR hereafter) conducts regular unannounced
inspections at restaurants. In our sample, an individual inspector is new to a particular
inspected restaurant on average 27% of the time. Comparing new and repeat inspectors,
we find a stark difference in inspection outcomes. Figure 1A shows the average number
of reported violations in a typical new-repeat history of a restaurant, based on the DHR
inspection records from July 2003 to March 2010. It starts with the first new inspector for
a restaurant, followed by up to four repeated visits of the same inspector and then the next
round for the next new inspector. The new-repeat gap is striking3 : a new inspector tends to
report more violations than her predecessor, but the number of reported violations declines
sharply when she returns. Not only does the cycling pattern hold for different types of
violations, it also persists after we control for restaurant age, year-month fixed effects and
restaurant fixed effects (Figure 1B).
    What drives the cycling pattern? We propose two explanations. The first one is based
on heterogeneous inspector criteria. Inspectors differ in their stringency and tastes. Since
compliance is not costless to restaurants, they should determine the effort of compliance
   1
     For example, the principal may set inspectors’ compensation conditional on the reported violations
or design a dynamic contract to prevent collusion between inspectors and the regulated (Tirole, 1986;
Martimort, 1999).

particular.

given the expectation about inspector type. Suppose that a restaurant believes that the
same inspector returns for the next inspection. Then it is optimal for the restaurant
to comply more in the areas where the previous inspector focused on. Such targeted
compliance may be reinforced after the inspector returns multiple times, because repeat
interactions reveal the inspector’s preferences. As the restaurant caters to the inspector’s
idiosyncratic preference, it deviates from the average of other inspectors’ preferences. This
may explain why the new inspector finds more violations, especially if the previous inspector
has had a longer relationship with the restaurant.
   The second explanation is based on diminishing inspector attention. When a new
inspector inspects a restaurant for the first time, she is not familiar with the restaurant and
does not know as to what areas are vulnerable to violations in the restaurant. Therefore,
it is optimal for her to check out every corner with a high level of attention. However,
returning to the restaurant, with the knowledge she acquired before, she may find it more
efficient to devote efforts to the areas in which she found problems in the last inspection.
Anticipating the inspector to reduce her attention gradually, the restaurant would focus
more on previously detected violations, which leads to fewer violations reported by a repeat
inspector.
   Both explanations reflect strategic detection and compliance, but the key difference
lies in inspector heterogeneity. In the first explanation, inspectors differ in taste and
stringency. This inherent but idiosyncratic preference applies to all restaurants inspected
by the same individual inspector. In contrast, diminishing inspector attention emphasizes
within-inspector rather than across-inspector variations. It depends on how an inspector
varies her detection effort over time, even if every inspector has exactly the same inherent
preference and faces the same detection cost. As detailed below, we attempt to separate
these two effects empirically by using inspector-violation type fixed effects and by allowing
inspection outcomes to depend directly on the previous inspector’s inherent preference.
   Separating the two explanations sheds light on the design of the inspection program. In
particular, if the new-repeat phenomenon is driven by heterogeneity of inspector criteria,
the DHR may want to train all inspectors to ensure homogeneity. However, if diminish-
ing inspector attention is the dominant reason, training only ensures that every inspector
behaves the same way as a new inspector, but it does not address progressive shirking
after the first inspection. Another policy lever is inspector rotation, which addresses both


                                              3
effects, but its effectiveness depends on the relative importance of the two. Thus, us-
ing our empirical estimates, we quantitatively simulate the effect of random inspector
assignment (which increases the probability of new inspection) versus the effect of making
inspector homogenous (which does not change the frequency of new inspection but reduces
inspector heterogeneity). Counterfactual simulations reinforce the conclusion that both
inspector-targeted compliance and diminishing inspector attention contribute significantly
to inspection outcomes.
   There might be other possible explanations for the new-repeat gap. Among those,
probably the most popular explanation is regulatory capture: maybe new inspectors are
more likely to follow the books in the first visit but get captured afterwards. However, the
DHR has already built in a number of institutional safeguards against inspector capture.
The probability of a fine is extremely low for a regular inspection (1.6%), the fine amount
(on average, $861 if fined) is determined by a separate branch not the inspector, and the
restaurant can contest and appeal any inspection outcome through a formal process. These
institutions suggest that the expected economic return of capture (to restaurants) is low.
Even if the inspectee is determined to bribe the inspector, he should have incentives to
do so in the first visit, not until the inspector returns. Another potential explanation is
endogenous assignment of new inspectors: if the DHR is more likely to assign new inspectors
to dirty restaurants, Figure 1 could simply reflect endogenous inspector selection. We rule
out this explanation, as the same pattern remains after we use propensity score matching
and instrumental variables to address endogenous inspector rotation.
   Our work contributes to several strands of the economics literature. First, our empirical
analysis complements a large body of literature on principal-agent theory. Second, we aim
to extend the literature on inspector heterogeneity, in which there are only a few stud-
ies until now. For example, Feinstein (1989) estimated inspector fixed effects in nuclear
plant inspections and found significant inspector heterogeneity, especially the presence of
underperformers. In another paper, Feinstein (1991) also found substantial heterogeneity
among IRS tax examiners in terms of detection rates. Macher et al. (2011) examined
FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing and found considerable heterogeneity
among regulators. On top of this literature, we demonstrate the new-repeat difference and
clarify the role that inspector heterogeneity plays in this difference. As for the new-repeat
difference itself, the closest study is Short, Toffel and Hogill (2016). They examined global


                                             4
supply chain audits for code-of-conduct compliance with labor standards, and found that
audits report more violations when auditors have not audited the establishment previously.
We extend their study by quantifying heterogenous inspector criteria and diminishing at-
tention as two separate explanations for the new-repeat difference. This distinction allows
us to shed light on alternative inspection designs.4
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data
and demonstrate the new-repeat difference in inspection outcomes. Section 3 examines
endogenous inspector assignment as a potential explanation. In Section 4, we first explain
how heterogenous inspector criteria and diminishing inspector attention can lead to a gap
between new and repeat inspectors, and then quantify the two effects empirically. We also
present the results from counterfactual simulations. A brief conclusion is offered in Section
5.


2         Data Description and the New-Repeat Difference

2.1        Data Description

Our sample is constructed from three administrative data sets collected by the DHR:
(1) restaurant/food service inspection files, (2) restaurant license files, and (3) restaurant
disciplinary activity reports. The data include all restaurant inspections in Florida from
July 2003 to March 2010. All food establishments are required to be inspected twice per
fiscal year by state laws and three times by administrative rules. However, due to labor
shortage, the average number of regular inspections per restaurant per year is less than 2
except for the 2008-2009 fiscal year. In fact, about 20-40% of restaurants received only one
regular inspection a year.
         The final sample is constructed in several steps. Starting with 600,492 regular inspec-
tions in the raw data, we exclude the first six months of each restaurant since its first
appearance in our data because we use these months to define the restaurant’s history.
If the first six months do not cover the restaurant’s first regular inspection in our data,
we exclude the restaurant’s history up to its first regular inspection. We also exclude any
inspections conducted before March 2004 because Florida reclassified some non-critical vi-
     4
    Our paper is different from Short et al. (2016) in many other regards. For example, we examine
government inspections while they examine private-sector inspections. Also the inspections in our paper
are conducted by individual inspectors, while those in their paper are done by audit teams.



                                                  5
olations as risk-factors at the time. As we apply restaurant fixed effects in all estimations,
we also exclude the 11,819 restaurants that have only one inspection throughout the sample
period.
       The final sample includes 426,831 regular inspections, covering 60,976 unique restau-
rants and 358 individual inspectors.5 Each year there are around 220 active inspectors.
Each inspector conducts, on average, more than 200 inspections per year although this
number varies greatly across inspectors. There are 55 violation items, among which 18 are
critical violations, 26 are non-critical, and 11 are risk factors.6 Throughout the paper, we
refer to critical, non-critical and risk-factor as three violation categories. As shown in Table
1, the average number of violations per inspection is 7.9, of which 1.62 are critical, 2.54 are
risk factors, and 3.75 are non-critical. About 96% of regular inspections are routine ones,
while 3.7% are initiated by complaints and 0.1% are licensing inspections.7
       To get a sense of inspector heterogeneity, we simply regress the total number of viola-
tions per inspection on a full set of individual inspector dummies, controlling for fiscal year,
month, and restaurant fixed effects. Such a regression yields an adjusted R-square of 0.51,
which is higher than that without inspector fixed effects (0.46). As shown in Appendix
Figure 1, the estimated fixed effects range from -6 to 16, except few outliers. This is huge
given the fact that the average number of violations is 7.9 with a standard deviation of 7.2.
The large heterogeneity is consistent with those documented for nuclear inspectors, tax
auditors, and pharmaceutical plant inspectors (Feinstein 1989, 1991; Macher et al. 2011).
       Inspectors may have different criteria on different items. To shed light on this, we
repeat the regression exercise with inspector-item fixed effects. Within each inspector, we
code the item with the largest inspector-item fixed effect as the inspector’s most frequently
cited item (MFCI).8 Appendix Figure 2 plots the histogram of MFCI across all 55 items.
The distribution is dispersed, with relatively high frequencies in certain categories (notably,
2, 8, 14, 22, 32, 37 and 45), which proves substantial heterogeneity in inspectors’ tastes
while there are some focal items that most inspectors pay attention to.
       Using the original DHR dataset, we define inspector i as “new” to restaurant r if the
   5
     The original inspection files include 386 inspectors and 97,990 restaurants.
   6
     See Appendix Table A1 for the details of the 55 items.
   7
     The results for the sample of only routine inspections are similar to those we will present below. The
results can be obtained from the authors upon request.
   8
     Before determining which category is an inspector’s favorite, we test the statistical significance of each
inspector-category fixed effect and exclude all that are insignificant from zero by 95% confidence.




                                                      6
observed inspection is the first inspection conducted by i at r during the whole sample
period. As shown in Table 1, about 27% of regular inspections are conducted by new
inspectors, and the average number of inspections by repeat inspectors is 3.7. That is, on
average, a restaurant is inspected 3 to 4 times by the same inspector until she is replaced
by a new inspector. Since a majority of inspections are conducted by repeat inspectors,
restaurants should on average expect a repeat inspector rather than a new inspector.
   The DHR dataset provides a rich set of variables which may be correlated with restau-
rant or inspector efforts. We will use these variables as control variables in our regression
analysis below. With no access to inspector personnel data, we proxy inspector experience
by the number of regular inspections that an inspector has conducted in our data before
a specific inspection. As shown in Table 1, the average inspector experience is 1,535. In
addition, 44% of inspections are conducted by inspectors with less than the median level
of experience (inexperienced inspectors), and 1% are conducted by inspectors with the
experience of less than 30 inspections (novice inspectors). Another interesting variable is
the number of inspections that the inspector has done in a day. An inspector may become
tired during the day and incur higher effort costs due to fatigue. On average, an inspector
has completed 1.6 inspections before coming to the inspection under study and 28% of
inspections are the first one in the day. Table 1 further reports that the average time span
between the current and last inspections is 184 days, and 38% of the inspections occur
during lunch time (12-2pm). These two variables may affect inspection outcomes because
restaurants are likely to adjust compliance effort according to when the next inspection is
expected to occur and most restaurants are busy at lunch time. During the sample period,
the DHR has adopted portable digital assistant (PDA) for inspectors. Since PDA usage
has a significant impact on inspection outcome (Jin and Lee 2014a), we create a dummy
variable indicating whether the study inspection uses PDA. We also control for the num-
ber of PDA inspections that the restaurant has experienced before the inspection, as the
restaurant may adjust compliance according to PDA usage.




                                             7
2.2      New-Repeat Difference

Despite universal training requirement for inspectors,9 the first panel of Table 2 reveals
significant difference between new and repeat inspectors. New inspectors on average find
9.36 violations, almost two additional violations (or 27% higher) than repeat inspectors.
Such differences are found in all three categories (critical, risk-factor, and non-critical). The
rest of Table 2 presents the new-repeat difference by the number of times that the previous
inspector has inspected the restaurant (Lrepeat). The new-repeat difference remains highly
significant, and the difference increases slightly with Lrepeat.
       Figure 1 shows the average number of violations during a typical new-repeat history
of a restaurant. It starts with the first new inspector for a restaurant, followed by four
repetitions of this inspector and then the next round for the next new inspector. To
construct the graphs, we identify the first “new” inspection for every restaurant in the
sample (1st N ew) and the repeat inspections conducted by the same inspector up to the
fourth (Repeat 1, 2, 3 and 4). While all restaurants must have their first new inspection by
definition, the number of restaurants differs over the order of repetition because restaurants
have different numbers of repetitions by the first new inspector. Similarly, we identify the
second, third, and fourth new inspections of restaurants, if they are observed in the sample,
and the following repeat inspections. The graphs show the average number of violations
for each new and repeat inspection.
       We present two panels of graphs in Figure 1. Figure 1A plots the raw data of reported
violations in total and three categories separately. Every point in Figure 1A reflects the
sample mean, with a vertical line for the 95% confidence interval. In both total and
category-specific graphs, we observe a spike in the first visit of a new inspector. The
“new” spike reflects sharp changes on both sides: comparing with her predecessor, a new
inspector reports more violations in her first visit; but comparing with herself, she reports
fewer violations when she returns the second time. In all graphs, the tip of the “new”
spikes increases cycle after cycle, probably because of overall time trends.
       To filter out possible time trends and restaurant heterogeneity, we use the whole sample
to regress violations (total and each category, separately) on year-month fixed effects,
   9
    A newly hired inspector should receive at least 120 hours of training in her first year of employment.
Also existing inspection staff receive a minimum of 20 hours of training each year. Each inspector is checked
by the FDA every three years to ensure compliance with national standards. Each inspector is required to
pass a certified food manager examination every five years.



                                                     8
restaurant age and restaurant fixed effects.10 Based on the residuals from those regressions,
we compute the average number of (residual) violations for each new-repeat cycle in Figure
1B. Spikes remain for new inspectors. The increasing trends of the tips, observed in the
raw data in Figure 1A, disappear mostly. There are still some increasing trends for total,
risk factor, and non-critical violations, but the increases are small in magnitude, compared
to those in Figure 1A. In the meantime, the trend for critical violations is now decreasing.
This is plausible if we believe that reported violations trigger compliance and some of the
compliance is permanent. In contrast to the sharp decline in an inspector’s first repetition,
reported violations tend to decrease over repetitions, while these changes are small and
insignificant.
       To better quantify the new-repeat difference, we turn to the following regression analysis
on the analysis sample.




                   yirt = αr + αt + αi + βnew · N EWirt + βLrpt · Lrepeati−1 rt

                              +βN ewLrpt · N EWirt · Lrepeati−1 rt + βx · Xirt + irt        (1)


where the dependent variable is the number of violations (yirt ) for restaurant r by inspector
i at time t. The key explanatory variables are a dummy indicating whether i is new to
the restaurant (N ew), the number of times that the inspector of the last inspection has
visited the restaurant (Lrepeat), and their interaction (N ew · Lrepeat). If the current and
previous inspectors are the same, N ew is equal to zero and Lrepeat reflects the length of
the relationship this inspector has had with the restaurant before this particular inspection.
If the current inspector is new, Lrepeat measures the repetitions of the previous inspector.
Restaurant age, inspector experience, inspection time, and all the other control variables
mentioned above are included (Xrit ), in addition to restaurant fixed effects (αr ), year-
month fixed effects (αt ), and inspector fixed effects (αi ). Table 3 reports regression results
for critical, non-critical, and risk-factor violations, separately.
       From Figure 1, we know that the “new” spike reflects two changes: an increase of
reported violations on the left (when we compare a new inspector to her predecessor) and
a decrease on the right (when we compare a new inspector’s first visit to her second visit
  10
       We also include a dummy indicator for missing value in restaurant age.



                                                      9
of the same restaurant). Our regression results capture both. Consistent with the left side
of the “new” spike, Table 3 suggests that a new inspector reports more violations than the
previous inspector, and this pattern is more conspicuous if the inspected restaurant has had
a longer relationship with the previous inspector. For example, when Lrepeat = 1, a new
inspector reports 0.28 more critical violations (= 0.2657 + 0.0152 × 1) than the previous
inspector coming back.11 This difference is about 17.3% larger than the sample mean.
Similar results are found for risk-factor and non-critical violations; the difference is 14.2%
for risk-factor and 11.1% for non-critical violations. When Lrepeat > 1, the difference
gets larger. For example, when Lrepeat = 3, a new inspector reports 0.31 more critical
violations (= 0.2657 + 0.0152 × 3) than the returning inspector.
       Consistent with the right side of the “new” spike, regression results show that the
number of violations declines most between the first and second visits of the same inspector.
For instance, consider a restaurant that has seen four visits of its previous inspector before
a new inspector comes in. For the first visit of the new inspector, we have N ew = 1
and Lrepeat = 4. For the second visit of the same inspector, we have N ew = 0 and
Lrepeat = 1. For the third visit, N ew = 0 and Lrepeat = 2. Thus, the regression predicts
that the new inspector reports 0.29 fewer critical violations from her first to second visits,
but only 0.013 fewer from the second to third visits.12 These numbers correspond to 17.8%
and 0.8% of the sample mean, respectively. For risk factors and non-critical violations, the
effects are similar.13
       Put together, Table 3 confirms the cycling pattern we have seen in the raw data: the
number of reported violations shoots up at every new inspection, declines sharply when
the new inspector returns, followed by small and incremental declines until the next new
inspector arrives. Note that our estimates do not imply that the same restaurant gets more
and more citations from one new inspector to another. To see this, consider a restaurant
that always receives a new inspector after the last inspector visited T times. According
to Equation (1), the difference between the new inspections of the two adjacent inspectors
  11
     More specifically, when Lrepeat = 1, the regression predicts βLrpt violations from the previous inspector
versus βnew + βLrpt + βN ewLrpt violations from a new inspector. Hence the new-repeat difference is βnew +
βN ewLrpt = 0.2657 + 0.0152 = 0.2809.
  12
     Everything else equal, the new inspector finds 0.2753 (= 0.2657 + (−0.0128) × 4 + 0.0152 × 4) plus a
constant on her first visit, -0.0128 plus a constant on the second visit, and -0.0256 (= −0.0128 × 2) plus a
constant on the third visit.
  13
     We estimated the reduced-form model for various subsamples, divided by inspector, restaurant, and
inspection characteristics. The results are very consistent across the subsamples (Appendix Table A2). We
also added a quadratic term of Lrepeat in the regression but find little change in results.


                                                     10
is zero. Now let us compare another two new inspectors: one comes after the previous
inspector visited T times and the other after the previous inspector visited only once. The
difference between these two new inspectors’ first inspections is (T − 1)(βLrpt + βN ewLrpt ).
Because βLrpt and βN ewLrpt are of opposite signs but similar magnitude, they largely cancel
out each other. In other words, even if two adjacent new inspectors face different values of
Lrepeat from their predecessor, their spikes are likely to be similar.


3    Endogenous Inspector Rotation

This section examines whether non-random inspector assignment can explain the new-
repeat difference. If the DHR assigns stringent inspectors to dirty restaurants, the new-
repeat gap could simply reflect endogenous inspector rotation.
    As a first check, in Figure 2, we plot the likelihood of a new inspector’s arrival by
the number of inspections that the last inspector has made for this restaurant (Lrepeat),
after controlling for year, month and restaurant fixed effects. The curve increases steadily
after Lrepeat = 3, suggesting that there is no obvious rotation cycle in inspector assign-
ment, although the DHR seems reluctant to change inspectors twice consecutively within
a restaurant.
    A more relevant concern is that the DHR may assign new inspectors according to a
restaurant’s last inspection records. To check this, at the inspection level, we regress the
indicator of the new inspector on the restaurant’s total violations found in the previous
inspection, in addition to restaurant fixed effects, year-month fixed effects, Lrepeat, and
other attributes of the previous inspection. Results are reported in the first column of
Table 4, showing that the number of total violations in the previous inspection has a
small (-0.001) but statistically significant effect on the propensity of a new inspector’s
arrival. However, the negative sign of this coefficient estimate is actually opposite to the
type of inspector selection we are concerned of. The second column of Table 4 breaks total
violations in the previous inspection into critical, risk-factor, and non-critical categories. To
our surprise, the number of critical violations found in the previous inspection is positively
correlated with having a new inspector next time, but the number of risk-factor or non-
critical violations shows an opposite effect. We do not have a good explanation for the
results, but this pattern cannot explain the robust finding about the new-repeat difference



                                               11
in our empirical analysis.
       What other factors drive the DHR to send a new inspector to a restaurant? We were told
that inspectors are typically assigned to territories near their residence in order to minimize
transportation costs. While we do not know individual inspectors’ residential locations,
we do observe most inspectors’ assignments clustered by no more than four zip codes.14
Further analysis suggests two other important factors, namely inspector retirement and new
hiring. Given the lack of inspector personnel data, we operationally define an inspector’s
retirement date as the date of her last appearance in our inspection data, and count an
inspector as a new hire in the quarter of her first appearance in our data.
       In the last two columns of Table 4, we include on the right hand side the proportion of
“retired” inspectors and the proportion of “new hires” in the corresponding subdistrict and
the previous quarter (there are 186 subdistricts in Florida). As we expect, both variables
are highly correlated with whether a restaurant receives a new inspector. To the extent
that inspector retirement and hiring are beyond the control of any single restaurant, we
believe that the inspector assignment driven by subdivision-level retirement and hiring
occurrences can be treated as exogenous.
       These results suggest that retirement and new hires may serve as valid instrumental
variables (IV) for N ew in Equation (1). In particular, we define two IVs, indicating whether
there was any retirement or new hire respectively in the corresponding subdistrict and
the previous quarter. Their interactions with Lrepeat serve as instrumental variables for
N ew · Lrepeat. The IV results in the first panel of Table 5 show that the coefficients of
N ew and Lrepeat are qualitatively same as the OLS estimates in Table 3; new inspectors
find significantly more violations than repeat inspectors for all three categories, and the
new-repeat gap increases in the number of the previous inspector’s visits.
       As another test of the potential endogeneity of N ew, the second panel of Table 5
uses propensity score matching (PSM), where the propensity score prediction is based on
Column 1 of Table 4. We conduct the PSM for each of the three violation categories, and by
  14
    In particular, for each inspector-year, we list all the zip codes where an inspector conducted initial
inspections and find that 80 to 90% of her assignments concentrate in four zipcodes. The average Herfindahl
index of zip codes within each inspector in a given year is around 3,500. If we examine inspector assignment
by zip-code, the Herfindahl index of inspectors within each zip-code is on average 7,000 to 9,000 each year.
This suggests that a zip-code is typically served by only one or two inspectors. Moreover, comparing
inspector assignment from one year to the next, we find that 57% of inspectors carry over at least 50% of
her top-4 zip-code assignments to the next year. Should new inspectors be assigned mostly in an attempt
to break a restaurant-inspector relationship, we should see weaker geographical concentration by inspectors
and greater turnover of assignments between two consecutive years.


                                                    12
the exact value of Lrepeat. Specifically, for each value of Lrepeat from 1 to 7, we estimate
the linear probability model where the dependent variable is N ew, the explanatory variables
are the lagged variables of total violations and Xrit , and we also control for year-month and
restaurant fixed effects. The predicted probability of new inspector’s arrival is used as the
matching variable. We used the nearest-neighbor matching without replacement with the
0.05 caliper (about 0.2 of the matching variable’s standard deviation). We computed the
bootstrapped 90% confidence intervals. The reported estimate is for the coefficient of N ew,
along with its 90% bootstrapped confidence interval. The PSM estimates are qualitatively
the same as the OLS results.
    Lastly, should new inspector assignment be targeted (and restaurants know the assign-
ment rule), we shall observe a larger new-repeat difference when the chance of getting a
new inspector is low. To check this, we rerun the OLS regressions for a few subsamples,
depending on whether there is high inspector employment turnover at the subdistrict level
in the previous quarter, whether Lrepeat ≤ 3, and whether the predicted probability of
getting a new inspector is below 10%. In each of these subsamples, we obtain similar results
as in the full-sample OLS regression. The key results are presented in Appendix Table A2,
or refer to Jin and Lee (2014b).
    In short, we conclude that inspector assignment is not random but largely driven by
factors beyond the control of individual restaurants, and the realization of inspector iden-
tity is hard to predict by individual restaurants. Thus, the new-repeat gap in inspection
outcomes cannot be explained by endogenous inspector rotation.


4    Two Explanations for the New-Repeat Difference

This section explores two explanations for the new-repeat gap, which we refer to as het-
erogenous inspector criteria and diminishing inspector attention. Both explanations imply
time-varying effects beyond inspector fixed effects. Therefore, we propose a structural es-
timation model to address the time-varying effects empirically and check the robustness of
our results in the reduced-form estimation.




                                              13
4.1      Heterogenous Inspector Criteria

The heterogeneity of inspectors’ tastes and stringency may explain the new-repeat gap
observed in our data. Suppose that a restaurant has been inspected repeatedly by an
inspector and the restaurant expects the same inspector to come back for the next inspec-
tion.15 Also suppose that the inspector is strict on, for example, bathroom cleanliness but
lenient on food temperature. Then the restaurant will devote most compliance efforts to
bathroom cleanliness and pay little attention to food temperature. However, suppose that
the next inspector turns out to be a new one and the new inspector focuses more on food
temperature. Then the restaurant will receive many citations in food temperature but few
citations in dirty bathroom. From the new inspector’s report, the restaurant can infer the
new inspector’s type. That point onward, the restaurant expects the same inspector to
return and targets compliance according to that inspector’s type.
       This simple example gives us a key prediction: the new-repeat gap is larger if the new
inspector is of a different type from the previous inspector. If we can measure inspector
type continuously, it implies that the further away the two inspectors’ types, the greater
the new-repeat gap. In our structural model, we attempt to measure the difference between
two consecutive inspectors’ types (unobservable to the econometrician) and estimate the
effect of the difference on inspection outcomes.
       The heterogeneity in inspector criteria does not always predict a positive gap between
new and repeat inspectors, as targeted compliance tends to counter detection and reported
violations are the product of these two countervailing forces. The mismatch of restaurant
expectation and realized inspector identity could go either way, which may end up to be a
pleasant or unpleasant surprise for the restaurant. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in inspector
criteria could predict a positive new-repeat gap on average, if the surprise is more likely to
be unpleasant (which depends on the distribution and assignment of inspectors), or if the
exact cancellation between compliance and detection is asymmetric across the two types of
surprise (which depend on the cost functions of compliance and detection). It is essentially
an empirical question, which we quantify in counterfactual simulations.
  15
    This is a simplifying assumption for this illustrative example. In reality, a sophisticated restaurant may
adjust compliance to a statistical distribution of potential inspector identity. The crucial point is that there
are different types of inspectors, and their different inspection criteria trigger different types of compliance
reaction.




                                                      14
4.2      Diminishing Inspector Attention

The finding that an inspector reports fewer violations when she returns to the restaurant
could also be explained by diminishing inspector attention. When a new inspector inspects
a restaurant for the first time, she is not familiar with the restaurant and does not have
any first-hand knowledge as to what areas are most vulnerable to violation.16 Checking
out every corner with a high level of attention, she may detect violations in many areas.
However, returning to the restaurant, she is equipped with the knowledge she acquired
before and may prefer to devote efforts to the areas she found problems previously. This
effect could magnify itself when she returns again, because she pays less attention to the
areas she recorded no problems multiple times. On the restaurant side, the restaurant
learns more about the inspector’s preference from previous visits and will most likely focus
compliance on those areas. As a result, the same inspector will find fewer violations.
       There could be various mechanisms behind diminishing inspector attention. It may be
a rational decision by the inspector, because detection effort is costly and the possibility of
finding a new violation in a previously compliant area is low. Within the same restaurant,
diminishing inspector attention could also be driven by a behavioral bias, as humans often
have confirmation bias and tend to avert self-contradiction (Jennings, Amabile and Ross
1982). Given the difficulty to distinguish rational and behavioral explanations, we are
agnostic on the mechanisms behind diminishing inspector attention, but aim to separately
identify its effect from the effect of heterogeneous inspector criteria.


4.3      Empirical Identification

To summarize, the hypothesis of heterogenous inspector criteria is built upon variations
across inspectors, while the hypothesis of diminishing inspector attention is based on vari-
ation within the same inspector. The difference gives us empirical identification. Note that
both hypotheses attempt to capture time-varying effects beyond inspector fixed effects.
In particular, heterogenous inspector criteria emphasize the mismatch between restaurant
compliance (to the last inspector’s preference) and the preference of the new inspector.
Hence it depends on the inherent difference between two adjacent inspectors. With enough
data, we can derive these inherent preferences from individual inspectors’ complete inspec-
  16
    Even if she reads the previous inspector’s report beforehand, the report contains mostly a check of yes
or no to the 55 pre-printed violation items, with no details on the physical layout of the restaurant or how
the layout relates to a particular violation.


                                                    15
tion records across all restaurants. Diminishing inspector attention focuses on differential
detection efforts within the same inspector-restaurant pair. In this sense, diminishing in-
spector attention captures temporal variation within the same inspector-restaurant pair
and does not depend on who the previous inspector is.
      To identify the two effects separately, we extend Equation (1) to the following specifi-
cation:




log(λirct ) = log(E(yirct ))

               =         βnew · N EWirt               + µic + βhetero (µic − µi−1 c )                       (2)
                         |      {z    }                 |           {z             }
                   new inspector’s higher attention     heterogeneous inspector criteria
               + βLrpt · Lrepeati−1 rt + βnewLrpt · N EWirt · Lrepeati−1 rt + µrc + µymc + ζXrit


Denoting yirct as the number of observed violations in category c for restaurant r by
inspector i at time t, we assume yirct follows a Poisson distribution with mean λirct .17
N ew and Lrepeat are defined as before. There are a rich set of fixed effects: µrc is the
restaurant-category fixed effect; µic is the inspector-category fixed effect for the current
inspector; µymc is the year-month-category fixed effect; µi−1 c the inspector-category fixed
effects for the last inspector. Vector Xirt includes control variables such as restaurant age,
inspector experience, whether the inspection is the inspector’s first of the day, whether the
inspection is during lunch hours, how many days since the last inspection, and so on.
      This specification includes two main changes from Equation (1): first, since the number
of violations is a count variable, we believe that a Poisson model is more appropriate than
a linear model. In fact, running Equation (1) with Poisson or OLS gives us similar results.
That is why we started with OLS in Section 2 and applied IV and PSM in Section 3.
The second change is adding βhetero (µic − µi−1 c ) on the right hand side. βhetero captures
the extent to which inspection outcomes depend on the inherent stringency and taste
heterogeneity between the current and previous inspectors. Note that βhetero does not
apply unless the current inspector is new and differs from the previous inspector. Since
we control for the inspector-category fixed effect of the current inspector, it captures the
extent to which a restaurant complies with the idiosyncratic preference of the last inspector
rather than that of the current inspector.
 17
      Some potential econometric issues regarding the specification are discussed in Jin and Lee (2014b).


                                                         16
   In comparison, βnew captures the effect of the new inspector’s higher attention. βnew
and βhetero can be identified separately because the former compares new versus repeat
inspectors no matter who the last inspector was, while the latter explores the identity and
preference difference between the current and previous inspectors.
   Neither heterogenous inspector criteria nor diminishing attention predict a clear effect
of Lrepeat. Strictly speaking, if a single visit is enough to reveal the inspector’s inherent
taste, the restaurant has the incentive to comply to that taste for any subsequent visits.
Similarly, an inspector may reduce her detection effort after the first visit and focus on the
same problematic areas for every subsequent visit (which invites the restaurant to focus
on the same areas for compliance). In reality, the Lrepeat-neutral prediction is violated
if the learning of inspector taste is gradual, if the restaurant changes its expectation of
inspector repetition, or if the inspector anticipates the restaurant’s targeted compliance
and therefore adjusts detection effort after each repeat visit. Given these ambiguities, we
continue to include Lrepeat and N ew · Lrepeat in the regression, but do not attempt to
distinguish the two explanations from the estimates of βLrpt and βnewLrpt .
   To summarize:

   • The distribution of inspector-category fixed effects (µic ) captures inspector hetero-
     geneity in their inherent stringency and taste (as well as the corresponding compliance
     response if restaurants can predict perfectly who will come next time).

   • We predict βnew > 0 if new inspectors have higher attention than repeat inspectors,
     even if they have the same inherent taste and stringency.

   • We predict βhetero > 0, which captures the new inspector effect due to heterogenous
     inspector criteria when restaurants cannot perfectly predict the identity of the next
     inspector.

   • The signs of βLrpt and βnewLrpt are ambiguous, depending on how restaurants and
     inspectors adjust their behavior and expectation over repeat inspections.




                                             17
4.4      Estimation Results

Table 6 reports the results from Equation (2).18 We estimate the specification for critical,
risk-factor, and non-critical violations separately, so that inspectors are allowed to differ in
taste and stringency across the three categories.19
       We have two kinds of coefficients for inspector heterogeneity, µic and βhetero . Figure 3
plots the histogram of the estimated µic for critical, risk-factor, and non-critical violations,
respectively. Using the most frequent inspector (in our data) as the benchmark, µic = 0.5
should be interpreted as inspector i on average reports exp(0.5) − 1 = 65% more violations
than the benchmark inspector. According to this interpretation, Figure 3 shows enormous
inspector heterogeneity in all three categories of violations.20
       In the bottom part of Table 6, we show that, within each inspector, the estimated µic
has a correlation coefficient of 0.73 between critical and risk-factor violations, 0.44 between
critical and non-critical, and 0.47 between risk-factor and non-critical. This suggests that
inspector heterogeneity is driven by differences in both overall stringency and relative taste
specific to each category.
       Despite the substantial variation in µic , βhetero is small. The hypothesis of heteroge-
nous inspector criteria predicts βhetero > 0 because, if the last inspector is less stringent in
category c than the current inspector (µic − µi−1 c > 0) and the restaurant anticipates the
last inspector to return, it should comply less and such lack of compliance will be reflected
in more violations reported by the current more stringent inspector. This prediction holds
for critical violations: for a new inspector who is 65% more stringent than the last (corre-
sponding to µic − µi−1 c = 0.5), she will find 1.9% more violations in addition to what she
  18
      In the bottom panel of Table 6, we report the goodness of fit for each column. The calculation follows
Cameron and Windmeijer (1996), which describes the log likelihood improvement from a constant-only
model to our model as a fraction of the log likelihood improvement from the constant-only model to the
perfect fit using the raw dataset itself. By definition, it is bounded within 0 and 1. The goodness of fit
measure is 0.45 for critical violations, 0.55 for risk factors, and 0.60 for non-critical violations, suggesting
that our model fits the raw data reasonably well. The bottom panel of Table 6 also reports the comparison
of our predicted violations versus the actual violations in both mean and standard deviation. The mean
is literally zero for all three columns, while the standard deviation is between 1.5 and 2.7. Most of the
seemingly large standard deviation is driven by the fact that our predicted violations are continuous but
actual violations are integers.
   19
      All estimations maximize the conditional likelihood with restaurant fixed effects. According to HHG
(1984) and Wooldridge (1999), restaurant fixed effects will drop out of the likelihood function conditional
on total violations found at a restaurant. Hence, we only need to estimate µic , βhetero , βnew , βpda , βLpda1 ,
βLpda0 , βnew , βLrpt , βnewLrpt and ζ.
   20
      After constructing robust standard errors according to Wooldridge (1999), we find that 22 inspectors
have a stringency statistically different (at 95% confidence) from the reference inspector for critical viola-
tions, 8 inspectors are different for risk-factor violations, and 166 inspectors are different for non-critical
violations.


                                                       18
would find if the restaurant fully anticipates her arrival. In comparison, we find that βhetero
is indifferent from zero for risk-factor violations and significantly negative for non-critical
violations. The latter could occur if restaurants face time or personnel constraints in com-
pliance so that more compliance in critical violations implies less compliance in non-critical
violations.
   After addressing inspector heterogeneity via µic and (µic − µi−1 c ), βnew captures the
effect of new inspectors’ higher attention. Our estimates suggest that a new inspector
reports 17.5% more critical violations, 14.6% more risk-factor violations, and 12.7% more
non-critical violations compared to a repeat inspector coming back for her second visit to
the restaurant. These percentages are computed by (exp(βnew + βnewLrpt × 1) − 1) × 100%
because the lowest value of Lrepeat is one. This large effect, combined with its increase with
the length of the relationship between the last inspector and the restaurant (as indicated
by the significant positive coefficient of βnewLrpt ), suggests that new inspectors may have
significantly higher attention in their first visit of a restaurant.
   In comparison, the coefficient on the relationship alone, βLrpt , is small but negative,
suggesting that among repeat inspectors one extra visit brings down the reported viola-
tions by 0.7-1.8%. This number could reflect a mixture of gradual compliance to the last
inspector’s stringency, gradual slack of repeat inspectors over time, or more compliance
with the growing fear of a new inspector coming next time. The positive and significant
estimate of βnewLrpt (across all three categories) suggests that slackness of repeat inspectors
is probably the most likely among these possibilities.
   One may argue that the large effect of new inspectors’ higher attention can be inter-
preted as restaurants catering to heterogenous inspector criteria within each of the three
violation categories. To address this possibility, we rerun the model for four frequently
cited items separately (items 2, 8, 22, and 23). In all four estimations, βnew is positive
and statistically significant. The estimates mean that a new inspector, compared to a
repeat inspector’s second visit, reports 16.7% more violations in item 2, 10.8% more in
8, 3.8% more in 22, and 9.0% more in 23. In comparison, the inspector attention effect
derived from the category-wise model is 14.6% more for risk-factor violations (items 2 and
8 are risk factors), and 12.7% more for non-critical violations (22 and 23 are non-critical).
The results suggest that only a small fraction of the category-wise attention effects can be
explained by heterogenous inspector criteria across specific items within the same category.


                                               19
   The results of some control variables may also suggest the tendency of diminishing
inspector attention. To the extent that novice inspectors (whose experience is no more
than 30 inspections) probably have the freshest memory of training and are still learning
where to pay more attention, they find 18.4-27.1% more violations across all three groups
of categories. Similarly, inexperienced inspectors whose experience is less than the median
also report more detected violations, suggesting that diminishing inspector attention is ap-
plicable not only to a longer restaurant-inspector relationship but also to longer experience
of inspectors. The sensitivity to inspector experience is consistent with what Macher et al.
(2011) found regarding the inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturing, although we do
not have detailed training and experience data as they do. Surprisingly, there is no obvi-
ous first-visit effect for the first inspection of the day, but inspectors find fewer violations
throughout the day, probably due to fatigue. In addition, older restaurants tend to have
more violations, as do inspections made during lunch time.


4.5   Counterfactual Simulations

Separating the effects of heterogeneous inspector criteria and diminishing attention sheds
light on the design of the inspection program. In particular, if the new-repeat phenomenon
is driven by heterogeneity of inspector criteria, the DHR may want to train all inspectors
to ensure homogeneity. However, if diminishing inspector attention is the dominant reason,
training only ensures that every inspector behaves the same as a new inspector, but it does
not address progressive shirking after the first inspection. Another lever is inspector rota-
tion, which addresses both effects, but its effectiveness depends on the relative importance
of the two. Thus, using our empirical estimates, we quantitatively simulate the effects of
random inspector assignment versus the effect of making inspector homogenous.
   To better understand how much of the new-repeat gap is driven by heterogenous inspec-
tor criteria and diminishing attention, we perform three counterfactual simulations. The
first simulation assigns inspectors randomly within each district. Specifically, we compute
the frequency of each inspector in the raw data and use this as the weight of random assign-
ment for that inspector. This way, the number of assignments for every inspector is similar
to that of raw data, but the assignment itself is random. To minimize simulation error, we
simulate random assignment for 100 times and compute the average predicted violations




                                              20
for each inspection. The simulation results are presented in Table 7.21 Many variables in
the regression model are related to inspector assignment, but the greatest change is that
over 80% of random assignments involve new inspectors as compared to 27% in the exist-
ing assignments. Consequently, random assignments on average yield 11.3% (non-critical)
to 17.6% (critical) more detected violations. Further decomposition finds that most of
the effects are driven by the large attention effect of new inspectors rather than inspector
heterogeneity.
       The second and third counterfactual simulations aim to compare the raw data with
situations without any inspector heterogeneity. To do this, we keep the same inspector
assignment as in the raw data but assume that every inspector is the same as either the
average inspector or the most stringent inspector. Comparing the former to the raw data,
inspector homogeneity leads to a lower mean and lower dispersion in the simulated dis-
tribution of detected violations. However, in the latter simulation, inspector homogeneity
leads to a higher mean and higher dispersion of simulated violations. This is because more
stringency leads to more detected violations in every inspection and this increase is greater
in magnitude for dirtier restaurants due to the exponential functional form of the Poisson
model. This also contributes to the increased dispersion of violations.
       Given the simulated effects of inspector rotation and inspector training, which lever
should the DHR adopt in its inspection program design? The results in Table 7 show that,
compared to the raw data, the increase in the average number of violations by making
every inspector the same as the most stringent one is much larger than the increase made
by random assignment, 12 times larger for critical violations, 17 times for risk factors,
and 13 times for non-critical violations. What does this mean for the DHR? Take critical
violations as an example. Assuming that the DHR aims to detect as many critical violations
as possible (which might minimize the public health risk) and it has to choose only one
change, the results mean that, if the cost of training all inspectors into the most stringent
type is 12 times larger than the cost of random assignment, random assignment should
be a more efficient policy lever. Similar interpretation can be made on other violation
categories, if we are willing to ignore correlations across categories.
  21
    Not surprisingly, the actual violations are more dispersed but their medians are close to the predicted
violations, especially in risk-factor and non-critical categories (because these two groups are less censored
at zero).




                                                     21
5    Conclusion

Government inspections often involve repeated interactions between inspectors and in-
spectees. In this paper, we use restaurant hygiene inspections as an example to show that
inspector assignment and repetition can have significant impacts on inspection outcomes.
Our paper is motivated by the fact that new inspectors detect significantly more violations
than repeat inspectors. After ruling out regulatory capture and endogenous inspector ro-
tation, we attempt to explain the new-repeat gap by heterogeneous inspector criteria and
diminishing inspector attention. We find that, after controlling for heterogenous inspector
criteria, a new inspector finds 13-18% more violations than the second visit of a repeat
inspector, likely due to the new inspector’s higher level of attention. Given that the new-
repeat gap is 27% in the raw data, our findings suggest that about 48-67% of the gap
is explained by diminishing attention of repeat inspectors. The remaining gap can be at-
tributed to restaurant heterogeneity, time trends, and heterogeneity of inspector tastes and
stringency.
    Using our estimates, we perform counterfactual simulations to highlight the effects of
inspector training and rotation on regulatory outcomes. In reality, there should be various
considerations for designing an inspection program. For example, more frequent rotation
of inspectors should increase the transportation cost of inspectors, and therefore reduce
the number of inspections that can be conducted per inspector per year. If the DHR aims
to finish a fixed number of inspections per restaurant per year, it requires the DHR to hire
more inspectors. Also it might be very expensive to create and run an effective training
program. Putting all these complicated issues aside and under the simple premise that the
DHR is to detect as many potential violations as possible, our simulation results suggest
a tradeoff between strengthening the training program and randomly rotating inspectors.
The two are comparable if training all inspectors into the most stringent type is about 12 to
17 times more costly than random rotation. Otherwise, one should be more cost-effective
than the other depending on the cost ratio. There are various ways to improve inspections
besides those we considered. Still we hope that our findings provide a useful guideline for
policy makers.

Notes: The linear probability model for a new inspector’s arrival is estimated by using the specification of Column
(1) of Table 4. The probability is relative to that when the number of inspection by previous inspector is one. The
estimates when the number of inspections by previous inspector is greater than 25 are omitted. The sample mean
number of inspections by previous inspector is 3.65, as shown in Table 1.

Notes: Inspector-specific fixed effects are estimated from regressing total violations on inspection month and
fiscal year fixed effects as well as restaurant-specific fixed effects. There are 358 inspectors in total. By adding
inspector-specific fixed effects, the R squared increases from 0.034 to 0.131. The omitted inspector’s ID = 59.
The outlying inspector (ID = 49233) has only 12 inspections in the final sample for all different restaurants. The
average number of inspections per inspector is 1,192, the median 952 and the maximum 4,275.

Notes: Inspector-item fixed effects are estimated by regressing item-specific violations on restaurant fixed
effects, month and fiscal year fixed effects. The graph shows the frequency of inspectors at each item for which
they are most likely to detect violations. There are 358 unique inspectors in the sample. See Appendix A for all
items.

Notes: All regressions include all control variables and fixed effects of our main specification in Table 3.
Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses. Panel A restricts the sample to those where more than
10% of inspectors in the same subdistrict retired or more than 10% of inspectors in the same subdistrict
were newly hired in the previous quarter. For Panel C, the probability of new inspector's arrival is
predicted from Column (1) of Table 4. *** significant at the 1% level; ** significant at the 5% level; *
significant at the 10% level.
