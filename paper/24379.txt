                                          ABSTRACT

Two for-profit Philippine social enterprises, aiming to demonstrate corporate social responsibility
by increasing microlending to the poor, incorporated a widely-used poverty measurement tool
into their loan applications and tested the tool using randomized training content. Treated loan
officers were instructed why and how to use the tool for targeting; control group training merely
labelled the tool “additional household information”. The targeting training backfired, leading to
no additional poor applicants and lower-performing loans. Descriptive evidence suggests the
targeting training exacerbated loan officer misperceptions and multitasking problems. Our results
help explain why corporate social responsibility efforts are often siloed from core operations.

I. Introduction
    For-profit social enterprises seek to “do well by doing good”, maximizing a double-bottom
line where both profits and social impacts are important objectives (e.g., Yunus 2008). Microcredit
in particular “has become the leading example of a broader push for social investment in the health,
education, and energy sectors” (Conning and Morduch 2011). Beyond social enterprises per se,
businesses in most industries have made substantial investments in corporate social responsibility
(“CSR”) that introduce elements of a second bottom-line (e.g., Servaes and Tamayo 2013;
Flammer 2015). 2
    Can enterprises pursue twin objectives without comprising one or both them? In particular, can
firms in microcredit—a “leading example” among social enterprises-- succeed in maximizing
profits while expanding access to credit for the poor? Work on multi-tasking, beginning with the
seminal theory of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991, 1994), highlights the challenge from a
mechanism design perspective: if employees (or managers) face relatively strong incentives for
one of the objectives, they may neglect the other. 3 Another challenge is that poverty targeting is
nontrivial (Alatas et al. 2012; Banerjee et al. 2015; Alatas et al. forthcoming; Hanna and Karlan
2017; Karlan and Thuysbaert forthcoming). So is finding the efficient frontier of the traditional
bottom line (e.g., Karlan and Zinman 2017). In short, maximizing either objective for a social
enterprise like a microlender seems challenging enough; trying to maximize twin objectives may
backfire.
    We examine the social enterprise balancing act, using a poverty targeting experiment
implemented by two banks in the Philippines. The banks sought to increase their lending to poorer
microentrepreneurs-- without sacrificing their own profits. To this end we worked with the banks
to integrate a widely-used poverty targeting tool into loan officers’ standard application workflow.
Specifically, each bank included the tool’s 10 questions, along with standard questions used for
underwriting, in its new loan application management and credit scoring software. The research
team trained all 27 loan officers that worked in microlending in 20 branches to use the new
software. Of the 20 branches, 10 were randomly assigned to treatment and 10 to control. Loan
officers in treatment branches were informed that the new questions should be used to improve
identification of poor households, reassured that the poverty indicators were not linked to credit
risk or the assessment thereof, and reminded of the bank’s social mission to reach poor households.
Loan officers in control branches were informed simply that the 10 new questions are “additional
household information”.
    We implemented the poverty targeting tool with the intention of making it easier for loan
officers to identify and encourage poor households to apply. For the treatment group this objective

2
  The CSR literature has only recently begun to use within-firm experiments to examine effects of CSR on
employees. The employees in these experiments have been freelancers, with their tasks and customers
assigned exogenously, and their responsibilities focused on maximizing profits (V. C. Burbano 2016; V.
Burbano 2017; Hedblom, Hickman, and List 2016; List and Momeni 2017). Our experiment complements
this work by taking place in long-established firms, with longer-tenured employees who are responsible for
bringing in customers and juggling both sides of the bottom line.
3
  See e.g., Palacios (2018) for a review of the empirical literature on multi-tasking problems in firms.

                                                    2
was made prominent and tied explicitly to the banks’ social missions. Beyond the tool and senior
management’s exhortation and expectations, loan officers faced no additional inducements to
bring in poor households. Nonetheless, the exhortations and expectations by senior management
were sincere: the plan was for the training to increase lending to the poor and then to use that
exogenous increase to study the impact of the banks’ microlending on poverty alleviation.
    Loan officers also faced incentives to maximize the traditional bottom line, in the form of
performance pay based on number of loans originated and the timeliness of loan repayments. In
this sense we expected the poverty targeting tool to alleviate a classic multi-tasking problem where
loan officers faced relatively strong incentives to maximize profits, potentially at the expense of
bringing in more poor clients.
    Treatment effects of the poverty targeting tool, estimated on outcomes measured over a two-
year horizon, suggest that it backfired. On the social side of the bottom line, the tool failed to
increase lending to the poor: treated loan officers brought in weakly more applicants (12, SE=13),
but no more poor applicants (0, SE=3), decreasing the proportion of poor applicants and loan
approvals. On the traditional side of the bottom line, the tool failed to hold profits constant: loans
brought in by treatment group officers have significantly higher default rates (3.4 pp, SE=1.7 pp),
while loan size and other terms do not change. An increase in default rates is bad not just for the
banks but for the individual loan officers as well, in the sense that higher default rates can lead to
reprimands and missed incentive bonuses.
    Surprised by these results, two years after the experimental period we worked with the banks
to administer a survey of all bank loan officers (not just those who cover microcredit; N=68) to
explore their beliefs and attitudes. Subject to the caveats that these data are from after the
experimental period, on a broader sample of loan officers, and purely descriptive, they nevertheless
enable us to explore mechanisms. We infer two key patterns. First, loan officers view the profit-
making side of their job as more important than the social welfare side. Second, loan officers
perceive poorer borrowers to be less profitable, despite bank management exhortations and
empirical evidence to the contrary. 4
    Taking the experimental and descriptive results together, we speculate that treatment group
loan officers were trying to act like canonical multi-taskers: maximize profits without making any
additional effort to bring in more poor borrowers. But—still speculating—treated loan officers
mistakenly thought that the new poverty targeting tool was helping them do a better job of bringing
in profitable borrowers by screening out poor credit risks. Perhaps this was a salience-driven
overreaction (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2017); after all, all loan officers in the experiment
had access to the tool, with the treatment merely drawing attention to it and the banks’ social
objective. Another possibility is that treatment group default rates rose because of a monitoring




4
  In this sense our study adds to the literatures on biases in expert judgment (e.g., Soll, Milkman, and
Payne 2015) and on the economics of discrimination in product markets and credit markets in particular
(e.g., Blanchflower, Levine, and Zimmerman 2003; Hanson et al. 2016).

                                                    3
failure: perhaps loan officers failed to anticipate the challenges of managing more borrowers (12
more in T vs C, SE=11).
     All told, this study contributes to the above-cited literatures on multi-tasking, poverty
targeting, social enterprise, and CSR. Our main innovation is bringing together these related
strands of work by considering a policy that asks front-line employees to pursue both profit and
social welfare objectives.

II. Setting
    We developed and conducted the poverty targeting experiment in close cooperation with the
senior management and microlending operations of two longstanding, family-owned-and-
operated, for-profit banks. First Macro Bank (FMB) has eight branches in Metro Manila (serving
mostly peri-urban areas) and FICO Bank has twelve branches in Northern Luzon (a more rural
region). Both banks offer a range of products and services, with microlending comprising only a
small fraction of the portfolio. 5
    Each bank touts improving social welfare as a key objective. Taking two examples from our
study period, FICO’s website stated: “[we] believe in the noble cause of community banking…
[the] bank is supportive of the economic ascendancy of the greatest number”. Similarly, FMB’s
website stated that it was founded to help improve the quality of the lives of the poor and
“commit[ted] to the development of clients”. During our study FMB received subsidized technical
assistance from a USAID-funded program to streamline its microlending processes with the
objective of bringing in more low-income borrowers (this is commonplace: Cull and Morduch
(2017) find that for-profit microlenders obtain more subsidies than do non-profits).
    Microcredit’s small loan sizes make it a natural focal point for a poverty targeting effort. FICO
and FMB offer individual liability loans with terms and targeting that are in line with their many
competitors. Loan amounts range from 5,000 pesos to 50,000 pesos (45 pesos ≈ 1 USD during our
experiment). Repayments are amortized over a 3- to 6-month maturity and due weekly. Annual
percentage rates are around 60% (and, given low inflation, approximate real rates). Applicants
must have an existing business, be between the ages of 18 and 65, and demonstrate sufficient cash
flow to service a new loan.
    Senior management at both banks view microlending as a fulcrum of their social missions and
the natural starting point for expanding financial inclusion (social mission) and expanding the
bank’s customer base (traditional bottom line). Yet loan officers face no quantitative directives or
incentives on how to implement the social mission; indeed, the poverty targeting tool the banks
implemented for the study was the most tangible effort to-date to translate exhortation into a
concrete action: bringing in more poor clients. Loan officers face clearer incentives on the
traditional side of the bottom line, with an incentive bonus based on meeting quantitative monthly
targets for portfolio at risk (PAR) and new originations.



5
    At the time of the experiment FICO had approximately 26,000 microcredit clients and FMB 2,700.

                                                    4
    Our loan officers thus face a difficult problem: they have front-line responsibility for both sides
of the bottom line but face quantitative incentives and directives only on the traditional side. There
may well be tension between profit maximization and bringing in more poor clients. If poor clients
are worse credit risks, or perceived to be worse by officers, they could jeopardize loan officers’
incentive pay. And if poor clients are difficult to identify—if it is difficult to measure whether a
given borrower actually contributes to the bank’s objective of expanding lending the poor— then
finding poor borrowers could leave less time for other screening and monitoring activities that are
key inputs to the traditional bottom line.
    The intervention was designed to alleviate tension in the loan officers’ juggling act by making
it easier to identify poor applicants, signaling the importance of bringing in more clients, and
clarifying the bank management’s belief that credit risk and poverty status are uncorrelated,
conditional on the other applicant characteristics considered in underwriting.

III. Experimental Design
    Management at both banks sought to make it easier and more salient for loan officers to bring
in more poor applicants. To this end the banks worked with us to design and implement a simple
experiment on poverty targeting training. In March 2010 we randomized the population of loan
officers from the two banks (NL=27), pairwise at the branch level (NB=20), to one of two groups:
Treatment and Control. 6 The randomization produces twelve treated and fifteen control loan
officers, from ten treatment and ten control branches. Table 1 Panel A shows that we cannot reject
equality of means for treatment and control branches across the few branch characteristics for
which we have data at baseline: poverty headcount in the branch’s catchment area, total number
of loan officers (including those not included in the experiment because they are not responsible
for microloans), and year opened. Panel B shows no evidence of differential loan officer attrition
across the two arms. The null effects in Table 1—and below when we estimate treatment effects—
are subject to the important caveat that they are imprecisely estimated.
    Both treatment and control groups used the same loan application process; specifically, the
start of our experiment coincided with the banks changing from paper applications and manual
underwriting to electronic and more-automated underwriting. We embedded a widely-used
targeting tool, the Poverty Probability Index (PPI), into the new electronic application. 7 The PPI
is comprised of ten simple, country-specific questions used to calculate a poverty likelihood (the
Appendix details the questions and scoring for the Philippines).




6
  We use pairwise randomization due to the small number of branches (NB=20), matching each branch with
another branch from the same bank based on the poverty headcount ratio of each branch’s catchment area,
and then randomizing within each branch pair. We calculate the poverty headcount ratio using the Annual
Poverty Indicators Survey produced by the Philippines’ National Statistics Office.
7
  The PPI was developed by the Grameen Foundation in 2006 and is now used by organizations in 45
countries. In 2016, Grameen transferred management of the index to Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA),
which then changed the PPI name from the Progress out of Poverty Index to the Poverty Probability Index.
The new name better reflects what the index measures, which is poverty likelihood at a point in time.

                                                   5
    The treatment was simple and threefold: as part of the training on the new system, treated loan
officers received: 1) Explanation that the purpose of the ten questions was to make it easier to
identify and service poor applicants (training for the control loan officers simply referred to these
questions as “additional household information); 2) Exhortation tying the PPI to the organization’s
social mission to help the poor by providing them access to microfinance (the control loan officers
received no such exhortation); 3) Reassurance that, taking into account the other information
required of applicants, poverty status should not impact credit risk and hence that bringing in more
poor borrowers should not affect loan officers’ ability to meet their incentive targets for loan
performance (the control loan officers received no such reassurance).

IV. Results
    We estimate treatment effects of the poverty targeting training on loan officer behavior by
regressing an outcome 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 , pertinent to the traditional or social side of the banks’ bottom lines and
measured over the 24-months post-random assignment, on a treatment group indicator 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 and our
randomization strata 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 (i.e., our branch-pair fixed effects):

                                   𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + � 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀
                                                       𝑘𝑘

i indexes loan officers, loan applicants, or loans, depending on the outcome. We always cluster
standard errors at the level of randomization: the branch. Because we have a small number of
branches (20), we bootstrap our standard errors with 5,000 repetitions (Cameron, Gelbach, and
Miller 2008). Table 2 reports treatment effect estimates for various outcomes in column 3, with
regression-adjusted means for each outcome in columns 1 and 2 (for control and treatment
observations, respectively).
    Starting with the social side of the bottom lines, Table 2 Panel A considers application
characteristics, measured at the loan officer level. Treated loan officers bring in weakly more loan
applicants over the 24 months post-treatment (12, SE=13), but no more poor applicants (-0.04,
SE=2.67), leading to a lower proportion of poor applicants (-6pp on a base of 22pp in the control
group, SE=2pp). Panel B provides additional support for the inference that the treatment makes
the average applicant less likely to be poor, estimating negative effects on the raw PPI score and
the inferred poverty likelihood at the application level. 8 Panel C provides further evidence that
loan officers use the PPI training to select richer not poor applicants, with variables collected for
underwriting purposes but not included in the PPI index indicating higher-income and higher-
wealth applicants. Appendix Table 2 shows a similar pattern of results if we consider only
approved applications in Panels A-C instead of all applications.
    Turning to the traditional side of the bottom line, we note that while treated loan officers bring
in weakly more applicants (Panel A) and approved loans (Appendix Table 2 Panel A), an increase
in loan volume will increase profitability only if there are fixed costs (which is a fair assumption),

8
  Appendix Table 1 reports treatment effects on each of the 10 components of the PPI. As expected-- given
that the point of the index is to aggregate noisy correlated signals to produce a better estimate than any
single component can provide—we do not find any treatment effects with p-values < 0.05.

                                                        6
loan terms do not become less favorable to bank, and loan performance does not deteriorate. Table
2 Panel D examines the latter two assumptions, and shows that loan terms are essentially
unchanged: the effect on loan amount is 619 pesos (SE=969) on a base of 17,000. (Other loan
terms are essentially fixed per bank policy; e.g., loan officers have little if any discretion over
interest rates, repayment frequency, repayment period, collateral requirements, etc.) But the key
result in Table 2 Panel D suggests that loan performance does deteriorate: the most important
measure of portfolio-at-risk (based on the actual performance incentives of loan officers), loan
default, increases by 3.4pp (SE=1.7pp) on loans originated by treated loan officers. A reduction in
loan performance of this magnitude would almost certainly prevent a loan officer from earning a
performance bonus, as bonuses are forfeited if their portfolio at risk is above 5%.
    All told, the results in Table 2 suggest that the poverty targeting treatment caused loan officers
to miss both social impact and profitability targets.

V. Exploring Mechanisms through an Ex-Post Loan Officer Survey
     Bank management and we were surprised by the results in Table 2. To explore how loan officer
attitudes and beliefs might moderate and/or drive the results, we fielded a survey approximately
two years after the conclusion of our study period (i.e., approximately four years after starting the
experiment). Neither bank had made changes to its loan application or scoring system in the
interim, with new loan officers using the PPI questions as “additional household information” with
no additional training, a la our Control Group. Research team staff interviewed the 17 of the 27
loan officers who were part of our experiment and still with their original bank, as well as 41 other
loan officers from other parts of the banks. Below we report results for all 68 loan officers, and do
not focus on the subsample of loan officers remaining from our experiment, given the high attrition
rate and small remaining sample size for that sub-sample.
    Table 3 explores how loan officers view their jobs (Column 1), with an eye on the relative
importance of the two bottom lines. Tellingly, when asked for their “Most important reason for
choosing to work at this company,” only 4 of the 68 selected “Best Opportunity to Work on Local
Development/Welfare,” while 93% selected a reason related to their private returns such as “Best
Paid,” or “Job Security.” Similarly, when asked to “Name 3 things that you like most about
working at this company,” 65% choose “Salary”, and 100% named at least one reason related to
private returns, while only 21% choose “I feel I can really help people”. In the same vein, when
asked “Do you think your job is more like…?”, 75% choose “Bank work”, while only 9% choose
“NGO work” and 16% choose “Both”. The response patterns in this table suggest that loan officers
see themselves as bankers first and foremost, valuing job attributes that are hardly unique to social
enterprise. Among the 17 loan officers remaining from our experiment, the slant towards the
traditional bottom line seems more pronounced if anything (compare Columns 2 and 3 to Column
1).
    Table 4 sheds some light on how loan officers map an applicant’s poverty status onto each side
of the double bottom line. The survey asks, for each of the ten PPI component questions, “If you
learn the following about a borrower how will it change your opinion of the impact a loan would


                                                  7
have on…” (1) “Profitability for the bank”, and (2) “Social welfare for the borrower’s family.” We
code “More” responses as 1, “Equal” as zero, and, and “Less” as -1.
    Column (1) suggests that loan officers perceive the three poverty indicators (many children,
light wall and roof materials) as being negatively correlated with profitability. Conversely, most
of the seven wealth indicators are thought to be positively correlated with profitability. Combining
the ten responses per loan officer into a single index by multiplying wealth indicator responses by
-1, we infer that on the whole loan officers perceive a strong negative correlation between
profitability and poverty: -1.1 (SE=0.29). Table 5 takes this hypothesis to actual data on loan
performance and borrower characteristics and finds no evidence to support it, either
unconditionally or conditional on credit score. It seems that loan officers have incorrect
perceptions.
    Table 4 Column (2) suggests that loan officers perceive poorer borrowers as benefiting no
more from loans than richer borrowers, and perhaps relatively less. The three poverty indicators
are thought by the loan officers to be weakly correlated with social welfare (with mean responses
indicating basically no correlation), while the seven wealth indicators have a small and positive
perceived correlation with social welfare on average. Aggregating the ten responses into a single
index, the perceived correlation between poverty and impacts on the borrower is -0.54 (SE=0.29).
    In sum, Table 4 suggests that the banks’ loan officers tend to think that bringing in more poor
borrowers hurts profitability and does not improve social welfare. This suggests an explanation for
the failure of our targeting intervention: 1) treated loan officers shared these perceptions during
our study—despite management reassurances and exhortations to the contrary; 2) treated loan
officers tried to use the PPI as a credit risk screening tool instead of a poverty targeting tool; 3)
this (mis)use of the PPI backfired, because it led loan officers to bring in applicants that actually
had greater ex-ante risk (screening failure), and/or because it led loan officers to take on larger
portfolios that proved unexpectedly difficult to manage (monitoring failure).

VI. Conclusion
     We worked with two for-profit microfinance institutions in the Philippines to implement and
test a widely-used poverty targeting tool (the Poverty Probability Index), with the objective of
providing more loans to poor households. The PPI consists of ten simple questions and was
integrated into the standard loan application at each institution. Loan officer training at control
group branches (N=10) simply referred to the tool as “additional household information”. Training
at treatment group branches (N=10) featured explanation of the questions; exhortation to use them
to meet the banks’ social missions by bringing in more poor borrowers; and reassurance from
management that poverty status and loan performance are uncorrelated, conditional on other
applicant characteristics. 9
    The treatment group training backfired: it produced no improvement on the social side of the
bottom line (bringing in no more poor applicants or borrowers), while harming the traditional side

9
 This reassurance is empirically validated (Table 5), but the training did not provide any quantitative
evidence.

                                                     8
of the bottom line (loan performance deteriorated substantially). Descriptive evidence suggests
that the additional training exacerbated loan officer misperceptions and multitasking problems,
with loan officers trying and failing to use the poverty measurement tool in pursuit of profit rather
than social objectives.
    Some important caveats are worth emphasizing. These are surprising findings given the intent
of the changed policy, and so from a Bayesian perspective replication is especially important. Even
taking our findings at face value, we consider briefly two important dimensions of external
validity. First, these results do not imply that PPI is an ineffective targeting tool in general. The
PPI may well be effective in the context of a program whose main purpose is reaching and helping
the poor. Second, our results do not imply that double-bottom line efforts will always backfire; it
is important to keep in mind that the banks in our study provided stronger incentives (and perhaps
selected personnel) for the traditional bottom line.
    Nonetheless our findings suggest that caution is warranted when entrusting employees to
balance two bottom lines. Our results also provide an explanation for why many firms take the
balancing act out of front-line employees’ hands, by segregating corporate social responsibility
(CSR) functions from core activities. But separating CSR from core functions may not be practical,
or optimal, in many companies—and perhaps in social enterprises especially.
    Hence future work would do well to unpack whether and how front-line employees can
successfully juggle both sides of a double-bottom line (or multiple margins of a multi-tasking
problem more broadly). Complementary approaches to the methods used in this study include
testing different incentive mechanisms, training content, employee recruitment strategies, and/or
feedback and workflow management tools; better-timed surveys on employee attitudes and
perceptions; and more granular measurement of employee activities. There is much more to learn
about the challenges and opportunities of implementing a double-bottom line.

* p<=0.10, ** p<=0.05, *** p<= 0.01. We use pairwise randomization due to the small number of branches (12 at
FICO Bank, 8 at First Macro Bank), matching each branch with another branch from the same bank based on the
poverty headcount ratio, and then randomizing within each branch pair. Standard errors, in parentheses, are
clustered at the branch level and adjusted for our small number of clusters by bootstrapping with 5,000 repetitions
per Cameron et al (2008). Poverty ratio is the proportion of households in the branch's catchement area below the
30th percentile of per capita household income, measured using the Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (2004) from
the Philippines' National Statistics Office. That survey did not cover the areas served by four FMB branches, and so
we matched those four into two pairs based on geographic proximity.

* p<=0.10, ** p<=0.05, *** p<= 0.01. Each row reports regression-adjusted means (columns 1 and 2), and the
treatment effect (column 3) estimated by regressing the outcome on the treatment indicator and strata (branch-pair)
fixed effects. Standard errors, in parentheses, are clustered at the branch level and adjusted for our small number of
clusters by bootstrapping with 5,000 repetitions per Cameron et al (2008). Panel C variables are collected routinely on
loan applications, just like the PPI variables used to construct the poverty indices in Panel B (see the Appendix for
details on index construction). Sample size drops from Panels B and C to Panel D because some approved applicants do
not avail a loan. Besides loan amount, we do not report other loan terms (e.g., interest rate, maturity) because bank
policies allow for little to no variation in those terms. Exchange rate during study period was 45 pesos ≈ 1 USD.

Data is from survey administered 4 years post-random assignment, to all loan officers working for the two banks at the
time, not just microloan officers. 17 of the 27 loan officers included in our experiment (see Tables 1 and 2) were still
working for the banks at the time of this survey and hence are included in this sample. Aside from the observation
count, each cell reports the proportion of all 68 respondents giving the response described in the row label. Private
*One individual responded that the bank was their first choice but did not provide a reason why, another said they
chose their job because it is "respected work".
