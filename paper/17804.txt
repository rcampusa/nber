Various theories of market failures and targeting motivate the promotion of entrepreneurship training
programs throughout the world. Using data from the largest randomized control trial ever conducted
on entrepreneurship training, we examine the validity of such motivations and find that training does
not have strong effects (in either relative or absolute terms) on those most likely to face credit or human
capital constraints, or labor market discrimination. On the other hand, training does have a relatively
strong short-run effect on business ownership for those unemployed at baseline, but not at other horizons
or for other outcomes. On average, training increases short-run business ownership and employment,
but there is no evidence of broader or longer-run effects on business ownership, business performance
or broader outcomes.

1. Introduction

    Governments and donors spend billions of dollars subsidizing entrepreneurship training

programs around the world. In the United States alone, there exist more than 1,000 SBA-

subsidized Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) and 762 not-for-profit programs

providing self-employment training and other assistance.1 Arguments for subsidizing training are

manifold, and span theories of allocative and/or redistributive frictions in credit, labor, insurance,

and human capital markets. But these arguments have been difficult to evaluate empirically due

to classic endogeneity problems from selection into training. Thus, surprisingly little is known

about the overall effectiveness of entrepreneurship training and whether this training mitigates

market or redistributive frictions.

    We address these limitations with an analysis of the largest and broadest randomized trial on

entrepreneurship training ever conducted in the United States or elsewhere in the world – the

Project Growing America through Entrepreneurship (GATE).2 Project GATE was a longitudinal

study conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Small Business Administration (SBA)

1
  SBDCs exist in all 50 states, and are administered and funded through partnerships between the SBA
and public colleges and not-for-profits. See http://www.sba.gov/content/small-business-development-
centers-sbdcs for a directory of SBDCs, Aspen Institute/FIELD (2012) for information on non-profit
programs, and European Commission (2010) for a description of programs in the European Union.
2
  The only previous randomized trial conducted in the United States was a smaller demonstration
experiment of self-employment training for U.I. recipients in Washington and Massachusetts (Benus et al
(1994)). That study found positive program impacts on self-employment, total earnings, and job creation,
but in addition to training the assistance program allowed for concurrent U.I. benefit payments and a
lump-sum benefit payment. A few recent experiments of the effects of business training on micro-
entrepreneurs have been conducted in developing countries (Field, Jaychandran, and Pande 2010; Berge,
Bjorvatn, and Tungooden 2011; Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar 2011; Karlan and Valdivia 2011; Karlan,
Knight, and Udry 2012; Gine and Mansuri 2011). These studies have generally found some positive, but
mixed, results. The results of this literature may be informative, but not generalizable, to the developed
country context where the content of entrepreneurship training, education level of trainees, and types of
businesses being created are very different, and where formal labor, financial and business markets are
more open and accessible. For related research using non-randomized approaches to identifying effects of
self-employment training programs, see, e.g., Kosanovich and Fleck (2001), Rodriguez-Planas (2010),
Almeida and Galasso (2010), and for random and quasi-experimental approaches to studying
entrepreneurship education for college and younger students see Huber, Sloof and van Praag (2012) and
Oosterbeek, van Praag and Ijsselstein (2010).
in which free entrepreneurship training was randomly offered to individuals interested in starting

or improving a business. More than four thousand individuals applied for a limited number of

slots for free entrepreneurship training services at 14 different SBDCs and non-profit

community-based organizations (CBOs) located across 7 cities in 3 states. SBDCs and CBOs are

the predominant providers of entrepreneurship training services in the U.S. market. Subjects

assigned to the treatment group were offered an array of best-practice training services whereas

subjects assigned to the control group were not offered any free services. Follow-up surveys at 6

and 18, and 60 months after treatment assignment yield a rich set of outcome measures. The 60-

month follow-up survey provides rare measures of long-run outcomes.

    We use the GATE experiment to conduct a comprehensive examination of the impacts of

entrepreneurship training. We provide new estimates for additional outcomes beyond those

reported in the original evaluation report, estimates that control for non-compliance in the

treatment and control groups, non-experimental estimates from the control group to demonstrate

potential biases, and estimates of distributional differences in business sales and employment.3

We also test hypotheses regarding the rationales for training interventions by examining several




3
  The final evaluation report for Project GATE submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor found that the
program increased business ownership in the short-run, and had positive effects on business longevity and
job creation over the full sample period (Benus et al. 2009). Unemployment insurance recipients at
baseline were found to experience larger positive effects. The report concluded "that the benefits of
Project GATE exceed its costs," and "DOL should initiate a new self-employment training program
similar to Project GATE in all states." The Department of Labor recently funded a new round of GATE
programs in three new states and one previous state "because of the success of the original Project
GATE" (U.S. Department of Labor 2010).
     However, the final evaluation report made several methodological decisions with which we disagree.
It excludes business partnerships between treatment and control group members (120 members), reports
estimates for several business outcomes that condition on post-treatment ownership status, does not
sufficiently address differential attrition between the treatment and control groups (treated subjects were
4-5 percentage points more likely to complete the follow-up surveys), relies on several estimates that may
suffer from recall bias, and uses a hot-deck procedure to impute missing values for outcome measures.


                                                    2
additional heterogeneous treatment effects and their implications for whether and why markets

fail for specific reasons and thereby justify training subsidies.

    Our estimates of average treatment effects across the entire sample suggest that GATE had

limited impacts on ultimate outcomes. GATE significantly increased the likelihood of business

ownership at 6-months (5pp on a base of 0.36) but not thereafter. 4 There is a more modest

increase in overall employment at 6-months (3pp), suggesting some substitution between self-

employment and wage/salary employment. We find no evidence, however, of average treatment

effects on other outcomes, including measures of business performance, household income, and

work satisfaction at any horizon (6-, 18-, or 60-months). We also show that the estimates are not

overly sensitive to reasonable assumptions about how attrition affects the composition of the

treatment vs. control groups. Overall, the only significant full-sample average treatment effects,

across a very large number of tests are on 6-month business ownership and 6-month employment

status.

    These null effect estimates on more ultimate outcomes are not simply due to a weak

treatment (lack of compliance, quality, intensity, etc.). We find that the GATE assignment to

treatment produced a 136 percent short-term increase and a 45 percent long-term increase in the

amount of training received. Recipients reported the training as useful in follow-up surveys, and

the treatment group was 11-13 percentage points more likely to create a business plan and 2-6

percentage points more likely to start a business than the control group.

    We also provide novel results on heterogeneous treatment effects, using these interactions to

shed light on the empirical importance of various rationales offered for training subsidies. Credit

constraints are one rationale offered for training subsidies: if training is valuable but potential

 The point estimates fall from 5pp at the 6-month follow-up, to 2pp at the 18-month follow-up, to 0-1pp
at the 60-month follow-up.

                                                  3
recipients lack the liquidity to pay for it, offering low-cost training may be a cost-effective way

(compared to, say, subsidizing lending) to improve access. Training may also improve access by

providing information, special training, and assistance in finding capital. Labor market

discrimination is a second rationale for training subsidies: if minorities face greater

discrimination from employers than from customers or lenders, then subsidizing training may be

a relatively efficient method of helping minorities overcome barriers to starting businesses and

avoid future discrimination in the labor market. A third rationale for training subsidies is human

and managerial capital constraints: if education or managerial labor markets do not function well,

then low-cost training may improve efficiency or efficiently redistribute to the most-affected

parties. Unemployment insurance frictions are a fourth rationale for training subsidies: training

may be a relatively efficient way to insure against job loss by providing recipients with

incentives to work by creating a job for themselves (and perhaps others).

   We do not find evidence supporting the credit constraint, discrimination, and human capital

constraint arguments. We do find limited support for the unemployment insurance friction

hypothesis: the GATE treatment effect on business ownership at 6-months is significantly greater

for those who were initially unemployed compared with those who were employed at baseline.

But, we do not find any other evidence of relatively strong effects for the unemployed, nor do we

find any evidence of lasting effects for the unemployed.

   The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides more details on GATE,

including its research design and implementation, the nature of the training services received by

subjects, and GATE’s average impacts on business planning and starts. Section 3 presents our

results on more ultimate outcomes of interest, distributional effects on business size, compliance

and local average treatment effects, non-experimental estimates, and a bounds analysis



                                                4
addressing differential attrition. This section also presents estimates of heterogeneous treatment

effects to test hypotheses about the (redistributive) efficiency of self-employment training.

Section 4 concludes.



2. The Growing America through Entrepreneurship (Project GATE) Experiment

A. Evaluation and Treatment Design

    Growing America through Entrepreneurship (Project GATE) was an evaluation designed and

implemented by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Small Business Association. The GATE

experiment is the largest-ever randomized evaluation of entrepreneurship training and assistance

involving more than four thousand participants. It differs from earlier large-scale evaluations in

the United States because its training was marketed to any individual interested in starting or

growing a business, and not limited to individuals receiving unemployment or welfare benefits.5

    GATE was administered between September 2003 and July 2005 in seven cities of varying

sizes: Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Duluth, Minnesota; Virginia, Minnesota;

Portland, Maine; Lewiston, Maine; and Bangor, Maine (see Bellotti et al. 2006 for more details).

Both urban and rural populations were served by the sites. Fourteen different organizations

provided the GATE training, including SBA-funded Small Business Development Centers and

non-profit community-based organizations.6 All of the providers and their programs had been




5
  Demonstration programs in Washington and Massachusetts starting in 1989, and Self-Employment
Assistance programs in several states starting in 1993, targeted unemployment insurance recipients. The
Self-Employment Investment Demonstration, implemented from 1988 to 1992 in five states, targeted
AFDC recipients.
6
  The Aspen Institute lists more than 750 non-profit programs providing training, technical assistance,
and/or loans to entrepreneurs in the United States. SBDCs exist in all 50 states, and more than one million
small businesses and entrepreneurs utilize these resources. The SBA provided $128 million in FY 2009 in
grant funding for these programs.

                                                    5
operating prior to the experiment, and thus collectively represent the existing market for

entrepreneurship training in the United States.

   Training providers marketed GATE to a broad group of potential entrepreneurs with an

extensive campaign that included public service announcements, paid advertisements, and flyers

and posters at One-Stop Career Centers. Individuals interested in receiving training had to first

attend an orientation meeting at one of the 21 participating One-Stop Career Centers in the seven

GATE cities. Anyone attending the orientation meeting was then eligible to apply for GATE by

completing a nine-page application form with questions on demographics, work and business

experience, and the individual’s current business or new business idea.          Applicants were

informed that “GATE does not have space for everyone” and that a “lottery or random drawing

will decide whether you will be able to enter the program.”

   Program coordinators reviewed applications for completeness and then randomly assigned all

complete applications to the treatment or control group with equal probability. The treatment

group was offered an array of free services. Program administrators informed the control group

that the GATE program did not have the capacity to offer them services, and administrators

offered no referrals to other (free) services either. Individuals in both groups were notified that

they would be mailed follow-up surveys in 6, 18, and 60 months.

   The array of GATE services offered to the treatment group began with a one-on-one

assessment meeting to determine an individual’s specific training needs. Then training was

provided by experienced business consultants in classroom and/or one-on-one settings.

Classroom offerings targeted a variety of general and specialized topics at different experience




                                                  6
levels. 7 One-on-one counseling was designed to provide advice that was customized to the

individual’s experience, capability, circumstances, and opportunities. GATE “training” was

always offered as this bundle/menu of services, and hence we cannot disentangle the effects of

its different components. The total cost of providing training to GATE recipients was estimated

to be $1,321 per person.



B. Sample Characteristics and External Validity

    For the study, 4,197 individuals completed the application process and were randomly

assigned to the treatment (N=2,094) or control (N=2,103) group. Among participants, 19 percent

were self-employed and 39 percent were receiving unemployment insurance (U.I.) benefits at the

time of the application. GATE participants do not differ substantially from the U.S. self-

employed population in demographic characteristics such as race, nativity, gender, age, and

education (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010). Given these characteristics and GATE’s mass

marketing, GATE treatment effects plausibly apply to a broad population of entrepreneurs and

potential entrepreneurs who are interested in training. GATE’s filters, which included attending

the orientation session and completing the application, imply that its external validity is

questionable for populations more marginally interested in training; e.g., for those who would

only participate if some other benefit was conditioned on participation or if particularly

aggressive marketing techniques were employed.

    The training and providers in the GATE experiment are representative of the current market

for entrepreneurship training. As noted above, GATE training was provided by 14 different

SBDCs and CBOS, which are the primary providers of subsidized self-employment training in

 Introductory courses cover subjects such as legal structure, business plans, and marketing. Intermediate
and advanced courses cover subjects including managing growth, legal risks, and personnel issues. More
specialized courses covered, e.g., accounting, information technology, and web-based businesses.

the United States. These providers and their programs existed prior to the experiment, and the

sites participating in GATE are located across rural and urban areas (7 cities of varying sizes),

and 3 states.



C. Randomization Integrity and Differential Attrition

   Table 1 starts by comparing mean baseline characteristics across the treatment and control

groups. Random assignment was not stratified by site, but each site produced roughly 50-50

assignments nevertheless. Among the numerous baseline characteristics measured in the

application, only one, age, is statistically different between treatment and control. One would

expect to find one or two significant differences by chance, and the magnitude of the age

difference is small (< 1 year). In any case, when estimating treatment effects we present results

both without covariates as well as with controls for a large set of detailed baseline characteristics.

   Table 1 also compares treatment and control completion rates and baseline characteristics for

each of the three follow-up surveys. Control group members are significantly more likely to

attrit: the completion rate differs by 4-5 percentage points, on a base of 56-80 percent, for each

follow-up wave. However, despite differential attrition rates overall, we do not find differences

in the observable composition of the treatment versus control groups, based on characteristics

observed in the baseline. The number of significant differences is about what one would expect

to find by chance, and the magnitude of these differences is small. More formally, in a regression

of follow-up survey completion on baseline characteristics, treatment status, and baseline

characteristics interacted with treatment status, the F-tests on the interaction variable coefficients

have p-values of 0.214 for Wave 1, 0.823 for Wave 2, and 0.091 for Wave 3. Despite this




                                                  8
reassurance, we investigate how treatment effects might be biased if there is in fact differential

attrition (e.g., on unobservables) in Section 3.F below.



D. Empirical Strategy

    Our main specification for estimating average treatment effects uses simple means

comparisons or OLS intent-to-treat estimates, conditional on all of the baseline covariates shown

in Table 1. When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects we add a set of interactions

between baseline covariates and treatment assignment to the model.



E. Treatment Effects on Services Received, Business Planning, and Trying Business Ownership

    Given that the control group was not restricted from obtaining training elsewhere, it is

important to examine whether and how the GATE treatment actually changed the use of training

and business planning.

    Table 2 shows that the treatment group was an estimated 37 percentage points more likely to

receive any training in the 6 months following random assignment than the control group.8 The

first 6 months after random assignment was the most intensive period for receiving training, with

less training received during the subsequent 12 month period (i.e. between Wave 1 and Wave 2)

and the last 42 month period (i.e. between Wave 2 and Wave 3).

    The treatment group also received more than twice the number of hours of training by the

first follow-up wave. The difference in training received is 9 hours at Wave 1 and 8.5 hours



8
 Examining who receives entrepreneurship training, we find only a few characteristics that predict take-
up of training by each follow-up wave. Focusing on the main effects we find some evidence that African
Americans and the more educated are more likely to receive training (see Appendix Table 1). Examining
differential take up between the treatment and control groups, we find only a few significant differences.
F-tests for differential take up for all covariates do not reject equality in any of the three follow-up waves.

                                                      9
summing across waves.9 The extra hours of instructional time are likely to result in substantially

more "homework" time. Consider business planning as an example of one of the main types of

content that is covered in training. Although students learn or receive guidance in the classroom

or one-on-one counseling on how to write a business plan, the actual writing, research and

calculations for the business plan are done elsewhere, and thus not reported as “training” hours

(estimates reported below indicate that the treatment group is much more likely to write a

business plan than the control group). Among those who received any training, the treatment

group received on average 19.2 hours of training in the first 6 months, which is roughly two-

thirds the instructional time for a 5-unit college course over a quarter.

    Follow-up survey responses also indicate that GATE participants were satisfied with services

(Appendix Table 2). 51.7 percent of GATE recipients reported that “the overfull usefulness” of

the services received was “very useful”, with 33.7 percent responding “somewhat useful”. Most

recipients of GATE training responded that services helped “a lot” or “somewhat” with at least

one specific aspect of the business or business planning (e.g., marketing strategy, accounting,

networking, information technology). The treatment group reports greater satisfaction overall,

and for each of the training aspects, than control group trainees (who obtained non-GATE

training of their own accord). These responses, along with the experience, best-practice

approach, and scale of the service providers (e.g. the SBA-funded SBDCs), suggest that any null

effects are not due to low-quality training that is particular to GATE.

        Table 3 shows that GATE affected some business planning and practice outcomes as

well. Treated individuals were 13 percentage points more likely to have written a business plan

by Wave 1, and this difference persists over time. This translates, to a relatively small degree,


9
 Drexler et al. (2011) find substantial effects on business practices and outcomes from only a few hours
of extra training among microcredit users in the Dominican Republic.

                                                   10
into participants trying business ownership: there are significant differences in the likelihood of

of ever having owned a business of 4 and 5 percentage points at the 6- and 18-month follow-ups.

By 60-months the difference shrinks to 2.5 percentage points, with a p-value of 0.135. We do not

find any differences in loan applications, however, on a low base; e.g., only 6 percent of the

treatment and control groups applied for a business loan by Wave 1.



3. Treatment Effects on More Ultimate Outcomes

A. Average Effects on Business Ownership and Performance

     We start by examining the average impacts on business ownership at each follow-up wave.

Table 4 reports estimates. For the treatment group, 40.1 percent are self-employed business

owners at the 6-month follow-up survey. This rate of business ownership is 5.2 percentage points

higher (conditional on baseline covariates) than for the control group. At the 18-month follow-

up, the treatment effect point estimate remains positive, but the difference of 2.2 percentage

points is smaller (control group mean = 0.41) and no longer statistically significant. Sixty months

after random assignment, the treatment and control groups have nearly identical levels of

business ownership.10 The positive effects of entrepreneurship training on business ownership

appear to die out over time. 11 Confirming this interpretation, we find a similar decline in

treatment effects over time if we condition the sample in all waves to only those who respond to




10
   We also find very similar average total number of businesses owned between the treatment and control
groups over the 60-month sample period.
11
   The results are not due to the influence of side or casual businesses, or disguised unemployment (Carter
and Sutch 1994). Defining business ownership with 30 or more hours worked per week, we find lower
rates of business ownership, but similar treatment-control differences: the treatment group has a 4.2
percentage point higher rate of full-time business ownership than the control group at Wave 1, dropping
to 1.8 percentage points at Wave 2, and dropping to essentially zero at Wave 3. We also restrict business
ownership to only include businesses reporting positive sales at each survey wave to remove non-serious
self-employment activities. Again, we find similar results.

                                                    11
the Wave 3 survey. Thus, the pattern of estimated effects on business ownership is not due to

changes in sample composition.

     Before examining additional outcomes, we briefly examine treatment effects on the dynamics

of business entry and exit in Appendix Table 3. Given that the treatment and control groups start

with roughly equal ownership rates (Table 1), any differences in business ownership rates at each

of the follow-up survey waves are due to differences in business creation rates, differences in

business exit rates, or both.12 The second panel of Appendix Table 3 shows that, conditional on

not owning a business at baseline, treatment group members were far more likely to have started

a business 6 months later. This effect dissipates over time. The third panel of Appendix Table 3

shows that, conditional on owning a business at baseline, we do not find any significant

differences in exit rates. Thus the treatment effect is driven primarily by a difference in business

starts, not exits.

     Overall, the estimates indicate that entrepreneurship training increased average levels of

business ownership in the short-run. Entrepreneurship training appears to have drawn new

people into starting businesses but did not increase the survival rates of pre-existing businesses.13

     The effects of entrepreneurship training disappear in the long run, however. This implies that

the marginal businesses produced by entrepreneurship training do not survive in the

medium/long-run. 14 Indeed, examining the treatment effects on business sales and hiring


12
   See Evans and Leighton (1989), Fairlie (1999), and Carrasco (1999) for more discussion and empirical
estimates of the relationships between self-employment entry, exit and steady-state rates.
13
   Using information on start and stop dates for all businesses owned between survey dates, we find no
evidence of treatment effects on total length of time of business ownership. This finding contrasts with
the finding of longer business longevity found in the final evaluation report, however, that estimate of
business survival conditions on the first business started after random assignment (Benus et al. 2009).
14
   Treatment effects do not vary with local economic conditions. We estimate specifications that include
the unemployment rate, and treatment interacted with the unemployment rate (with unemployment
varying by MSA and year/month), and find no evidence of heterogeneity conditional on underlying
unemployment in the local economy.

                                                  12
employees (Table 4), we find no significant effects, suggesting that the marginal businesses had

low levels of sales and generally did not hire employees.

      The positive Wave 1 average treatment effect on short-run business ownership is not

accompanied by positive average treatment effects on business sales or the likelihood of having

an employee. Nor do we find significant treatment effects on sales or employees at longer

horizons. Note that these results do not condition on business ownership, and thus capture the

treatment’s overall impact on sales and hiring employees. The results for employment do not

differ when we change the focus from having an employee to the number of employees

(Appendix Table 4). Results are similar for other measures of business performance such as

profits and a summary index that standardizes and aggregates across several measures of

business size and success (Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007). These estimates are also reported in

Appendix Table 4.15



B. Effects on Firm Size Distribution?

      Next we explore whether the average treatment effect analysis might obscure important

effects on the firm size distribution. In particular, training may have spurred the creation of a few

very successful businesses which may have in turn led to large local economic impacts. We

focus here on long-run (Wave 3: 60-month) outcomes, for treatment vs. control, and for both all

businesses and businesses started post-treatment.

      We start by simply examining the distribution of sales and employment for businesses

created by the treatment and control groups in Table 5 (Columns 2, 3, 5 and 6). We also report

the unconditional distributions for all individuals in the treatment and control groups (Columns 1

and 4), but note that the differences in the distributions between treatment and control groups are

15
     The business outcome summary index actually shows a small negative treatment effect in the long-run.

                                                     13
similar because the percent of individuals who do not own a business is essentially the same for

the 60-month follow-up. Both the sales and employee distributions show that our sample has

fewer large businesses than the United States as a whole. This is partly due to the five-year study

period: the distributions are more similar when we compare our sample to U.S. businesses

created in the past 5 years (Column 8). Focusing on the treatment vs. control comparisons, we do

not find that businesses created by the treatment group are more likely to be very successful than

businesses created by the control group. In fact, we find that a higher percentage of businesses

owned by the control group have sales of $500,000 or more. The treatment-control difference,

however, is less clear when we focus on other sales level cutoffs or on high levels of

employment. We do not find a significant difference between the full treatment and control

distributions reported in Table 5 using a chi-square test.

     To more formally test whether average treatment effects hide important differential effects

across the distribution of sales, we also estimate regressions for the probability of creating

businesses at various cutoffs above $100,000 and 10 employees using the full Wave 3 sample.16

We find no treatment effects at any of these cutoffs (results not reported in tables, but available

upon request). Finally, we estimate quantile regressions for sales and employees starting with the

75th percentile and incrementing up by 5 percentile points to the 95th percentile. Again, we find

no evidence of treatment effects at any of these quantiles. Overall, we do not find evidence that

entrepreneurship training increased the likelihood of creating high-revenue or high-employment

firms five years post-random assignment.




16
  For example, the dependent variable equals 1 if the person owns a business with sales of $100,000 or
more and zero otherwise; i.e., the zero group includes non-business owners and low-sales business
owners.

                                                   14
C. Average Effects on Earnings from the Business

        Although business earnings and income are more difficult to measure precisely, we also

estimate treatment effects on these outcomes. The follow-up surveys provide information on 1)

how much the owner paid him/herself in regular salary from the business, and 2) how much the

owner received in other income payments such as bonuses, profit distributions, or owner's draw

from the business. Information is also available on the start and stop dates of all of the businesses

owned between each survey wave. Although there is a fair amount of missing information, these

measures can be combined to estimate the total earnings and income from all businesses owned

between survey waves.17 Appendix Table 4 reports estimates. We find no evidence of positive

treatment effects. In fact, the point estimates for treatment effects for all three waves are

negative.

        Another method for measuring business earnings that reduces problems with missing

values and recall bias is to use only the most recently owned business (including businesses

owned at the survey date). Appendix Table 4 reports estimates. Using this measure we also do

not find any evidence of positive treatment effects.

        In contrast to these results, the final evaluation report for Project GATE (Benus et al.

2009) found positive estimates for total business earnings except for Wave 1, and a total

treatment/control difference of $1,128 from combining all waves (although not statistically

significant). The positive benefit/cost conclusion reached in the final evaluation report essentially

hinges on this finding and the finding of 170 more full-time jobs created by the treatment

group.18 Our analysis of the GATE Project data, however, provides no evidence of a positive


17
   Among study participants reporting owning a business between survey waves, we find that 16 to 21
percent are missing a value for at least one component needed to calculate total business earnings.
18
   The actual estimated benefit/cost to society calculated in the report is $-1,891, but arguments are made
that underreporting of business earnings could make the estimated positive business earnings effect larger,

                                                    15
business earnings treatment effect (in fact the point estimates for each wave are negative) or

evidence of positive effects on hiring employees. Although we cannot replicate the analysis

conducted in the report to identify the exact causes of the discrepancy, we suspect that the hot-

deck imputations, exclusion of treatment/control partnerships, and sample weighting procedure

are each partly responsible.19



D. Average Effects on Overall Employment, Household Income, and Work Satisfaction

    Returning to Table 4, we also estimate treatment effects on broader outcomes: the likelihood

of being employed (wage/salary work or business ownership), household income, and work

satisfaction (which we use as a proxy for potential non-pecuniary benefits of employment or self-

employment). 20 The positive 6-month effect on employment suggests that the business

ownership effect does not fully crowd-out wage/salary work: the two point estimates (on

business ownership, and employment) suggest about 50 percent crowd-out. Similar to the

business ownership effect, the effect on overall employment dissipates over time. For income

and work satisfaction, we do not find significant effects at any horizon.21




and that higher treatment group job creation (which is not included in the calculation) could improve the
final benefit/cost estimate (Benus et al. 2009).
19
   The final evaluation report used a hot-deck procedure to impute all missing values for start and stop
dates and earnings from each business owned during the sample period. It also excluded all
treatment/control business partnerships, and used sample weighting procedures to adjust for non-response
to follow-up surveys. In sensitivity analysis presented in an appendix in the report, estimates of treatment
effects on total business earnings over the sample period became noticeably smaller when removing each
of these procedures (which were conducted separately, but not together).
20
   See, for example, Hamilton (2000) and Kawaguchi (2004).
21
   We also estimate treatment effects on total earnings by combining separately reported business earnings
and wage/salary earnings (as opposed to direct reports of total household income). We do not find any
significant treatment effects on this measure either. Nor do we find any significant effects on reliance on
public assistance.

                                                    16
E. Compliance and Local Average Treatment Effects

    To gauge how much larger treatment estimates are when estimating the effects of receiving

entrepreneurship training (i.e. “treatment-on-the-treated” or local average treatment effects),

instead of estimating the effects of being offered free entrepreneurship training (i.e. “intent-to-

treat” effects), we estimate instrumental variables regressions. As reported in Table 2, 18.8

percent of the treatment group did not receive any entrepreneurship training in the first 6 months

after random assignment, and 44.0 percent of the control group received at least some

entrepreneurship training in the 6 months after random assignment. To account for both types of

non-compliance and estimate the effects of receiving entrepreneurship training on business

outcomes, we estimate the following two-stage regression. The first-stage regression for the

probability of receiving any entrepreneurship training is:

(3.1) Ei = ω + γXi + πTi + ui.

The second-stage regression for the outcome of interest, y, is:

                      ෡ i + ε i,
(3.2) yi = α + βXi + ΔE

                                                                           ෡i is the predicted value
where Xi includes baseline characteristics, Ti is the treatment indicator, E

of entrepreneurship training from (3.1), and ui and εi are error terms. Δ provides an estimate of

the local average treatment effect (LATE).

    The IV estimates are reported in Appendix Table 5 for the six main outcomes reported in

Table 4. As expected given the non-compliance rates, the point estimates are generally scaled up

by a factor of 2 to 3 over the “intent-to-treat” estimates reported in Table 4. None of our

statistical inferences change. The LATE estimates indicate that receiving entrepreneurship

training increases business ownership by 13.5 percentage points and overall employment by 7

percentage points at Wave 1. There is no strong evidence of effects on long-term business


                                                17
ownership or other outcomes. Because most of the ITT estimates are close to zero the "scaled

up" LATE estimates also tend to be close to zero.

   Appendix Table 5 also reports estimates of non-experimental correlations between receiving

entrepreneurship training and our key outcomes, to compare to the LATE estimates. For these

regressions we include only the control group sample, and control for the rich set of baseline

characteristics reported in Table 1. For most of the business outcomes, we find large and positive

significant conditional correlations with entrepreneurship training. These estimates, which may

be subject to selection bias, are substantially larger and more likely to be statistically significant

than the LATE estimates from the experiment. They demonstrate the potential problems with

estimating the effects of entrepreneurship training using non-experimental data. Even with

detailed controls for baseline household income level, self-employment status, health problems,

work experience in a family business, credit history, unemployment insurance receipt, employer-

provided health insurance, personality traits, and standard demographic controls, non-

experimental estimates may be strongly upwardly biased.



F. Exploring the Impact of Differential Attrition on the Estimates

   Although we do not find strong evidence of differential attrition based on observables in

Section 2.C above, or that treatment effect estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of controls for

baseline characteristics (Table 4), follow-up survey response rates are higher in the treatment

group for each of the follow-up waves, raising the concern that attrition may be correlated with

unobserved heterogeneity in outcomes as well. To investigate whether differential attrition might

have a large effect on the results we follow two different approaches. First, we estimate

regressions for our main set of outcomes using the predicted probability of attrition as a sample

weight. The full set of baseline controls are used to estimate these predicted probabilities. This

                                                 18
technique places more weight on survivors who look like attriters, in an attempt to compensate

for the attriters’ absence. The estimates are robust to using these weights (Table 6 vs. Table 4).

   Second, we conduct a bounds analysis using various assumptions about the treatment effects

for attriters, in the spirit of Horowitz and Manski (2000) and Lee (2002; 2009). Table 7’s

Column 4 reproduces the relevant average treatment effect estimate from Table 4. Following

Kling et al. (2007) and Karlan and Valdivia (2011), we impute to the lower (upper) bound the

mean minus (plus) a specified standard deviation multiple of the observed treatment group

distribution to the non-responders in the treatment group, and the mean plus (minus) the same

standard deviation multiple of the observed control group distribution to non-responders in the

control group. In Column 3, for example, we create a conservative treatment effect estimate by

assuming that treatment group attriters have the mean value for the dependent variable minus

0.05 standard deviations among non-attriting treatment observations, and that the control group

attriters have the mean value for the dependent variable plus 0.05 standard deviations among the

non-attriting control observations.

   Table 7 indicates that the results are not overly sensitive to adding and subtracting 0.05

standard deviations from the means, but are sensitive to moving 0.25 standard deviations from

the means (Columns 1 and 7). To put the magnitudes of these changes in perspective, Table 7

also reports the treatment and control standard deviations in Columns 8 and 9, respectively (the

treatment and control means are reported in Table 4). For business ownership at Wave 1, for

example, the -0.05 adjustment reported in Column 4 assumes that the attriting treatment group

has a 2.5 percentage point lower business ownership rate than the non-attriting treatment sample

and that the attriting control group has a 2.4 percentage point higher business ownership rate than




                                                 19
the non-attriting control sample. These are large changes from a base business ownership rate of

roughly 35 to 40 percent and yet do not result in major changes in the results.22

     If we focus on the disappearance of the 5 percentage point short-run treatment effect by the

60 month follow-up survey, we find it would take an extreme form of biased attrition to

regenerate the treatment effect in the long run. For the treatment effect to be 5 percentage points

at the 60-month follow-up it would require that the attritors in the treatment group have more

than a 0.10 standard deviation higher business ownership rate than non-attritors and attritors in

the control group have more than a 0.10 standard deviation lower business ownership rate than

non-attritors.

     Columns 5-7 of Table 7 also show the particular and strong form that attrition would need to

take to create positive effects on outcomes other than short-run business ownership and

employment. It would have to be the case that treatment group attritors have substantially more

positive treatment effects, and/or that control group attritors have substantially more negative

treatment effects, than non-attritors. In all, the results in Tables 6 and 7 suggest that attrition

would have to be particularly strongly correlated with treatment effects to change inferences

based on our main results.



G. Hypothesis Testing Based on Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

     To shed light on various rationales for training subsidies, we next explore heterogeneous

treatment effects in the data. We estimate these effects by adding several interactions between

key baseline characteristics and treatment status to our model of conditional average treatment

effects (i.e., we estimate each heterogeneous effect of interest conditional on the others). Table


22
  We also estimate bounds using the trimming procedure suggested in Lee (2002, 2009). The estimated
range is similar to that reported for 0.10 standard deviations for most outcome measures.

                                                20
8A reports estimates for our main outcomes. Each row presents results from a single regression.

We also estimate average treatment effects on sub-samples of key groups to address the policy

question of whether training benefits targeted groups in levels if not relative terms (Table 8B).

     Credit/liquidity constraints are one important rationale for training subsidies: constraints may

prevent potential entrepreneurs from obtaining training, even if training is valuable. 23

Alternatively, or possibly additionally, training may help recipients relax liquidity constraints by

helping them find alternative sources of financing (e.g., microlenders, SBA lenders, Community

Development Financial Institutions, etc.) and navigate application processes. Part of the

coursework and counseling in entrepreneurship training is devoted to providing information and

assistance in finding capital. If either of these mechanisms is in play, then we might expect

subsidized training to have (relatively) strong, positive effects on the credit constrained,

conditional on other characteristics.

     Our measure of baseline credit constraints comes from the application question: “Do you

have any problems with your credit history?” We construct a dummy that takes a value of 1 for

the 44 percent of the sample that responded “yes”, and either interact this dummy with treatment

status (Table 8A, Column 2) or limit the sample to those with credit problems (Table 8B,

Column 1). We do not find evidence that training has positive effects on the credit constrained:

across the two tables we find only one significant point estimate out of 36 (for business

ownership in Wave 1). We also estimate whether entrepreneurship training differentially affects

the level of invested capital in the business for those with credit problems. We do not find any

evidence that training affects investment, debt, or loan applications, overall or differentially for

the credit constrained (results not shown in tables).


23
  See Parker (2009) and Kerr and Nanda (2011) for recent reviews of the literature on credit constraints
for entrepreneurs.

                                                   21
     Labor market discrimination is another potential rationale for training subsidies: if employers

discriminate more than customers, then low-cost training may be a relatively efficient method for

redistributing to affected groups. 24 Entrepreneurship training may allow minority and female

entrepreneurs to overcome other barriers to starting businesses and get a foothold in business

ownership, where discrimination limiting future success might be less than in the labor market.

We include interactions for minority and female in Table 8A, Columns 3 and 4, and estimate

separate regressions for minority and female subsamples in Table 8B, Columns 2 and 3. We do

not find evidence that training has relatively strong or lasting effects for minorities or women. In

fact, treatment effects on business ownership are significantly lower for women at 6- and 18-

months, producing main effects on business ownership for the female sub-sample that are not

statistically significant (Table 8B, Column 3).

     Human and managerial capital constraints are another important rationale for training

subsidies: if education or managerial labor markets do not function well, then subsidizing

training may improve efficiency or efficiently redistribute to the most-affected parties. Self-

employment training may be especially helpful to those lacking the main human capital factors

found to be associated with business success in the previous literature: education, previous

managerial experience, and previous experience working in a family business. 25 However,

estimates reported in Table 8A, Columns 5-7 and Table 8B, Columns 4-6, do not provide

evidence that training has relatively lasting or strong effects on those with less education, less

previous managerial experience, or less experience working in a family business.




24
   See Borjas and Bronars (1989) and Fairlie and Robb (2008) for a discussion of customer and other
forms of discrimination against minority business owners, and Altonji and Blank (1999) for a review of
the larger literature on racial and gender discrimination in the labor market.
25
   See Parker (2009), Fairlie and Robb (2008), and van Praag (2005) for reviews of this literature.

                                                  22
     Unemployment insurance frictions are perhaps the most important, or at least most

commonly invoked, rationale for training subsidies. Entrepreneurship training may be a

relatively efficient way to insure against job loss by providing recipients with incentives to work

by creating a job for themselves (and perhaps others).26 We test this by interacting treatment

status with a measure of initial unemployment. We find that those who were initially

unemployed are more likely to have a business at the 6-month follow-up (Table 8A, Column 8

and Table 8B, Column 7). This effect disappears at later follow-ups, however: we find no effects

in the longer-run. Nor do we find any other evidence of strong or lasting effects for the

unemployed, in either relative (Table 8A) or absolute (Table 8B) terms. The results for the

unemployed do not change if we drop those who were business owners at baseline and examine

treatment effects relative to only those who were wage/salary workers.27



4. Conclusion

     Although a substantial amount of money is spent on subsidizing entrepreneurship training

around the world, we know very little about its effectiveness and whether it alleviates market

frictions. We provide new estimates on the average and heterogeneous treatment effects of


26
   Another explanation for why the unemployed may benefit more from job training is that they have
more time to devote to it. But we do not find any evidence that the unemployed (at baseline) receive more
or different training.
27
   We define the unemployed to include anyone who is not working in a wage/salary job or self-employed
at the time of application. Participating in the GATE program implies some level of interest in work, and
our definition facilitates a straightforward classification of the sample into the two main categories of
unemployment and employment (i.e. wage/salary work or self-employment). We find similar results
when using alternative definitions of unemployment. First, we estimate both sets of regressions using UI
recipients (which was used in the final evaluation report, Benus et al. 2009). Second, we estimate
regressions using a slightly more restrictive definition of unemployment to include only those "looking
for work" at the time of application. This is the definition used in Benus and Michaelides (2010), which
builds on the final evaluation report by shifting the focus from U.I. recipients to the unemployed. They
find stronger positive estimates of treatment effects for the unemployed than those reported for U.I.
recipients in the final evaluation report. Under any and all definitions, we find positive effects on business
ownership in the short-run, but no effects on any outcomes in the long run.

                                                     23
entrepreneurship training from Project GATE, the largest and broadest entrepreneurship training

experiment ever conducted. We find evidence that the training increased average business

ownership in the short-run, but that the marginal businesses were unsuccessful and failed to

produce tangible or subjective benefits at any of the three follow-up horizons (6-, 18-, and 60-

months). We also find no evidence that training shifts the distribution of firms in important ways

(e.g., by disproportionately creating very successful firms) that might be missed by analysis of

average treatment effects. Although we find higher attrition among the control group, bounds

analyses confirm that only extreme forms of biased attrition would change these results.

     Our analysis of treatment heterogeneity produces some novel insights about the theory and

design of training interventions. Many of the rationales put forward for subsidizing training—

countering credit or human capital constraints in enterprise development, or labor market

discrimination—are not borne out by the data. We do find evidence that GATE’s training had

relatively strong positive effects on business ownership for the unemployed in the short run, but

these effects disappear by the long run.

     In all, the absence of positive treatment effects across numerous measures of business

ownership, business performance and broader outcomes, and the estimated $1,321 per-recipient

cost of providing GATE training, suggests that entrepreneurship training may not be a cost-

effective method of addressing credit, human capital, discrimination, or social insurance

constraints. This conclusion contrasts with the positive benefit/cost conclusion reached in the

final evaluation report submitted to DOL, and with similarly positive arguments proffered by

advocates of state-level programs.28


28
  E.g., the New York Senate (2011) justified extending the SEA program by stating that it "has been extremely
successful in helping individuals who are likely to exhaust their regular unemployment insurance benefits to develop
and establish small businesses in New York…The success of this program is evident. Over 4,000 jobs have been
created and $16 million in state tax revenue has been generated at no cost to the state."

                                                        24
   Our results also speak to the importance of understanding which components of training are

more and less helpful, and for which populations. Should subsidies for entrepreneurship training

be re-allocated to job training? Should content from entrepreneurship training be grafted onto job

training? Are there groups thus far not identified for whom entrepreneurship training may be

beneficial in the longer run?

   Understanding more about the effects and mechanisms of entrepreneurship training is

particularly important given the continued growth and popularity of these programs around the

world. Many financial institutions with a social aim now bundle business training with their

loans. As noted above, the Department of Labor recently funded a new round of GATE programs

in four additional states based on the findings from the GATE Project, and President Obama

recently signed the Small Business Jobs Act which expands funding to SBDCs throughout the

country. Individual states also continue to extend Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) programs

that were originally authorized by Congress in 1993 and made permanent in 1997.

Notes: (1) The wave 1, wave 2 and wave 3 surveys are conducted at 6, 18, and 60
months after time of application. (2) Treatment‐contol differences with
covarariates are estimated from a linear probability model that controls for
program sites, female, race, immigrant, age, married, children, education level,
household income, self‐employed at application, health problems, worked in
family business, bad credit history, unemployment compensation, employer
provided health insurance, autonomy, and risk tolerance. (3) Sample weights
used to estimate treatment‐control differences are predicted probabilities of
non‐response in specified wave from first‐stage regression using all covariates.

Notes: (1) See Table 4 for sample sizes. (2) Columns (1) and (7) impute to the lower (upper) bound the mean minus (plus) 0.25
standard deviations of the observed treatment distribution to the non‐responders in the treatment group and the mean plus
(minus) 0.25 standard deviations of the observed control distribution to non‐responders in the control group. Columns (2, 3, 5,
and 6) repeat the exercise subtracting and adding the specified standard deviations. Column 4 (unadjusted) reproduces the
estimates reported in Table 4.

model that controls for program sites, female, race, immigrant, age, married, children, education level,
household income, self‐employed at application, health problems, worked in family business, bad credit
history, unemployment compensation, employer provided health insurance, autonomy, and risk tolerance.
(3) The business outcome index is an equally weighted average of z‐scores from sales, any employees,
number of employees, and profits. Z‐scores are calculated by subtracting the control group mean and
dividing by the control group standard deviation.
