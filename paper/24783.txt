                                            ABSTRACT

We provide a model of self-selection by candidates in a probabilistic voting environment to shed light
on the forces shaping the quality of politicians from both the supply and demand sides of politics.
The model highlights that the patterns of selection and the comparative statics of politician quality
depend critically on how the costs of running for office vary for candidates with different qualities.
The model offers predictions on how the quality of the political class will vary with key parameters
pertaining to both the supply and demand for candidates. We use the model to frame a review of the
empirical literature on political selection that has emerged in the last two decades. We contrast areas
where significant progress has been made with others where important theoretical predictions remain
untested or existing evidence does not allow a consensus, highlighting areas for future research.

1       Introduction
The last two decades have witnessed the development of a vibrant new literature in economics
and political science focused on political selection. This literature has investigated how
various features of the sociopolitical environment shape the quality of the political class.
This has not been an idle pursuit given two important facts. First, there is evidence that
political leaders matter for policy outcomes at all levels, including the national executive
(Jones and Olken 2005; Besley, Montalvo, and Reynal-Querol 2011), national legislators
(Lee, Moretti, and Butler 2004; Washington 2008; Clots-Figueras 2012), and local politicians
(Pande 2003; Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004; Meyersson 2014). Second, societies appear to
vary in their ability to select politicians with desirable traits like education.1 These two facts
prompt the question of what forces shape the quality of the political class. In this paper, we
review what we have learned about those forces after almost two decades of research.
    “Quality” is of course a loaded term. Theoretical work in political economy often dis-
tinguishes between ideological differences among politicians, and differences in “valence,”
understood as features that voters value positively regardless of ideology, such as charisma,
competence, or integrity. We will refer to quality and valence interchangeably to indicate
performance-relevant traits like competence or integrity.
    A brief review of the theoretical work involving candidates with valence seems to indicate
an open gap. In particular, we are missing a workhorse model of the determinants of the
quality of politicians that uses a standard probabilistic voting setting to capture partisan
competition (as in the textbook treatment by Persson and Tabellini (2000)), while considering
candidates of varying valence making entry decisions. In this paper, we propose a simple
model of political selection and then use it to guide a review of the empirical evidence on
what factors tend to produce politicians of higher quality.
    We consider a probabilistic voting world with candidates from two rival social groups who
must decide whether to pay a cost to run for office. Candidates care about winning per se and
may differ in their valence. Since valence is observable and valuable to voters, higher valence
gives candidates an electoral edge. Candidates learn their valence before running, and decide
whether to run under uncertainty about the realized valence of the opponent. While valence
does not affect the valuation of holding office, we distinguish between cases where the costs
of running do not vary with valence (arguably the case if valence is about honesty) and when
they do (arguably the case if valence is a form of competence that yields a higher market
income that must be forgone when running). The model distinguishes between parameters
belonging to the supply side of politics, such as rewards from office and the available range of
qualities among would-be candidates, and parameters belonging to the demand side, such as
the size and partisanship of both groups, the distance between their preferences (an inverse
of political competition), and the intensity with which voters care about valence as opposed
to group allegiance.
    We find that the cost structure is crucial. When the cost of running does not vary with
valence, it is the relatively high quality types who run, encouraged by their better electoral
    1
    For example, in Figure 1 we show how national legislators differ in terms of their educational attainment
across countries. See also Best and Cotta (2000) for a comparative analysis within Europe.


                                                     1
prospects. When the cost of running rises fast enough with valence, the pattern reverses and
it is the relatively low quality types who run, as they face lower costs. As a result, some of
the comparative statics on candidate quality switch signs depending on which cost structure
prevails. In addition, we find that while supply-side parameters tend to affect candidate
quality in the same way across both parties, changes in demand-side parameters will affect
opposing parties differently. We also use the model to elucidate how the study of the drivers
of quality of elected politicians differs from that of candidates. Finally, we point out ways in
which the model could be extended to analyze issues of accountability and party organization.
     We take the main assumptions and comparative static predictions from our theory and
examine what the empirical literature has to say about them. In particular, we begin by
examining two key assumptions in the model: 1) that the rewards from office are positive;
and 2) that voters care about valence.
     The empirical literature supports both assumptions. In addition to any official salary a
politician may receive, the benefits to political office can come in many other forms. There
is considerable empirical evidence that the pecuniary returns to holding office can include
such things as private-sector opportunities, both during and after leaving office, as well as
unofficial earnings, both legal and otherwise. In contrast, the evidence on any non-pecuniary
benefits is practically non-existent. Given the difficulties in measuring non-financial motives,
we are largely left to infer the existence of these benefits through model-based approaches.
Also, voters do seem to care about valence, whether characterized as honesty, competence,
or charisma. The literature has not yet been able to isolate the effects of any one individual
trait.
     We also examine three main comparative-static predictions from the model under different
cost structures: 1) the impact of the benefits to office; 2) the impact of political competition;
and 3) the impact of group size and cohesion.
     If costs are increasing with valence and parties are not too asymmetric, the model predicts
that higher expected benefits of holding office will induce higher quality individuals to run
for office, all else equal. Conversely, if costs are constant, an increase in benefits will lower
the quality of the candidate pool. Interestingly, the empirical evidence can go in either
direction depending on the nature of the benefit. When the benefit involves an increase in
official salaries, the evidence suggests that the quality of the applicant pool increases, which
is consistent with candidates facing steeply increasing costs of running. But if instead the
benefit involves an increase in the opportunity to engage in more rent seeking, then studies
tend to show a decrease in the quality of the applicant pool, which is consistent with a
constant cost structure. The theory can help to rationalize these two disparate findings if the
nature of the benefits is creating selection along different dimensions of valence. On the one
hand, higher wages attract more competent individuals, who are also likely to have better
outside options. On the other hand, an increase in the opportunity to be corrupt attracts
less honest types, and running costs are unlikely to vary with a person’s level of honesty.
     The second prediction of the model involves political competition. Whether and how
political competition helps candidate quality again depends on the cost structure. If costs
are constant competition helps quality in the strong party while hurting quality in the weak
party, but if costs are increasing candidates in the weak party get better without those in

                                               2
the strong party being affected. Here, the majority of the evidence shows a strong positive
association between the competitiveness of a district and the quality of the elected official.
    It is important to note, however, that the prediction is on quality of the candidate pool,
and the only empirical evidence we have in the literature is for elected politicians. Despite its
simplicity, the model has less to say about the drivers of quality for the elected politicians.
When it comes to the comparative statics on the elected, changes in the model’s parameters
will set into action various countervailing forces that render the predictions generally am-
biguous. Under some restrictions, certain predictions are possible: if costs are increasing and
parties are relatively even in their electoral appeal, an increase in rewards from office will
increase the quality of elected politicians. This is what the empirical literature tends to find.
    The final prediction involves the effect of group size and cohesion on the quality of the
candidate pool. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence has little to say on this matter. We are
unaware of any studies that have examined the relationship between group size and cohesion
on the quality of the candidate pool. There are, however, a few recent papers that examine
the effects on quality of the elected. More research is needed before a clear pattern can
emerge.
    In summary, the empirical literature is in its infancy, and still learning to speak. Data and
identification challenges mean we actually know very little about our politicians. We know
some general characteristics of those who get elected, such as their gender, age, education,
and previous occupation. But for those who are not elected, we typically only know little
more than their names, and this makes it difficult to study the supply and demand factors
that determine political selection. In addition, valence can mean many things, and as we
have highlighted, both the theory and empirics depend on how we define it. To achieve a
deeper understanding of political selection, we need to go beyond the standard proxies for
quality, such as education. Access to administrative data and primary data collection will
be key steps in this direction.
    Identification remains a significant challenge. Nobody (who we know of) gets randomly
assigned to become a politician, nor are the reasons why people become politicians typi-
cally determined at random. As a result, endogeneity and omitted variable bias are ever
present concerns. However, in much the same way that randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
have revolutionized empirical work in other fields, the regression discontinuity design has
transformed political economy. Since Lee (2008), there have been many studies using close
elections to determine important questions such as whether female leaders matter, whether
financial returns to political office exist, or whether policy converges across parties. As we
will document below, the empirical literature has spoken loudest on the questions that lend
themselves to a regression discontinuity design approach, whether it be in the use of close
elections or in the evaluation of a policy rule that is applied discontinuously but based on a
continuous eligibility criterion.
    However, there are well known limitations to the RDD approach. As has been noted
before, this design produces treatment effects that are localized, which makes comparative
analysis more difficult even among studies in the same setting. Moreover, not all questions
lend themselves to such convenient variation, and many of them deserve more empirical in-
vestigation, even if it falls short of quasi-experimental standards. In these circumstances,

                                               3
theory–the ultimate form of pre-analysis–acquires even higher value as a guide to interpreta-
tion.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief review of
the models with valence. This will help situate our model in the literature and highlight its
contributions. We present our model in Section 3, followed by a discussion of the relevant
empirical literature in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion of some of the
key open empirical and theoretical questions on this exciting topic within political economy.


2       A brief review of models where candidates differ in
        valence
There are a number of papers featuring models where candidates differ in their valence. We
group these into roughly five strands of research.
    Downsian politics and policy platforms The earliest strand involves Downsian pol-
itics; as such, these models aimed to understand whether existing differences in valence
push platforms toward or away from the median voter. Some of the earliest contributions
to this literature are those by Londregan and Romer (1993), Adams (1999), Ansolabehere
and Snyder (2000), Groseclose (2001), Aragones and Palfrey (2002), and Schofield (2003).
More recently, Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita (2009), Bernhardt, Câmara, and Squintani
(2011), Hummel (2013), and Kamada and Sugaya (2014) have added to that literature. This
strand of research tends to abstract from candidate entry.2
    Agency and screening A second strand of the literature features models in which
politicians have private information about their underlying type and can use this information
to extract rents while in office. Voters use elections as a way to both select and discipline
politicians. But to the extent that reelection incentives force politicians to act according to
voters’ preferences while in office, it also makes it harder for voters to tell apart different
types of politicians just by observing their record. Papers in this line include Banks and
Sundaram (1993), Fearon (1999), Besley (2004) and Smart and Sturm (2013), and although
they provide insights into the effects electoral accountability may have on political selection,
these models tell us less about how entry decisions may be affected differently for different
types of candidates.
    Agency and self-selection A third strand of research focuses more on candidate self-
selection decisions and derives propositions for the quality of politicians. The emphasis is
usually on how the quality of politicians responds to various elements of the sociopolitical
system, such as compensation in office, opportunity costs from private life, party governance,
the prevalence of the rule of law and more generally the threats and opportunities, legal or
illegal, of a public life. Papers in this strand include Dal Bó and Di Tella (2003), Caselli and
Morelli (2004), Messner and Polborn (2004), Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella (2006), Poutvaara
and Takalo (2007), Mattozzi and Merlo (2008), Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti, and Tabellini
    2
    Carter and Patty (2015) present a model in the Downsian tradition where candidates may abstain from
participating. However, their paper is not concerned with evaluating how candidate incentives, as shaped by
valence, affect self-selection decisions and ultimately the quality of politicians.


                                                    4
(2013) and Dal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017). While concerned with valence,
these papers, like those in the previous strand, tend to de-emphasize the partisan elements of
electoral competition. One resulting advantage is that these models help us to think about
several aspects that may be orthogonal to partisanship. The disadvantage is that they remain
limited in their ability to connect political selection to the more distinct aspects of electoral
competition, such as group conflict and partisan differences.
     Citizen-candidates Some of the papers in the third strand adopt the citizen-candidate
framework from Osborne and Slivinski (1996) and Besley and Coate (1997) but tend to
abstract from the ideological elements present in those papers. Conversely, the original
citizen-candidate work focused on ideology more than on valence: Osborne and Slivinski
(1996) abstracted from valence considerations altogether and Besley and Coate (1997) focused
on the efficiency of politician-policy combinations (which could involve valence) rather than
on how fundamentals shape the quality of politicians. More recently, Di Lonardo (2017)
produced a citizen-candidate model where candidates differ in valence. The main bulk of his
analysis abstracts from self-selection, as candidates do not know their own valence at the
time they decide to run. An extension considers privately informed candidates and examines
conditions for contested and uncontested election equilibria, and the link between candidate
ideology and valence.
     Social groups and parties A fifth strand of the literature, like the first, distinctly incor-
porates the electoral dimension without the same concern for Downsian policy determination.
In some of this work, candidate quality is totally random rather than shaped by self-selection
decisions, as in Banerjee and Pande (2009) who study ethnicity-driven politics; other work
tends to place parties instead of candidates as the key strategic actor. Models along these
lines include those by Carrillo and Mariotti (2001), Galasso and Nannicini (2011), Mattozzi
and Merlo (2015), Galasso and Nannicini (2017), and Besley, Folke, Persson, and Rickne
(2017). Placing the political party at center stage allows for important gains in understand-
ing the calculus of a fundamental actor of electoral democracies, but it usually comes at a
cost, namely detracting attention from candidate self-selection decisions.
     A review of these strands of work leaves us with a hole in the literature that seems worth
filling. Much of the work on agency models incorporates self-selection by candidates with
varying valence but abstracts from group and partisan dimensions. Conversely, much of the
work outside of agency theory looks at partisan differences, but eschews self-selection on
valence. In the next section we introduce a model that combines both aspects through a
simple, textbook-style probabilistic voting model à la Persson and Tabellini (2000).


3     Valence differentials and candidate self-selection in a
      world with probabilistic voting: a simple model
3.1    Social fundamentals
There are two groups of voters j = r, l, (right and left) with respective measures ρ ∈ (0, 1)
and 1 − ρ. Voters elect a single leader. There are two groups of politicians (i.e., parties)

                                                5
representing groups r and l, each with measure 1.3 A politician from each party is randomly
recognized to be able to run, and that person must then decide whether to run or not.4
Politicians vary not only in their group affiliation, but also in terms of valence. A politician
has a valence vj drawn from a uniform distribution in the range [0, v̄j ] ; j = r, l, so we allow for
the two groups to have different valence ranges. A politician’s type is a pair (vj , j) , j = r, l,
and is observable to voters.

3.1.1    Voter preferences
Politicians are office motivated. Winning office confers a benefit b ≥ 1, whereas a politician
outside of office receives zero. Importantly, this model does not distinguish between legal
and illegal rewards from office.
   A voter i obtains a benefit from electing a leader of type (vj , j) given by

                                               $vj + I (j) δi ,

where $ > 0 tracks how much voters care about valence relative to partisan alignment, and
I (j) = 1 when j = r and is zero otherwise.
    The random shock δi captures an1 idiosyncratic  preference of voter i for
                                                                            candidate   r, and
                                              1                                    1         1
                                                
it is distributed uniformly in φ − 2R , φ + 2R among r voters and in −φ − 2L , −φ + 2L
among l voters. The parameter φ captures the preference distance between groups. As such,
                                                                                     1
it proxies for the degree of societal division. We assume φ > 0, and also φ − 2R       < 0 and
       1
−φ + 2L > 0, respectively guaranteeing that some r voters could vote for an l candidate and
that some l voters may support the r candidate. This implies that there will be some swing
voters who could be swayed even by small valence differentials. However, since φ > 0, in the
absence of valence differences l voters will tend to side with the l candidate, and r voters
with the r candidate. The parameters R, L track the importance of group affiliation for an
individual’s political preference, and can be seen to describe group cohesion, or partisanship.
    In this model, group membership is a candidate characteristic analogous to ideological
positioning. As in citizen-candidate models, this feature of the candidate is an ascribed
characteristic that cannot be altered. Once in office, the candidate will act like a member of
her group, and utility consequences for voters will follow. Differently from citizen-candidate
models, we focus on purely office-motivated candidates in order to isolate the self-selection
implications of valence.

3.1.2    Timing
Two candidates, one from each group, are recognized to run. Their valences are realized and
each candidate learns her own privately. Then each candidate decides whether to run. If one
   3
     The measure of politicians could be made smaller than that of voters for realism, but this is inessential,
as is the fact that politicians do not vote.
   4
     The assumption that a party member is randomly recognized to run reflects our abstracting from party
governance, a maintained assumption in this paper, and a natural point from which to develop extensions in
future work.


                                                      6
person runs, that person wins automatically. If both run, an election is held (with the utility
shocks δi being drawn and valences becoming observable to voters just prior to the election).
If nobody runs, parties draw candidates again. A candidate who has declined to run cannot
be drawn again and collects a payoff of zero. Once there is a winner she is appointed and
the payoffs are collected.

3.1.3       Decisions to run
A candidate with type (vj , j) will want to run if and only if the expected private benefit of
doing so is non-negative,
                                   P (j wins) b − c (vj ) ≥ 0.                             (1)

3.1.4       Two formulations for costs
We will consider a model where c (vj ) = c, and one where c (vj ) = c · vj . In both cases the
parameter c only matters relative to b, so from now on we will adopt the normalization c = 1.
For ease of exposition, we will develop the model and establish the results for the case of
constant costs, and later explain how the results change under the alternative cost structure.
Proofs are in the appendix and contain results for both cost structures.

3.2       Solving the model
A voter supports the r candidate if and only if

                                                      δi ≥ $ (vl − vr ) ,

which implies that the vote shares of the r and l candidates are,5
                              1
                          sr =  + [ρR + (1 − ρ) L] $ (vr − vl ) + [ρR − (1 − ρ) L] φ                                    (2)
                              2
                              1
                          sl = − [ρR + (1 − ρ) L] $ (vr − vl ) − [ρR − (1 − ρ) L] φ.                                    (3)
                              2
These shares are intuitive: the vote share of the r candidate increases with the distance
between groups φ whenever the R group has an electoral advantage (i.e., whenever ρR >
(1 − ρ) L). This becomes more likely when a larger share ρ of the population is r and when
these voters are more partisan due to having more concentrated idiosyncratic shocks (high
R). Given φ > 0, a higher R and L make group membership a stronger determinant of the
                                                                                                                    1

vote vis-a-vis valence.6 When ρ = 21 and R = L, the two groups are electorally symmetric
and absent valence differentials both parties will obtain half of the votes. Some restrictions
are necessary in order to guarantee that vote shares are interior and involve votes from both
groups going to both parties.7
     As stated above, candidate j’s decision to run depends on the expression P (j wins) ≥
c(vj )
  b
       . The probability that candidate j wins depends on whether the other candidate −j
runs, and conditional on −j running, on how high −j’s valence is:

               P (j wins) = P (j wins | − j runs) P (−j runs) + 1 − P (−j runs) .                           (4)

This is explained by the fact that if candidate −j does not run, candidate j wins automati-
cally, but if candidate −j runs, then j needs to have a high enough valence relative to that
of candidate −j, such that j can obtain the majority of the vote. Combining expressions (1)
and (4) shows that a candidate j with type vj will run if and only if,

                           b − c (vj )
                                       ≥ P (−j runs) P (−j wins| − j runs) .                                (5)
                               b
The analysis of decisions to run depends on how each side in the last inequality behaves,
which will partly depend on the cost structure.
   In the case c (vj ) = 1, the inequality in (5) governing candidate j’s decision to run
becomes,                                                   
                            b−1                         1
                                 ≥ P (−j runs) P sj < |vj .                            (6)
                              b                         2
    This expression says that, in order to run, the benefit-cost margin on the left hand side has
to compensate for the risk of defeat on the right hand side. Candidate j’s valence is private
information, so the probability that the opponent runs (P (−j runs)) does not depend on
candidate j’s valence; also, the probability of losing a contested election (P sj < 12 |vj ) is
decreasing in j’s own valence type. Hence, candidate j’s risk of defeat in the right hand side
of (6) is decreasing in that candidate’s own valence vj .
    In standard probabilistic voting models the uncertainty about the electoral outcome stems
from shocks to the distribution of idiosyncratic preferences. Here, uncertainty in the eyes of

     Note that both φ, a measure of preference separation, and (R, L), which capture group cohesion, can
be seen to affect competition in that they alter the margin of swing voters. That said, in our view φ better
captures the potential for competition because, as made clear in (2)-(3), with constant costs (and holding
valences fixed), an increase in φ will always raise the vote-margin gap in favor of the dominant party (reducing
competition thus measured), while the effects of changes in (R , L) depend on which is the dominant party,
and which candidate has higher valence.

one candidate (herself endowed with private information on her own type) stems from not
knowing the realized type of her potential rival.

3.3    Equilibrium quality of candidates
The pattern of selection for candidate j will depend on the number of times the left hand
side of (6) intersects the right hand side as vj varies, and whether in the case of a unique
intersection, the benefit-cost margin intersects the defeat risk function from above or below.
The assumptions of uniform density for idiosyncratic shocks and valence types ensure that
the risk of defeat is linearly decreasing in a candidate’s own type. Therefore, if an intersection
exists it is unique. With constant costs, the left hand side is cut by the decreasing risk of
defeat from above, so it is the candidates with relatively high valences who prefer to run.
This is detailed in the following proposition:

Proposition 1 Suppose c (vj ) = 1. In equilibrium, it is the relatively high valence politicians
who run. Specifically, politicians run if and only if their type is above a cutoff given by

where x ≡   ρR+(1−ρ)L $
                        .

    Proof: See Appendix.
    This proposition goes against the usual expectation in the literature that the less able
have a comparative advantage in entering politics (cf. Caselli and Morelli (2004); as we will
see later, the opposite result will hold when costs are increasing fast enough.) The reason
is simple: higher valence candidates are more confident of victory and hence more willing to
sink the cost of running. Inspection reveals that (interior) equilibrium cutoffs are given by
two terms neatly separating “supply side” parameters v̄j 1b and “demand side” parameters
grouped in the electoral asymmetry expression x. As is clear from the cutoffs, the strategies
for candidates on each side are identical if the electoral asymmetry term x goes to zero. As
one groups grows stronger, a wedge appears between the quality of candidates running on
each side. In what follows we assume without loss of generality that ρR − (1 − ρ) L ≥ 0 so
x ≥ 0 and we can refer to r as the electorally advantaged party. Inspection of the equilibrium
cutoffs shows that,

Remark 1 Suppose v̄r = v̄l = v̄, so that any asymmetries stem from electoral advantage. If
costs are constant (c (vj ) = 1), then vl∗ > 0 and vl∗ ≥ vr∗ , and the disadvantaged (l) candidates
have higher average quality.

    Sources of electoral strength such as a large group size (high ρ), highly partisan voters
(high R), or a lack of electoral contestability (high φ) will make candidates in the dominant

                                                9
r party more confident that they can win and incentivize lower quality candidates to run. As
a result, the electorally strong party will feature worse candidates on average and increases
in electoral strength will amplify that valence gap.

3.4    Comparative statics on the quality of candidates
The relevant parameters in this model are: b, ρ, R, L, φ, $, v̄r , v̄l . While the model can be
studied keeping v̄r and v̄l different, we will for simplicity study the model under the symmetric
restriction v̄r = v̄l = v̄. Under both cost structures, if valences are drawn from the same
distribution (v̄r = v̄l = v̄), only the demand side term x drives a wedge between the cutoffs
governing running decisions in each party.
    Before formally stating the comparative static effects, note that when costs are constant
                                                      v ∗ +v̄
the expected quality of candidates for party j is j 2 . Thus, differentiation of cutoffs directly
yields the sign of changes in expected quality of candidates in any party j, as detailed in the
following proposition (the proof if standard and hence omitted).

Proposition 2 If costs are constant (c (vj ) = 1),
    (a) The expected quality of candidates from both parties decreases with the rewards from
office b, and it increases with the maximum possible type v̄.
    (b) The expected quality of candidates from the electorally strong (weak) party decreases
(increases) in the electoral asymmetry term x.

    One take-away from this proposition is that the “supply side” parameters (b, v̄) affect
both parties in the same way. In contrast, changes in demand side parameters have opposing
effects across parties. This is because they directly shift the wedge x that drives apart the
strategies of candidates on each side.
    The last proposition also provides some specific lessons. If we unbundle the electoral
asymmetry term x, it is easy to see that,

Corollary 1 If costs are constant (c (vj ) = 1),
    (i) The expected quality of candidates from a party j decreases with the share of voters
belonging to group j, and with the importance of own group affiliation. That is, the quality
of r candidates decreases with ρ and R, and it increases in 1 − ρ and L, while the opposite
holds for l candidates.
    (ii) The expected quality of candidates from the electorally strong (weak) party increases
(decreases) with the degree of electoral contestability φ1 , and with voters’ concern for valence
$.

   All of these results are intuitive. When costs are constant, it is the relatively high valence
types who run, and more confidence in victory translates into lower valence types deciding to
take the campaign gamble. Therefore, any increase in a party’s electoral strength – whether
from group size or own-group partisanship – translates into worse candidates, while the rival,
weakening party selects better candidates. The parameters for voter preference distance
φ and voter concerns with valence $ operate together, in the sense that only the ratio $φ

                                               10
matters, and its role is to amplify the effects of electoral asymmetry. The reason is intuitive.
If φ is high, voters from each group are more distinct in their preferences, there are fewer
                                                                          ρR−(1−ρ)L
swing voters, and the effects of electoral asymmetry (as measured by ρR+(1−ρ)L      ) make more
of a difference. Conversely, if concerns for valence $ increase, the pure partisan aspect of
preferences matters less.
    A conclusion from the analysis in this section is that the empirical study of some parame-
ters – especially those on the demand side in the term x – may have to pay special attention to
heterogeneous effects across parties. Empirical designs that do not accommodate for possibly
heterogeneous effects may find attenuated or even zero effects.

3.5     A different cost structure
An important goal of our theoretical analysis is to contrast two different cost structures. We
developed the model and main results relying on a constant cost of running. This might make
sense if a higher valence captures something like integrity, which may be unrelated to the
cost of running. But if valence captures something like ability and market opportunities that
are forgone when running, then the costs of running could be increasing. In this subsection
we detail how the previous results change under increasing costs.

3.5.1    Equilibrium selection patterns
If costs are increasing, the benefit-cost margin on the left hand side of (6) becomes decreasing
in vj at rate 1b . In addition, if that rate of decrease is faster than that of the right hand side,
we could expect a pattern of selection that reverses the one under constant costs: high valence
individuals have a small risk of defeat but also small benefit-cost margins due to their high
costs, and therefore might prefer to stay out. Indeed, the alternative version of Proposition
1 states that if v̄l , v̄r > b, and 0 ≤ x ≤ b(v̄r − b)/v̄r , then when c (vj ) = vj there exists an
equilibrium in which candidates run if and only if their type is below a cutoff level given by

                                          vr∗ ≡ b
                                                                
                                                          x
                                          vl∗   ≡b 1−                ,
                                                      v̄r − b
                   ρR−(1−ρ)L φ
where again x ≡ ρR+(1−ρ)L    $
                               .
    As a result, if costs rise fast enough, the selection pattern flips relative to the constant
cost case: it is the lower valence types who run.8 Moreover, when costs are increasing,
vr∗ > vl∗ and the electorally advantaged (r) candidates have higher average quality. Why does
it take steeply increasing costs to invert the selection pattern? The reason is that higher
valence candidates face higher costs, but they are also more confident in victory; to invert the
selection pattern, the discouragement from higher costs must dominate the encouragement
from increased confidence in victory. In addition, since attracting higher quality candidates
   8
    By fast enough we mean the slope − 1b of the benefit-cost ratio in the left hand side of (5) is smaller than
                                                                             1
that of the defeat risk expression on the right hand side. The latter is − v̄−j .


                                                        11
requires additional confidence in victory, it is the electorally dominant party that fields the
better candidates.

3.5.2   Comparative statics of candidate quality
                                                                                v∗
When costs are increasing, the expected quality of candidates in party j is 2j and differen-
tiation yields the comparative statics effects. The alternative version of Proposition 2 (the
proof of which is again standard and hence omitted) states that (i) if c (vj ) = vj and the
electoral asymmetry term x is not too large, the expected quality of candidates from both
parties increases with the rewards from office b, and it increases among the weak party with
the maximum possible type v̄r . In addition, (ii) an increase in the electoral asymmetry term
x leaves the strong party unaffected and decreases the quality of candidates from the weak
party.
     As with constant costs, the supply-side parameter b affects both parties in the same way
(if asymmetry is not large), rather than making the candidates of one party better and the
candidates from the other worse. But the sign of the comparative static effect for changes in
rewards b changes: while in the constant cost case increases in rewards decreased candidate
quality, now an improvement in the rewards from office improves candidate quality. The
intuition is tightly linked to the drivers of the selection pattern, indicating that attracting
higher quality candidates would require compensating them for the costs of running - stronger
confidence in victory is not enough, and higher rewards are necessary.
     When we consider the results for both cost structures together, two broad implications
follow. First, the two cost structures imply opposite selection patterns and often different
comparative statics results. Second, the empirical study of effects of changing rewards b
on candidate quality can help pin down the prevailing cost structure independent of party
affiliation: b is a parameter that affects all parties equally, and does so in opposite ways
strictly based on the cost structure.

3.6     Comparative statics on the quality of the elected
It is generally easier to collect information about elected officials than about the entire
candidate pool. Moreover, we tend to care more about those who are elected, since they set
policy. Unfortunately, the study of what drives the quality of elected officials is theoretically
much more complicated. Our model helps explain the complications.
    Changes in the parameters of the model set off countervailing forces that tend to create
ambiguous effects over the expected quality of the elected. There are three types of compet-
itive scenarios: One where the r candidate runs alone, one where the l candidate runs alone,
and one where both candidates run. In the last case, there is an actual electoral contest. The
overall expected quality of the elected person reflects the expected quality of the winner in




                                               12
each competitive scenario, weighted by the probability that each scenario occurs,9

  Eelected (v) = E (v|r alone) P (r alone) + E (v|l alone) P (l alone) + E (v|both) P (both) .
                                                                                                    dEelected (v)
   Therefore, given a change in a parameter θ, the change in expected quality is                         dθ
                                                                                                                    =
A + B where,

                      dP (r alone)                 dP (l alone)               dP (both)
   A ≡ E (v|r alone)               + E (v|l alone)               + E (v|both)              (7)
                           dθ                           dθ                        dθ
          dE (v|r alone)               dE (v|l alone)               dE (v|both)
       B≡                P (r alone) +                P (l alone) +             P (both) .
                dθ                           dθ                          dθ
One obvious source of ambiguity is that demand side parameters can have opposing effects
on the candidates from the two parties. But the complexities do not end there. Even if
we focus on the supply side parameter b, which affects the quality of candidates from both
parties in the same fashion, countervailing forces are still present.
    The expression for dEelected
                             dθ
                                 (v)
                                     helps show that when a parameter changes there are three
types of forces at play. First, there is the direct effect on the quality of candidates conditional
on each competitive scenario (reflected in the terms labeled with B). Thus, a parametric
change that is expected to, say, increase cutoffs vr∗ and vl∗ will introduce a force toward
higher quality elected politicians because the candidates who run are better. We call this
the “candidate quality” effect. But secondly, when a parameter changes, the probability of
each competitive scenario changes as well (as reflected in the terms labeled with A). The
terms in A form a convex combination of three expected qualities, and a change in cutoffs
that makes more types run will reduce the chances of the uncontested electoral scenarios and
increase the chance of an electoral contest (formally, if a change in a parameter θ increased
cutoffs, it is easy to show that we would have dP (both)
                                                       dθ
                                                            > 0). This change in the likelihood of
the different competitive scenarios introduces two additional effects. First, since a contested
election creates an order statistic effect over the expected quality of the winner, the contested
election tends to produce winners of higher quality than the uncontested elections. This is
the “competitive” effect. But when parties are electorally asymmetric, one of them will
field candidates of higher quality than the other. Thus, an uncontested election featuring
the party with better candidates will typically produce winners of high quality; the contested
election gives chances to both parties, including one that may on occasion win despite having
candidates of worse quality. This is a “composition” effect. The “competitive” and the
“composition” forces go in opposite directions and render the overall impact of contestability
itself ambiguous. That said, as parties get close to electoral symmetry, the composition effect
vanishes, and increases in contestability produce only the competitive effect which in turn
   9                                                                                            P (j)(1−P (−j))
     The probability P (j alone) that party j will have its candidate running unopposed is 1−(1−P    (j))(1−P (−j))
where P (j) is the probability that a candidate from party j who has been recognized decides to run. Recall
that if neither candidate runs, parties draw new candidates –a process that could go on for arbitrarily many
iterations. The term P (j alone) can be seen as the probability that party j will field the lone candidate,
starting at any iteration. Thus, P (j alone) = P (j) (1 − P (−j)) + (1 − P (j)) (1 − P (−j)) P (j alone), which
                                                                            P (j)P (−j)
yields the expression above. Analogous reasoning yields P (both) = 1−(1−P      (j))(1−P (−j)) .

enhances the quality of the elected. When parties are close enough to symmetric, parameter
changes that increase the measure of types who run make the overall effect from the terms
in A unambiguously positive. The question then is whether such positive effect compounds
or cancels the candidate quality effect in line B.
    These considerations underlie the following proposition.

Proposition 3 Suppose parties are close to, but not perfectly, symmetric. (i) If costs are
constant (c (vj ) = 1), an increase in b produces countervailing forces: the candidate quality
effect is negative and the competitive effect is positive. As x approaches zero the former effect
dominates the latter, decreasing the quality of elected politicians. (ii) If costs are increasing
(c (vj ) = vj ), an increase in b produces a positive candidate effect and a positive competitive
effect, increasing the quality of elected politicians.

     Proof: see Appendix.
     This proposition tells us that, due to potential ambiguities that only disappear under
symmetry, the study of the quality of elected politicians cannot in general be used to deter-
mine the effects of rewards, nor what cost structure is in place. It is more reliable to analyze
the quality of candidates.
     The analysis of the comparative statics of the quality of the elected under conditions of
asymmetry is difficult and left for future research. In situations of very stark asymmetry
where one party is almost always running unopposed, the comparative statics of the elected
will tend to track the comparative statics of the candidates from the dominant party. It is
worth mentioning that the model presented here readily accounts for uncontested elections,
since it is often the case that a candidate runs unopposed and it is feasible to study the
comparative statics of the likelihood of such events. This is also left for future research since
it is not something that we will use to guide our empirical review.

3.7    Summary and discussion
Our simple textbook-like model produces clear predictions for how fundamentals will affect
the quality of candidates. A higher valence is an electoral advantage (due to higher chance of
besting the opponent), but may also be a cost disadvantage (due to higher opportunity costs).
When the electoral advantage force dominates, the best types run and electoral strength,
lower political competition, lower voter preferences for valence, and the attractiveness of office
all worsen the average quality of candidates. When the cost disadvantage force dominates,
the opposite holds.
    The study of the quality of the elected is more complicated. Changes in parameters
can create countervailing effects through a direct impact on the quality of candidates, and
through changes in the contestability of elections. Under conditions close enough to electoral
symmetry, higher rewards from office are guaranteed to improve the quality of the elected
when the costs of running increase with valence fast enough. Part of the proof of our Propo-
sition 3 shows that in contested elections the effects of rewards on the elected track the effects
over candidates. Thus, we should expect higher rewards from office to lower the quality of


                                               14
the elected when costs are constant, and to improve their quality when costs are (rapidly)
increasing.
    Our simple model generates enough complexity to entertain the analyst, but it certainly
leaves out important dimensions that ought to be developed in future research. We have not
dealt with the issue of accountability. The model could be extended to incorporate different
benefits from office depending on how candidate type affects performance and reelection
probabilities. Similarly, we have not dealt exhaustively with parties. For example, parties
could play a role by screening members and therefore shaping the distribution of candidate
valences to differ from that of the general population.


4      A review of the empirical evidence
Our model’s predictions are based on two assumptions that seem natural yet we have not
justified: 1) the returns to office are positive; and 2) voters care about valence. Before we
test the model’s main predictions, we explore whether the empirical evidence supports these
two assumptions.

4.1     What are the returns to holding office?
The empirical evidence on the returns to office can be usefully classified along two dimensions:
financial versus non-financial, and present versus future returns.

Financial returns Most elected politicians receive a salary, and for some positions the
pay can be quite attractive.10 But at the same time, we have also seen several instances in
which individuals take pay cuts in order to hold office. For instance, a U.S. senator earns
$174,000 annually. Prior to running for office, Georgia Senator David Perdue received an
annual salary of close to $1 million as the CEO for Dollar General; Carly Fiorina’s annual
salary at Hewlett-Packard, before she was fired and began an (unsuccessful) Senate bid,
ranged from $1 to $4 million per year. Based on these casual observations, it seems unlikely
that the salary one receives in office, while a clear enticement for many, can fully explain why
individuals run for office. Are there other financial returns to holding office? In this respect,
the empirical literature has largely focused on trying to identify two additional sources: 1)
future returns to holding office; and 2) illicit returns to holding office.
    Estimating the future returns to holding office: Since leaving the White House in 1996, Bill
Clinton has earned in excess of 106 million dollars in speaking fees. George W. Bush allegedly
received a 7 million dollar advance for his post-presidency memoir, “Decision Points.” Barack
Obama’s expected advance for his memoir has been estimated to be somewhere between 25-
45 million dollars. Most people cite these events as clear evidence of the future benefits of
holding office. After all, when individuals have been elected to a position of power and have
  10
    For example, Peichl, Pestel, and Siegloch (2013) estimate a positive wage gap of 35%-65% between
German members of parliament and citizens with similar observable traits occupying executive positions in
the private sector, with the difference shrinking to zero for top positions.


                                                   15
experienced how policy decisions are made, they should be able to monetize this experience
and knowledge once they leave office. And yet, there are relatively few studies that can
provide systematic evidence on the future returns to holding office.
    There are two primary reasons this strand of the literature remains sparse. First is a
data constraint: it is very difficult to obtain information about a politician’s income or net
wealth after they have left office. We only know how much Bill Clinton received in speaking
fees because the Clintons have remained in the public eye, and even then speaking fees are
not his only source of income. To estimate the returns to office, one would need to find a
systematic way to collect income or wealth data for a reasonably-sized sample of politicians.
This has proven to be extremely difficult.
    The second hurdle is in finding an appropriate counterfactual. Even if we do know that
Bill Clinton earned 106 million dollars in speaking fees since leaving office, do we know how
much he would have earned during this period had he not been president? The answer is
certainly no. Fortunately, some recent advances have been made in our ability to properly
estimate the counterfactual.
    The studies that have made progress on this question have overcome these limitations
in fairly creative ways. For instance, Eggers and Hainmueller (2009) created a database of
every candidate who ran for the House of Commons between 1950 and 1970. For competitive
candidates who had passed away (23% of the sample), they were able to link the majority
to their probate values to measure the total value of the candidate’s estate at death. To
identify the returns to holding office, they employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD)
comparing Members of Parliament (MPs) with parliamentary candidates who narrowly lost.
They find that serving in office almost doubled the wealth of Conservative MPs, but had no
discernible financial benefits for Labour MPs. The authors suspect that Conservative MPs
profited from office largely through lucrative outside employment they acquired as a result
of their political positions.
    Querubin and Synder (2009) take a similar approach in their analysis of U.S. Congressmen.
They use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the rents from a seat in the U.S.
Congress between 1850 and 1880. They find evidence of significant returns for the first
half of the 1860s, during the Civil War, but not for other periods. Those who won their
first election by a narrow margin and served during the period 1861 - 1866 accumulated, on
average, almost 40% more wealth between 1860 and 1870 (roughly $800,000 in present-day
values) relative to those who ran but did not serve. Consistent with these findings, wealth
accumulation was particularly large for congressmen who represented states most involved
in military contracting and those who served during the Civil War on the committees that
were most responsible for military appropriations.
    We suspect that it is not a coincidence that these two studies approached the question from
a historical perspective. After all, one needs microdata to identify politicians, and Census
microdata in the U.S. (U.K.) only becomes public 72 (100) years after they are collected. In
other settings, most notably the Scandinavian countries, researchers have been able to solve
the data constraint with access to more current administrative data. For instance, Lundqvist
(2013) estimates the financial returns to being elected to a local council using administrative
data from Sweden. The author again uses a RDD approach, but adapted for a proportional

                                              16
representation (PR) system. In this case, the comparison is between candidates who just
barely won to those who barely lost a seat for the same party. For local politicians who had
run for office during the period 1991-2006, the author found no evidence of financial returns
in the short or long run. Whether these results are specific to the time period, to Sweden,
or the type of elected position remain interesting open questions. Kotakorpi, Poutvaara,
and Terviö (2016) also do not find large returns for being elected to parliament in Finland.
They find that while becoming a member of parliament increases annual earnings by about
$20,000 while in office, the effect on subsequent earnings is small. Another way that studies
have dealt with the need for extensive data requirements is to approach the topic of returns
more narrowly, from a within-office rather than career perspective; for instance, Lenz and
Lim (2009) find that U.S. representatives do not accumulate wealth faster than a matched
sample of non-representatives.
    Overall, the results on the future returns to office seem mixed, or at least highly dependent
on the context. Without additional studies, it is difficult to know whether the differences in
findings are due to the nature of the position, the type of electoral system being considered,
or any other difference in the political or economic setting. One takeaway, however, is clear:
close elections have been a valuable source of variation for trying to identify these effects,
even if they do introduce another layer of “localness” that make comparisons across studies
more difficult.
    Estimating the illicit returns to holding office: Politicians need not wait to leave office to
capitalize on their ability to wield political influence. Rent extraction is another potential
benefit of holding office.
    For evidence that corruption may be an important motive for holding office, one only
needs to pick up the newspaper. The concern, of course, is that newspaper accounts may
paint an exaggerated picture or only report on a subset of cases. Some studies have been
able to provide systematic evidence of the extent to which politicians engage in corruption.
For instance, Reinikka and Svensson (2004) track the flow of public funds that the central
government of Uganda used for primary education. Based on a survey of 250 primary schools
that compared the amount of funds disbursed from the central government to the amount
received by schools, the authors estimated a leakage rate of 87 percent. The bulk of the miss-
ing funds were captured by local officials and politicians. Ferraz and Finan (2011) use data
from an anti-corruption program in Brazil that audited municipalities’ use of federal funds.
They estimate that approximately 80 percent of mayors engaged in some form of corruption,
at a cost of US $550 million per year. McMillan and Zoido (2004) examine unusually detailed
records kept by the then-secret-police chief of Peru in the 1990s documenting bribes paid in
exchange for support of President Fujimori’s regime. They note that politicians generally
received between US $5,000 and US $20,000 per month, relative to a salary of US $4,500 per
month. Niehaus and Sukhtankar (2013) examine a wage increase in the context of India’s
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme program, and find that almost the entire
21% increase was captured by local officials and politicians.
    While it is has been hard to find direct evidence of political corruption, numerous papers
measure corruption indirectly by estimating the value of political connections. A number
of papers have documented that firms linked to politicians perform better. For instance,

                                               17
Fisman (2001) shows that the stock prices of Indonesian firms connected to President Suharto
fluctuated in response to news about his failing health. He estimates that 23% of the value of
the most connected firms was due to corruption. Faccio (2006) later extended this analysis
to include the effects of political connections to over 20,000 publicly traded firms across 47
countries. She finds that having a board member or large shareholder who is a politician is
associated with a 2.3-4.3 percent increase in the company’s market value, depending on the
corruption level of the country that the politician represents. Szakonyi (2017) uses an RDD
and data from Russia to show that politically-connected firms experience a 60% increase
in revenue and a 15% increase in profits during the politician’s term. He argues that the
increase in firm performance can be explained by greater access to government contracts. We
have also seen convincing evidence that political connections are useful for obtaining access
to credit for firms in Pakistan (Khwaja and Mian (2005)) and better labor outcomes for
family members in Italy (Gagliarducci and Manacorda (2016)), the Philippines (Fafchamps
and Labonne (2017)), and Sweden (Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2016)). Although all of
these studies focus on only one side of the exchange, it is not unreasonable to think that
the politician also benefits from the relationship. The obvious limitation in interpreting the
existence of corruption or valuable connections as implying substantial returns to holding
office is that in most of this research the exact benefits accruing to the individual politicians
themselves cannot be estimated.
    The work by Fisman, Schulz, and Vig (2014) makes progress by exploiting the introduction
of India’s Right to Information Act that required, starting in 2003, all candidates standing for
public office to disclose the value and composition of their assets. Based on this information,
the authors calculate the asset growth of politicians using the disclosures of those competing
in consecutive state assembly elections and compare the asset growth of election winners and
runners-up. They find that the annual asset growth of winners is 3-5 percent higher than
the runners-up in close elections. This sizeable increase in yearly assets cannot be explained
by formal compensation, but are instead suggestive of rent-seeking activities. Consistent
with this hypothesis, the growth rates are higher in more corrupt states and for individuals
holding ministerial positions.

Non-financial returns Politicians may also have non-financial motives for holding office.
These incentives have been modeled in various ways, such as the self-esteem boost one gets
from holding office (“ego rents”), the rewards from performing one’s civic duty, and the desire
to implement one’s preferred policy. These incentives can motivate individuals to seek office
even if financial rewards are diminished or nonexistent.
    While the existence of non-financial incentives has gained acceptance in the theoretical
literature, those incentives have been difficult to quantify. After all, how does one systemati-
cally measure the utility politicians receive from performing their civic duty, or implementing
their policy of choice? Imposing structure through theory has allowed partial progress, by
effectively “residualizing” this component of a politician’s utility.
    Diermeier, Keane, and Merlo (2005) provided the first estimate of the non-pecuniary
returns to office using a structural model of the career decisions of U.S. national legislators.
By observing politicians’ career decisions and financial rewards over their life cycle, these

                                               18
authors estimate that general non-pecuniary rewards amount to over $200,000 per year for
a senator and about $20,000 to $35,000 per year for a representative, depending on whether
he/she is a member of a major House committee. To put this number in perspective the
average annual salary of a member of Congress in 1995 dollars over their sample period is
$120,378.
    The non-financial benefits of holding office might also accrue in the future in the form
of legacy effects. Studies have shown that one of the benefits of holding office is that one’s
offspring are also more likely to hold office. For example, Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Synder (2009)
study political dynasties in the US Congress since the 1700s. They show political power is
self-perpetuating: legislators who hold power for longer become more likely to have relatives
entering Congress in the future. Querubin (2015) finds similar evidence for the Philippines.
He finds that candidates who barely win their first election are around 5 times more likely
to have a relative in office in the future than individuals who barely lose and do not serve.

4.2    Do voters care about valence?
Valence can mean different things to different researchers. When the term was originally
introduced by Stokes (1963), valence (or “valence issues”) referred to any issue or attribute
the electorate cared about beyond a candidate’s stated policy platform. This definition
can of course include various attributes, such as a politician’s charisma, integrity, or the
ability to deliver goods and services. Valence can be multi-dimensional, and on some level
context-specific. This imposes an obvious empirical challenge, especially given the paucity
of information that typically exists about political candidates.
    Measuring valence: As we will see in the studies below, most empirical studies that feature
valence define it as an indicator of quality, and therefore tend to rely on common proxies, such
as a person’s education level, pre-office income levels, or type of occupation. And while an
individual’s socio-economic outcomes are undoubtedly a function of that individual’s traits,
these proxies are not only likely to miss important attributes but are also likely to reflect
luck or social class.
    This measurement concern was a primary reason why Dal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and
Rickne (2017) turned to administrative data from Sweden in order to assess whether politi-
cians were positively selected from the population. In contrast to other (non-Scandinavian)
settings, Sweden maintains a national registry of its population which can be accessed for
research. Besides the common set of socio-economic characteristics (e.g., age, education,
gender, income, etc.) these data also contain rich measures of individual ability, including
evaluations of IQ and leadership potential for the 1951-1980 cohorts done by the military
on all males. These data also link individuals across generations, which allows for the mea-
surement of an individual’s social background. Based on these data, the authors settled on
four different measures of quality: 1) education, 2) leadership score, 3) cognitive score, and
4) a measure of an individual’s earning capacity as estimated from a fully saturated Mincer
regression developed by Besley, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017). These measures, while
positively correlated, also capture different margins of variation and suggest the possibility
that there might be different dimensions of ability. That multiplicity highlights the hazards

                                              19
of relying on a single measure of quality.
     The contrast between Figures 2a and 3 illustrates some of the pitfalls in the measurement
of politician quality. The former shows a negative correlation across countries between GDP
per capita and the percentage of legislators with a college degree or higher (a correlation that,
as shown in Figure 2b, obtains also when considering the education of politicians relative to
that of the general population they represent). If instead we were to plot this relationship
using the percentage of legislators who had a master’s degree or higher as our measure of
quality, we would reach the exact opposite conclusion: there is a positive correlation across
countries between GDP per capita and the quality of the political class.
     Is there any evidence that voters care about valence? In general, there is evidence that
voters react to news that might be informative about valence, although voters’ reactions
may not always improve selection. Characterizing valence as honesty, there is a substantial
literature noting that voters are less likely to support a candidate who has behaved (or been
strongly alleged to have behaved) corruptly. This behavior has been documented in elicitation
of survey preferences (Winters and Weitz-Shapiro 2013; Banerjee, Green, McManus, and
Pande 2014) and in actual voting (Ferraz and Finan 2008; Chong, De La O, Karlan, and
Wantchekon 2014; Chang, Golden, and Hill 2010; Bobonis, Cámara Fuertes, and Schwabe
2016; Fisman, Schulz, and Vig 2016).11
     There is also substantial evidence that corrupt behavior by politicians affects citizens’
propensity to vote. Kostadinova (2009), Caillier (2010), de Figueiredo, Hidalgo, and Kasa-
hara (2012), and Chong, De La O, Karlan, and Wantchekon (2014) all document evidence of
lower turnout when voters are made aware of corruption, although Malesky, Schuler, and Tran
(2012) find no effect. Overall, almost all of the findings indicate that evidence of corruption
impacts citizen responses, either through lower vote shares for the corrupt, or through lower
turnout, which may also suggest that voters disapprove of, and are put off by, corruption.
The catch is, lower turnout does not necessarily mean tighter accountability. Throughout,
it is worth noting that evidence of corruption does not only demonstrate a politician’s (lack
of) honesty; it may also signal something about his performance in office.
     Voters also seem to prefer candidates who are more competent, although this competence
has been defined empirically in a variety of ways, some more compelling than others. Besley,
Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017) cite a survey of Swedish voters in 2000 where 71 percent
of respondents agreed that competence was an important attribute of politicians. Candidate
quality is often defined as having previously held office, and there is considerable evidence
that such candidates tend to garner higher vote shares, as in Lublin (1994).12 In a more
recent example, Hobolt and Hoyland (2011) find that voters reward parties who choose more
experienced top candidates in elections to the European Parliament.
     Another common way to define competence is performance in office. Studies show that
voters reward top performers in a way that is consistent with positive selection (Padró i
Miquel and Snyder 2006; Alt, de Mesquita, and Rose 2011; Banerjee, Kumar, Pande, and
Su 2011; Butler and Powell 2014; Humphreys and Weinstein 2012).13 Clearly, however,
 11
    See Pande (2011) for summaries of several papers on this question.
 12
    For a thorough review of this literature, see Squire (1995)
 13
    Pande (2011) also summarizes some of this literature.


                                                   20
performance in office, while likely correlated with competence, is not a direct measure.
    Two studies provide more direct evidence that competence matters to voters, both in
the context of randomized experiments embedded within campaigns. Bidwell, Casey, and
Glennerster (2015) show that voters respond positively to new information about candidates’
professional qualifications; Kendall, Nannicini, and Trebbi (2015) show that voters respond
positively to a campaign that featured the incumbent’s competence as a manager. Kendall,
Nannicini, and Trebbi (2015) use a random utility voting model to estimate the weights that
voters place on valence versus ideological considerations. They find that while most voters
place equal weights on valence and ideology, right-leaning voters tend to place much lower
weight on valence. Although this paper does well to separately identify the effects of ideology
from valence, one complication in the interpretation of the results is that their informational
treatment about valence does not separate the incumbent’s competence from effort. Thus,
we might have estimated similar effects even in a pure moral hazard world: voters may have
been rewarding candidates based on effort rather than screening on valence.
    Voters also select on other characteristics, such as appearance (Atkinson, Enos, and Hill
2009) or ethnicity (Norris and Mattes 2003; Ferree 2006; Eifert, Miguel, and Posner 2010;
Adida 2015). Ethnicity is likely a heuristic shortcut (Ferree 2006), and may even be a rea-
sonable one, given that in some contexts ethnicity correlates with redistributive preferences
(Pande 2003). Interestingly, this behavior is most pronounced in low information environ-
ments, and tends to decline as potential voters get more information about a candidate’s
competence (Casey 2015) or various other characteristics (Conroy-Krutz 2012). This sug-
gests that such behaviors are not inconsistent with the existence of a preference by voters for
high valence candidates.

4.3    Do higher rewards from office improve politician quality?
According to our model, it is important to distinguish between the pool of candidates and the
elected politicians. Predictions about the quality of the elected combine predictions about
the quality of those who run with predictions about changes in the type of competition
scenarios that may occur. Theoretical predictions about the quality of the overall pool of
willing candidates are more straightforward. If the costs of running are increasing (fast
enough) with valence, then as the expected benefits of holding office increase, higher quality
individuals will find it worthwhile to run for office, all else equal. If costs do not rise fast
enough, an increase in benefits will lower valence instead. (In the case of the elected, the
same predictions arise if one restricts attention to the case of increasing costs, or scenarios
where contestability is held constant – something that the analyst cannot easily control for.)
Given these opposite predictions, what does the empirical evidence say?
    To address this question empirically, researchers have to overcome two serious but familiar
challenges: data and identification. Not surprisingly, the limited empirical evidence we have
on this topic has focused on the easier-to-measure financial rewards to office, and in particular
the salaries politicians receive, rather than on non-financial rewards. It is also worth noting
that the preferred empirical setting involves the entire candidate pool rather than just the
elected. To wit, the data gods can be cruel: We often know very little when it comes to those

                                               21
who choose to run, but are not elected.
    Identification is, of course, the other concern. The rewards from office are almost never
set exogenously. Instead, they are a function of the political and economic environment.
This makes it difficult to cleanly identify the effects of, say, a politician’s salary on the
characteristics of the candidate pool, even assuming sufficient sacrifices to the data gods
have been made.
    Given these constraints, one shouldn’t expect to see too many serious studies on this
topic. To our knowledge, there have been very few studies that have examined the effects
of politician salaries on the quality of the candidate pool. Ferraz and Finan (2008) examine
whether higher salaries attract better candidates for local council in Brazil. The authors
exploit the fact that salaries for local legislators are capped at different levels based on the
population of the municipality. Based on this exogenous variation, they find that a 20 percent
increase in wages leads to a modest increase of 0.2 years of schooling and 0.05 additional terms
of experience. Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) examine the effects of higher wages on the
pool of candidates who run for mayor in Italy. Using a similar research design, they also find
that higher wages attract more educated candidates. Kotakorpi and Poutvaara (2011) take
advantage of a reform in the year 2000 in Finland, when the salaries of members of parliament
were increased by 35%. Using candidates in municipal elections as a control group, the
authors find that a higher salary increased the fraction of candidates with higher education
among female candidates, but not among male candidates. Lastly, Dal Bó, Finan, Folke,
Persson, and Rickne (2017) document a positive correlation across Swedish municipalities
between relative mayoral wages and several measures of quality among individuals running
at the top of the various municipal party lists, who de facto constitute the set of mayoral
candidates.
    A few other studies have also looked at the effects of wages on political selection, but
they have been limited to elected politicians. Fisman, Harmon, Kamenica, and Munk (2015)
use data on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to examine the impact of salaries
on the composition and behavior of legislators. They employ a differences-in-differences
approach that exploits the introduction of a law that equalized the salaries of MEPs. They
find that increasing salaries decreases the quality of elected MEPs, as measured by college
quality. The intuition for this result is similar to why higher wages may decrease the quality
of the candidate pool when opportunity costs do not vary with valence. The authors report
that the wage increase leads those with lower quality degrees to seek reelection more, without
affecting the reelection seeking behavior of those with top degrees. Braendle (2013) also
studies the harmonization of the base pay for the Members of the European Parliament
(MEPs), but in using alternative measures of human capital (e.g. education levels, political
experience, and occupational background) he finds no significant impact of the reform on
quality.
    As we discussed above, the impact on entry decisions of financial and non-financial ben-
efits beyond salary remains uncharted territory. A study by Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti, and
Tabellini (2013) offers a glimpse into this area, however. These authors examine the effects
of additional government revenues on political corruption and on the quality of politicians.
If additional revenues yield benefits to politicians, variation in those revenues may lead to

                                              22
changes in non-wage benefits. An obvious caveat to our interpretation of this study is that
the link between central transfers and benefits accruing to the local politicians is likely com-
plex and heavily dependent on context. The identification strategy of the authors is based
on the fact that federal transfers to municipal governments change exogenously according
to given population thresholds. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design, they show that
larger transfers increase political corruption and reduce the quality of candidates for mayor,
as measured by education. Pecenco and Sukhtankar (2018) document similar findings in
the context of local elections in India. The authors exploit experimental variation in the
introduction of a new payment technology used for two of India’s largest welfare programs.
This reform was estimated to have reduced leakage in both programs by 40% (Muralidha-
ran, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar 2016). The authors show that the heads of the elected village
councils in the treatment areas are less educated than those elected in the control areas. Re-
latedly, Gehlbach, Sonin, and Zhuravskaya (2010) document the high share of businessmen
who run for public office in Russia. Using data from Russian gubernatorial elections, they
show that “Businessman Candidates” emerge in regions with low media freedom and govern-
ment transparency. They argue that when democratic institutions are comparatively weak,
businessmen run for office to avoid the cost of lobbying elected officials. When democratic
institutions are strong, the ability to influence public policy is limited. How one maps “Busi-
nessman Candidates” to valence is unclear, but the results do suggest that the opportunity
to extract rents might attract candidates who are more venal.
    In sum, there is fairly convincing evidence that the rewards from office matter for polit-
ical selection, but how they matter appears to depend on the type of rewards in question.
Increases to legal rewards tend to induce positive self-selection, whereas increases to illegal
rewards can invite negative self-selection. One interpretation of this difference lies in our
assumptions about opportunity costs and valence. If we view valence as being about hon-
esty, then the costs of running should be constant in valence, and according to our model,
and most of the evidence, increases in the attractiveness of office induce a negative selection
effect. Still, these considerations suggest that it would be informative to enrich our model
by allowing the nature of the benefits to vary.

4.4    Does political competition improve the quality of politicians?
A second main prediction of the model is that the quality of the candidate pool will depend
on electoral contestability. If costs are constant, then we should observe higher quality
candidates by the dominant, and hence likely more numerous, party in more competitive
districts (with negative effects on the weak party); if costs are increasing we should expect
no change in the strong party but higher quality among candidates in the weak party. Thus,
higher quality may result on average in both cases. The empirical study of the effects of
competition has met with the usual challenges of identification and data availability. With
the exception of Dal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017) who document a positive
relationship between political competition and the quality of the candidate pool, all the other
empirical studies on this topic have only focused on elected politicians.
    There are several strands of the literature that can claim empirical support for the pre-

                                              23
diction that more competition should improve the quality of willing politicians. One line
of study has looked at the relationship between political competition and performance. If
we care about valence because politicians with higher valence perform better in office, then
we should also expect to see better policy outcomes, broadly defined, in more competitive
districts. Several studies suggest this is the case. For example, Besley, Persson, and Sturm
(2010) show that among states in the U.S., higher political competition is associated with
policy choices that are more pro-growth (i.e., low taxes, higher investment spending, etc.).
Besley and Preston (2007) examine the performance of local government in the United King-
dom from 1980-1988. They show that policies tend to be more moderate in places with less
electoral bias (and hence more competitive). Galasso and Nannicini (2011) provide evidence
that members of the Italian parliament from 1994-2006 are less likely to be absent for roll-call
votes if they come from more contested districts. Recently, Gavoille and Verschelde (2017)
provide additional evidence of the effects of electoral competition on political selection, us-
ing data on members of the French National Assembly from 1958 to 2012. They show that
a Herfindahl index of the vote shares during the first round of the legislative elections are
strongly predictive of a deputy’s legislative activity. The correlation between political com-
petition and performance can even be seen at a cross-national level. Using an event-study
design, Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2014) show that countries grow faster
after becoming more democratic (which, one might expect, increases political competition).
    Although the relationship between competition and performance is interesting for many
reasons, there are two immediate concerns for using this line of attack in support of the
theory. First, a positive relationship between competition and performance is also consistent
with a model in which politicians are identical. In models that feature only moral hazard
(e.g. Ferejohn (1986)), politicians have an incentive to behave “better” in places that are
more competitive. Second, unless we are willing to take a normative stance about what good
policies entail, it is not clear what better performance means, or even how valence should
map onto these outcomes. After all, competent individuals are equally capable at engaging
in corruption as they are at implementing growth-enhancing policies.
    Another strand of the literature offers a more direct line of attack, by using a proxy for
valence as the dependent variable. A nice example is again the paper by Galasso and Nan-
nicini (2011). In addition to documenting that political competition leads to less absenteeism
among Italian MPs, they also show that MPs who come from more competitive districts have
more years of schooling, higher pre-election income, and more experience in local government.
Similarly, De Paola and Scoppa (2011) use data from Italian local level governments for 1985-
2008 to show that in municipalities that are more politically competitive, both mayors and
councilors tend to have higher education levels and come from higher-skilled occupations.
    Researchers have documented similar evidence in the U.S. In their study on political
dynasties, Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Synder (2009) find that dynastic legislators (who typically
have less public office experience) are less common in more competitive places. Atkinson,
Enos, and Hill (2009) find that more competitive congressional districts in the U.S. lead
to contestation by candidates who also appear more competent. The authors asked college
undergraduates to evaluate hundreds of pairs of photos of 972 Congressional candidates for
the 2004 House elections and 1990-2006 Senate elections. For each pair, the students were

                                              24
asked to pick which candidate appeared more competent. Based on these pairwise choices,
the authors constructed competence scores for 972 Congressional candidates. They then
regressed their measure of candidate facial competence score on district competitiveness as
evaluated by the Cook Political Report, which classifies each campaign as Tossup, Lean,
Likely, or Safe for each party. They find that moving from a race categorized as Safe to one
that is considered a Tossup increases the facial competence of the challenger by almost one
standard deviation. There is also evidence in support of the prediction at the cross-national
level. Besley and Reyal-Querol (2011) use a dataset on 1,400 world leaders between 1848
and 2004 to examine whether democracies select more educated leaders than autocracies.
Controlling for country and year fixed effects, they find that democracies are 20 percent
more likely to select a highly educated leader.
    In sum, there is broad empirical support for the second prediction. But even with the
ball seemingly at the back of the net, there are at least three reasons why one should stop
short of claiming victory. First, empirical work rarely analyzes heterogeneous effects by
party, something that the theory strongly suggests should be done when studying the effect
of demand-side parameters. If the detected effects operate across the whole political spec-
trum, then both versions of the model presented here would be falsified. Second, political
competition as is often empirically measured (a vote-margin gap between parties) is itself an
equilibrium outcome, determined not only by voters’ preferences, but by candidates’ best re-
sponses and the overall political environment. This raises important identification concerns.
Places that are more politically competitive are also likely to be, among other things, more
economically developed and populated by more educated citizens. Without accounting for
these types of factors, we are likely to overstate the importance of political competition on
political selection. Third, with empirical evidence so uniformly in favor of one version of the
theory that makes competition look good, one cannot help but wonder how much publication
bias is at play. While it is always difficult to induce sufficient excitement to publish a null
result, it is even more so if the null result is based on a poor research design. Without a
credible empirical strategy, such as an RDD to lean on, the literature has yet to establish
convincing evidence on the relationship between political competition and candidate quality.
    Although we are far from being able to causally estimate the extent to which political
competition affects political selection, we have made some nice progress in identifying effects
that bear some relation to competition. Beath, Christia, Egorov, and Enikolopov (2016)
study the effects of electoral rules on political selection through a randomized experiment
in villages in Afghanistan. As part of a community-driven development project, villages
received block grants in order to fund local public goods. A precondition for receiving these
block grants was that villages were required to create an elected community development
council. The experiment randomized whether the councilors were elected based on an at-
large system or on single-member-district elections. We interpret the latter as constraining
political competition. Elected officials from the at-large elections were found to be more
educated than those elected from single-member-district elections. Unfortunately, the authors
do not present evidence regarding the effects on the entire candidate pool.
    The literature on the impact of political reservations on political selection provides another
nice example of studies relying on plausibly exogenous variation in the rules of political

                                               25
representation. For instance, since the 1990s India has reserved political positions at the local
level for women and for two disadvantaged minority groups – scheduled castes and scheduled
tribes. If the effect of a political reservation is to increase (to 100%) the probability that
a candidate from a certain group gets elected, one could construe reservations as lowering
competition. Then a natural question to ask is whether political reservations induce lower
quality candidates to run. An attractive feature of the setting is that the elections in which
districts were subject to these reservations are determined exogenously.
    Based on this variation, the evidence seems to indicate across various measures that
political reservations have a negative effect on the quality of officials. In an important study
by Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) on the effects of female reservations on public goods
provision, they show that in the villages with reserved female pradhans, the leaders tended
to be less educated, less experienced, have fewer household assets, and less likely to have
received any formal training. Lamba and Spears (2013) provide indirect evidence of the
effect of caste-based reservation on leadership quality. They show that reserved villages are
less likely to receive a cash award for reducing open defecation.
    However, it is not necessarily clear that the negative impacts of quotas extend outside of
India or persist over time. Besley, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017) examine the effects of
the introduction of a “zipper quota” in Sweden, which led to women and men being listed on
ballots in alternating order. They found that this policy increased the earnings capacity of
elected officials, driven by an increase in the quality of male elected politicians. Baltrunaite,
Bello, Casarico, and Profeta (2014) find that levels of education and relevance of previous
occupation among elected politicians also increase after the introduction of gender quotas in
Italy. Bagues and Campa (2017) find that municipal-level quotas in Spain increase female
representation without discernible effects on quality or the promotion of women to positions
of higher influence.
    Overall, the effect of reservations seems to indicate that the characteristics of the un-
derlying population from which candidates emerge matter. Securing the representation of
disadvantaged groups with serious shortages of human capital may mechanically reduce the
quality of elected politicians in the short run. This is more likely to occur in the local context
in India, where human capital asymmetries are large, and less likely to occur in Sweden where
said asymmetries are smaller. These considerations suggest a potential tension between rep-
resentation and competence: a society where no group has a monopoly on representation,
but where instead all groups are represented, may have to make room to less educated politi-
cians. Dal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017) take up the study of this tension
in Sweden. Although it is true that members of the working classes have on average lower
competence scores than members of economic elites, politicians from the working class are
as much or even more positively selected, diluting the tension between broad representation
and competence.

4.5    Does group size and cohesion improve the quality of politicians
       from the group?
Another prediction from our model relates to the impact of group size and cohesion on the
quality of politicians. To our knowledge only two papers have explicitly studied the effect of
group size and partisanship on candidate quality. Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016) examine
the role of caste-based politics in India on the supply of local public goods. Using panel data
from India across three elections, they show that when the population share of the largest
eligible caste passes a threshold of 0.5, the schooling of the elected representative increases
by almost 2 years. The authors interpret this finding in the context of a model in which each
ethnic group runs a candidate who maximizes the collective benefit of the group, net of his
effort and opportunity cost. Because more competent representatives deliver higher levels of
public goods, it is in the group’s interest to run a high quality type. To ensure that the high
quality type is willing to run given that his opportunity cost is higher, the model further
assumes that the group can commit to ex-post transfers. Thus, once the largest ethnic group
becomes sufficiently numerous to become politically viable, we will see an increase in the
quality of the elected politician.
    This finding stands in contrast to the study by Banerjee and Pande (2009), also in India.
They argue that in places with a dominant population group, the more citizens care about
identity politics, the worse the quality of the political representation will be. The reason is
that stronger concern for group identity makes the larger group’s electoral advantage more
unassailable. These authors derive their prediction from a model that captures one aspect
of ours, namely a strictly statistical effect: suppose candidates are drawn at random from a
distribution, and the probability of winning depends both on candidate valence and electoral
strength of the party/group - then electorally stronger groups may win even when drawing the
lower valence candidate. To test this claim, they assemble a dataset that combines electoral
data from 1980 and 1996 with microdata on the corruption records of Indian politicians from
the state of Uttar Pradesh. They find that when voters are more likely to vote along caste
lines, winner quality is lower in jurisdictions where she or he is from the majority party
relative to jurisdictions where her or his party represents the minority.
    That these two intriguing studies took in place in India, in a setting where group identity is
well defined, is unlikely to be a coincidence. In other contexts, the notion of group formation
and group identity are likely to be much more endogenous, which makes identifying the effects
of group size on political selection even more challenging.


5     Conclusion
The research on political selection has come a long way since Besley (2005) and Persson and
Tabellini (2000) surveyed the literature almost two decades ago. We know a lot more about
who becomes a politician and why. These insights have the potential to affect policy in ways
that could improve the quality of politicians and governance more generally.
   There is, however, still plenty to be learned. In particular, there are at least five major


                                               27
gaps in the literature that will hopefully be addressed by the next time this literature is
resurveyed, maybe two decades from now.
    First, how does valence affect performance? We have a general sense that valence matters,
or at least that it matters to voters. But we have a poor understanding of the ways in which it
matters. Does it matter through the types of policies that are set and/or through how given
policies are implemented? What are the dimensions of valence that affect performance, and
how should we adjust the rewards from office to attract individuals who possess these traits?
Such questions will undoubtedly require not only new sources of data, but also additional
guidance from theory. If such theory is to take advantage of our simple model, it will be
important to add some notion of accountability in order to better capture the incentives office
holders face.
    Second, political parties likely play a major role in who becomes a politician, and yet we
have a very limited understanding of how political parties recruit and screen their candidates.
The literature on primaries (e.g., Hirano and Snyder (2014)) is a promising step in this
direction, but in the end it is only one of the many ways parties select their candidates. We
need a much more comprehensive understanding of party objectives, governance structures,
and strategies, and how these factors shape the quality of the political class. Models such as
those by Carrillo and Mariotti (2001), Caillaud and Tirole (2002), Besley, Persson, and Sturm
(2010), Galasso and Nannicini (2011), Mattozzi and Merlo (2015), Galasso and Nannicini
(2017), and Besley, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2017) provide a valuable start.
    Third, while we have made progress in documenting some of the financial rewards of
political office and how they affect political selection, we are still missing evidence on non-
financial returns. Motives such as prestige or the desire to perform one’s civic duty could play
even larger roles in determining selection patterns. Different types of rewards may also hold
differential interest to candidates with different types of valence. Higher wages seem effective
in attracting more competent individuals who face higher opportunity costs. Attracting more
honest types, however, whose opportunity costs may be unrelated to their type, may require
improvements in other types of reward (or punishment) schemes. Progress – both theoretical
and empirical – on this theme is needed.
    Fourth, we need to better understand the relationship between political competition and
valence for both the elected and non-elected. Thus far, the empirical evidence has consisted
of observational studies mostly limited to the valence of the elected candidates. We still do
not have clear evidence, causal or otherwise, on whether political competition improves the
quality of the candidate pool as a whole.
    Finally, despite some pioneering efforts, the empirical relationship between candidate
quality and group size and cohesion is largely unexplored. How to deal with the endogeneity
of group size or cohesion is a daunting empirical challenge that remains to be conquered.
But given the importance of parochial politics and ethnic divisions in determining the way
we vote and the way public resources are distributed, it is a relationship that should attract
more attention in the years to come.

7     Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1: We separate the analysis for the cases with c (vj ) = 1 and
c (vj ) = vj , j = r, l. We start with the first one.
    Constant costs (c (vj ) = 1)
    As stated in the main text, a candidate with type vj runs iff
                                                             

In order to develop the expressions in the right hand side we postulate the existence of
the equilibrium described in the proposition, namely one in which candidates run iff their
type is above a cutoff vj∗ , where vj∗ is the equilibrium choice among possible cutoff choices
vj0 ∈ [0, v̄j ]. In this case, the type v−j of candidates that j may confront is drawn from a
uniform distribution in v 0−j , v̄−j . Candidates with types vl and vr then want to run iff,
                                    

respectively,

cutoff choices vl0 , vr0 are strategically independent, and that the right hand side of both condi-
tions is decreasing in the respective own types vl , vr . Therefore candidates run iff their types
vl , vr satisfy the respective conditions,

Assuming without loss of generality that r is the electorally strong party (ρR ≥ (1 − ρ) L),
it is immediate that we have an interior equilibrium whenever v̄r 1b + x < v̄l and v̄l 1b > x.
     Increasing costs (c (vj ) = vj )
     The inequality in (5) governing candidate j’s decision to run becomes,

We look for an equilibrium where l candidates enter iff vl ∈ [0, vl∗ ] and the r candidates enter
if vr ∈ [0, vr∗ ] and where, since x ≥ 0 we also have vr∗ ≥ vl∗ . Given a putative cutoff vj0 , and
an equilibrium where candidates run as long as vj ≤ vj0 , the probability candidate j runs is

In an equilibrium where all types up to a given cutoff run, the left hand side in these inequal-
ities must (start higher and) decrease faster in vj than the right hand side, requiring b < v̄−j
for j = r, l, as assumed.
    We first rule out vl∗ > vr∗ . Since vl∗ ≤ b (to ensure P (l wins)b ≥ c(vl ) = vl ), it must be
true that vr∗ < b. But consider a type who is not running vr = b − ε with 0 < ε < b − vr∗ .
                                                                       ε
For this
     n type theoleft hand side of the running condition (10) reads b and the right hand side
          v ∗ −b+ε−x
min 0, l v̄l        < εb implying this type strictly prefers to run, yielding a contradiction, so
vl∗ > vr∗ cannot hold in equilibrium.
    If there is an equilibrium, it must be the case that vr∗ ≥ vl∗ . Thus, a type vr = vr∗ wins
for certain and therefore in equilibrium we cannot have vr∗ < b (if this held, then there would
be a type v̂r > vr∗ for whom P (r wins | vr = v̂r ) = 1 and b > v̂r so running would be
strictly profitable). Also, we cannot have vr∗ > b (candidates with vr > b would make a loss
as c(vr ) = vr > b). Therefore, in equilibrium we can only have vr∗ = b. Given this, the l
candidate would run iff:

                        ≥ min 1 −              , 1 ⇔ vl ≤ b 1 −              ≡ vl∗ .

                                                                                     b
Types vl ∈ [0, x] stand no chance in a contested election. But types vl ∈ 0, v̄r (v̄r − b) are
                                                                         h                i
willing to run just in the off-chance that r does not run. Types vl ∈ v̄br (v̄r − b) , vl∗ are only
willing to run given they stand a chance in a contest, and since x ≤ v̄br (v̄r − b), they do. It is
easy to check that all r candidates with vr ≤ b prefer to run, completing the characterization
of the equilibrium.
    Proof of Proposition 3:
    We first tackle the case of a constant cost of running, and deal with the case of increasing
costs right after.
    (i) Constant costs (c (vj ) = 1)
    We study the expression (7) under the restriction v̄l = v̄r = v̄. We will also evaluate a
number of expressions at the point of symmetry where x = 0 and thus vr∗ = vl∗ and standard
continuity considerations will extend the result to a neighborhood near the point of symmetry.

   We first analyze the “candidate quality” effect ( dE(v|rdbalone) P (r alone)+ dE(v|ldbalone) P (l alone)+

E (v|both) (the expected quality of the winner in a contest) decreases in b is more tedious to
show. A sketch of the steps is as follows:

After some algebra, and taking x → 0 so vl∗ → vr∗ , one can show the above expression to be

hand side.
    We next show the competitive effect to be positive. Since as just established, under
                                  ∗
electoral symmetry Ξ > v̄+v     2
                                    , the competitive effect is positive whenever an increase in b raises
P (both) and decreases P (j alone),j = r, l. Since P (both) = 1 − P (l alone) − P (r alone) it
sufficient to show dP (jdbalone) < 0; j = r, l which are the same under symmetry.

which is negative iff (vl∗ − (v̄ − vr∗ )) (v̄ 2 − vr∗ vl∗ ) < (v̄ − vr∗ ) vl∗ (vl∗ + vr∗ ) ,which then using sym-
metry becomes v̄ (v̄ − v ∗ ) > (v̄ − v ∗ ) v ∗ which is true. Thus, the preceding argument estab-
lishes the potential for ambiguity in a neighborhood around symmetry. Additional straight-
forward algebra shows that as x → 0 the addition of the candidate quality and competition
effects A + B becomes negative - in the limit the candidate quality effect dominates the
competition effect.

From proposition 2, an increase in b raises cutoffs vl∗ , vr∗ if x is small enough, and it is
straightforward to show that this implies dP (both)

if the competitive effect leads E (v|both) to be larger than E (v|r alone) and E (v|l alone)
(which must be true under symmetry) the sum of terms in A will be positive. Since higher
cutoffs increase E (v|r alone) , E (v|l alone) and E (v|both), the effect must be overall positive,
proving the result. That dE(v|rdbalone) > 0, dE(v|ldbalone) > 0 is obvious. We now confirm that
under electoral symmetry we find dE(v|both)  db

                                    dv ∗
from the fact that Ξ < v ∗ , and     db
