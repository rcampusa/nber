Between 1660 and 1830, Parliament passed thousands of acts restructuring rights to real and equitable
estates. These estate acts enabled individuals and families to sell, mortgage, lease, exchange, and improve
land previously bound by inheritance rules and other legal legacies. The loosening of these legal constraints
facilitated the reallocation of land and resources towards higher-value uses. Data reveals correlations
between estate acts, urbanization, and economic development during the decades surrounding the Industrial
Revolution.

1. Introduction

         Between 1660 and 1830, Britain’s Parliament passed roughly 3,500 acts altering

individuals’ and families’ rights to real and equitable estates, principally rights to land and

permanent fixtures, such as buildings and mines, upon the land. The volume of these acts, which

we refer to as estate acts, exceeded the volume of all other legislation, with the exception of acts

establishing statutory authorities and enclosure commissions. Concerning the latter, a large

literature exists. Few scholars, however, have studied estate acts. As a result, fundamental

questions remain unanswered. What was the economic rationale underlying estate legislation?

What were estate acts’ economic effects?

         This essay answers these questions by analyzing several sources seldom studied by

economic historians. The first is a database containing all estate acts passed by Parliament

between 1660 and 1830, constructed by the authors.1 The second is a series of parliamentary

reports including the First Report of His Majesty’s Commissioners Respecting Real Property and

the Report from the Select Committee on House of Commons Officers and Fees.2 The third is the

Journals of the House of Commons.3 The fourth is the Middlesex Deeds Registry.4 These

sources reveal rationales for estate legislation.

        Estate acts were necessary because the inheritance system – known as strict settlements –

created equitable estates in land (enforced by the court of Chancery) on top of real estates in land

(enforced by common law courts). These overlapping estates involved numerous individuals,

including the landholder, his extended family, additional beneficiaries designated by past

landholders, and all potential heirs (including those unborn). All of these individuals possessed

rights to revenues derived from the land. These complicated bundles of overlapping rights

prevented property holders from using resources as they saw fit. Landholders could neither

mortgage, nor lease, nor sell much of the land under their control. Landholders had to dedicate

large tracts of land to traditional tasks. Landlords could not cut timber or mine coal unless

explicitly authorized to do so. Landholders could neither utilize resources in new ways nor

improve infrastructure without reaching agreements with all other parties possessing interests in

a parcel, and such agreements could not, in most cases, be enforced by law, but could, in many

instances, be challenged through courts. Conveying land to new parties proved particularly

problematic. The Chancery Court emphasized the security of beneficial interests (even minor and

tangential) rather than the rights of purchasers (however deserving and efficiency enhancing).

This inflexible system posed problems for people trying to exploit opportunities arising from

technologies unanticipated in decades past.

        Estate acts loosened these constraints by permitting previously prohibited actions,

reorganizing complicated bundles of rights, and conveying those new rights to new users. Estate

acts began as petitions from landholders seeking relief from restrictions that strict settlements

imposed on the employment of land and resources. Parliament reviewed these petitions, ensured

that they met certain standards for protecting the rights of all interested parties, and then passed

legislation establishing new rules regarding the employment and conveyance of property. Most

estate acts authorized the sale, lease, or improvement of land. In layman’s language, estate acts

freed land from the shackles of the past and exposed land to the invisible hand. In economic

terms, estate acts reduced transaction costs and enabled landholders to undertake activities that

they could not take given existing property-rights arrangements and legal institutions.

       It should be expected that reducing transaction costs facilitated the reallocation of

resources to new and superior uses. Case studies and quantitative evidence indicate that this was

the case. Concentrations of estate acts occurred in urbanizing areas, such as the periphery of

London, and in industrializing regions, such as the county of Lancaster. Correlations between

estate legislation, urbanization, and industrialization suggest a link between the reorganization of

property rights and Britain’s march towards modernity.

       A companion paper (Bogart and Richardson 2008b) illuminates quantitative

characteristics of estate legislation. It demonstrates, for example, that landholders from all walks

of life employed estate acts to alter rights to land that they possessed. The preponderance of the

land affected by estate acts lay in England. A minority lay in Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. A

small fraction lay in colonies overseas. An appendix contains a series of tables presenting an

array of information, including chronological and cross-sectional data series, with which scholars

can test our hypotheses or advance their own.

       Another companion paper advances a broader argument (Bogart and Richardson 2008a).

At the end of the seventeenth century, Parliament established multiple forums where rights to

land and resources could be reorganized. These forums served individuals, families, and

communities by issuing estate, enclosure, and statutory authority acts. These forums enabled

property rights to adapt to changing economic conditions. The paper employs historical




                                                 3
evidence, archival data, and statistical analysis to demonstrate that between 1700 and 1830,

Parliament passed an increasing number of acts reorganizing property rights in response to

increases in the demand for such acts. Tests with placebo groups confirm the robustness of this

result.

          Together, these essays lay the foundation for our broader hypothesis. Institutional

adaptability facilitated Britain’s transition from a medieval to a modern property-rights system.

Britain was the first nation to make this transition and the only European empire to make the

transition gradually and peacefully. The transition occurred in the decades following the

Glorious Revolution and may be one reason that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain. Our

emphasis differs from Douglas North and Barry Weingast (1989), who argue that following the

Glorious Revolution, security against sovereign expropriation fostered the growth of capital

markets. Scholars – including Gregory Clark and Patrick O’Brien (1994) – dispute the accuracy

of that assertion. We emphasize that Parliament’s actions lowered transaction costs, increased the

security of conveyance, and restructured property rights in ways that enhanced efficiency.

          The argument that we advance in this series of papers addresses issues of broad academic

interest. Social scientists often note that developed and developing nations differ in the nature of

their property rights’ regimes. Hernando de Soto (2000) observes, for example, that in

developing nations, inflexible and opaque rules regarding property prevent citizens from

converting assets, which they hold in abundance, into capital, the medium of the modern market

economy. Ronald Coase (1960, 1974) observes that attaining economic efficiency in the

presence of transaction costs requires the proper definition and allocation of rights. Common and

statutory law recognized this principle in nineteenth-century Britain, Coase argues, and by

assigning property rights to maximize productivity, fostered British economic ascendance.




                                                   4
Richard Posner (2003) emphasizes a related issue. According to Posner, common-law legal

systems foster economic efficiency because judicial decisions “allocate responsibilities between

people engaged in interacting activities in such a way as to maximize the joint value, or, what

amounts to the same thing, minimize the joint cost of the activities (Posner 2003 p. 98).” Like

Coase, Posner corroborates his claim with historical examples.

       This essay adds new observations to the historical corpus. In the eighteenth century,

when the British economy entered an unparalleled era of expansion, Britain’s Parliament began

operating according to Coasian principles and reorganized property rights en masse. In the

nineteenth century, when most common-law doctrines reached their modern form, doctrines of

equity (enforced through the Chancery Court) dominated the conveyance of land. These

doctrines were designed to protect beneficial interests, not to maximize productivity. Efficiency

became a dominant doctrine in the English legal system only after Parliamentary intervention.

       The rest of this essay advances our argument. Section 2 provides historical background,

principally by describing the system of strict settlements and English law governing equitable

and real estates. Section 3 sketches our economic interpretation of the equitable and real

property, principally by elucidating how the system of strict settlements contributed to high (and

often prohibitive) transaction costs and the insecurity of conveyance. Section 4 contains case

studies that illuminate real-world problems posed by the system of strict settlements. Section 5

discusses how estate acts solved these problems, lowered transaction costs, and facilitated the

reallocation of resources. Section 6 reveals correlations between the number of estate acts in

each county and the rate of urbanization. Section 7 discusses the implications of our analysis. It

focuses on broad issues, such as how the development of Britain’s property-rights system

fostered economic development.

2. Strict Settlements

         Estate acts arose from an English system of inheritance that solidified around the Civil

War of the 1640s and prevailed for several centuries thereafter. During this era, large landowners

held most of their land under settlement. Lesser gentry and yeoman families also employed the

legal device, even on single family farms. While estimates vary, at the peak, at least one-quarter

and as much as three-fourths of land in England was strictly settled.5

         A settlement served several principal purposes. The first was to keep a family’s estate

together for future generations. A settlement dictated that the estate descend intact from one

generation to the next. It did this by assigning control of the estate to a single heir, usually the

eldest son of the current holder. A second purpose was to care for the extended family. A

settlement did this by assigning stipends to relatives such as children, grandchildren, widows,

cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces. Some individuals received periodic payments, such

as monthly or annual stipends. Other individuals received lump sums, often upon marriage or

reaching the age of adulthood.

         A settlement was a generic name for a property transaction and for the documents created

in its consummation. Settlement deeds contained six common elements. The premises listed the

names, occupations, and ranks of the parties involved, including the trustees. The recitals and

testatum described the property to be settled and the purpose of the settlement. The habendum

contained the trusts imposed upon the property, such as jointures (payments to widows) and

portions (payments to younger children). The entails set out the order of succession, established

life-estates for living heirs, and established a series of fee tail estates for unborn heirs. The

    Some of the best known works describing the system of strict settlements are Thompson (1963, 1994), Eileen
    (1964, 1983, 1993), Baker (1971) English and Saville (1983), Beckett (1984), Habakkuk (1994), and Cannadine
    (1994).


                                                       6
powers described what the life tenants and trustees could do with the estate (English and Saville,

1983, pp. 19-21).

       Many features of settlements influenced the use and allocation of property. The holder of

settled land was not the absolute owner. The holder was merely a life tenant of an estate. The

land belonged to a trust, for which the holder was named the beneficiary. The holder, in turn,

held the land in trust for other beneficiaries, typically including his wife, children, unborn

descendants, all potential future heirs, and members of his extended family, such as his brothers,

sisters, nieces, nephews, and other descendants of previous holders of the estate. The life tenant

controlled the use of the land possessed by the nested trusts as long as the life tenant fulfilled the

terms of his stewardship. This legal structure – a trust within a trust – kept settlements from

being adjudicated in common law courts. The common law did not recognize such legal

structures. Only the Chancery court recognized and enforced such arrangements.

       Settlements restricted the uses to which resources could be put. The holder of a settled

estate (who was just a life tenant) could not grant leases lasting beyond his life and could not

grant leases from which he benefited at the expense of his successors (such as leases in which

tenants paid lump sums up front in return for concessions). The holder of a settled estate could

not sell, exchange, or mortgage the property. If he completed such transactions, he could be held

liable for damages to the estate, and the transaction could be voided, because he had no power to

transfer title. Similarly, the holder of an estate could not alter the property, even if he considered

the alterations to be an improvement. The removal of trees, hedges, and buildings, the opening of

new mines, quarries, and peat bogs, and the conversion of arable lands into pasture (or vice

versa) could be considered waste. All those who benefited from such actions could be liable for

damages, if upon inheriting an estate, the successor claimed to have been harmed by the acts.




                                                  7
Sales, exchanges, mortgages, improvements, and long-term leases could only be undertaken if

the powers section of a settlement contained specific clauses authorizing such actions.

Settlements written in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries seldom provided such powers.

By the nineteenth century, settlements became increasingly sophisticated, and tended to provide

broader powers to estate holders.

           A settlement legally bound the hands of all heirs alive when it was written. A settlement

could not be changed until a tenant in tail (i.e. the next in line to inherit) who was born after the

date of settlement came of age (i.e. reached age 21). Then, the current life tenant (usually the

father) and the future tenant in tail (usually the son) could remove the entail by the legal process

of common recovery. This procedure involved a collusive lawsuit concerning a fictitious

transaction backed by a warranty to recover land of equal value in fee simple should the

warrantor default.6 This legal trick would have enabled the life tenant alone to break the entail in

the absence of the strict settlement, which lawyers devised to block common recovery, by

creating an equitable estate protected by the Chancery courts, which life tenants could not break.

           Whenever possible, families resettled estates when the heir apparent reached the age of

majority and/or when the heir apparent married. Resettlements at age of majority protected the

interests of the extended family, who would lose their legal claim to financial support if an heir

born after the date of settlement (and therefore unbound by the settlements’ provisions and

entail) inherited the estate. Resettlement at time of marriage protected the interests of the wife,

who needed means of support should she outlive her husband; the wife’s children, who needed to

be placed first-in line for succession; and the in-laws, who usually contributed land to the estate,

and who in certain circumstances, might regain that land or enter the line of succession.

                                                          8
       These facts ensured that families kept their land settled at almost all times and that

settlements could be changed only infrequently, at intervals of two or more decades, as a family

waited for an heir to come of age and for the father and son to reach an agreement about

restructuring the estate. The time to resettlement could be greatly lengthened if the life tenant

died without a surviving son and the estate passed to a male relative who was a child when the

settlement was written. The entail would bind such an heir until he bore a son who reached the

age of twenty one.

       Settlements restricted powers for several reasons. Restrictions prevented the holder of the

estate from dissipating resources dedicated to the support of future heirs and the extended family.

Another reason was powers’ uncertain effects on the legal stability of the settlement. In the late

seventeenth century, settlements were a novel legal form. Settlements with expansive powers had

not been tested in the Chancery court. Chancery interpreted settlements conservatively and

presumed that life tenants did not possess powers that were not explicitly described in

documents. Landholders could not predict how the court would react to the inclusion of

additional powers or whether the wording of a novel clause might provide a life tenant with a

loophole enabling him to circumvent all other restrictions.

       Landholders also did not know the personality of the person(s) who would inherit their

estates. Settlements were designed to last far into the future. Settlements dictated that if possible,

the estate descend from first son to first son, but disease and demographics dictated that estates

occasionally shifted from the direct paternal line, and cousins, minor children, or distant relatives

might inherit. This person would have power over the widow, dependants, and descendants of

the individual who established the settlement. Providing too much power to the life tenant of the




                                                  9
estate, particularly when the wording of clauses providing powers had not been tested in court,

put the interests of other members of the family at risk.

         Uncertainty about the impact of providing powers to the life tenants and the threat that

powers might pose to the interests of the extended family meant that landholders only included

extensive and/or novel powers when doing so promised lucrative returns. In the seventeenth

century, when the settlement system evolved, technology changed slowly. Economic progress

proceeded at a slow pace. The problems posed by expansive powers probably outweighed the

potential benefits, at least in the eyes of the wealthy families, which typically bound land in

restrictive settlements. Most of those families felt that reorganizing resources once each

generation, when the family resettled its estates, would ensure the family employed resources

optimally. As the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries progressed, however, the pace of

technological change accelerated and economic opportunities arose more often. Families needed

new and flexible ways of managing estates. Simultaneously, courts and lawyers gained

experience with particular clauses providing particular powers, and the risk of including these

clauses in settlements declined. These circumstances meant that restrictive settlements became

increasingly inefficient.

         Market transactions could not easily alleviate these inefficiencies because conducting

transactions and enforcing contracts on settled land could be costly, uncertain, and insecure.

Settlements were long, complex documents, traditionally unpunctuated, and full of repetition.7

Interpreting settlements required experience, skill, detailed knowledge of the document, and a

large library of property laws, precedents, and legal texts estimated at 674 volumes in 1826

(English and Saville, 1983, p. 18). Public libraries did not contain these volumes. The public also


7
    The fact that until the Conveyancing Act of 1881, solicitors were paid for conveyances by the word (1s for every
    72 words in 1862), did not encourage conciseness (England and Saville, 1983, p. 18).


                                                        10
lacked access to information about Chancery courts proceedings and precedents, because the

court did not keep detailed written records of its proceedings until the later seventeenth century.

Settlements themselves were not part of the public record. Copies of the deeds were usually held

by the life tenants, trustees, lawyers, and maybe members of the extended family. Settlements

had to be consulted before taking out mortgages, drawing up leases, or completing sales, because

if the settlement did not specifically authorize a transaction, the transaction could be voided.

Ambiguities in settlements often deterred individuals from transacting on estates, for fear that the

transactions would be disputed by other beneficiaries.

       Another source of confusion was settlements multilayered structures. Strict settlements

established equitable estates, which created a trust within a trust and gave beneficiaries rights to

income from a family’s real estates. Equitable estates were enforced in the Chancery court. A

real estate was a set of rights to land and permanent fixtures, such as buildings and mines, upon

the land. Real rights of many forms existed, the most common and consequential were feudal

tenures. Tenures (and other rights to real property) were enforced in common law courts.

       The next section of this essay elaborates on the transaction costs created by the system of

strict settlements. The discussion covers a wide range of issues in the laws governing equitable

and real estates. The discussion explains how the overlapping equitable and real estates impeded

the reallocation of resources and reduced the security of conveyancing (i.e. of transferring land

among owners).


3. Transaction Costs Created by Strict Settlements

       The Coase Theorem revolves around a pivotal point. Transaction costs – particularly the

expense, certainty, enforceability, and feasibility of contracting – determine property rights’

economic effects. Low transaction costs yield environments in which the assignment of rights



                                                 11
influences the distribution of wealth, but not the allocation of resources among competing tasks

or the efficiency of market outcomes. High transaction costs yield environments in which the

assignment of rights affects the allocation of resources, the efficiency of markets, and the

distribution of income. The transaction costs associated with the system of strict settlements

were, as this section shows, often high and occasionally prohibitive.

       A settlement created an estate in equity with a plethora of participants. These included

the life tenant, current dependents, and potential heirs. The life tenant made decisions concerning

the management of the estate, subject to the terms of the settlement, which limited his powers,

obligated him to carry out the wishes of his ancestors, compelled him to care for members of his

extended family, and ensured that he did not take actions that prejudiced the interests of heirs to

come. Dependents and heirs could defend their interests, if they believed them to be neglected or

attacked, through the Chancery court and other judicial venues.

       The settlement was, in other words, an intergenerational bargain within an extended

family. The costs of renegotiating the agreement rose with the size of the family, the diversity of

its members (and their interests), the complexity of the settlement, and the intricacies of the

bargain to be struck. Life tenants who wished to undertake actions beyond the bounds of their

powers had to convince all parties of the settlement to concur. Otherwise, other parties to the

settlement could hold up the transaction, by claiming that their interests were affected, and bring

actions in various legal venues.

       Economic transactions between life tenants and third parties – such as purchasing

property from, leasing land from, or mining coal on a settled estate – created additional

complications. For simplicity, we refer to all potential third parties as ‘entrepreneurs.’ We begin

by considering the case of an entrepreneur hoping to strike a deal with a life tenant who




                                                 12
possessed powers to sell, lease, and/or improve his land, and explain how settlements

complicated transactions even with empowered owners. Later, we discuss the problems of

transaction with owners lacking such powers.

       Deals between life tenants and entrepreneurs often foundered because of problems posed

by settlements. One problem was lack of public information concerning the contents of

settlements. Settlements were not public records. Copies of them existed in no public repository.

Entrepreneurs could only get information about settlements from life tenants themselves or

perhaps from other private parties with copies of the documents. Interpreting these documents

might be difficult, because settlements represented intergenerational bargains among extended

families. Implicit understandings of longstanding might influence families’ relations. Families

might interpret and enforce their bargains internally. Differences might exist between the

settlement as written and the bargain as implemented. If families resolved the issue amongst

themselves, ambiguities might exist in the documents that had not been tested in court or

reworked with lawyers.

       Ambiguities in settlements were a common concern. Ambiguity existed in part because

of uncertainty about how the Chancery would interpret the wording of documents disputed

before them. Chancery began to adjudicate large numbers of settlements only in the eighteenth

century. These early settlements were conservative, or strict, providing few powers to life

tenants. Chancery developed experience dealing with these laconic compacts, but how Chancery

would interpret novel wordings and powers remained uncertain. Solicitors and barristers

lamented this fact even in the nineteenth century.

       Another complication arose from the long and variable statutes of limitations concerning

the conveyance of land. English law lacked a set length of time after which an individual who




                                                13
purchased land honestly and enjoyed undisputed proprietorship was secure in his title. The length

of time after which an individual knew he was secure against claims of adverse possession

depended upon the method of conveyance via which they acquired the land, the type of tenure

under which they held the land, the existence of settlements and entails, the existence of prior

rights or conveyances, and the existence of writs or other legal remedies available to potential

plaintiffs. For example,

        The time limitation in a writ of right is sixty years, that in a formedon, a writ in the nature
        of a writ of right, and one of the remedies to recover a mere right of property, is only
        twenty years; whilst in the possessory actions of mort d’ancestor and novel disseisin, fifty
        years is the limitation for writs founded on ancestor’s possession, and thirty years for
        writs founded on the claimant’s own possession (BPP 1829 p. 132).

Many actions undertaken in the court of Chancery possessed no statute of limitations.

        These long, variable, and at times unlimited periods meant that entrepreneurs purchasing

land from settled estates had to be concerned that their purchase could be disputed far into the

future. Entrepreneurs had to fear “pocket conveyances” and “pocket settlements” which might

appear decades in the future giving other parties the ability to dispute the entrepreneurs’

possession of the property. These fears were exacerbated by a legal principal that prevented

trustees of land from providing receipt for payments for land that they sold. Only the beneficiary

of the trust could provide proper receipt for payments. The life tenant of a settled estate was the

beneficiary of a trust that held the land for his use, and thus, could provide receipt for his own

interests, but the life tenant was also a trustee for the tenant in tail, all other potential heirs, and

everyone in his extended family that received support via the settlement. The life tenant could

not provide receipt for payments meant to buy out their interests. Thus, an entrepreneur wishing

to purchase land from a settled estate had to have written receipts from all interested parties, no

matter how remote, to ensure that they did not dispute the fact of his payment. If he did not




                                                    14
acquire written receipts from all interested parties, even those he did not know about, he could be

forced to pay again. Even if he acquired receipts, he could also be forced to pay again if he

delivered the payment to the trustees, rather than the beneficiaries, and the trustees took the

money for themselves and denied it to their charges.

       In 1829, a leading barrister, J. J. Park, described this problem to a Parliamentary

commission in these terms.

       The doctrine of seeing to the application of purchase money, in cases where there is a
       trust or authority to sell, appear to me to be one of the false steps of the English law.
       Every principle of common sense, of justice, and of convenience, dictates that the party
       who places a confidence in another respecting his property should be the sufferer, if that
       confidence should be misplaced, rather than an innocent person who has acted bona fide.
       If A. intrusts B. to sell his estate, and I buy it, and pay B. the money, which he embezzles,
       it is preposterous to say that A. can with justice require me to pay the price over again.
       He was the agent of A., not of me; I did not select him (BPP 1829 p. 169).

Complaints about this problem of paying twice appear numerous times in the testimony collected

by the Parliamentary commission and the literature on legal history.

       One reason for this rule regarding receipts was a precaution of courts in favor of parties

beneficially interested. This precaution pervaded legal doctrines concerning trusts and estates,

and particularly influenced the proceedings in Chancery, which was a court of equity where

parties sought equitable relief and courts sought outcomes according to “equity and good

conscience (Baker 1971 p. 129).” In 1829, when testifying before the Parliamentary commission

concerning real property, John Bell esquire, the King’s Counsel, stated that “I think we have got

into difficulties by an anxiety to protect against breaches of trust (BPP 1829 p. 235).” This

anxiety meant that “in order to prevent fraud, courts have borne too hard upon trustees, and

thereby prevented proper persons from accepting trusts who would otherwise have done [so]

(BPP 1829 p. 235).” The predisposition towards protecting the beneficiaries of trusts often

prevented trustees from taking actions that maximized the value of the assets under their



                                                 15
supervision. For example, trustees who sold land to raise cash for beneficiaries (for purposes

stipulated in a settlement) could not purchase the property if they believed it was selling for too

low a price. The predisposition could also lead to the punishment of trustees who exceeded their

authority to invest funds in projects that paid high. The King’s Counsel emphasized this point by

describing an often mentioned case from Chancery court in which a trustee lent money on West

Indian mortgages and earned his charges “a very large sum on the whole by this management of

the property,” but on one transaction, lost money when the mortgagee failed. The beneficiaries

sued. When deciding the case, Chancellor Lord Tharlow wrote “he was extremely sorry to

charge the trustees with the loss, but he felt bound to do it (BPP 1829 p. 235).”

        Now, consider the position of an entrepreneur hoping to strike a deal for the purchase of

land locked in a settled estate that the life tenant lacked the power to sell. What were the

entrepreneur’s options? The entrepreneur could wait for the family to resettle the estate. Then,

the family could add the necessary powers to the document. The wait might last for years,

depending on the length of time a tenant in tail who was born after the writing of the current

settlement took to reach the age of adulthood.

       The other option was to strike a bargain that all of the parties to the settlement would

adhere to voluntarily until either (a) the family could rewrite the settlement and/or (b) until the

entrepreneur possessed the land long enough for the title to be secure against claims of adverse

possession. Enforcing such a bargain might be difficult, for several reasons. First, transactions

such as this were seldom repeated, and certainly not repeated the infinite or indefinite number of

times needed to sustain cooperation via trigger strategies (a typical way in which self-enforcing

agreements arise). Second, adherence to the bargain depended only in part on the parties’

economic interests and also on personal relations. Extended families could be complicated




                                                 16
emotional arenas, where jealousy, desire, love, hope, hate, antipathy, and revenge might motivate

individuals to take unexpected, and at times, economically irrational actions. Entrepreneurs’

must have been reluctant to sink large sums into projects which might be halted when siblings

fought, or children rebelled, or distant cousins fell in or out of love. Third, parties who wanted to

defect from the agreement could do so at low financial cost, because equity and common law

courts gave them quick and inexpensive mechanisms to assert their rights against parties that

illegally held land or violated covenants of trust. Fourth, the entrepreneur faced problems of

fraud from the family, which might promise to provide him with certain lands at a certain price,

but which could back out of the deal or hold him up for larger sums after he had sunk significant

investments, perhaps by ex-ante establishing exit strategies of which the entrepreneur was not

aware. One possibility would be to create ‘pocket conveyances,’ which transferred property to

other parties, prior to selling or leasing the land to the entrepreneur. Other possibility would be to

conceal a family member’s interest in the settlement, perhaps by failing to provide a clause of the

document, or insisting that someone with a beneficial interest had migrated abroad or fallen out

of contact with the family or was believed to be deceased. Then, the family could renege on the

deal by ‘rediscovering’ the overlooked clause or ‘resurrecting’ the supposedly departed relative.

       In theory, a life tenant hoping to sell settled land to an entrepreneur had one additional

option. He could sue in Chancery, hoping to convince the court that its rules, precedents, and

principles should allow him to sell the land. Chancery’s presumption was to protect beneficiaries

and to prohibit transactions not authorized in the original settlement, but the life tenant could

argue that his family’s settlement contained either ambiguous clauses that, in fact, authorized the

sale or implicit powers that, in the past, had been exercised to enable similar sales. Such suits




                                                 17
were not unknown, but they were uncommon, and by the early eighteenth century, increasingly

rare.

        Life tenants avoided Chancery because of the court’s practical defects. By 1700, “the

word, ‘Chancery,’ had become synonymous with expense, delay, and despair (Baker 1971 p.

128).” During the eighteenth century, scholars estimate Chancery’s backlog at something like

10,000 to 20,000 cases, with the time needed to dispose of them as long as thirty years (Baker

1971 p. 129). One source of these problems was the principle that ultimate responsibility for

everything done in the court rested on the chancellor’s shoulders. Most chancellors wished to

reach decisions only after all relevant facts were ascertained, and this required time and effort.

Chancellors often commissioned enquiries into facts and adjourned trials until they received

reports. Chancellors might require extensive investigations before deciding straightforward

issues, even if all parties to the suit agreed on the pertinent questions and relevant facts. For

example, in his testimony before the Royal Commission, the King’s Counsel, John Bell,

described the case of Leak v. Robinson, where both parties wanted the Chancellor to decide

“whether certain limitations were not too remote,” and neither party wanted to incur the expense

of “a taking of accounts,” but the court refused to settle the question expeditiously, and the case

“remained for many years in the court of Chancery, and put the parties to a very great expense in

taking accounts (BPP 1829 p. 243).”

        A second source of expense and delay was the dependence of Chancery officials on the

fee system. Most of the hundreds of clerks were paid for each task they performed. The clerks

were paid by the page for drafting documents, so they developed “such large handwriting, and

used such wide margins, that it was said a skillful clerk could spread six ordinary pages into forty

(Baker 1971 p. 130).” Litigants were obliged to order and pay for copies they did not want and




                                                  18
which were sometimes never made. Proceedings became verbose and complex. The paperwork

involved often inhibited the progress of suits. Since every step in litigation imposed fees, there

was neither incentive for swiftness nor procedural reform. “Many of the fees were extortionate

… and standards for taking them were somewhat flexible (Baker 1971 p. 129).” While two

distinguished chancellors, Francis Bacon and Lord Macclesfield, were dismissed for accepting

‘presents’ for favoring one side in a suit, their subordinates regularly received ‘gifts’ for

expediting paperwork, which clerks came to see as fees which could be demanded with an

untroubled conscience. Positions as a chancery clerks became so valuable that in the early 1700s,

they could be sold for thousands of pounds. Clerkships came to be seen as property. Attempts to

reform the system were resisted with hostility.8

         A third source of expense and delay was uncertainty concerning and ambiguity within

Chancery’s legal doctrines. This complaint arose often in testimony before the Royal

Commission. Barrister Charles Butler, for example, stated that much litigation arose due to

confusion about what the court of equity considered an abuse of power. Litigation to determine

what was or was not an abuse was expensive. Animosity within families, however, often

compelled family members to sue, in the hope that they would win their case, or at least impose

large costs on their rivals (BPP 1829 p. 116).


4. Case Studies

         This section presents concise case studies that illustrate problems posed by the system of

strict settlements. These case studies come from the Journals of the House of Commons and

testimony provided to the First Report of the Royal Commission on Real Property.




8
    For an extended discussion of the problems of the later Chancery court, see Baker (1971) pp. 126-131


                                                        19
       The first case illustrates ways in which strict settlements, limited powers, and long lives

could keep landholders from putting resources to productive uses. To the Royal Commission, a

barrister, Hasler Capron, described a case involving a client. The client inherited an estate in

1762 at the age of eleven. He had been alive at the time of the settlement, and was bound by its

provisions, which lacked explicit powers to harvest timber. In 1829, when Capron’s testimony

was taken, the client had been bound by the settlement for 67 years.

       Not a stick has been cut during the whole of that period; all the old trees, with
       scarcely an exception, have become decayed and valueless; no young timber is
       rising to replace them, and no underwood has been produced (BPP 1829 p. 173).

Capron testified that “it was thought right, many years since, to make an application to the then

Lord Chancellor on the subject, who declined interfering, and his example was followed by one

of his successors at a later period (BPP 1829 p. 173).”

       A second case study illustrates how settlements could remain in force for longer periods

and how the property could pass unexpectedly to remote relatives. This case involves the estates

of the Duke of Northumberland. In 1767, the first Duke of Northumberland settled his estates on

his eldest son for life and upon that son’s son in tail. The first Duke had another son who was set

to inherit in the event of the death of the eldest or the exhaustion of his direct line. In 1786, the

eldest son succeeded his father as the second Duke of Northumberland and inherited the estate.

The second Duke had a son who was the tenant in tail in the 1767 settlement and another son

who was to inherit in the event of the eldest son’s death or the exhaustion of his direct line.

When the eldest son married in 1817, he joined with the second Duke in resettling the estate. The

settlement limited the life tenant’s power to sell or lease land. In 1818, the eldest son succeeded

his father as the third Duke and inherited the estate as a life tenant. The third Duke died without

an issue and the estate passed to his brother who succeeded as the fourth Duke. In 1865, the




                                                  20
fourth Duke also died without issue. His death exhausted the line of the eldest son of the first

Duke so the estate passed to the senior heir in the line of the second son of the first Duke, the

Earl of Beverley. The Earl had been alive when the Second Duke’s estate was resettled in 1817.

The Earl’s eldest son had also been alive. The Earl inherited the Northumberland estates and

became the fifth Duke of Northumberland. Since he had been alive at the date of resettlement, he

was bound by its terms. Two years later, he died, and his eldest son succeeded him as the sixth

Duke. Since he had been alive at the date of resettlement, even though he was just an infant, he

was bound by its terms. When he inherited, his son became tenant in tail. Since his son was born

after 1817 (and thus after the date of the resettlement) and before 1846 (and thus was over the

age of twenty-one), the sixth Duke and his heir apparent could, employ the process of common

recovery to break the entail and resettle the estate. Thus, the 1817 settlement with its restrictive

powers lasted 50 years. Over this period, the life tenant changed six times, ultimately residing

with the second Duke’s cousin’s grandson. A priori, it would have been impossible to predict

this line of descent or to know the personalities, capabilities, and powers appropriate for each life

tenant.

          The vagaries of descent generated anxiety about the relationship between an estate’s life

tenant and the estate’s other beneficiaries. A lacuna in the male line might shift control of the

estate to distant relatives, who might lack emotional (and perhaps legal) ties to those who

remained dependent on the estate, such as the previous life tenant’s widows and daughters. In

such circumstances, a life tenant might shortchange beneficiaries to whom he lacked close

emotional ties (or perhaps had long-standing animosities). Fears of abuse increased when

prospective heirs were born after the date of the settlement, in which case they could inherit the

estate in fee simple, and have legal obligations neither to current beneficiaries nor the extended




                                                  21
family. Circumstances of this sort play prominent roles in novels of the period. Jane Austen’s

“Pride and Prejudice” is an example. Complaints about abusive heirs also appear in legal

literature. To the Royal Commission, for example, the leading barrister John Tyrrell testified that

concerns about abusive heirs shaped the structure of settlements, particularly restraints on the

power of alienation by a life tenant, because the life tenant might be a stranger with no interest in

the family. John Tyrrell described “several cruel cases” with which he had personal experience

(BPP pp. 321-3).

        Settlements also contributed to anxieties about the security of conveyance. As the

previous section noted, entrepreneurs purchasing land from settled estates had to worry about the

strength of their titles. A case dealing with the sale of land near the River Rodon illustrates the

problem. In a petition submitted to the House of Commons, Joseph Goodman described how he

signed a deed of covenant with several land-owners near the river that

        “would permit him to come upon their lands for the clearing the said River in
        order to make it navigable and for removing any impediments therein; and such of
        the said land owners as had an inheritance in fee-simple did give power to the said
        petitioner to dig down or cut away any part of the lands belonging to them, not
        exceeding 30 feet in breadth, in order to enlarge the said River for the more easy
        making the same navigable; and the said petitioner covenanted to make
        satisfaction to the land owners for what damage should accrue thereby to be
        ascertained in manner therein mentioned.”9

Goodman began to improve the river and had come close to completing the project when he

learned that the deed would be voided because “several estates and interests, in all or greatest

part of the said lands, being limited to persons not in being, or to infants or coverts, or under

some entail or settlement” could not be conveyed to him. A witness stated “that several of the

persons, who signed the aforesaid Deed were only tenants for life; and could not agree that the

                                                      22
said Joseph Goodman should have the banks of the river so cut.” Goodman lost his rights to the

river and the money that he had invested in the project.

          Another example of insecure conveyancing comes from barrister John Gurney’s

testimony to the Royal Commission on Real Property. Gurney described a case where a

gentleman sold an estate claiming that he held it in fee simple. The purchaser built a “good

house” on the lands and lived on the property for forty years. Then, a daughter of the gentlemen

who sold the property discovered a deed of settlement made many years prior upon her parent’s

marriage. The settlement did not provide powers to sell portions of the estate. The daughter

brought the case to court and “recovered the estate (BPP 1829 p. 97).” The purchaser lost his

home, the land, and the money that he invested in the property.


5. Estate Acts and the Relaxation of Strict Settlements

          During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Parliament could remedy almost any

difficulty arising from the system of strict settlements. Prior to the rise of strict settlements,

Parliament occasionally resolved disputes over landholding, sometimes in response to petitions

from the public, but usually in response to petitions from the royal household, which requested

changes in rights to royal estates, often in order to reward tenures and pensions to people who

had served the regime well. After the rise of strict settlements, the mechanisms previously

employed to manage royal estates became mechanisms for managing strictly-settled estates of

landlords large and small. This section describes those mechanisms, which we refer to as estate

acts, and the ways in which parties to settlements used estate acts to restructure rights and

convey property.10



10
     See Bogart and Richardson (2008) or additional details concerning estate acts, including in-depth discussions of
     their structure and data panels describing where, when, what types, and for whom estates acts were passed.


                                                          23
       Estate acts began as petitions from landholders seeking relief from restrictions that strict

settlements imposed on the employment of land and resources. Over time, Parliament

standardized procedures for processing petitions. Typically, petitions were submitted to the

House of Lords, introduced as estate bills, and referred to a committee, which ensured that the

requests met certain requirements designed to protect the rights of interested parties. Notice of a

bill had to be sent to all parties with interests in the property. Notification requirements included

all individuals with rights to the land via deed, marriage, custom, or settlement. These

individuals had the right to tell the committee their concerns about the legislation. Bills deemed

beneficial to the pertinent parties were publicly read three times, sent through committees in both

houses, passed by the Lords and the Commons, and sent for royal assent.

       This multilayered process provided individuals with an opportunity to describe the ways

in which the legislation could harm their interests and enabled Parliament to ensure that these

parties received compensation. The process also meant that estate bills represented joint

decisions of the national legislature (Parliament), the executive branch (the monarch and his

ministers) and the courts of final appeal (the monarch, the chancellor, and Parliament).

Parliament kept written records of the proceedings and served as a repository where information

about estate acts could be examined by the public. Parliament provided copies of these

documents to parties which requested them, enabling parties to use Parliament as a means of

documenting transactions.

       Estate acts served several functions. Estate acts’ primary task was authorizing

transactions prohibited by strict settlements. Table 1 indicates the most common kinds of

transactions. The typical act authorizing a sale indicated what specific piece of land could be sold

and what property the life tenant would return to the estate to ensure that all beneficiaries




                                                 24
received at least the same support as before. The typical act authorizing exchange of property

indicated what property would be transferred out of an estate and what property would replace it.

Acts authorizing leases specified the property that could be leased, the terms under which it

could be let, and the length of the leases. Acts authorizing a discharge released property from a

settlement and specified land that would enter the settlement in return. A mortgage act permitted

a life tenant to borrow money using land as collateral. If the borrower defaulted, the act might

empower the lender to take ownership of the collateral or might provide the lender with rights to

use (or lease) the collateral until he recovered what he was owed. An act of partition divided a

unit of land into two or more units. Life tenants might use these acts to divide property amongst

members of the extend family, perhaps by subdividing a large lot containing a single house into

several lots on which family members built separate dwellings. Life tenants might also use these

acts to subdivide property in preparation for improving the land and selling it at a later date. All

of these acts helped landholders convey property to other parties and put resources to new and

better uses.

       Acts concerning timber and mining also affected the employment of resources. Acts

authorizing the cutting and sale of timber allowed life tenants to harvest trees from their estates.

Timber was an important commodity at the time. Old-growth timber was a principal input for

naval construction. Tall, straight trees were needed to make the masts and keels of ships. Timber

was also used to construct homes, farms, and workshops and for manufacture of durable

merchandise, such as furniture, tools, and wagons. Wood served as a source of fuel. Timbers’

value made managing woodlands an important task for landed families. Determining the optimal

mix of trees and the optimal time to harvest took knowledge, skill, and patience. As trees grew,

their value increased. Once trees attained full height, and the wood began to age, trees value




                                                 25
began to decline. Trees’ growth/value profile, the financial needs of the family, interests rates,

and other economic conditions (such as the demand for lumber) determined the point of

maximum profit. All of these conditions could not be incorporated into settlement contracts.

Estate acts allowed families to harvest timber at the point of maximum profit, which was

difficult, if not impossible to do, when settlements restricted life tenants’ and trustees’ powers.

       Acts authorizing the mining of ore allowed families to sell minerals and coal discovered

on their estates. The value of metals – such as iron and tin – grew throughout the eighteenth

century, as technological progress lowered the cost of smelting, increased the quality of metals,

and expanded the range of products which could be made with pewter and steel. The value of

coal also increased, as demand for fuel rose, and the availability of alternatives (particularly

wood) declined. Estate acts allowed families to open new mines or lease the rights to mine coal

on their estates (mining leases typically lasted 40 to 60 years). Settlements seldom included such

powers, because of the difficulty writing a contract specifying the conditions under which one

would want to take such action.

       In addition to authorizing actions prohibited by settlements, estate acts served as a

mechanism for completing incomplete settlement contracts. Settlements could not possibly

consider all possible contingencies that could arise during their long and variable existence,

particularly during an era of revolutionary economic and technological progress unanticipated by

the original writers’ of the documents. The settlement system dealt with incompleteness in

several ways. The doctrine of perpetuities forced settlements to be reinstituted periodically,

allowing families to rewrite the agreement and reorganize the allocation of resources when they

prepared to pass the land to a tenant in tail born after the date of the settlement. Chancery courts

created default rules which came into force when circumstances arose not covered by the




                                                 26
settlement. Chancery itself could be approached when the default rules or the settlement itself

generated unpalatable outcomes. But, as the previous section showed, Chancery’s default

position depended upon doctrines of equity, which protected beneficial interests and the desires

of the deceased (i.e. those who settled the land on their descendants). In addition, Chancery’s

sclerotic procedures raised the cost and slowed the dispensation of justice.

          Estate acts provided an alternative route for dealing with incomplete contracts. This route

differed from the law of equity in important ways. Parliament streamlined procedures for

requesting reviews, providing a relatively rapid and inexpensive forum for dealing with

contingencies. Parliament employed default rules that emphasized the productive employment of

resources as long as beneficial interests received sufficient compensation. Parliament’s doctrines,

in other words, looked forward, emphasizing the interests of current and future generations.

Parliament’s doctrines deemphasized the dictates of deceased landholders, except for the

beneficial interests which Parliament satisfied but did not emphasize.

          Estate acts also served as a mechanism for revealing information pertinent to property.

Entrepreneurs seeking to acquire rights to resources worried about the provenance of the land

that they sought to purchase. Equitable rights to the land were private information. Real rights to

land were, in some cases, public information and, in other cases, private. Public repositories did

not retain records indicating who had which rights or where such information might reside.11

Sellers had an incentive to withhold enough private information to derail deals that they wished

to unwind. Ex-post revelation of private information occasionally cost entrepreneurs substantial




11
     Here we should note that England did not possess a system of notaries like nations on the continent. The public
     records to land that existed tended to be those retained within the rolls of courts and the royal bureaucracy.
     Locating and searching such records was an expensive and time-consuming process. The only exceptions were
     the deed registries in Middlesex and Yorkshire.


                                                          27
sums. Fears of such situations must have deterred entrepreneurs from undertaking many potential

projects.

       Parliament’s procedures for processing bills required the notification of all parties with

interests in the property. Parliament recorded all of the information that it received, including a

verbatim copy of the settlement agreement and all rights regarding the land. Parliament

encapsulated this information within an estate act, and then, established new rules regarding the

land. Parliamentary scribes recorded all of this information in a series of documents. These

documents could be used as evidence in a court of law. That fact was the essence of a private act.

These acts created definitive documentation regarding personal and property rights. Private

parties had to bring these documents to court to enforce these rights. Private parties obtained

these documents from the Parliamentary record office, which could be searched by the public.

       The legal nature of Parliamentary decisions and the creation of legal documentation

meant that rights to land and resources could be conveyed securely via estate acts. Estate acts

described all relevant information. Estate acts encoded this information in documents that courts

recognized as the last word on the subject. Estate acts placed this information in the public

record. Entrepreneurs that purchased or leased land via an estate act need not worry that courts

would reverse the transaction at some point in the future.

       Not only did the Parliamentary process differ from the Chancery process because the

former emphasized efficiency while the later emphasized equity, the Parliamentary process was

quicker, cheaper, and more predictable than suits in the Chancery Court (English and Saville,

1983, p. 50). The success rate for private bill initiatives in Parliament was very high, particularly

after the early 1700s (Hoppit 1996). The process usually took a matter of weeks, whereas in the

Chancery the process could take years owing to the large backlog of cases (Baker 1971, pp. 128-




                                                 28
133). Evidence on the fees for many types of private bills are available in a report from the

Select Committee on House of Commons Officers and Fees. The report shows that fees paid to

clerks for estate bills in 1832 were minimal, amounting to an average of £28 for bills affecting

one person and an average of £70 for bills affecting several persons or having more than one

object (BPP 1833 p. 247). The report also provides information on the total fees paid to solicitors

for one estate bill in 1831. The total cost including fees for the Lords was £534 (BPP 1833 p.

250). It is revealing this solicitor’s fee was similar to those for enclosure, road, railway, and

urban improvement bills in the 1820s. Among the 19 enclosure, road, railway, and urban

improvement bills described in the report the average solicitors fee was £526. Thus is does not

appear that estate bills were any more expensive than the average local or private bill.

       The evidence on Chancery suits suggests that fees could be larger. Baker chronicles the

case of Morgan v. Lord Claredon in 1808 where the fees exceeded £3700 and the case lasted

more than 16 years before the counsels were briefed (Baker 1971 p. 131). We are not aware of

any comparable cases from the same period where the expense of an estate bill reached such

proportions and with similar delays.

       A case study illustrates how estate acts helped life tenants manage their property and

facilitated the conveyance of land (see English and Saville 1983, pp. 54-58, for additional

details). The Coke family of Norfolk obtained five estate acts over a 150-year period. In 1665,

John Coke settled his estates on relatives in succession and in tail male; reserving for himself

powers to make leases. In 1671, John Coke died without children. His cousin, Robert Coke,

succeeded as life tenant to the estate. Ambiguities in the settlement obscured the heir’s power to

make leases. So in 1678, Robert Coke obtained an estate act empowering him to make leases of

the estates. In 1718, Robert resettled the estate when his son reached the age of majority. In




                                                  29
1747, Robert’s grandson, Thomas Coke, resettled the estate when his son, Edward Coke (i.e.

Robert’s grandson), reached the age of majority. At that time, shares of the income from 64 of

the 83 properties in the Coke estates were reserved for financing beneficial interests, such as

bride’s pin money, jointures for wives and widows, and portions for children, grandchildren, and

relatives. The Coke family wished to charge all the sums to the same lands, so that they could

freely use the rest of the property. An estate act facilitated this rationalization of the family’s

assets. In 1753, Edward Coke died, leaving Thomas Coke with no surviving sons. In 1759, to

protect the interests of his female descendants, Thomas Coke, inserted in the settlement

additional restrictive covenants. In 1776, Thomas Coke passed away, and his nephew Thomas

William Coke inherited. He survived for 66 years, and during that period, obtained three estate

acts that authorized him to sell lands as long as he replaced them with new property of equivalent

value dedicated to the same uses.

        Another case study illustrates how estate acts enabled landholders to respond to

opportunities created by London’s real-estate boom during the 1720s. London sits within

Middlesex County, which operated a registry recording real-estate transactions since the

eighteenth century. From 1715 to 1719, the number of deeds registered annually averaged 1552.

From 1720 to 1724, the number of deeds registered annually averaged 2395 (Sheppard, Belcher,

and Cottrell 1979). The real-estate boom generated opportunities to profit from the construction

of housing and factories. The Duke of Norfolk held estates in the city and on its outskirts, but the

settlement under which he held his lands prohibited the extension of leases beyond his life. In

1724, the Duke of Norfolk overcame this constraint by obtaining an act that allowed him to

extend leases for up to sixty years. In 1725, the Duke registered a 42-year building lease for his




                                                  30
lands in London. The Duke’s deed specifically mentioned the passage of the act giving him the

legal authority to enter into long-term lease contracts.12

           A final case study illustrates how estate acts increased the security of conveyance. To the

Royal Commission, the barrister, Alexander Sidebottom, described a case where buyers wished

to purchase land from eight different manors. However, on these manors, enclosures and

allotments had been made without distinguishing whether tracts of land were held in copyhold or

freehold, resulting in confusion concerning the provenance of titles. It was suggested that the

lords of the manors could stipulate that a certain percentage of the land should be considered

copyhold of each manor. Such stipulations could help to determine the average value of the land

(and thus the purchase price), but such stipulations would leave the purchaser vulnerable to

future suits to recover plots of land conveyed incorrectly. Transferring titles securely required

following correct procedures. Therefore, the buyers and sellers asked Parliament to authorize a

commission that would determine what was freehold and what was copyhold. The commission’s

decisions formed the foundation of the estate act. The act converted the commission’s decisions

into facts of law, providing the buyers and sellers with the documents necessary to convey title

securely. Sidebottom stated that estate acts were the only way to get out of such difficult

situations (BPP 1829 pp. 272-73).


6. Urbanization and Estate Acts

           Our hypothesis suggests that there should have been a correlation between estate acts and

economic development. This section shows that such a correlation existed during the decades

surrounding the Industrial Revolution. We focus on urbanization, a key component of

                                                        31
development, and a phenomenon which we can measure accurately, using data on population

densities.13

          Figure 1 (a) illustrates urbanization across English counties between 1760 and 1830. The

light-shading indicates counties where during that period the population per square mile

increased more than 15%. The medium-shading indicates counties where during that period the

population per square mile increased more than 20%. The black-shading indicates that the

population density of the county of Middlesex increased by more than 400%. The growth of

population in Middlesex stems from the growth of London. Growth of population in the

Midlands stems from the rise of industries, such as textiles, manufacturing, and mining, and the

ensuing expansion of industrial urban areas. In the Midlands, the county that experienced the

most growth was Lancashire. Its population grew by more than 1 million, with much of the

growth concentrated in the cities of Manchester and Liverpool.

          Figure 1 (b) through (d) reveal that between 1760 and 1830, estate acts were concentrated

in industrializing urban areas. Figure 1 (b) illustrates the number of acts authorizing sales of

settled land that Parliament passed between 1760 and 1830. The light-shading indicates counties

with more than one and a half estate acts per 100 square miles. The medium-shading indicates

counties with more than three estate acts per 100 square miles. The black-shading indicates that

Middlesex had more than 20 acts per 100 square miles. Figure 1 (c) illustrates the number of

estate acts authorizing leases per 100 square miles. The light-shading indicates counties with

more than one-tenth of an act per 100 square miles. The black-shading indicates that Middlesex

had more than 20 acts per 100 square miles. Figure 1 (d) illustrates the number of estate acts

authorizing mortgages per 100 square miles. The light-shading indicates counties with more than

one act per 1000 square miles. The black-shading indicates that Middlesex had more than 10 acts

per 1000 square miles.

       The correlation between estate acts and population growth can be seen clearly when the

data are plotted on a graph. Figure 2 accomplishes this exercise. The figure plots the county-level

change in population from 1760 to 1830 against the number of estate acts authorizing sales and

leases in each county over the same period. Higher changes in population are strongly associated

with larger numbers of sale and lease acts. The correlation coefficient is 0.82.

       The geographic correlation between urbanization and estate acts provides one piece of

evidence that estate acts promoted greater efficiency. The restrictions associated with strict

settlements should have become more binding as urbanization increased and as landowners on

the periphery of urban expansion perceived the opportunity to profit by switching land from rural

to urban uses. Without estate acts, it would have been much more difficult for landowners to

reallocate resources in response to urbanization. At the same time, by relaxing the constraints on

building in a particular city, estate acts made that city more attractive to business and individuals.

Many estate acts were specifically passed to authorize building leases in urban areas. For

instance, there was a cluster of building lease acts in Lancashire in the 1790s, when Manchester

and Liverpool were growing rapidly. Estate acts and urbanization were clearly interconnected.


7. Conclusion

       In this essay, we have argued that by removing the shackles of the past, reducing

transaction costs, restructuring equitable and real estates, reallocating resources to new uses, and

increasing the security of conveyance, estate acts made property more productive. Our argument

addresses a large literature concerning property rights and economic progress. A well-known

hypothesis is that British courts developed a common law that protected property and promoted



                                                 33
efficiency better than the legal codes of other nations. The reward for adopting such judge-made

laws was rapid economic development (La Porta et al. 1997, 1998).

       This paper argues that Britain did not have an inherently superior property-rights system

circa 1700. Like many European countries, an array of courts enforced an array of rights in an

array of ways. These overlapping legal systems tied land to traditional uses. One key to Britain’s

economic success was its ability to adapt property rights in a manner which reduced transaction

costs and reallocated land and resources to higher-value uses. Parliament played a key role in this

process, by establishing a forum where families and individuals could reorganize rights to

equitable and real estates outside of the existing judicial process. This Parliamentary forum made

property rights increasingly adaptable. At the end of the seventeenth century, most families had

locked land into strict settlements that minimized the risk of opportunistic behavior, but in doing

so, restricted the uses to which land could be put. Those restrictions could be costly if economic

conditions changed, which they did during the eighteenth century. Parliamentary estate acts

enabled landowners to react to the rapid pace of economic progress. Eventually, during a time

period which falls outside the bounds of this study, Parliament passed general reforms of the

equitable and real property systems, creating the common-law of property that scholars admire

today. The efficiency of the English common law, in sum, was in part due to Parliamentary

intervention, and not an inevitable outcome of judge-made laws.

       In future research, we plan to explore the relationship between the legislative and judicial

processes for creating legal codes. We also plan to identify the casual links between adaptable

institutions and economic development as well as the political mechanisms that fostered

adaptability. A final topic that we plan to examine is the issue of redistribution. Our transaction-

cost analysis does not preclude the possibility that estate acts redistributed income. Our




                                                 34
examination of the evidence indicates, however, that redistribution was (at most) a second order

issue. Contemporary commentators incessantly discussed issues of efficiency, but seldom

(almost never) discussed issues of redistribution. The reason, we believe, lies in Parliament’s

efforts to ensure that estate acts resulted in Pareto-superior reorganizations of rights. The hows

and whys of Pareto-superiority are worthy of further research.
