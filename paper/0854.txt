                Severance Pay, Pensions, and 'fficient Mobility



                                     ABSTRACT



     This paper argues that pensions are used as severance pay devices in an

efficient compensation scheme. The major points of the study are:       (1)

Severance pay, which takes the form of higher pension values for early

retirement, is widespread.   (2) A major reason for the existence of pensions

is the desire to provide an incentive mechanism that can also function as an

efficient severance pay device. It is incorrect to think of pensions merely

as a tax—deferred savings account.    (3) The wage rates that older workers

receive exceed their marginal products. This is evidenced by the fact that

employers are willing to buy them out with higher pensions if they retire

early.

     These conclusions are based upon examination of a data set which was

generated as part of this study. That data set contains detailed information

on 244 of the largest pension plans in the country, covering about 8 million

workers.

 I.   Introduction
       It   is often suggested that severance pay is not a common feature of labor

 contracts   even though theory dictates its usage in a number of
 circumstances.1 Sometimes in the same breath, the widespread nature of
pension arrangements are noted without providing much justification for     this

 "forced savings"    which operates through the firm. This paper provides   a

theoretical argument and evidence from pension plans covering approximately

8.4 million workers that pension plans are incentive—based severance pay

devices which bring about efficient mobility and effort in the labor market.

The major points of the study are:

      1.) Severance pay, which takes the form of higher pension values for

early retirement, is widespread.

      2.) The age—earnings profile is significantly steeper than the age—

productivity profile. This is the direct implication of the firm's offer to

buy workers out with higher pension benefits if they retire early.

      3.) Pensions cannot be thought of simply as an asset for retirement in

the same way that one thinks of a savings account. There     is an important
incentive—severance    pay aspect to pension and this feature may be the most

important reason why "forced savings" through pensions are widespread.



II. The Model

      Long—term labor contracts may create problems for separation

efficiency. For example, as I have argued elsewhere (Lazear 1979, 1981) the

incentives generated by an upward sloping age—earnings profile often make

steep profiles preferred even if productivity does not rise over the hf e—

cycle. A steeper profile induces more effort because the worker is reluctant

to shirk for fear that he may lose his job which offers future rewards that
                                               4


far exceed his   alternatives (see Becker and Stigler (1974)). When the

earnings profile deviates from the productivity profile, mobility                 decisions
(and labor supply considerations in general) are distorted. Severance pay can

eliminate much of the distortion.

       The basic point   is this: If wages exceed marginal product,              then the firm

has an incentive    to buy out of the contract by paying the worker an amount              to
leave early. The amount that the firm is willing to pay measures the differ-
ence between the future wage commitment and future marginal product. If the
firm   offers that amount to the worker, the worker will accept the buyout only
when his alternatives        are   sufficiently good——in fact, it      turns   out, only when
his alternative use of time exceeds his            value   at the   current   firm. Figure 1
makes this clear.

                                                                          F

       The worker's productivity at the current firm is V and                   W is the

value of the alternative use of time. The date of efficient retirement, where

W = V,     is T. The actual wage profile is W; it has the same present value

as V , but is steeper and includes a pension between T and T' •                      It   is the

deviation between W and V that generates incentives and simultaneously

creates the problem that severance pay reduces.

       Suppose, for example, that at time t0 a worker receives a wage offer

from another firm of W where V < W < W .                     Efficiency   requires that the

worker leave, since there are side payments that could be made which make all

parties better off if the worker moves to the new firm. However, in the

absence of any side payments, the worker opts to remain since W exceeds

1q*   from t0 to T

      A severance pay arrangement can bring about efficiency in this situation.

Since the present value of W equals the present value of V (for a zero—

prof it equilibrium), the firm "owes" the worker the present value of ABCD

plus EFGH ,     (hereafter          just "ABCD" and "EFGH.") Offering the worker this

amount as severance pay induces efficient mobility. What the worker receives

from quitting is (T — t0)W* + (ABCD) + (EFGH). If he stays, he receives

W(t) from t0 to T plus area EFGH, or (T — t0)V + (ABCD) + (EFGH). What

he earns if he quits always exceeds what he receives if he stays if and only

if W > V which is the condition for efficient mobility.

      Pensions may serve as severance pay. This requires that the expected

present value of the pension at t0 be (ABCD) plus (EFGH), or in general, the

expected value of the pension for retirement at t is (in time zero dollars)


                T                                  T'
(1)    P(t) =   ft   [   W(t)   —   V(r)]e rTd + 5
                                                   T
                                                        W(r)ertdt
                                                           6




It is obvious from (1) that the expected present value of the pension must

first increase with t until t =                    t        and then decline in order for pensions

to act as an efficient severance pay device. This counterintuitive implica-

tion is the result of using a pension as an efficient form of severance pay.

If pensions were merely a tax advantageous savings account, this pattern would

not be expected.

      In addition to the possibility that the worker receives an exogenous wage

offer of w* > V , there is also the possibility that V is unexpectedly low,

as the result of an unanticipated worker illness, for example. Again, with

reference to figure 1, suppose that marginal product fell to V at time to.

It is efficient for the worker to quit since there is some set of side

payments which could make all parties concerned better off. Awarding the

employer   the right to terminate a worker without cause at any time as long as
the firm pays the appropriate severance pay will restore                      efficiency, and will

not require any verification that V is                         in fact below W .   However,   it   will

require   severance pay greater than the amount described by P(t) in (1).

      A scheme which induces the firm to behave appropriately requires that

severance pay C(t)               is paid when the worker is terminated "without cause."

Before discussing the applicability of this approach we define:

                    T                                  T'
(2)   C(t)          f   [   W(T) — W(t)e_rTdr +        f W(T)etdT
                    t                                  T

At t0 ,      C(t)       equals (JBCD) + (EFGH).                This rule always induces efficient

layoff behavior. The cost to the firm at time t0 of keeping the worker net

of output is w(t) from t0 to T plus area EFGH or
                            T
                            f    W(t)edr      + Area (JBCD) + Area (EFGH)
                            to
                                                   *
                                          —
                                              f V (r)e —rT di
                                              to
                                                 7




The cost     of terminating the worker with severance pay C(t) is Area (JBCD) +
Area (EFGH). It is clear that it is cheaper to lay the worker off with
severance pay if and only if

                               T    —        *
                               f ( W(r)   — V (r) )e —rT di > 0

                                0


which is the efficiency condition.2

       Note first that when the firm lays off the worker severance pay is higher

than when the worker resigns voluntarily. This is simply the result of the

difference between V and W so that the worker's gains are not equal to the

firms losses. It implies, however, that as t approaches T ,                  the   difference

between the benefit that the worker receives from early retirement at his

election and that received when he retires with "consent" of the employer,

i.e., the employer wishes him       to   leave, shrinks to zero (because V —        W


shrinks to zero)

       Although severance pay associated with employer—initiated separation is

well—defined conceptually, it may be difficult to use in practice for two

reasons:

       First,   termination "without cause" is not an unambiguous term.            Recall

that   a   major reason for the upward sloping age—earnings profile is that such a

profile     imposes large costs on workers who shirk and are terminated as the
result.      Workers do not receive severance pay C(t) if they are fired for

shirking,     but they do if   they are terminated "without       cause." This creates a
source     of disagreement between worker and firm. (ERISA [1974) is the

outgrowth of many such disputes.)4

       The second reason is more compelling. Since C(t) >            P(t),   the worker

prefers that a given separation is initiated by the employer while the
                                           8




employer prefers that it is initiated by the worker. Thus, a worker who finds
    *
w       > V can gain by inducing the firm to terminate him. In fact, since C(t)
                                               *
>       P(t), there are even some values of W < V for which workers prefer to be

laid off. If V >           > W, the worker would be unwilling to initiate a separ-

ation, but prefers that the employer does relative to work. This encourages

shirking and other malfeasant behavior which assists in bringing it about. A

similar argument can be made on the other side. The firm sometimes prefers

that the worker quit and may make work conditions correspondingly miserable.

Neither of these situations is efficient. The rule C(t) = P(t)         avoids any

of these difficulties.

          If severance pay arrangements are efficient, then the value of the

severance pay provides us with an estimate of the difference between wages and

marginal product. Stated intuitively, employers are only willing to buy out

of the commitment if they lose by retaining the workers. Only when W > V is

the employer anxious to buy out and his anxiety increases as the difference

between W and V increases. Thus, in figure 1, if the pension value of

retiring at T is EFGH and at t0 is ABCD plus EFGH , then the

difference, ABCD , measures the difference between wages and marginal product

between t0 and T •          Since   w(t) and P(t) are observed, V(t) can be

estimated so that we can determine, at least for those near retirement years,

the relationship between wages and marginal product.

          Similarly, if one computes the pension benefits paid at the employer's

election, one can obtain an estimate of the W(t) or reservtion wage

profile.        W(t) and V(t) should converge at normal (or mandatory)

retirement if that date is chosen efficiently.

          These issues are now treated more formally. First consider pension

benefits that can be received at the worker's election, even without "consent"
                                                      9




 of the employer. This corresponds to the present value of the difference

 between W(t) and V(t).

         An efficient severance pay rule says that at time t                           ,   the worker will
 quit and take severance pay if and only if W(t) ,                           the   alternative use of

 time (now a random variable) exceeds V(t) .                       Utility maximization          implies

 that a worker quits and accepts severance pay if two conditions hold: (1) the

 present value of severance pay plus the alternative stream exceeds the present

 value of the wage stream in the current firm and (2) the worker cannot do even

better by delaying his retirement to some time in the future.5

         Let us make periods and wage changes discrete. Consider period T — 1                                ,


 i.e.,   one year before normal retirement. The worker retires if


                          K+l                                            K
                                      1                    1                       1
 (3)     WT1+ST1 E                  T>WT_].+(l+r)ST
                          r=O (l+r)                                     r=O (l+r)


where K        T' — T,      St is the annual pension payment received from t until

death at T' if the worker retires at t ,                        W       is the alternative wage paid

between t and t÷l and W is the wage at the current firm between t

and t÷l.

       To induce efficient quitting behavior, it is necessary that the i.h.s. of

(3) exceeds the r.h.s. of (3) iff WT_l >

Substitution of (4) into (3) yields the necessary and sufficient condition

that the worker quits if

Since this is the efficiency condition, the severance pay arrangement results

in efficient turnover.

        Now consider the decision at T—2 •                      The   worker resigns at T —            2     if and

only if two conditions hold: First, the present value of retiring at T—2

and receiving severance pay must exceed the present value of continuing to

work until T—l and retiring then, taking the T—1 severance pay. Second,

the present value of retiring at T—2 with severance pay must exceed the

present value of working until T and taking the normal pension. If we make

the assumption that              > V implies W, > V,                            for t' > t then the

second condition becomes redundant (demonstrated below). Consider the first

        Note also that if WT2 > VT2                                the worker chooses retirement at T—2

over retirement at T. The second condition is redundant. Since

        > V implies WT1 >                                ,       the efficient pension plan already
insures that inequality (5) holds as well. That is, since the efficient

pension at T-1 induced retirement at T—1 whenever WT1 > VT_li it is

clear that retirement at T-2 dominates retirement at T because it

dominates the superior strategy, namely, retirement at T—l.

       It is through equations (9) and (10) that we derive our                          results.   If the

wages of old workers (t—i > t                    in   fig. 1) exceed their marginal products,

then the present value of the pension falls as the age of retirement rises

 (eq. (9)). Similarly, eq. (9) provides us with an estimate of the difference

between W and V at each point in time because Tj and T-i+1 are

observed.

       The point of this section can be restated: The pension which acts as

severance pay reduces the true wage to V when we take into account the way

that the pension value falls with experience. Since the pension is riot paid

if the separation is punishment for too little effort, incentives are

maintained while efficient turnover is produced.

       Below we discuss the role of vesting in this context. But before doing

that, we derive some additional formulas. Let                              us specify the efficient C(t)
path, i.e., that path that induces the employer to lay the workers off if and

only if V <        ,       where V is now a random variable.

       By development analogous to eq. (3)-(10) we derive the efficient employer

initiated severance pay:


                   CT.÷l      =
(11)      CT_i -                  WT.        WTi

                                                                           (1+r)

where CT =    T     since WT =
                                        VT
                                             •        This path induces employers to separate
workers "without cause," if and only if V < W

       The case of postponed retirement is equivalent. In fact, normal

retirement is riot sacred once we allow pension benefits to vary with the date

of retirement. The date of "normal retirement" is the date of modal
                                             13




retirement. In almost all cases that age is 65 and corresponds to the start

of   social security payments. The reason is that        the social security earnings

test   causes   the W(t) function to take a discrete jump upwards at age 65.

Therefore, from the point of view of efficiency, most workers find that W(t)

intersects V(t) at T •        If   H is the amount      of   social security payment,

then all of those individuals whose alternative value of time at T without

social security included lies between V and V-H find that there

alternative use of time rises above V at P

       Except for this detail, the analysis of postponed retirement is similar.

A worker should continue to work if and only if W(T) > V(T) •                 This is the
same condition (5). The worker's choice is still reflected by (3) so all

holds as above with a replacement of subscripts. If j is the number of

years after "normal retirement" then retirement occurs if f:

Eqs. (9), (9') and (10) follow accordingly so that an estimate of W—V can be

obtained for those years after T as well by examining the way in which

pension benefits decline in late retirement.

       Let us summarize this section. Employers are willing to buy out of a

long term contract if the wage rate exceeds VMP. The amount that employers

are willing to pay reveals something about the difference between W and V.

Pensions may act as a buyout. If the value of the pension declines with the

age of retirement, this suggests that the pension plays the role of severance

pay. By examining the way in which pension benefits move with age of

retirement, one can infer something about the difference between W and V.
                                       14




 Vesting

      It is useful to consider the way that vesting affects the analysis. When

a worker's pension is vested, he carries with him the rights to any accrued

pension benefits. Vesting creates no difficulties for worker-initiated

separation since the efficiency of pensions as severance pay is based on the

assumption that the worker receives the value Pt if he leaves at t. The

difficulty arises in the attempt to use pensions as both severance pay device

and incentive provider. If a law such as ERISA requires vesting of pensions,

then a firm which previously used pensions as a reward for service well done

has that tool nullified. The reaction may take a number of forms. bst

extreme is that pensions are not used at all for this purpose. Instead,

deferred compensation in the form of even steeper wage growth can be used.

This is less desirable than wage growth with pension because it creates too

little turnover and does not solve the final period problem efficiently. A

less extreme adjustment is that the value of the pension can be made more

highly contingent upon final salary. The firm can then reduce wage growth for

shirkers which will decrease the value of the pension accordingly. Finally,

the firm can opt to violate the law. If the probability of that occurring

decreases in worker effort, incentives may still be maintained, although to a

lesser extent.

     This raises other issues. "Vesting" is not an especially meaningful term

once it is recognized that the pension benefit formula can be altered.

Vesting states that a worker is entitled to accrued benefit even if he leaves,

but accrued benefits may be very small until the final years before retire-

ment. There are a number of reasons: First, if the benefit formula depends

upon final salary, the benefit received by a worker who leaves at age 30 may

be much smaller than if he leaves at age 60 because salary grows with age, and
                                                  15




 in an inflationary economy, with time. Second, since length of service

 affects benefits, formulas can be specified to make accrual rates a convex

 function   of years of service, placing a premium on             long tenure. Third, early
 retirement    restrictions normally prevent a worker from taking retirement
 before   an age around 55. A worker who is "vested,"             but    below   that age

 receives   a promise of benefits at 65. This is generally less valuable than
 the   right to start receiving benefits at 55 which he enjoys if he remains with
 the   firm until that age.6

       A final point is that the tendency of many plans to tie benefits to final

 salary rather than a career average may be evidence for the incentive role of

pensions.      If insurance or savings were the motive, then tying pensions to
permanent income is more likely to be warranted and a                  career average is a

better    proxy for permanent income than is final salary. Final salary,
however,    can be adjusted to reflect worker effort and hours worked. The

multiplier effect on pension value may create significant incentives for

workers    to maintain effort and labor supply during those final years.

Inefficient     Retention and Inefficient Separation

       There   remains the   possibility that the worker will not leave the firm

when it is efficient for him        to   do so   and that he will separate when separa-
tion is inefficient. This results when both V and W                      are random variables
                                                  —       *   —    *     —
simultaneously.     For example, let V > W > V > W. V >W implies that the
employer will not initiate a separation. V > W implies that a worker will
                            -    *
not initiate a separation. W > V            implies that a separation is efficient.

This inefficient retention can be eliminated by lowering C(t) to P(t).

Then   the employer will initiate a separation whenever V* < V. The difficulty
is that setting     C(t) =   P(t)   creates some additional inefficient separation
                                                      *   -
at the same time. For example, if V > V > W > W, a separation that would
                                                   16




not have occurred with C(t) > P(t) does when C(t) =                P(t),   yet this separa—
                                        *     -
tion    is inefficient since V > W. Note that even C(t) > P(t) does not
                                            —    *       * —
eliminate all inefficient separation. Suppose W > V > W. V < W implies
that the employer terminates the worker, but this termination is inefficient
          -           *                                                   *
since     W < V .          Analogously, inefficient quitting occurs when V > W > V.
Since W > V, the worker quits and receives P(t). This quit is inefficient
              *
since     V > W. Elsewhere (Hall and Lazear [1982]), the tradeoff between

inefficient separation and inefficient retention is analyzed in depth. These

simple rules cannot, in general, eliminate all inefficiencies, and more

complex rules suffer from other difficulties.


Human    Capital
       The theory of specific human capital, through its sharing arrangement
(see   Becker (1964)) implies           W <   V for older workers. This pattern is the
reverse       of that shown in Figure 1. It also has different implications.

       First it implies that employers prefer that employees work beyond the

date at which the worker chooses to retire. Since V > W ,              the worker chooses
to retire when               =       in the absence of other incentives. This occurs
                                 W
                  =
before
                      V,     the condition that determines efficient date of retire-

ment. Since V > W , the employer prefers that the worker continue to work so

that there is no mandatory retirement.

       Second, if specific human capital were important pensions would be

unlikely to decline with increases in retirement age. This encourages more

quitting by workers. But when specific human capital is important so that the

wage is below the value of the worker to the firm, the problem is that there

is already too much quitting. (In the absence of offer-matching, an outside

wage offer between W and V generates a quit even though quitting is

inefficient •)

 Empirical Analysis

     The data for this analysis were constructed using the Banker's Trust 1975

 Study of Corporate Pension Plans. This book contains detailed verbal

descriptions of 271 pension plans from 190 of the largest companies in the

United States. These plans cover about 8.4 million workers or about 25% of

all workers covered by private pension plans.

     The major empirical task was to convert the verbal descriptions into

machine readable data. After that was done, it was necessary to write a

program which would calculate the appropriate expected present values using

these data. A summary of the approach follows.

     Pension benefit formulas take three basic forms. The simplest form,

sometimes called the pattern plan, awards the recipient a flat dollar amount

per year worked upon retirement. The more "conventional" type, calculates

pension benefits from a formula which depends upon years of service and some

average salary. Finally, a "defined contribution" plan awards pension

benefits which vary depending upon the value of market securities. Here, each

year a certain amount is put into some investment fund on the employee's

behalf. The value of the pension depends upon the performance of that fund.

     Given these formulas, the first task is to calculate normal retirement

benefits that are available to the worker if he retires at the normal

retirement age. This involves taking into account the type of plan the

individual has as well as his salary and tenure.

     In addition to calculating normal retirement benefits, also calculated

are retirement benefits that accrue to individuals who retire from one to

fifteen years before the date of normal retirement, if that was permitted, and

for those who retire from one to fifteen years after the date of normal

retirement, also if permitted by the conditions of the plan.

     There are no individuals in this sample, per Se. This data set is a

description of pension plans so what is reported in this empirical section are

the results of a simulation exercise. For each pension plan, I created twelve

employees, having all combinations of tenure upon normal retirement of 10, 20,

and 30 years and salary upon normal retirement of $9000, $15,000, $25,000 and

$50,000. The analysis described below relates to these 2,928 hypothetical

individuals from 244 pension plans. (Only 244 of the plans had complete and

clean information.)

     It is important to note that calculating retirement benefits at each age

of retirement is not a straightforward task. Most plans have many restric-

tions on the maximum amount which can be accrued and many provide for

supplemental benefits if early retirement is taken. Also, a large number of

plans reduce pension benefits once social security eligibility age is

reached. These restrictions and supplements are incorporated into the

program. Additional restrictions have to do with vesting requirements,

maximum age at which the individual begins employment, minimum numbers of

years served before particular supplements are applicable, and restrictions on

years during which supplements may be applied. In calculating retirement

benefits, assumptions about wage growth are crucial. Since it is nominal wage

growth that is relevant, I examined the CPS data from 1974 and 1976 to infer

what a synthetic cohort age 55—63, in 1974, would earn as individuals 57—65

years old in 1976. As is known by most labor economists, earnings growth for

older individuals is negative, not positive, and this sample was no exception

to that rule. For the sample of males working "full time" in both years,

average nominal wage growth during that period was —2%. For those who were

full time in 1974 and full or part time in 1976, the rate was —13%. Most of

this reduction in observed earnings reflects reduction in hours worked by
                                       19




 these individuals, often as the result of illness. However, it is the annual

 earnings figure that is relevant for calculating pension benef its.7 In order

 to be conservative, it was assumed that the wage growth rate was zero, rather

 than negative. My assumption tends to increase the value of normal retirement

 benefits relative to early retirement benefits, and so, understates the amount

 by which the expected present value of pension benefits declines as one

postpones retirement. Additionally, the entire analysis was performed with an

earnings growth rate equal to +5%. This reduced the magnitude, but not affect

the direction of the results reported below.

     In order to calculate present values, an assumption about interest rates

must be made and a particular mortality table must be chosen. I assumed that

the interest rate was 10% and I used the life tables for Americans in 1975.

It is important to point out that it is not clear that this is the appropriate

life table. Early retirees may have different life expectancies than normal

retirees. The most obvious reason is that early retirees may retire early

because they are less healthy. If so, their life expectancy would be

shorter. These calculations would then overstate the amount by which pension

benefits decline as retirement age is postponed.


Findings

     Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics. The mean of the expected

present value of pension benefits taken at normal retirement age is $51,209

for those "workers't in our sample. But the variation is tremendous. The

standard deviation is $53,282 with a maximum value of $412,970 and a minimum

value of $398. Part of this is due to variation in salary and tenure

status. But even within each salary and tenure group, the variation in

benefits across companies is enormous. Within each group the maximum value is

about three times the mean, the minimum is about one—fifth of the mean, and
                                      20




the standard deviations go from about 30% to about 60% of the mean as salary

and tenure increase.

     The most important findings relate to the way that the expected present

value of pension benefits vary with the date of retirement. Table 2 reports

the means of expected present value of pension benefits upon retirement from

10 years before normal age to 10 years after normal age for that sample of

simulated individuals who were eligible for some pension benefits in all of

those situations. In Table 2, EPV—10 is the expected present value of

retirement at 10 years before the normal age; EPVO is the expected present

value at normal age; and EPV+10 is the expected present value at 10 years

after normal age. All other numbers correspond. The table is broken down by

salary and tenure category so that the averages reflect averages across

pension plans for individuals of a given type, rather than averages across all

individuals. The plans are also broken down into the three basic types:

pattern, or defined flat benefit plans; conventional, or defined formula

benefit plans; and defined contribution plans. Table 2 contains only

individuals having 20 or 30 years of tenure since those with 10 years of

tenure at age of normal retirement would not be eligible for early retirement

10 years prior. For ease of inspection, Table 2 also reports the ratio of

expected present value in a particular year to expected present value of

pension benefits if retirement occurs at the normal age. This is listed as

ERAT—10—ERAT+10 in the table.

     Two important points are obvious upon inspection. First, most workers

receive pensions, the expected present value of which declines as retirement

is postponed. The exception to this is individuals who are on defined

contribution plans. They are relatively rare, amounting to approximately

500,000 of the 8.4 million workers in the Banker's Trust sample.
                                          21




      This evidence suggests that firms   attempt   to buy old workers out of their

long—term arrangements. This is consistent with the notion that pensions are

used as a severance pay device to induce workers to leave early if it is

efficient for them to do so. Further, most pension plans have this feature,

the exception being plans of the defined contribution type.

      This evidence also suggests that pensions cannot be viewed simply as a

tax free savings account. That view is inconsistent with the finding that

most pensions lose value as the worker works beyond a certain point even

though he has withdrawn nothing from the account.8

      Finally, using equation 9, we can estimate the difference between the

worker's observed wage rate and his VMP. This is done for the 10 years

preceding normal retirement age and is reported in Table ? as WVDIFF—10 to

WVDIFF— 1.

     Note that the size of the wage VMP differential tends to increase with

experience (WVDIFF15 > WVDIFF6), is reasonable in size, and varies with tenure

at normal retirement.

     The estimated size of the difference between wage and marginal product

tends to start out negative and become positive. This reflects a wage rate

which is less than marginal product during the early years of the work life

and greater than marginal product in the later years.

     The magnitude of the difference between wage and marginal product seems

reasonable as well. For conventional plans, where the pension varies with

salary level, wages exceed marginal product by about 30% in the final year

before normal retirement for individuals with 30 years of tenure. For those

with only twenty years of tenure, that excess is closer to 10% of final

salary.
                                       22




      Individuals havinq shorter tenure at normal retirement age are workers

 who initiated employment with the firm more recently. Those workers are less

 likely to have wages which exceed their marginal products. In fact, for those

 workers, a significant fraction of the early years have wages below marginal

 product as reflected by a negative WVDIFF term. It is also true that the size

 of the differential varies with salary as expected. There seems to be a

 tendency for those with conventional pension plans, i.e., those with formula

 defined benefits, to be more overpaid when old than those with flat defined

 benefits or pattern plans. This can be explained. If higher wage workers are

more likely to be doing jobs which are more difficult to monitor, using an

upward age—earnings profile as an incentive mechanism is likely to be more

important for that group.

     To the extent that the simulated work force is representative, 92% of

simulated workers had a normal age of retirement equal to 65. Furthermore,

17% of those workers could not defer retirement beyond the age of 65.

     As discussed above, the way in which the value of pension benefits

available with employer consent, C, declines with the date of retirement

tells us something about the difference between the wage rate and the

reservation wage. Since the reservation wage must be lower than VMP for a

contract to be efficient, the ratio of the expected present value of retiring

without consent, C,, to expected present value of retiring with consent,

     should always be less than one, but should approach one as the individual

approaches normal retirement age. Table 3 selects individuals who have valid

information on benefits received with and without consent. An analysis

similar to that reflected in Table 1 is performed there and the hypothesis is

borne out. CERAT is defined as the ratio of expected present value of

benefits received when retiring without consent to expected present value of
                                             23




 benefits received when retiring with consent. The number following CERAT

 refers to the appropriate year, —10 being 10 years before the normal age of

 retirement and —1 being 1 year before the normal age of retirement.         Here, it

 is universally true that the ratio is less than one so that benefits from

 retiring with consent exceeds those from retiring without consent and that

 ratio approaches one as one moves toward normal retirement. It should be

 pointed out that 68% of the plans do not make any distinction between separa—

 tiori    with   or without employee consent. This is probably because when a

 difference exists, each side tries to induce the other to initiate the

 separation. Also, that benefits are not much larger when retirement occurs

 with consent is not surprising. For retirement to be efficient at         T, V(T) =
 W(T).     Since C(t) —    P(t)   is a measure of V(T) —   (T),   this is expected to

be small toward the end of the career.


Additional Results

         Although somewhat removed from the main issues of this paper, it seems

useful to investigate the data set further to explore some other aspects of

pension plans. Since this is among the first comprehensive data sets on

pension plans, it seems useful to examine the relationship between pension

benefits and some characteristics of the firms, workers, and plan types. This

is easily done by using the simulated data and by summarizing it in regression

form. Table 4 reports some regressions performed on the same simulated data

used to construct Table 1.

         The results provide some interesting insight into the major pension plans

in the United States. First examine column 2. Here, the expected present

value of the pension taken upon normal retirement is regressed on a number of

right hand variables. Each year of additional tenure upon normal retirement

contributes about $2,600 to the value of the pension. Thus, an individual who
                                            24


intended     to retire at age 65 would get about $2,600 more for beginning his job

at age 44 than he would if he had begun his job at age 45. Similarly, each

additional dollar of salary at the time of retirement maps into $2.87 in terms

of additional pension benefits. This does not say that pensions trade for

salary at a 2.87 to 1 ratio. The salary is a flow whereas the pension value

is a stock. This says that each additional dollar that an individual can earn

during his last few years of employment tends to bring about almost a $3

increase in pension benefits. Thgain, this is consistent with the interpre-

tation that wages and pensions are an incentive generating mechanism. If

harder working individuals are rewarded with higher wage rates during their

final years on the job, then this also increases the value of their pension

benefits multiplies the cost of shirking.

       There seems to be some tendency for larger firms to have more generous

pension benefits. Also formula defined benefit plans are clearly more

lucrative than are flat defined benefit plans. This is true for a given

salary level and it is also true that higher salaried individuals tend to have

the formula rather than the flat defined benefit scheme. Defined contribution

plans seem to be slightly less lucrative if the individual is to retire at the

normal age and significantly less lucrative if he plans to retire early.

However, defined benefit schemes are much better if the individual intends to

remain on the job past the normal retirement date since the present value of

those pension benefits increase with postponed retirement (of. columns 1, 2,

and   3 and note the change in sign on FORMULA) •    Columns   1 and 3 paint a
similar picture.
       In   column 4,   the relationship between the size of early retirement
benefits    and normal retirement benefits is examined. The most     striking

feature     is that the longer is tenure at the normal   retirement age, the higher
                                      25




is the ratio of early retirement benefits to normal retirement benefits.

Firms are more anxious to buy out individuals of a given age who started many

years ago than they are to buy out individuals of that same age who started

more recently. This makes sense. The contract has been negotiated more

recently for individuals with shorter tenure and they are less likely to be

overpaid than their more experienced counterparts of the same age.

     Individuals who receive defined benefits, either of the flat or formula

variety, have higher early retirement benefits relative to normal retirement

benefits than those who are part of a defined contribution plan. Since the

expected value of pension benefits does not decline over time for defined

contribution plans in the same way that it does for defined benefit plans,

they are less reasonably viewed as incentive generating devices.


Conclusion

     In sum, these data provide support for the view that pensions serve as an

efficient severance pay device. The fact that the expected present value of

pension benefits declines as the individuals postpones retirement suggests

that pensions are not merely a tax—free savings account. If pensions were

merely a tax—free savings account, then it is unlikely that the expected

present value of the pension would decline over the individual's life time.

The fact that pension benefits have a higher value upon early retirement than

upon normal retirement suggests that pensions are an integral part of the

compensation package. Additionally, the estimates suggest that workers

receive wage rates which exceed their marginal products by about 30—35% by the

time they reach retirement. This is consistent with the interpretation that

an important reason for upward sloping age—earnings profile is the provision

of incentives. Finally, the identity of the party who the separation affects

the size of the severance pay, although this practice is not universal.
                                     26




Pensions given at the employer's initiative are larger than those given when

employees initiate the separation. This carries with it the implication that

each party will try to induce the other side to initiate the action.

     1This issue arises in many recent papers which discuss the relationship

between compensation and efficiency. See for example, Arnott and Stiglitz

(1981), Azariadis (1980), Carmichael (1980), Cooper (1981), Green (1981),

Green and Honkapohja (1981), Grossman and Hart (1981a, b), and Hall and Lazear

(1981).

              assumes that V*(to) < V(t0) implies V(t) =           V*(to)   for t > to
              *                        *
and that V Ct0) =      V(t)   implies V Ct) =      V(t)   for t > to.

     3Th1s is consistent with Becker, Landes, and Michael (1977) in that a

separation occurs whenever it is efficient. The severance pay rule is

important, however, because it induces each side to voluntarily and

unilaterally separate only when it is efficient to do so. Landes' (1980)

analysis of alimony relates to this issue in that alimony is severance pay and

efficient alimony would make divorce "efficient." Hall and Lazear (1982)

analyze the issue of efficient severance pay in depth.

     4Yet there may be other causes for profiles which are steeper than

productivity. These do not require a distinction between a termination "with

cause" and one "without cause." There, any employer—initiated separation

carries with it payment C(t). Harris and Holinstrom (1982) and loannides and

Pissarides (1980) argue that insurance may be the motive.

     5That   the entire remaining stream must be examined is recognized in
Fields   and Mitchell (1981). Bulow (1981) also points out (as my calculations

implictly do) that the "true" current wage also includes the value of changing

the pension as the result of working that period.

     6Burkhauser and Quinn (1981) argue a similar point. It has been

suggested that altering the benefit formula can induce "voluntary" retirement

even if mandatory retirement is prohibited.

     7One feature of the CPS data may lead to an understatement of wage

growth. Since remaining on the same job is relevant to the calculation of

pension benefits, I restricted by attention in 1976 to individuals who had not

changed occupation or industry during the last two years. Some individuals

who remained within industry and occupation may have changed jobs and their

wage growth is likely to be lower than average.

         more sophisticated story is consistent, however. Pensions may also

serve the role of insurance. It can be argued that those who retire early are

the "losers," due to poor health, for example. An arrangement which paid them

more at the expense of those who retire later is consistent with the data. I

have argued elsewhere (Lazear [1979]) that the insurance explanation is

inconsistent with patterns of mandatory retirement across worker types.
