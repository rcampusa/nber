          The proponents of floating
                                       exchange rates before 1973 did not
  promise that exchange rates would
                                       necessarily be stable under such a
  system, but only that they would be as stable as the underlying
                                                                  macro-
  economic fundamentais.l
                           Nevertheless, the widespread feeling is that
  exchange rates have turned out to be more volatile than
                                                               necessary. Many
  practitioners believe that exchange rates are driven by
                                                               Psychological
  factors and other irrelevant
                                 market dynamics, rather than by ecomomic
 fundamentals. Support seems to have grown in the l980s
                                                         for "target—
 zone" proposals, or some other
                                sort of government action to stabilize
 exchange rates

         Economists have understood for some time that under conditions
                                                                         of
 high international capital
                             mobility, currency values will move sharply
 and unexpectedly in response to new information. Even
                                                         so, actual move-
 ments of exchange rates have been
                                      puzzling in two major respects.
 First, the proportion of
                            exchange rate changes that we are able to pre-
dict seems to be not just
                            low, but zero. According to
                                                            rational expecta-

                               nor the forecasts of market
                                                                participants
as reflected in the forward discount

1. Introduction

       When we return to the basics, to ask what is actually known about

the crucial building blocks of exchange markets, we find one question

that has been answered and three that have not. The one conclusion

about which there is no longer serious disagreement is that monetary

disturbances have real effects. The 1980s have witnessed very large

swings in real money supplies, real interest rates, and——more

demonstrably——real exchange rates, convincing most observers that there

is not an exogenous instantly—equilibrating optimally—functioning real

economy that can be divorced from monetary factors   .   It   follows that

even if financial markets do operate efficiently——a proposition that we

neither automatically presuppose nor rule out in this paper——one cannot

make an argument against government intervention in foreign exchange

markets on the grounds of Arrow—Debreu optimality alone.

       There are three questions that have yet to be satisfactorily

answered, and that are examined in this study. Question 1: How

responsive are investors' demands for domestic and foreign assets to

expected rates of return, that is, what is the degree of substitu-

tability? Question 2: How do investors form expectations? In

particular, how much weight do they give to the contemporaneous spot

rate and how much to other factors? Question 3: How does the actual

process governing the spot exchange rate correspond to the process

embodied in investors' expectations, that is, are expectations

rational? As we will see, these questions together contain the

essential elements necessary to evaluate claims of excessive exchange

rate variability.
                                        —3—



         We will be trying to shed light on these questions by
                                                               drawing on
  several areas of the existing
                                empirical literature on the spot and

  forward exchange markets, as well as on some new empirical results.

  Empirical topics to be covered, if
                                        only briefly, are non—stationarity of
  the nominal and real exchange
                                   rates, regression tests of exchange rate
  determination, forward market efficiency,
                                                variance—bounds tests and
  bubbles tests, portfolio_optjmizatjo and the exchange risk
                                                             premium, and
 expectations survey data.

        However, we begin by considering the more general motivation for

 answering the three questions stated above: how
                                                      knowing the answers to
 them might help answer whether
                                   exchange rate fluctuations have been

 unnecessarily large.


 2. Factors In lterainIng     'Rxcesslye   Variability'
        In seeking to get a handle on the question of alleged excessive

 variability, we specify as general a model of the spot exchange rate as

 possible.


             s = S(Z,
(1)                     ii*, AS   u).

We represent fundamental determinants
                                           such as asset supplies by t, the
interest differential by i—i*, investors' expected future change in

the exchange rate by ASe      and any short—term random factors   by u. The
last will be found necessary if we are to confront regression
                                                                  results,
which under the best of circumstances
                                         have relatively low R2s. It will
also be found necessary if we are to consider the issue of alleged

short—term volatility unrelated to fundamentals.
                                                  —4—



          The equation is so general that it could be interpreted as the

old balance—of—payments flow approach to exchange rate determination,

where     9.   represents factors affecting the current account and the other

three variables are determinants of the capital account •              We shall


follow the stock approach here however, in which the focus is on stocks

of assets rather than flows.

         We can impose additional structure on equation (1) by defining

9.    to be specifically the log of the supply of domestic assets minus the

log of the supply of foreign assets, defining s to be the log of the

spot price of foreign exchange, imposing homogeneity, and assuming also

that the two components of expected returns enter with coefficients of

equal magnitude:


(2)            s =   9.   —    L(i_i*_Me;    u)



In equation (2),               9.   is the relative supply of domestic assets and L

is the relative demand for domestic assets, which depends positively on

rp      l*_ASe ,              the risk premium or expected excess rate of return on

domestic assets. In a portfolio—balance approach, for example, we could

assume that the share of the portfolio allocated to foreign assets,

x, is linearly related to the risk premium on foreign assets:4


(3)            x = A — B (rp)


 Then (2) would hold, with


                               log(x(.)) —   log(l—x(.))   ,   and



               dL/d(rp) =
                                    (!+1JB
                                               —5—




        We can now use equation (2) to consider the question of exchange

  rate variability. it seems likely that regardless whether the funda—

 nientals term      2.   is defined to include only money supplies or also

 supplies of bonds and other assets, one cannot in fact explain observed

 variability in s by variability in                  9..   This is the Implication of

 both volatility tests and regressions of the spot rate against funda-

 mentals such as asset supplies .5            The same conclusion seems to hold as
 well if the fundamentals term           9.   is   defined to include the current
 account 6

        We are thus led to consider the other two terms in equation (2),

 which are determinants of asset demands rather than asset supplies:

              and u. The expectations formation process is key to the

 question of variability, whether as a source of fluctuations or as

 "stabilizing speculation," moderating the effect of disturbances that

originate in the other terms •          To allow for both the bandwagon effects

that are so often cited by participants in the
                                                               exchange market,7 and the
stabilizing expectations that are the norm in models based on economic

fundamentals, we can specify expected depreciation to be the sum of an

extrapolative or "bandwagon" expectations term and a regressive

expectations term:


(5)          As =
                     (s    —
                               sri)   + Q(s    —
                                                   se).
ODnsider a disturbance in u, or any of the other terms, that

increases s. lb the extent that               g > 0, "speculators," or investors,

will expect future increases in           s, will shift their asset demand into

foreign assets, and will thereby exaggerate the increase In                 s. To
                                       —6—




the extent that 0 > 0, they will expect a return back to the equilib—

rium value          and will thereby dampen the fluctuation. If g > 0,

expectations are said to be elastic or destabilizing; if g < 0, they

are said to be inelastic or stabilizing.

       It is important to note that equation (5) could be fully

consistent with rational expectations in a variety of models. For

example, in the case g = 0,        regressive expectations can be rational in

the sticky—price monetary ("overshooting") model of Dornbusch (1976),

where the rational value of 0 depends on the speed of adjustment of

the price level, or in the portfolio—balance model of Kouri (1977) and

Rodriguez (1980), where it depends on the speed of adjustment of the

stock of foreign claims.8 In the case 0 = 0         on the other hand,

extrapolative or "bandwagon" expectations could be rational in models of

speculative bubbles such as Blanchard and Watson (1982) or Dornbusch

(1982) .     Finally,   in the case g = 0    0, static expectations

 (ASe = 0)      could be rational if the true exchange rate process is a

random walk, a result consistent with recent empirical findings.9

           An alternative interpretation of equation (5) is a speculative

bubble: speculators think that there is a probability        0 that the

bubble will burst within the coining period and the spot rate will return

all the way to equilibrium s, and a probability (1—8) that it will

continue on a bubble path (in which case it will increase at a rate

equal to g/(1—e) times the rate at which it has already been

increasing) .o      Again, such a bubble could be rational, if the actual
spot rate turns out to follow the same process.
                                              —7--




           Friedman (1953) argued persuasively that speculators who had a

 destabilizing effect would be "buying high and selling low," and thus

 would lose money and be driven out of the market.            In modern terms, he

 argued that destabilizing speculation would be inconsistent with

 rational expectations. &t the modern realization that one can have

 rational stochastic speculative bubbles, in which each speculator stands

 to lose money if he doesn't go along with the others, has all but

 destroyed the classic Friedman argument.

          A linearized form of the equation of spot rate determination (2)

Equation (7) illustrates in a simple way a conflict that exists in dis-

cussions of excessive exchange rate volatility. Some economists, such

as Tobin (1978), argue that exchange rates are too variable because

financial markets are "excessively efficient," that capital sl0shes back
                                   —8—




and forth among countries in response to trivial disturbances, and that

a tax on foreign exchange transactions would reduce volatility. This

view says that volatility is high because 3,    the degree of substituta-

bility, is high. t there is another view, associated with McKinnon

(1976), that exchange rates are too variable because of a "deficiency of

stabilizing speculation,' in other words, because      is too low. The

apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that the variance is posi-

tively related to      (the Ibbin case) if   8 < g, (and   1 > (g—8))

because in that case the expectations to which investors react are

destabilizing. The variance is negatively related to        (the McKinnon

case) if B > g, because in that case expectations are stabilizing. To

analyze the possible sources of exchange rate volatility, we need to

consider both the degree of substitutability and whether expectations

are stabilizing.

        In this paper we will be seeking enlightenment on the empirical

magnitude of these parameters. In doing so we are leaving out much that

is central to the macroeconomics of exchange rates •   Even if the expres-

sion in (7) is small, one could still make many arguments for or against

restricting the movements of the exchange rate that result from changes

in macroeconomic factors such as   2. or i—i' (assuming it could be

done)

        For example, many economists believe that the strong real appre-

ciation of the dollar in the early l980s can be attributed to a shift in

the monetary—fiscal policy mix that raised the interest differential

j_j* and made U.S. assets more attractive to world investors. Some

believe further that it would not have been desirable to force down the
                                      —9—



 value of the dollar, for example by
                                       foreign exchange intervention or the
 imposition of controls to shut off the capital
                                                  inflow (even assuming it
 possible), in the absence of reductions in the fiscal
                                                         budget deficit.
 The argument is that U.S. Interest rates would have risen even more than

 they in fact did, crowding Out domestic investment.''

        To evaluate such
                           arguments, one should probably specify an objec-
 tive function, including such variables as output, inflation, trade

balance and investment, and try to judge whether letting the market

determine the exchange rate is likely to result in a higher value of the

objective function than proposed plans to stabilize the exchange rate.

Such questions are beyond the scope of this paper.'2

       Our interest here is only In the question whether foreign

exchange markets can fairly be said to be working well. If allegations

are found justified that speculative bubbles, a failure of market eff I—

ciency, or random fluctuations, are raising exchange rate variability

needlessly, then it could be said that the markets are not working well.

The possibility might in that case exist of obtaining lower exchange

rate variability without cost. There is a wealth of empirical results

that can be brought to bear.

                        It. Random Walk   Isu1ts

      A variety of different econometric approaches seem to end up at

the same conclusion, that the exchange rate follows a random walk. In

this part of the paper we discuss the apparent Inability to forecast

future changes In the exchange rate using either


  (i) the past time series of the process itself (section 11.1),

 (ii) macroeconomic fundamentals (section 11.2), or

(iii) the forward exchange market (section 11.3).

We then discuss what else, if anything, can be learned from the

currently popular variance—bounds and bubbles tests.


1. NonstationarIty of Noainal and al Fxchange Rates

       It is now widely recognized that the linear time series

representation of the natural logarithm of either spot or forward

exchange rates is best described by a random walk process 13 Formal

statistical tests for the presence of a unit root in the autoregressive

representation of the logarithms of spot and forward exchange rates were

first conducted by Meese and Singleton (1982) .    These unit root tests,

pioneered by Fuller (1976) and his students, are known to have low power

against borderline stationary alternatives. 1-wever, we find the

superior out—of—sample forecasting performance of the random walk model,

over time series models where the unit root Is not imposed, to be power-

ful evidence in favor of the unit root null. Finally, more recent

statistical tests of the unit root hypothesis that are robust to

conditionally heteroskedastic disturbances (Phillips (1985)) also
                                   —11—




 support the unit root hypothesis. This is an important methodological

 advance, since it is also widely recognized that exchange rate vari-

 ability tends to be episodic; see Qimby and Obstfeld (1984) for tests of

conditional heteroskedasticity in nominal exchange rates.'4

       Nonstationarity in the nominal exchange rate does not create

problems for standard theories of exchange rate determination. In the

monetary models, if the money supply is nonstationary in levels, or even

in changes, then the exchange rate will be nonstationary in levels or

changes. We have only to be careful how we specify our econometric

tests of nominal exchange rates, preferring first differences over

levels in general. Nonstationarity in the real exchange rate is

considered by some to be a more serious matter however. If the real

exchange rate follows a random walk, then there is no tendency to return

to purchasing power parity, and seemingly no limit on how far out of

line one country's prices can get from another's.'5

       Not long ago, purchasing power parity was widely accepted. It

was argued on a priori grounds that the law of one price should be

enforced at least for traded goods once transport costs were accounted

for: If automobiles were selling at a lower price in Germany than in

the United States, International arbitrageurs should buy them in Germany

and sell them in the United States, raising the price in one country or

lowering it In the other until equality was restored.

       The empirical evidence against PPP in level form is overwhelm-

ing. The enormous real appreciation of the dollar in the early l980s

convinced the remaining doubters, but abundant statistical evidence was

there all along. For example, Krugman (1978, p. 406) computed for the
                                      —L.
                                        I )_




floating   rate period July 1973 — December 1976 standard deviations of

the (logarithmic) real exchange rate equal to 6.0 percent for the

pound/dollar rate and 8.4 percent for the mark/dollar rate. He also

computed serial correlation coefficients for PPP deviations of .897 and

.854, respectively, on a monthly basis, equal to .271 and .150 on an

annual basis •    The serial correlation coefficient is of interest because

it is equal to one minus the speed of adjustment to PPP.

       Table 1 shows updated annual statistics on the real exchange rate

between the United States and Great Britain. During the floating rate

period 1973—84, there is a significant time trend, and a standard

deviation of I5.4 percent. The serial correlation in the deviations

from PPP is estimated at .720, with a standard error of .248. (The

equation estimated is (er         —         ) = AR(er t   —       )   +   c         ,   where
                            t+1       t+1                     t               t+1

er is the real exchange rate and er is the long—run equilibrium

level, alternatively estimated as the sample mean or a time trend, and

AR is the autoregressive coefficient.) This means that the estimated

speed of adjustment to PPP is .280 per year and that one can easily

reject the hypothesis of instantaneous adjustment.

       From the ashes of PPP, a phoenix has risen. In response to

findings such as those reported here, some authors have swung from one

extreme, the proposit1on that the tendency of the real exchange rate to

return to a constant is complete and instantaneous, to the opposite

extreme that there is no such tendency at all. &t there is even less

of an a priori case why PPP should hold in rate—of—change form than in

the level form.

       Several authors16 have claimed that the random walk model of the

real exchange rate has a basis in efficient markets theory. Their

argument is apparently that if the expected inflation rate is lower in

the United States than In Germany, allowing for expected exchange rate

changes, then an arbitrageur can contract to buy automobiles In the

United States and ship them to Germany and expect to sell them there at

a higher price; such profitable arbitrage would then eliminate the

opportunity to begin with, enforcing PPP in expected rate—of—change

form. If this arbitrage is intended to be different from the old

arbitrage in level form which has been empirically rejected, and these

authors clearly intend it to be different, then it Is a remarkable

strategy to recommend to international traders. Measures of expected

real depreciation of the dollar as of 1985 showed a short—term depreci-

ation rate of about 1.0 percent per annum. As of 1985, the level of fW

prices was said to be almost twice as high in the United States as in

Germany, as a result of the five—year appreciation of the dollar against

the mark. Yet the apparent strategy tells people to buy 1Ws in the

United States and ship them to Germany because in the three months It

takes to complete the shipment their relative prices will have increased

0.25 percent in expected value! The near—50—percent loss would seem to

outweigh the 0.25—percent gain.

       Even though ex ante relative PPP has little basis in theory, it

does appear to have some empirical support. Typically, the estimated

speeds of adjustment during the floating rate period, .27 or .28 on an

annual basis in Table 1 (1973—84), while not so low as to be Implausible

as point estimates, are nevertheless so low that one statistically
                                      —14—




 cannot reject the hypothesis that they are zero. In other words, one

 cannot reject the hypothesis that the autoregressive coefficient is 1.0.

        A 95—percent confidence interval on the autoregressive

 coefficient covers the range 0.17 to 1.27 (in the no—trend case). If

 the null hypothesis is an autoregressive coefficient of 1 .0, one cannot

 legitimately use the standard t—test derived from a regression where

 the right—hand variable is the level of the real exchange rate, because

 under the null hypothesis its variance is infinite.   There are a number

of ways of dealing with this nonstationarity problem. Here we simply

apply the corrected Dickey—Fuller (1979) cumulative probability distri-

bution for the t—test appropriate for this problem. The t—ratio to

test an autoregressive coefficient of 1.0 is 1.13, which falls far short

of the Dickey—Fuller 95—percent significance level, 3.00.

       This failure to reject a random walk in the real exchange rate is

the same result found by Roll (1979), Frenkel (1981, p. 699), Darby

(1981), Adler and Lehman (1983), Mishkin (1984, pp. 1351—53) and Pigott

and Sweeney (1985) .   Hakkio (1984) provides evidence of a unit root in

the real exchange rate using the Dickey—Fuller (1979) statistical

procedures. Most of these studies used monthly data rather than yearly,

and the statistical procedures employed were generally not powerful

enough to reject the random walk.'7

       A more promising alternative is to choose a longer time sample.

Table 1 also reports statistics for the entire postwar period 1945—84.

PPP held slightly better during the etton Woods years than it did

after 1973, as measured either by the mean absolute deviation and

standard deviation of the real exchange rate, or by the ability to
                                   —15—




reject the hypothesis of zero autocorrelation. t,     despite   the longer

time sample, one is still unable to reject the random walk. The 95—

percent confidence interval runs from .65 to 1.01, and the t—ratio of

1 .9 falls short of the Dlckey—Fuller 95—percent significance level of

2 .93.

         The last column of Table 1 presents an entire 116 years of U.S.—

U.K. data. With this long a time sample, the standard error is reduced

considerably. The rejection of no serial correlation in the real

exchange rate Is even stronger than in the shorter time samples. More

important, one is finally able to detect a significant tendency for the

real exchange rate to regress to PPP, at a rate of 14 percent a year.

The confidence interval for AR runs from .77 to .95, safely less than

unity, and the t—ratio of 2.92 exceeds the Dickey—Fuller significance

level of 2.89.

         If the speed of adjustment to PPP is indeed on the order of 20

percent a year, and the standard deviation of the real exchange rate is

on the order of .15, then the standard deviation of new shocks is on the

order of /1 — .802)(    .152) = 10 percent. With such a large error term

in the regression equation, it is not surprising that most econonietri—

clans have been unable statistically to reject zero adjustment using the

data from a mere 14 years of post—1973 data. The tests simply have

insufficient power. This conclusion is supported by Monte Carlo tests

as performed by Hakkio (1986). He hypothesizes an ARIMA (1,1,2) process

for the real exchange rate (with the first—order autoregressive coef-

ficient equal to .9) and manufactures 100 months of data. He finds that

the standard tests are not powerful enough to reject the random walk.'8
                                     —16--




         The problem distinguishing between a stationary and a random walk

 process can be considered by calculating an
                                                 approximate value of sample
 size N that would give rise to a 95 percent confidence interval for

 AR (the first order autoregressive
                                       coefficient) that excludes the value
 one. With a little hand—waving and the use of the conventional formula

 for the variance of the estimate of
                                        AR these values of N would be
 roughly 156, 196, and 759 for actual values of
                                                     AR equal to .95, .96,
 and .99 respectively. N=156 is roughly the number of months in the

 modern floating rate period. In terms of the half—life of deviations

 from PPp it would take about 13,
                                    16, and 68 observations (months) for 50

 percent of the deviations from PPP to disappear, when     AR for the real
 exchange rate was .95, .96 and .99 respectively.

        Thus in our view the evidence for a unit root in real exchange

 rates is much less convincing than the evidence for a unit root in

nominal exchange rates, suggesting that PPP is still a reasonable anchor

for long—run exchange rate expectations.

nominal exchange rates and the near nonstationarity of the real exchange

rate for tests of spot rate determination,
                                               forward rate bias, and
variance bounds will be discussed at the

three sub—sections respectively.


2. gress1ons of &change     te 1ter1natjon
       Regressions of equations of exchange rate determination were the

first sort of tests to become popular in the iuld—l970s. The flexible—

price monetary model,'9 for example, was represented by the equation
                                     —17—




(8)       s =     —     + X(i_i*) + u


where s is the log of the spot exchange rate (domestic currency!

foreign), mt is the log of the domestic money supply relative to the

foreign, " is the log of domestic income relative to foreign,

(i_i*) is the interest differential, and u is the regression

error. The model is derived from the assumption of instantaneous

adjustment and perfect substitutability in the goods market (implying

purchasing power parity) as well as in the bond market (implying

uncovered interest parity) 2O Under the assumptions, (i_i*)t could as

easily be replaced by the forward discount fdt, or by investors'

expected rate of depreciation ts.


(9)       s =m    —     + X(s) +

Intuitively, an increase in the relative supply of the domestic

currency m will lower its value, or raise the price of foreign

currency s. Anything that raises the relative demand for domestic

currency, like an Increase in relative income y or a decrease in

expected future capital losses          will have the opposite effect.

       Other authors argued that important elements were missing from

the equation. As we saw in the last section, deviations from purchasing

power parity are in fact very large. If they were purely random, they

could just be subsumed in the regression error u (as could random

shifts in money demand) .   &it   we also saw that they are in fact highly

autocorrelated. If the deviations are thought to have an

autocorrelation coefficient of 1, i.e., If the real exchange rate is
                                                  —18—




 thought to follow a random walk, we have the version of the monetary

 model used by feese (1986)              .   The equation could simply be estimated on

 first differences.                   the other hand, if deviations from PPP arise

 primarily from price level stickiness and thus are thought to be damped

 over time, e.g., to follow an AR(1), and if expectations correctly

 reflect this tendency to return to long—run equilibrium, then a more

 complete model is needed. The real interest differential, which is

 equal to expected real depreciation, will be proportionate to the

 current deviation from equilibrium.2' In the sticky—price monetary

niodel,22 we can simply add the real interest differential
       e            *   *e
(i—u       ) — (i            ), to   equation (8): When the interest differential

rises without a rise in expected inflation (lTe)                  it   attracts an

incipient capital inflow that causes the currency to appreciate. The

coefficient is 1/9, where 0 is the expected rate of adjustment of

the spot rate to equilibrium.

            Another alternative to the simple monetary model is the

portfolio—balance model23 which relaxed the assumption of uncovered

interest parity, and as a consequence introduced the stocks of bonds

into the model. Some synthesis versions required only adding a variable

for the cumulation of government deficits and current account deficits

to the earlier equations 24

            These models have all been grouped under the name "asset market

approach" because they all assume that exchange rates are determined in

financial markets in which investors are able to shift their asset

holdings instantaneously. it is important to note that the models

already build in a high degree of exchange rate volatility, even without
                                    —19—




any special factors such as irrational expectations, speculative bub-

bles, or an error term. In the flexible—price monetary model, for

example, a one percent change in the money supply will have a more—than—

proportionate effect on the contemporaneous exchange rate, if it leads

investors to expect more money growth and currency depreciation in the

future. (This has been called the magnification effect.)

        In the sticky—price overshooting model of Dornbusch, even a

onetime change in the money supply can have a more—than—proportionate

effect, because it transitorily lowers the interest rate and as a result

drives the value of the currency below the new long—run equilibrium

level.25 Sometimes, especially in policy circles, the overshooting

model has been mistakenly invoked to support the idea that irrationality

or speculative bubbles increase exchange rate variability. &t most

readers of the Dornbusch paper have realized that its beauty lies

precisely in the fact that overshooting occurs even when investors

behave well in the sense that their speculation equates the forward

discount to the rationally expected rate of depreciation. Indeed, when

expectations are rational in the Dornbusch model, the conditional

variance of the spot rate is given by

                    2
(10)       (1 +-—-) c

where       is   the variance of changes in the money supply.26 There is a

sense in which this much volatility, if not necessarily optimal for the

allocation of resources (a question on which we have demurred), is a

natural and inevitable consequence of money supply changes in a sticky—

price world.
                                  —20—



       The econometric evidence from regression tests can only be

interpreted as saying that either expected depreciation is not

adequately captured by the forward discount (or Interest differential),

or else there is some other substantial error term u in an equation

like (8) that will enter the variance of s in addition to the

fundamentals variables. e can always postulate the existence of

variables that must have been incorrectly omitted, as the real interest

differential would be if the sticky—price monetary model is correct but

equation (8) is tested without it. &t it is fair to say that every

equation that has been proposed, or that is likely to be proposed in the

future, has a substantial error term left over. Much- has been made

(appropriately) of the models' inability to predict out—of—sample. &lt

many of the regression estimates have shown very poor fits, not to

mention unsensible coefficients, within the sample period as well. Even

for the sample period during which the sticky—price monetary model fit

the mark/dollar data remarkably well, the R2 was only .80.27

Subsequent sample periods usually showed less sensible coefficients and

worse fits for all varieties of models (except when a lagged endogenous

variable Is used. In such cases a more informative goodness of fit

statistic would be one that measured the contribution of the explanatory

variables after accounting for the past history of the spot rate.)28

       Unsensible coefficients are often attributable to endogeneity of

rlghthand side variables. For example, negative coefficients on the

money supplies can be attributed to central bank reaction to the

exchange rate when setting monetary policy. Income, interest rates and

other variables are also almost certainly endogenous 29 Unsensible
                                  —21—



coefficients would in turn explain the inability to predict even

directions of movement out—of—sample. Such econometric problems have

encouraged many to go on to other testing procedures, such as those

discussed in later sections. &t it is Important to note at this stage

that the endogeneity problems alone cannot explain the poor fits •    To

see this, one need not rely on instrumental variables estimates, which

are only as good as the instruments used. One can impose a unit coef-

ficient on the money supply and reasonable values on the other coeffi-

cients; the fits are still poor.3° In the limit, if the error term

    in the regression were indeed always close to zero, one should get a

perfect fit regardless of whether the rIghthand—side variables are

determined in other equations. This is true even If sophisticated

theories of the expectations term are built from rational expectations,

speculative bubbles, etc. Assuming expected depreciation is measurable

by the forward discount, then some function of the forward discount and

other fundamentals should give a good fit, unless there are large

omitted factors.

      Why emphasize so much the poor fits? The first reason is it

already gives us our first conclusion: no set of macroeconomic vari-

ables that has been proposed is capable of explaining a very high

percentage of the variation in the exchange rate. One can always postu-

late, In the manner of "real business cycle theory" some unobservable

portfolio shifts or productivity shocks that must be determining the

exchange rate. &it if the shocks cannot be measured or even described

meaningfully, then they probably belong in the error term u. Our

conclusion that the magnitude of u Is large Is evidence, for example,
                                 —22—




undermining any defense of exchange rate variability made on the grounds

that it is appropriate given changes in monetary policy. If all

exchange rate changes were in truth explainable by changes in money sup-

plies, either contemporaneous or anticipated, we would have much better

results In our regressions of the monetary equation (1) than we do.

       The second reason why we flag here the poor fits and simultaneity

problems is that some of the alternative tests that econometricians have

turned to, though seemingly more sophisticated than these regressions,

are very sensitive to the assumed behavior of the error term.    These are

the variance—bounds and bubbles tests, which are discussed in section

11.4 below.

       Faced with poor econometric results for our models based on

macroeconomic fundamentals, the proper response is to test components of

the models in isolation. (It is not to test the models jointly with

other assumptions!) Tests of unbiasedness in the forward market are one

such approach, as almost all of the models include rational expectations

as a key element, or at least as a special case. They are also thought

to shed light on the question whether the forward discount can

legitimately be used to measure expected depreciation. We now turn to

these tests


3.   InterpretIng 1sts of Bias in the Forward Discount
        The literature testing the unbiasedness of the forward discount

is by now truly voluminous. Typically, the ex post error made by the

 forward discount in predicting the change in the spot rate is regressed

 against information available at the beginning of the period, such as
                                  —23—




the lagged prediction error.3' It often turns out that a statistically

significant portion of the prediction errors can be explained using the

available information, which constitutes a rejection of the null hypo-

thesis of unbiasedness.

       The most common test in this literature takes the forward dis-

count itself to be the information set on which expectations are

conditioned.32 The regression equation is


(11)      As÷1 =   a   + b fd +


Under the null hypothesis that the forward discount is an unbiased

predictor of actual depreciation, the coefficient b should be one.33

       It is important to consider tests of the bias in the forward rate

in difference rather than levels form. Earlier versions of the test

regressed the level of the realized future spot rate against the level

of the forward rate.34 The argument in favor of the difference versions

of the forward rate bias test can be made as follows • Since the loga-

rithms of the levels of spot and forward rates contain unit roots, each

of these series are highly autocorrelated. In addition, the sample

contemporaneous cross correlation of the log levels of spot and forward

rates is essentially one, over any subset of the modern floating rate

period. This common stochastic trend in the log levels of spot and

forward rates ensures that they are highly cross—correlated, even when

the two series are sampled at slightly different points in time.

Finally, the sample variance estimates of the log levels of spot and

forward rates are essentially the same over any subset of the recent

floating rate period. These "empirical regularities" guarantee that the
                                   —24—




slope coefficient from a regression of         on      will be near

unity, as this coefficient is equal to the sample correlation coeffi-

cient when the variables have the same sample variance. In modern time

series parlance, the log levels of spot and forward rates are cointe—

grated with a cointegrating constant near unity. The set of empirical

regularities that suggests the levels regression will have a coefficient

near one has no implications for either of the difference versions of

the forward rate bias test.35

         The null hypothesis in equation (11) is usually rejected. The

coefficient is significantly less than one; the implication is that one

could expect to make money by betting against the forward discount

whenever it is nonzero. Often the estimated coefficient is close to

zero or even negative, which would say that the forward discount does

not even get the direction of movement of the exchange rate right.

Bilson (1981) interprets this finding as "excessive speculation:"

investors would do better if they would routinely reduce toward zero the

magnitude of their expectations of exchange rate changes.

         Most economists have not followed Bilson in the large step from

the statistical finding of bias to the conclusion that the rational

expectations hypothesis should be rejected. The economist's usual a

priori argument——that any incipient opportunity for earning excessive

profits would quickly attract investors who would eliminate it——is

considered sufficiently strong that other explanations for the finding

of bias are sought.

         Easily the most common explanation given is exchange risk. Risk—

averse   investors will demand some extra expected return for taking an
                                  —25—




open position in a currency that they perceive as riskier.36 Whether or

not the optimal statistical predictor equals the expectation that inves-

tors have in mind (rational expectations), if the investors' expectation

is not in turn equal to the forward rate (because of a risk premium

separating them), then the forward raje will be biased. This explana-

tion is discussed at some length in Part III.

       Here we discuss two other explanations that are sometimes given

for the finding of bias in the forward rate. One is easily covered.

Under the joint null hypothesis of rational expectations and risk

neutrality, it is expected real profits that should be zero; but the

condition usually tested is the absence of expected nominal profits.

The reason for the distinction is not that goods price indices are

different in different countries. The same price index, determined by

whatever consumption basket is relevant for the investor in question,

should be applied to both currencies. The problem is rather that the

price index goes in the denominator of the expression for the expected

real value of an asset, and by Jensen's Inequality it does not drop out

of the expected difference in returns on countries' assets. (This is

the resolution of the famous "Siegel's Paradox;" see Frankel and Razin

(1980), Fngel (1984) or the references cited in these papers for a more

complete explanation.) Doing the tests in real terms rather than

nominal does not seem to make much difference however. This is what one

would expect from the fact that the short—term variability of goods

prices is much smaller than the variability of exchange rate; presumably

it is also true that uncertainty regarding goods prices is much smaller

than uncertainty regarding exchange rates. Indeed, in the special case
                                  —26--




where goods prices are nonstochastic when expressed in the currency of

the producer country and the spot rate is distributed log—normally, the

usual method of running the regression on logs of the nominal spot and

forward rate is exactly correct .

       A more serious obstacle to interpreting findings of forward rate

bias as evidence against the joint hypothesis of rational expectations

and risk neutrality is the "peso problem." As is widely known by now,

the peso problem arises when there is the possibility of a large depre-

ciation in the currency contingent on an exogenous event that may not

have occurred in the sample period. In the context of the surprisingly

sustained period of dollar appreciation in the early 1980s, with the

forward market all the while forecasting a depreciation, it has been

suggested that either the collapse of a rational speculative bubble or a

sudden shift in the fiscal and monetary policy mix could be such an

exogenous event. Unfortunately, the term "peso problem" is sometimes

used indiscriniinantly to explain away any rejections of unbiasedness,

leaving one to wonder why the test is run in the first place. It is

important to remind ourselves of the familiar fact that standard

statistical significance tests take into account the possibility of an

event by chance failing to occur in the sample. (This assumes that the

sample period was dictated by exogenous considerations such as data

availability, as Is the case in most of the tests.) One cannot say, for

example, that "the forward market repeatedly mis—forecast the apprecia-

tion of the dollar in 1981—84 because it could not know that the White

House or Qrngress would repeatedly fail to correct the structural budget

deficit." If investors repeatedly mis—forecast fiscal policy in the
                                  —27—




same direction, that itself Is a violation of the rational expectations

hypothesis.

       The correct definition of the peso problem is that, because of

the possibility of a discretely—large change in the exchange rate, a

usually—respectable number of observations might not in fact be large

enough to give an approximately normal distribution to the coefficient

estimate, with the result that the usual significance levels applied to

the t—statistic may be inappropriate.38 When one suspects that such a

failure of normality may be a problem, one response is to use tests that

do not require that distributional assumption. Nonparametric tests of

the dollar in the 1981—1985 period show that statistical rejections of

unbiasedriess need not necessarily depend on normality: the dollar re-

peatedly moved upward in value while the forward discount was predicting

the reverse (Frankel (l985b), Evans (1986)). It is true, however, that

nonparanietric tests frequently depend on a random sampling assumption.

       If we leave behind Jensen's Inequality and the peso problem, the

exchange risk premium remains the major explanation——short of a

rejection of rational expectations——for the findings of bias In the

forward rate. We will consider exchange risk, and the information to be

gained from the theory of portfolio optimization, in Part III.


4. Variance &unds and B.ibbles 1ksts

       Variance bounds tests have been found intuitively appealing for

two reasons. First, they have the appearance of more generality than

regression tests. Second, they appear to hook up neatly with the

popular feeling——which is the main motivation of the present study——that

markets have been in some sense too volatile.
                                 —28—




       It has been pointed out repeatedly that the variance—bounds and

bubbles tests require the assumption that the economic fundamentals have

been correctly identified. Hamilton and Whiteman (1986) criticize the

bubble tests on the grounds that "one can always relax restrictions on

the dynamics of the fundamental driving variables so as to interpret

what appears to be a speculative bubble as instead having arisen from

rational agents responding solely to economic fundamentals not observed

by the econornetrician." Similarly, Meese (1986) and Flood, Hodrick and

Kaplan (1986, p. 32) argue that the tests are actually tests of the

joint hypothesis of (1) a correct model, (ii) no regime changes, and

(iii) no bubbles.

       These criticisms have also been levelled at the variance—bounds

tests applied to the stock market by Shiller (1981). For example, Marsh

and Merton (1986) argue that their assumption about the dynamic process

governing the payout of dividends will result in a violation of

Shiller's sample variance bounds even when the simple stock price

present value is in fact true. &it it has not entirely sunk in, for the

case of the foreign exchange market, how damaging is the dependence of

the tests on having correctly specified the macroeconomic fundamentals.

(The same could be said for specifying the money demand function cor-

rectly in tests of hyperinflation.) In the case of the stock market, at

least modelling the price as the present discounted value of expected

future dividends is fairly airtight, subject only to the possible

problem of a risk premium.39

       We now spell Out briefly the steps in deriving a bubbles test,

starting from a model such as equation (9), and the perils that lie
                                              —29—




therein. If agents are assumed to have rational expectations, Ase

can be replaced by E(st÷i —           s)        in the equation:


                                                —
(9')      s =         —
                                  + X(Es+i          s)   + u

Equation (9') could be estimated by McCallum's (1976) method of replac-

ing Est+i by the expost realization st+1 plus a random prediction

error et and then using an instrumental variables (IV) technique

such as Generalized Method of Moments or two—step two—stage least

squares. Alternatively, if the regression error                         were thought to be

small relative to the expectational error                          it would be preferable

to solve for              before estimating.


(9'')     s1 =             St
                                  —
                                      m   + -   y —-u          —



Equation (9') or (9'') will hold——under the joint hypothesis of rational
expectations and the rest of the model——regardless whether there is a

speculative bubble term or not.

        To test the special case of no bubble, we estimate the model a

different way. We solve for s as a function of expectations:


(12)      St =
                  1

                          m
                              —
                                  r'      +
                                              jrA
                                                    (Es+i) +
                                                                   1
                                                                       Ut

We then note that


             E ——
             tst+l — 1+A          m+i 1+A t't+1  1+A ' t5t+2'+—E1
                                          ——--- +—E           1+A t''t+l' '


substitute   into (12), and continue to substitute recursively. The well—

known result is that the (no—bubble) solution for today's exchange rate

can be written as the present discounted sum of the entire expected
                                   —30--




future path of monetary conditions:

                         T
           *         x    I
(13)      s =      (Tj-) (-) E +T —        t+T +    t+T

For example, if far—sighted agents expect an increase in the money

supply to take place four years in the future, it will have an effect on

the exchange rate today. The reason is that they expect the currency to

depreciate (whether in terms of goods or foreign currency) in four

years, and thus expect that agents in three years will seek to move out

of domestic currency in anticipation of capital losses, causing a

depreciation in that period. Agents in two years will in turn seek to

move out of domestic currency, and so on. The depreciation is passed

all the way back to the present.

       Note that setting the price of foreign exchange to the present

discounted sum of expected future monetary conditions (where the

discount factor is iI(1+x)) is analogous to the model In the stock

market that sets the price of equity to the present discounted value of

expected future dividends (where the discount factor is one over one

 plus the real interest rate) .   The major difference is that we are much

 less confident about having the right fundamentals in the foreign

 exchange market. In addition, estimation of equation (13) requires that

 the disturbance term u be uncorrelated with the appropriately dated

 fundamentals (or else an IV procedure must be utilized40)

        Equation (13) gives only the particular fundamentals solution,

 which sets the coefficient on the speculative bubble term to zero. The

 intent of the bubbles tests is to test the equation against the

 alternative more general solution
                                          —31—




(14)         s =   s     +


where a is any stochastic process satisfying E,a+ =              a   .   The

extra term can arise from self—fulfilling expectations: if everyone

expects the dollar to appreciate, even if for a reason unrelated to

fundamentals ("sunspots"), they will buy dollars and drive up the price,

so that the expectation turns out to have been rational. In a single

deterministic bubble of the sort Flood and Garber (1980) test for,

a      is a constant •       Wit there are other possibilities. In the

stochastic bubble model of Rianchard and Watson (1982) at has a

probability of collapsing to zero each period.

          The next step in the bubbles tests of West (1984), Meese (1986)

and Casella (1985) is a non—trivial assumption in any context: some

stable dynamic process must be assumed for the fundamentals variables

       and y, such as a vector autoregression. Then the Hansen—Sargent

(1980) prediction formula can be applied to (13) so that the expected

future values of m and                 are substituted out. This results in a

multiple equation system with nonlinear cross equation constraints that

we shall refer to as (13').

          The trick behind the bubbles test Is the recognition that under

the null hypothesis of "no bubble term" the estimator of the parameters

of equations (13') will be more efficient than the estimator of the

parameters of equation (9') .         Under the alternative hypothesis that

there is a bubble term as in equation (14), the estimator of the

parameters of equation (9') will still be consistent, whereas the

estimator of the parameters of equations (13') will be inconsistent.
                                  —32—




Thus a Hausman (1978) specification test can be used to choose between

the two possibilities.

       At least four propositions are being maintained when estimating

the system (13'); (a) the macroeconomic model such as equation (8) is

correct, (b) the interest differential or forward discount is an

unbiased predictor in the sense of equalling the realization within the

sample period, up to a random prediction error (this requires rational

expectations, no peso problem or regime changes, and no risk premium),41

(c) there are no bubbles, and (d) the dynamic model assumed for the

explanatory variables is correct. (The last assumption can be checked

independently using standard procedures.) Assumptions (a) and (b) are

also maintained when estimating (9') .   Thus the bubbles test procedure

only makes sense if diagnostic checks of the estimated fit of (9') do

not indicate misspecification. Testing propositions (c) and (d) while

maintaining (a) and (b) has the obvious difficulty that if the null

hypothesis Is rejected one does not know why. &it In the present

context, it seems particularly tenuous, since propositions (a) and (b)

can be tested individually, and few people interpret the evidence as

supporting them.

        In addition, the small sample properties of the bubble specifi-

 cation test have been questioned (in the context of the present value

 relation for stock prices) by Mattey and Meese (1987) .   In   their sitnu—

 lation experiments the nonparametric tests for bubbles turned out to be

much more reliable tests for the presence of bubbles than the specifi—

 cation test. Evans (1986) has employed nonparametric tests of bubbles
                                      —33.—




on the dollar—pound exchange rate over the recent floating rate period,

and reports finding a bubble in the dollar—pound rate.

        We now consider the weaknesses of variance bound tests • We

repeat equation (1), or its incarnation as the monetary model equation

(9), as



           s =     +         —
                                 s)
where      is the sensitivity of the current spot rate to the expected

change in the spot rate (the same as A, the semi—elasticity of money

demand, in the monetary model), and           denotes all the fundamentals.

Now the results from Meese and Singleton (1983) allow us to deduce


(15)       var(s) < var(i)


in the absence of exchange market bubbles. }re             can include the

structural disturbance u in (1) or the variance bound can be taken

after projecting s and            on an information set that excludes

u. The variance bound in (15) can be written in terms of conditional

variances or, if equation (9') holds in first differences with u as

the structural disturbance, then a bound analogous to (15) holds for the

first difference of s and              Thus nonstationarity of the

exchange rate or fundamentals will not undermine the following discus-

sion. The relation (15) makes It clear that It is meaningless to com-

pare the variability of s with an individual component of

unless SL contains a single variable, or we know all the values of the

structural parameters on the variables in           and the covariances

between all the fundamentals. Actual variance bounds tests of (1) are
                                         —34—




generally uninteresting because they test whether the variance of a

linear combination of the variables in 5L is an upper bound on the

variance of s, and the tests are conditioned on knowing the correct

variables and the correct values of the structural coefficients.             While

it is true that the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methodology of

Hansen (1982) can be used to construct a statistical test of (15) that

incorporates the sampling variability of the estimated parameters, this

has not been done in the exchange rate context •           We   believe that such an

exercise is futile since It is already known that asset market models of

exchange rate determination fit poorly.

        A more obvious problem with variance bounds tests can be seen

from the application of variance bounds procedures to tests of forward

rate bias. Recall that the unbiasedness equation


 (16)         s+i =   a + b(fd) +               with b =   1    implies



 (17)         var(As+i) > var(fd)

 The variance bounds test has no power to detect the alternative


 cov(fdi c) = cov{fd
                             ,
                                 (s   —
                                          f)]    > 0, since (17) would hold a

                                                                     of (16)
 fortiori .    The most common empirical finding in regression tests

 is that cov(As÷i fd) < 0 which also implies that cov(fdt, ct+1 < o.42

 However, the variance of the lefthand side of (17) is typically so much

 larger than the variance of the righthand side that a test of (17) fails

 to uncover a significant negative covariance of the forward discount

 with the forecast error              For example, take the published results

                      His   regression    tests of (16), reported in his Table 1
 in Huang (1984) •

 (p. 157), indicate two rejections of b =           1   when       < o and one
                                    —35—




rejection of b =    1   when b > 0, out of a total of nine currencies.

In his following Table 4 (p. 160), none of the variance bounds tests

reject (17) for the same currencies and sample periods. It is true that

all of Huang's point estimates of the bound



            var(ts+i) > var(e1)

are violated, but none of the violations is statistically significant.

These "small sample" results illustrate the large—sample theoretical

results of Fraukel and Stock (1987) who show that the most powerful

conditional volatility test is equivalent to the analogous regression

test in terms of asymptotic power. See also Froot (1987)

          Finally, we conclude this section by noting that it is the lower

variance bound on the forward rate (or forward discount) that is

violated in exchange markets, not the upper bound. Properties of

conditional variances allow us to deduce var(f)        var(s) where

St
     is   the predictor of s based on the limited informatin set of past

spot rates. The forward rate is the predictor of the spot based on the

market's larger information set. (The regression analogy is that R2

cannot decrease when you add explanatory variables.) Since the variance

of the prediction error from forecasting s on just its own past value

is less than the variance of the prediction error from forecasting the

spot rate with          the market's forecast, the lower variance bound on

the forward rate is violated. (See for example the root mean square

error statistics in Meese and Rogoff (1983a) for the forward rate versus

the random walk model as predictors of future spot rates and the other

results discussed in section 11.3.)

                      III. The change Risk Pre1ua

       We   are interested in the size and variability of the risk premium

for two reasons •   First   if the size and variability are thought to be

small, as argued in Frankel (1986a), then it is difficult to attribute

the results of regression tests of forward rate unbiasedness (described

in section 11.3), or the results of variance bounds tests (described in

section 11.4), to the risk premium. This would leave only the explana-

tion that expectations cannot be assumed rational (in the sense of

lending themselves to representation by the ex post sample

distribution)

       Even if expectations are thought to be rational, there Is a

second motivation for looking at the variability of the risk premium.

Since the risk premium, rp in equation (2), together with the

substitutability parameter ,        can be a key determinant of the exchange

rate, estimating the variability of the risk premium will help us

analyze the sources of variability in the spot rate           Here we will

be particularly interested in the effects on s        when there is an


exogenous change in asset supplies L,        expectations As, or the

substitutability parameter .

        Until   relatively recently, empirical work on the risk premium was

 limited almost entirely to the estimates of bias in the forward market's

 prediction of future spot rates discussed in section 11.3. The problem

 was that rational expectations had to be assumed a priori in order to

 interpret the systematic component of the prediction errors as equal to

 the risk premium. For those who were willing to make that assumption,
                                    —37—



the conclusion was that the risk premium is large and variable. For

example, the finding of zero coefficients in the regression of exchange

rate changes against the forward discount implied that the rationally

expected rate of depreciation was zero (random walk), and 100 percent of

the forward discount was made up by the risk premium, rather than by

expected depreciation. Since the dollar's forward discount against the

mark or yen has moved over a range of roughly 2 percent to 4 percent in

recent years, this would imply that the risk premium was substantial in

both magnitude and variability.

        It has been argued that if the systematic component of the

prediction errors is indeed properly interpreted as the risk premium,

then it ought to be related statistically to those variables on which

theory tells us that the risk premium depends. We now turn to the

theoretical determinants of the risk premium and the corresponding

econometric tests.


1. Implications of Portfolio—Optimization with Qnstant Variance

        If investors maximize single period utility that is a function of

mean and variance of end of period wealth, asset demands can be written

as a linear function of expected relative rates of returns:


(3')       x = A — B rp


where       =   pc2   and A is the minimum variance portfolio. The

parameter p is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and c is

the variance (covariance matrix in general) of exchange returns.

Several authors43 have inverted equation (3') without imposing the
                                  —38—



theoretical restrictions of mean—variance analysis, and have attempted

to explain the ex post risk pretniuni (forecast errors) by variables to

which portfolio balance theory says that the risk premium should be

related. This line of research has uniformly found no relation

between rp and x. The difficulty n predicting ex post risk premiums

by asset shares can be appreciated by inspecting figures 1—5, where the

two variables are plotted for five currencies versus the dollar over

April 1973 to December 1984. The mean drifts in the Japanese, German,

French and British shares are not accompanied by mean drifts in the

corresponding excess return variables.

       Using the constraints implied by mean—variance analysis, and

reasonable coefficient estimates for the parameters in (3t) Frankel

(1986a) has argued that the exchange rate risk premium (and also its

variability) must be very small. The argument can be summarized as

follows: the unconditional monthly variance of the relative return on
                                                                          If
dollars over the period August 1973 — August 1980 is roughly .001.

we take .001 as an upper bound on the conditional variance of relative

dollar returns, and a coefficient on risk aversion equal to two, then

 the term tpc]   is .002. An increase in the supply of foreign assets

 equal to 1% of the portfolio would only require an increase in the risk

 premium of 2.4 basis points on an annual basis!44 The argunient does,

 however, assume that the conditional variance of returns is constant; we

 take up this subject in the next subsection.

        Hansen and Idr1ck (1983), and Wdrick and Srivastava (1984,

 1986), among others, have attempted to conduct inference regarding the

 magnitude and variability of the risk premium using a more general
                                  —39--




intertemporal utility valuation model of the risk premium. In this

setting a linear equation relating asset supiles to the risk premium

would only obtain if investors' preferences were logarithmic or asset

returns are interternporally independent. We would not a priori expect

to be able to explain the risk premium by relative asset shares alone,

so these models offer an alternative theory of rp.

       The intertemporal general equilibrium model of Lucas (1982), as

amended by Fbdrick and Srivastava (1984), can be used to derive a

relation between the forward rate and the expected future spot rate.

While this model relies on some very restrictive assumptions, It

provides considerable insight into the nature of the exchange rate risk

premium. In this type of individual utility maximization model the

equilibrium price of an asset Is found by equating the foregone marginal

utility from purchasing an asset to the conditional expectation of the

present discounted value of the marginal utility of return from holding

the asset. In order to price a nominal forward exchange contract, money

is introduced into the asset pricing model by the restriction that

agents purchase a country's idiosyncratic endowment with that country's

money. Arbitrage ensures that the next period forward price of foreign

exchange be equal to the expected present value of a known return at

time t of investing in a nominally risk free bond with payoff in

period t+l, i, multiplied by the spot rate that will prevail in the

next period,         The asset pricing model provides the interpretation

of the discount factor as the interteinporal marginal rate of substitu-

tion (Richard and Sundaresan (1981)) between period t and t+l

dollars, +1' where, for convenience, a U.S. perspective has been
                                       -40-



adopted. Thus the forward rate can be written as:


(18)            =



        Using the definition of conditional covariance, (18) may be
rewritten as:                              -




(19)            =
                    E{st+ijI(t)] + cov[Q+ii, s11I]
where cov[ .,.1I] denotes covariance conditional on the information

set I, and the derivation of (19) makes use of the first order

condition for utility maximization E[ Q            I
                                               t t+1 t t
                                                            =   1.   The second term

on the righthand side of (19) has the Interpretation of a risk premium.

However, it is useful to Introduce a benchmark return, i1, defined

explicitly in Hansen and Hodrick (1983), so that (19) can be rewritten

as a conditional capital asset pricing equation (CAPM):


(20)         E(f —   s+1I1)
                              =
                                  tE(1+i
                                            —
                                                iIIt)
where         is the conditional covariance of the risk premium and

benchmark return divided by the conditional variance of the benchmark

return.

          Implications of this model have been tested by Hansen and Hodrick

(1983), Hodrick and Srivastava (1984, 1986) and cumby (1986), among

others. Ekapirical work is typically conducted assuming that conditional

second moments and/or             do not vary across time. While statistical

tests of the "consumption beta" model usually indicate a rejection of

the model, qualitative features of the data are explained by this para-

digm; see the discussion in Oimby (1986) .          We   now turn our attention to
                                      —41—



the implications of time variation in return second moments on variabil-

ity of the risk premium and in turn on the variability of the spot rate.


2. Implications of lime—Varying turn (bvariance8

       A   number of authors have in effect argued that the assumption of

a constant covariance matrix of exchange returns should be relaxed.45

Pagan (1986) argues, in a context where the conditional variance changes

over time, that there may be some points when it exceeds the sample

variance (.01 on an annual basis), and that the risk premium at such a

point will exceed the upper bound claimed in Frankel (1986a) .    Wit if we

allow the conditional variance to vary over time, then one can still

apply the upper bound to the average conditional variance and therefore

to the average risk premium. If the conditional variance is 10 times

larger than .01 one period in ten (for example, when the preceding

squared realization was particularly large), then it is true that a one

percent change in the portfolio in that period will change the risk

premium by as much as 0.2 percent per annum, and that the magnitude of

the risk premium could be as large as 20 percent annum (if close to 100

percent of the portfolio is in one asset or the other) .    Wit in the

other nine periods out of ten, these magnitudes would have to be zero

for the variance to average out to .01.

       When we allow for return variances to vary over time, variation

in the risk premium derives from this additional source and can thus

exhibit considerable volatility. This point is made by Giovannini and

Jorion (1986) .   If   we are interested in the question of how big an

effect foreign exchange intervention has on average, then the
                                   —42—



observation that the conditional variance and the risk premium may at

times be higher and at times lower may    not   be very relevant. &it for

other questions, such as explaining the variability of the exchange

rate, the observation that the risk premium changes over time is quite

relevant.

        Recent work by Oiiaby and Obstfeld (1984), Hsieh (1984), Domowitz

and Hakkio (1985), and Giovannini and Jorion (1987a), rejects the hypo-

thesis that the conditional variance of exchange returns is constant

over time. Supporting evidence is provided by Implicit variances

extracted from options data in studies by Lyons (1986) and Hsieh and

Manas—Anton (1986): these estimated variances, which are to be thought

of as characterizing Investor's conditional beliefs, clearly vary over

time.

        Giovannini and Jorion (1987a) specify the conditional variance as

a function of the levels of domestic and foreign interest rates. Their

aim is to argue that their estimate of variation in the conditional

variance corresponds to large variation in the risk premium, In contrast

to Frankel (1986a) .   &it   they appear to have fallen into a (remarkably

 common) pitfall in their calculations: their estimates imply a true

variance of the monthly risk premium equal to 1.1 x 1O, not 1.1

 (Giovannini and Jorlon, 1987b)

        Perhaps the most popular approach to modeling the conditional

 variance of returns Is to employ variants of Engle's (1982) autore-

 gressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) process •     In the context

 of the single period mean—variance model, Engel and Rodriguez (1987)

 show how to extend the econometric procedure of Frankel (1982) to
                                 —4')—




account for time variation in return second moments. However, the basic

message for the relation between asset shares and the risk premium is

unaltered when the Engel—Rodriguez procedure is employed.

       Table 2 provides evidence of the variability in exchange return

second moments; the maximum, minimum, and average values of the sample

standard deviations and correlations are tabulated for a sample of 100

months. The autocorrelatlon function of the annualized standard devi-

ation of exchange return calculated from the $/DM rate is displayed in

Table 3. The pattern of autocorrelations in Table 3 is typical of all

21 elements in the second moment matrices displayed in Table 2. A

reasonable characterization of this process is simple exponential

smoothing or an ARIMA (0,1,1):


(21)          —       =    +     ÷ 016t—1   with    =



The estimate of      varies by currency second moment, but     = —.9     is


robust to the series under analysis. The stochastic model (21) implies

that all shocks      to the standard error of exchange return second

moments are permanent. The large negative coefficient on            implies

that after one period, the level of the standard deviation of return is

increased by 10% of the initial shock forever.

       We are now ready to consider the implications of time variation

in return second moments for the larger question of exchange rate

determination. We can infer the effects of changes in exchange rate

return variance on the demand for asset shares by looking at our

equation for the optimally—diversified portfolio:

This       analysis can be justified by assuming that the composition of

monetary and nonmonetary assets is varied in whatever way is necessary

to hold the interest differential constant. Since the change in                          is

permanent we know that the effect on tomorrow's spot rate will be the

same as the effect on today's spot rate. Thus the risk premium

                     (sefl
                              —

                                          is held fixed in this experiment. The analysis

is in the same spirit as our earlier attempts to quantify loosely the

effects of changes in the disturbance terni u in (2) and in expec-

tations when macroeconomic fundamentals are held constant.

               The sign of the effect, equation (22), of the return variance on

the spot rate depends on the sign of the initial risk premium. If the

foreign asset initially pays a positive risk premium over the domestic

asset (because the supply that must be held exceeds the demand consti-

tuted by the minimum—variance portfolio A; rpt as we have defined it

is negative), then the permanent increase in uncertainty reduces the

demand for foreign assets and thus reduces their price                          The effect

on st is zero if the initial risk premium is zero. &it the effect can

be very large in magnitude if the initial risk premium is non—zero, for

example if the initial risk premium is on the order of .03 (as it might

be if the entire 3 percent discount at which the dollar sold against the

mark or yen in the early l980s is attributed to a risk premium rather

than to expected depreciation). For our benchmark parameter values

                   = .01   on an annual basis, and p =        2),   we can

calculate the linearized effect on the spot rate s of a change incL

        Consider a permanent increase in the annual variance c               from .01

to .02. (One standard deviation of the monthly standard deviation for

the $/DM exchange return is estimated at roughly 9.3% per year over the

December 1977 to April 1986 period in the bottom panel of Table 3; the

square is .0087.) Such a shock will have a possible linearized effect

course, permanent changes in 2t cannot occur very often.

         The autocorrelations in Table 3 are also consistent with the

hypothesis that         is white noise around its mean. Under such a

hypothesis no shocks are permanent. A purely transitory disturbance to

      will have an effect which is very much smaller than that calculated

above: calculations based on (22) are mitigated by the presence of a

second term that arises because the spot rate is expected to go back to

its previous level.48

         The results of this subsection suggest that additional research

be directed at the spot rate—conditional volatility nexus. In appendix

1 we consider the model (21) for          as well as an ARCH process, in
                                      —46—



 which the initial shock to the variance dies out gradually over time.

 The algebra is considerably more complicated then for the transitory

disturbance, because there is a third effect, via the rational expecta-

 tion of an effect on the spot rate next period, when the innovation to

the variance will have only partially died out. The effect on the

exchange rate lies between the effects of a permanent and transitory

change in          (Poterba and Summers (1986) calculate the effect of

             IV.     Survey Ita   and Heterogeneous pectat1ons


       Of the factors suggested as determining "excessive variability"

in section I of this paper, we have considered the role of fundamentals

versus the disturbance term, and we have considered risk and the degree

of substitutability. We have still to consider the role of expectations

per se. The idea of destabilizing speculation——that investors, respon-

ding to non—zero expectations of exchange rate changes, work to raise

the variability of the exchange rate——is what is often meant by descrip-

tions of the market as excessively variable. The variance—bounds tests

and bubbles tests at first sounded like a promising way to shed light on

questions of destabilizing speculation and bandwagons. If we were con-

fident about having specified the fundamentals correctly in equation (2),

then we might look to the variance—bounds and bubbles tests to see if

the expectations term ASe is formed in a destabilizing way. More
                                  —47—



simply, we could compare the variance when ASe in equation (9) is

constrained to zero with the unconstrained variance: this is the test

for "destabilizing speculation" performed by Kohlhagen (1979) and

Eichengreen (1981). &it, as we argued in section II, we are not at all

confident about having specified the fundamentals correctly, which means

that there is no new information to be gained from these tests.

       At the end of Part I we suggested that the best way to get at the

question of whether speculation is destabilizing or not is to consider

whether expected future depreciation responds positively or negatively

to a current change in the exchange rate. If a current depreciation,

originating in fundamentals or in anything else, generates anticipations

of further depreciation, speculators will sell the currency and thereby

exaggerate the depreciation. If it generates anticipations of future

appreciation, back in the direction of some long—run equilibrium,

speculators will buy the currency and thereby dampen the depreciation.

In this part of the paper we consider this question of how expectations

are formed.

       A way of defining stabilizing expectations is that the expected

future spot rate         gives a weight less than one to the contem-

poraneous spot rate, s, that it Is a convex combination of the

contemporaneous rate and other factors. We have the case of regressive

expectations when the "other factor" is the equilibrium rate :

               =
                   (l—8)s + o(s) .
Or, in terms of expected depreciation,

(23)      As+i =          s)
                                        —48—



Stabilizing expectations are the case 0 < 0 < 1, destabilizing

expectations the case 0 < 0, and the borderline case is static

expectations, 0 =    0.

1. Measuring Stabilizing and Istabilizing pectations

        1.zo alternative ways of measuring expected exchange rate changes

are common in the literature. The first is the forward discount. The

second is ex post changes in the sample period, allowing only for a

purely random error term. The first is valid only if there is no time—

varying risk premium, and the second only under the rational expecta-

tions assumption (including the absence of regime changes, peso

problems, etc.).

        When we use the rational expectations approach of substituting

t+1 for ts1 in the above equation (23) and interpreting the

regression error as a random expectational error, a test of 0 = 0           is a

test of a random walk in the true spot process, as in section II. Table

4a, which is drawn from Frankel and Froot (1985), looks for a tendency

of the dollar to regress toward equilibrium, where equilibrium is

alternatively measured in rows 1—4 by a constant and in rows 5—8 by the

value       that would give purchasing power parity (with 1973—1980 as

the base period) .   We   are unable to reject a random walk in several

(limited) post—1976 sample periods. We argued in section tI.1 that the

theoretical case for a reversion to equilibrium rather than a random

walk is much stronger in the case of the real exchange rate than it is

for the nominal exchange rate. Rows 9—12 of Table 4a report tests of

the tendency to regress toward           where the change in the exchange
                                    t
                                  —49—




rate is adjusted for expected inflation rates.5° If we wanted to apply

the same rational expectations assumption to the price levels as to the

nominal exchange rate, we would be back in section 11.1's tests of

changes in the real exchange rate. The results on our limi.ted post—1976

sample periods are the same as in most tests of ex ante purchasing power

parity on the floating rate period: we can find no statistically

significant tendency to regress toward an equilibrium.

       These findings are exactly what we would expect from our earlier

conclusion that the speed of return to PPP may in fact be in the range

of 15—25 percent a year, but that the floating rate period does not

offer enough data to reject zero statistically. If we are sufficiently

confident about both the gradual tendency to return to equilibrium in

the longer run——based, for example, on the 115 years of U.S.—U.K. data——

and the rational expectations assumption, we can infer that speculators

must have stabilizing expectations. &t it would be better to have more

tangible evidence, since the 115 year autoregressions cover a number of

different economic policy regimes.

       Table 4b uses the forward discount to measure expected depreci-

ation in the same regression equations. Such regressions will only be

valid in the unlikely case that the risk premium is uncorrelated with

the rlghthand—side variable (the current spot rate relative to its

equilibrium). Not surprisingly, the results are poor. Even when the

correction for expected inflation is applied, which makes the equation

essentially a regression of the short—term real interest differential

against the real exchange rate, the coefficient is statistically

insignificant. Others have gotten better results on larger data sets.

Hooper (1985), Hutchison and Throop (1985), Golub et al (1985), Sachs

(1985) and Feldstein (1986) report regressions with the two variables

reversed, and find that the long—term real interest differential, in

particular, Is a significant factor explaining the real exchange rate.

&it when Meese and Rogoff (1986) examine real versions of the sticky

price monetary model of section 11.2, they find that real interest

differentials cannot explain movements in real exchange rates signi-

ficantly better than a random walk model. (The advantage of testing the

sticky price monetary model In real terms is that one abstracts from

instability in money demand parameters. Given the assumptions employed

in their paper, monetary shocks have proportionate effects on the real

exchange rate and real interest differential, and hence net out of the

analysis.) In any case, the entire approach of using the interest

differential or forward discount to measure expected depreciation will

be viewed as suspect by those concerned by the risk premium.

       What is sorely needed is an alternative to measuring expected

depreciation either by ex post exchange rate changes or by the forward

discount, one that does not require pre—judging either the unbiasedness

of expectations or the existence of the risk premium. A good candidate

for such a measure is offered by surveys of the exchange rate expecta-

tions of market participants. One such survey has been conducted every

six weeks since 1981 by the Fconomist—affiliated Financial Report. The

data are discussed and analyzed at length in Frankel and Froot (1985,87)

and Froot and Frankel (1986).

       Table 4c reports regressions of regressive expectations with

expected depreciation measured by the Economist survey data, for the
                                  —51--




same samples of observations that were used in the preceding regressions

of ex post changes and forward discounts.5' Almost all the results show

a highly significant expectation of regression toward equilibrium, at a

rate of about 10 percent in the case of expectations at a six—month

horizon, which is (1 — •92) = 20 percent per year. (The expected speed

of adjustment per year is somewhat lower in the case of the three—month

horizon.) This expected speed of adjustment to PPP is in the range of

the actual speeds of adjustment estimated in Table 1, suggesting that

the low power in the regressions of ex post changes in Table 4a might

alone have been responsible for the failure to reject a random walk.52

       Other tests reported in Frankel and Froot (1987), Dominguez

(1986), and Froot and Frankel (1986), show that the prediction error

made by the survey numbers is not in fact random. The tests constitute

a rejection of rational expectations (jointly with the hypothesis of no

regime changes or other peso problem) that is free from any concerns

about the risk premium. Generally, the true spot process behaves more

like a random walk than the survey respondents realize. In terms of the

language attributed to Rhlson (1981) in section 11.3 above, there is

excessive speculation: investors would do better to reduce their

expectations of exchange rate changes toward zero. In terms of the

specific regressive expectations model estimated in Table 4c, survey

respondents overestimate the speed of return to equilibrium.

       One might think that such a failure of market efficiency would be

evidence of the sort we are looking for, that "exchange markets are not

working properly." it a tendency for speculators to expect the

exchange rate to regress toward the equilibrium at a faster rate than is
                                    —52—



correct is stabilizing. An increase in the value of the currency, due

in the context of equation (2) to an increase in the interest differ-

ential i_i* or the error term u for example, will be damped because

of the effect on expectations. We saw in equation (10) that the varia-

bility of the exchange rate in the DQrnbusch overshooting model is

inversely related to the value of    e.    A   high 0 means that, for any

given positive interest differential, it takes less of an appreciation

to generate the necessary expectations of future depreciation.53

       One cannot work with the survey data on expectations without

pondering the issue of heterogeneous expectations. Almost all of the

exchange rate literature, theoretical as well as empirical, presupposes

that market participants all share the same expectation. &it the truth

is that people disagree. Disagreement can explain the very high volume

of trading in the spot and forward exchange markets. The Economist's

Financial Report shows quite a range of variation in their survey

responses; the high—low spread for the six—month expectations averages

15.2 percent. (The regressions reported in the tables here are based on

the median response.)

       The possibility of heterogeneous expectations introduces another

possible source of variability into the exchange rate: the market in

the aggregate may shift over time the weights it assigns to different

forecasting mechanisms, for example the weight assigned to regressive

versus bandwagon expectations in equation (5). The market may increase

the weight it gives to one of these formulations if it has recently been

forecasting better than the other. This could happen if portfolio mana-

gers update in a Bayesian way the weights they place on the forecasts of
                                  —53—



different models. Alternatively, it could happen when those investors

who bet correctly gain wealth and receive more weight in the market in

the next period. As the weight placed by the market on different expec-

tations shifts, the aggregate demand for foreign currency and therefore

the exchange rate will change over time. Even if no single forecaster

holds destabilizing bandwagon expectations, any factor pushing up the

value of the currency, such as an increase in (i_i*) or Ut will

produce a drawn—out appreciation as the weight placed on the optimistic

forecasts gradually increases. Although none of the actors in such a

model is satisfying the rational expectations assumption in the sense of

knowing the complete process that is driving the exchange rate, neither

is any of the actors behaving foolishly. Putting more weight on band-

wagon expectations than on regressive expectations would have given the

right answer in the case of the dollar from 1981 to February 1985, for

example, but would have lost the investor a lot of money thereafter. In

such a changing world it is difficult to see what variables it would be

"rational" for the investors to grant more weight.

       We can offer some evidence for the idea that forecasters don't

concur on a single stabilizing sort of expectations model as nicely as

the estimates of regressive expectations in Table 4c would suggest.

Money Market Services, Inc., has conducted since 1983 a weekly survey of

currency traders as to their forecasts at shorter—term horizons than the

Economist survey. Estimates of regressive expectations on these two

sets of survey data, together with a third conducted by the American

Express Bank Review irregularly between 1976 and 1985, are reported fri

Table 4d. The nine data sets are ordered by forecast horizon. The
                                    —54—



results are striking. The longer—term forecasts are strongly regressive:

the &onotnist 12—month forecasts show that a 10 percent appreciation

today generates the expectation of a 1 .75 percent depreciation over the

subsequent year. The shorter—term forecasts show precisely the reverse

however: a 10 percent appreciation today generates the expectation of

0.78 percent further appreciation over the next month. This suggests

the possibility that the forecasters who subscribe to bandwagon expecta-

tions ("chartists," or technical analysts, who use time series analysis

to extrapolate past trends) tend to be traders with a shorter—term out-

look, while those who subscribe to regressive expectations ("fundatnen—

talists," who forecast a return to macroeconomic equilibrium) tend to be

economists with a longer—term outlook. A small change in the weight

that the market gives to two such different forecasts could have a big

effect on the exchange rate, especially if asset demands are as sensi-

tive to expected rates of return as was suggested by some of the substi-

tutability arguments in section iii.


2   • Onclusion
        The question, "are exchange rates excessively variable?", cannot

be answered by comparing the variance of the actual exchange rate to the

variance of a set of macroeconomic fundamentals. Overshooting theories,

which are based on fundamentals and are consistent with market eff 1—

ciency, allow exchange rate variability to exceed monetary variability

by an indefinitely high multiple.

        More damaging is the finding of regression tests that measurable

fundamentals do not explain the exchange rate well, even contempo—
                                   —55—




raneousLy. The proposition that the exchange rate follows a random

walk, in the sense that first differences cannot be explained by any-

thing, may be unnecessarily nihilistic. There does appear to be some

tendency for the exchange rate to return to equilibrium at longer

horizons •   Even the dollar came home to earth in 1985—86. &it the error

term is very large in the shorter—term (e.g. monthly) data that is

available for most econometric studies.

       It is tempting to argue that there must exist fundamentals of

which market investors are aware but the econometrician is not •   Such an

argument might be supported by any evidence that the market could pre-

dict future exchange rates better than the models; but there is no such

evidence. Expectations measured by the forward exchange market (or by

survey data) contain no useful information for predicting exchange rate

changes. The very bad performance of the forward discount, either as a

predictor of future changes in the forward exchange rate or as a contem-

poraneous determinant of the level of the exchange rate in equations

such as (8), could in theory be attributed to an exchange risk premium.

The framework of optimal portfolio diversification and conventional

estimates of the degree of risk—aversion seem to imply that the risk

premium does not vary enough to acquit the forward exchange market •   A

welcome recent line of research takes the source of variation to be

changes in the conditional variance rather than changes in asset sup-

plies. &t this literature has yet to demonstrate that such variation

in the conditional variance can explain the bias in the forward rate.

       We have seen that small changes in the variance, unless transi-

tory, could produce large changes in the demand for assets and therefore
                                      —56—



in the exchange rate as opposed to the risk premium.. &it      unless
"changes in the variation in the exchange rate" is considered an

enlightening explanation of variation in the exchange rate, we are still

mostly in the dark.

       One   need not explain all the fluctuations in the exchange rate to

evaluate the scope for government policy.55 Policy—makers could affect

the foreign exchange market through three different channels. First,

macroeconomic policy, for example interest rates and the mix     between

monetary and fiscal policy, has large effects (the poor regression

reults not withstanding) .   We   have not explored the resulting policy-

making tradeoff between the exchange rate and other macroeconomic

objectives in this paper. They are thoroughly discussed elsewhere, and

the regression tests in any case suggest that the major determinants of

the exchange rate, at least on a shorter—term basis, lie elsewhere.

       Second, Tobin (1978) and Dornbusch (1986) have argued that a tax

on International borrowing or on other foreign exchange transactions

would reduce the extent to which investors could react to small changes

in the attractiveness of different countries' assets, and would thereby

reduce exchange rate volatility. As we noted in section 1.2, this

argument requires that expectations be destabilizing. If expectations

are instead stabilizing, then a decrease in the degree of substituta-

bility would increase exchange rate volatility rather than the

reverse. On the other hand a Ibbin tax on foreign exchange transactions

should work to discourage short—term trading more than long—term

trading, since the given tax is a higher percentage of the return for

shorter term transactions. If our survey data findings are correct and
                                    —57—



short—term expectations (less than 3 months) are destabilizing but long—

term expectations (greater than 3 months) stabilizing, then a Ibbin tax

might reduce volatility after all.

        Third, others argue that central banks should intervene in

foreign exchange markets to dampen fluctuations. Foreign exchange

intervention of course is generally thought to affect the exchange rate

to the extent it changes the relevant macroeconomic fundamentals,

particularly nonsterilized intervention that allows the change in

reserves to change the money supply. &t effects via current macro-

economic fundamentals should be subsumed in the first category above.

If foreign exchange intervention is to have an independent effect,

particularly if sterilized intervention is to have a substantial effect,

it will be via investor expectations of future exchange rate changes.

The strongest case for steps toward reform of the floating rate system

would be if one could demonstrate that expectations are destabilizing,

producing bandwagons in the exchange rate, and that a change in

government policy might alter these expectations even without altering

asset supplies, for example, by bursting a speculative bubble. The

announcement on September 22, 1985, that the G—5 had decided at the

Plaza Hotel to work to bring the dollar down caused an instant 5 percent

depreciation of the dollar. While the fall in demand for dollars could

be explained as a rational re—evaluation of the future expansionariness

of U.S. monetary policy, it might also be explained as the bursting of a

bubble. .ir theories of rational speculative bubbles have virtually

nothing to say about what causes the price to jump from one bubble path

to another •   Wit this is precisely the sort of effect for which many
                                        —58—




proponents of a more activist policy are looking. Proponents of a

target zone argue that the stabilizing effect would be even greater if

the government announced a change in policy regime, rather than a one-

time initiative of the sort that took place at the Plaza.

         The key question, then, seems to be the behavior of investor

expectations. In particular, much hinges on whether expectations when

left to themselves are destabilizing. The question whether the true

spot process matches up with the expected one, i.e., whether expecta-

tions are rational, Is not as directly relevant. The evidence appears

to be that expectations are stabilizing, at least at horizons greater

than three months. The survey data at a six month horizon reported in

Table 4c, for example, show that a 10 percent appreciation today

generates an expected future depreciation of about 1 percent, or 2

percent at a per annum rate. If speculators are investing on the basis

of these expectations, then they are acting to stabilize the exchange

rate. A Tobin tax to discourage speculation might then raise

variability.

         Survey data at short horizons show quite different results

however •   It   seems likely that expectations are in fact heterogeneous.

One   consequence   is that "the" expectation can't be rational if investors

do not agree on a     single   expectation. A second implication follows from

the high degree of substitutability (for an average value of the

variance) that we found in section III: small changes in the weights

that the market assigns to competing exchange rate forecasts will

produce large changes in portfolio preferences and thus large changes in

the exchange rate. This source of exchange rate variability could be
                                  —59—




classed as a speculative bubble in the sense that it arises from self—

confirming changes in expectations rather than from fundamentals, though

it is not the rational speculative bubble that has been extensively

studied recently.

       As Krugman (1985) has argued, .when the market has temporarily

"lost its moorings,' It is possible that a more activist policy can

restore the anchor to expectations. Investors might be persuaded to

expect more of a tendency to return to equilibrium. Wit central bank

governors and finance ministers of major countries will only be able to

affect expectations If they have credibility. They did not have

credibility in 1973. In this sense the breakdown of the fixed exchange

rate system was inevitable. They have more credibility today; this much

is clear from the market's sensitivity to every utterance of the

Treasury Secretary and the thairman of the Federal Reserve, and their

Japanese and German counterparts. Whether this credibility would still

be there if policy—makers tried to exploit it more systematically with a

reform of the world monetary system is another question, especially if

one allows for the usual politicization of any process of choosing

targets for an economic price that affects people's livelihoods.

the scope of this paper is the question whether it is even a feasible

option for government intervention in foreign exchange markets to

stabilize the exchange rate without changing monetary and fiscal policy,

inflation differentials are unrelated to expected exchange rate changes,

rejecting the random walk characterization of the real exchange rate.

Huizinga (1986) is also able to reject the random walk.


       '8llakkio's unrestricted process allows for a unit root.

Similarly the last line in Table 1 allows for the possibility of a

trend. From   a   macroeconomic viewpoint, rather than a statistical one,

one might consider the important question to be whether most changes in

the real exchange rate die out over time, rather than whether there are

sometimes also permanent changes in the real exchange rate, for example,

when the price of oil goes up.

       25Overshooting can occur also in the portfolio—balance model,

in the stock of claims on foreigners, just as in the monetary model

overshooting can be viewed as the consequence of a finite rate of

adjustment in the general price level.

above—mentioned models both insainpie (1975—1982) and out of sample

(1983) .     Schinasi and Swamy (1986) use a method that allows coefficients
to change over time. The two more recent papers claim relatively good

results with a lagged endogenous variable.


           29The rate—of—return term (j_i*) in equation (8), seems for

some reason to generate more econometrician anxiety over endogeneity

problems when it is expressed as expected depreciation,                in

equation (9), even though it is the same variable when covered interest

parity holds.

exceeding 18 months, is never good.

Obstfeld (1984) and Obstfeld (1986) regressed against the Eurocurrency

interest differential and again found that for most exchange rates the

coefficient was significantly less than 1.0 and even less than zero.

(One would expect the same finding as in the forward discount tests,

given that the interest differential is equal to the forward discount by

covered interest parity.) These findings are also consistent with those

of Meese and Rogoff (1983a) that the random walk predicts, not only

better than other models, but better than the forward market as well.


           33Equlvalently, in a regression of the prediction error

       —
           fd   against fdt, the coefficient under the null hypothesis

should be zero.

                exception is the unlikely case where, even though investors

are risk—averse, exchange rates are like the outcome of a bet on a foot-

ball game in that they are completely uncorrelated with other rates of

return (on all "outside" assets), so that exchange risk is completely

diversifiable.


        37This statement assumes a Cobb—Douglas price index with weight

       39Recall that the tests of forward rate unbiasedness in the

preceding section are also joint tests of rational expectations and no

risk premium.


       401f u is known to be correlated with the monetary fundamentals

but an appropriate instrumental variable is available, then equation

(13) can still be estimated by the appropriate techniques, the same as

the standard regression equation (8). Casella (1985), for example,

allows for endogeneity of the money supply in her bubbles test of the

German hyperinflation.


       41one could presumably relax the assumption of no risk premium by

specifying a portfolio—balance model, in place of (8), with bond sup-

plies appearing on the righthand—side. Assumption (b) would then be the

less—stringent condition that expected depreciation                is an unbiased

predictor in the sample (requiring rational expectations and no peso

problem or regime changes). Woo (1984) has attempted this sort of

bubbles test.

         441f investors are assumed to calculate their portfolios once a

year, the numbers are slightly different. The annual variance in

returns is observed to be about .01 •                         Then an increase in the supply of

foreign assets equal to 1 percent of the portfolio of 2.0 basis points.


         45Frankel (1982, P. 260) describes this assumption as one made

for convenience, to focus on variation in asset supplies and the risk

premium, with variation in the variances and covariances considered a

priority for future research.


         46This model marginally outperforms (i) an autoregressive model

with lag length estimated, (ii) the sample mean or median, and (iii) a

random walk model, on the basis of out—of—sample fit.


         47For simplicity we are leaving out the effect of a change in the

return variance on the minimum variance portfolio A via the convexity

term.


         48Suppose                    =    +      where               is now a purely transitory

disturbance to                        The effect of               on the exchange rate will be

considerably smaller than that implied by (22). Besides the direct

effect on                    from (22) we must recognize that the spot rate in the

subsequent period will return to its previous level, so that the risk

premium will rise by the full amount of the increase in s• Taking

account of this second offsetting term we get:

Note that the effect on expectations is much more important than the

portfolio valuation effect, due to the high degree of substitutability.

Again, if the initial risk premium is close to zero, the effect on a

change in the return variance is close to zero. &it if the initial risk

premium is .03 and we consider a transitory change in        from .01 to

.02, the change in the spot rate will be roughly —( .03/ .01)( .01) =

—.03,   or a 3 percent appreciation of the less risky currency.


        49Note that the mean—variance model (3') used to derive (22) is

less applicable when        varies over time.


          50The expected inflation rates used here are three—year forecasts

by DRI.


        51lndeed, the samples were dictated by the availability of the

survey data.


              is noteworthy that the survey data regressions are valid

even if the survey responses measure true expectations with error, so

long as the measurement error is random. The standard error of the

regression (and statistically significant coefficient estimates) imply

that the magnitude of the measurement error is small, relative, for

example, to the magnitude of the expectatiorial errors introduced when ex

post exchange rate changes are used as the lefthand—side variable.


          5311 we ask what happens when the true speed of regression to PPP

is held constant but investors have a higher expected speed of regres-

sion 0, it turns out that the effect is still to reduce variability.

The effect on the conditional variance is shown in Frankel (1983)

Frankel and Froot (1986)


       55Dornbusch (1986) points out that someone who believes that

exchange markets are not efficient need not necessarily believe that the

government could do better, any more than someone who, like Ibbin

(1978), believes that the markets are efficient need necessarily believe

in laissez—faire.
