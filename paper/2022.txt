      Price Inertia and Inflation: Evidence and Theoretical Rationale




                                 ABSTRACT




      In this paper we look at some empirical evIdence of and theoretIcal
 rationale for price inflexibility in the face of a decrease in short run demand
 in the Western—type industrialized economies. The empirical evidence suggests
 that price sluggishness is pervasive but varies across markets, industries and
 countries. There are different reasons for the price inertia. The respon8e of
 firms to uncertainty, the cost of adjusting prices, the contents of the long—
 term contracts In the goods and Input markets, the extent and variability of
excess demand may differ among firms and industries. The structure of the
 industry, the degree of heterogeneity of the products In a market, the network
of input—output relationship among industries, the nature of International com-
petition, the process of forming expectations about the future,shocks from mone-
tary and fiscal policies and input price shocks, all interact and create the
ever changing environment of the firms. In these changing circumstances there
are incentives for prices to be sluggish and thus arises the dilemma of
achieving price stability at a high cost of unemployment. The ability of
governments to achieve stable prices is probably endogenous in the system and
may depend on a threshhold rate of inflation. A number of policy options are
discussed to address the issue of price inertia which would reduce the adjust-
ment burden of anti—inflationary policies.

                                Introduction


      TIie phenomenon of price insensitivity to changes in demand in the

 advanced Western economies has been a subject of considerable discussion

 among macro—economists and policy makers. In recent years prices have not

 only been rigid downward but even have risen in the face of slack demand.

 Short—run inflexibility of prices is critical for the success of fiscal and

 monetary stabilization policies and ability of the economic systems to

 accommodate external shocks. The question is what are the causes of price

 inflexibility and is it consistent with private maximization principles.

 How the dynamic interactions among various stages and types of economic

activity lead to price stickiness of the aggregate price level?

      The debate on aggregate price adjustment has been joined by two

schools of thought: the neo—Keynesian approach which assumes that markets

do not clear because of institutional and informational
                                                          arrangements and

the "new classical" equilibrium approach to business cycle which postulates

market clearance and instantaneous prices adjustment in response to changes

in nominal demand. The empirical evidence, as shown by Gordon [1982aJ and

others is that prices are neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly flexibile;

they vary over time and across industries, markets, and countries. Neither

of the two approaches seem as of yet to provide a consistent explanation of

this empiricaL finding. This has led to a search for developing the micro

foundations for price rigidity from an optimization viewpoint and models

which explicitly take account of the structure of markets and input—output

relationships in the economy. As of yet there is no general consensus
                                              —3--



model available to explain the observed degree and pervasiveness of price

i   nil exi hi I   ity.


         In   this paper our purpose is to sketch some illustrative empirical

findings on price adjustment at the aggregate and industry levels in some

of the Western industrialized economies and to discuss some of the micro

economic models of price adjustment that have been proposed. The second

objective of the paper is to examine the relationship of market structure

and pricing behavior and assemble some of the evidence on differential

price behavior in competitive and oligopolistic markets. The third issue

considered is how these differential price behaviors may lead to the price

adjustment observed at the aggregate economy level. The paper is concluded

with a few final remarks and policy suggestions.


                          I. The Extent and Degree of Price Inflexibility

         The empirical evidence on the question of price vs. output flexibility

has been quite extensive. The evidence comes partly from macro econometric

studies, survey of transactions in different markets and studies of

disaggregated price series. We shall briefly discuss each of these type of

evidence before examining some of the theoretical rationale provided for

the phenomenon of price inertia in the context of profit maximizing models.


         1.   Evidence from Macro Price Models

         R. J. Gordon [1982a] has been one of the leading persons in the U.S.

who has addressed empirically the question of price inertia in aggregate

price level. His results indicate that nominal GNP has been divided con-

sistently over the last 90 years of U.S. history about two thirds taking
                                     —4—


  the form of output changes and the remaining one third the form of price

  changes; the structure of price expectations has changed some time before

  the World War lifrom a regressive to an extrapolative form possibly due to

 the recognition of the stabilizing role of government policies and the

 emergence of overlapping wage contracts in the U.S. However, when the

 experience of the U.S. economy is compared to that of Japan and the U.K.,

 Gordon finds that the wage and prices are more flexible in the latter

 countries. The degree of price inflexibility therefore varies among

 countries and overtime. Nonetheless, the evidence of price inertia par-

 ticularly in the postwar U.S. economy suggests a sluggish response of pri-

 ces to restrictive demand policies and the resulting
                                                        high unemployment,
 thus constituting a dilemma for policy makers.

      Evidence of price inflexibility in the postwar U.S. economy and the

European economies has been reported by other studies as well. Otto

Eckstein and G. Fromm [1968] using U.S. annual data found that both prices

and outputs react within three to six months to changes in costs and

demand. George Hay [1970] found for two U.S. industries that a temporary

increase in demand caused a small increase in price but a large increase in

output. de Minel [1974] using aggregate data for the U.S. reached similar

conclusions. The evidence provided for the nineteen OECD countries by D.

Grubb, R. Jackman and R. Layard [1982] suggests different
                                                            degrees of price
and wage Inertia in these countries over the postwar period. Coutts,

Godley and Nordhaus [1978] using British data for several industries

reached the conclusion that prices are mainly determined by costs and

affected little by changes in demand. Studies using time series data for
                                      —5—


Germany found that firms keep their prices at their planned level and

adjust their outputs when demand changes [Kawasaki, McMillan and Zimmerman

[1983]J. The econometric results obtained by Nadiri and Gupta [19771 and

Eckstein—Wyss [1977] for different U.S. manufacturing industries provides

evidence of price inertia at the industry level. These results indicate

that effects of demand changes on prices are small in most of the

industries considered and there is evidence of considerable inertia in

price adjustments. The degree of demand effect and price adjustment,

however, varies among   industries.
     The studies differ in their coverage, level of aggregation and span

of time. However, they all seem to point to the slow adjustment of prices

and more rapid adjustment of outputs when the demand level changes in the

short run. But a potential shortcoming of all these studies is that they

are based not on transaction but list prices. George Stigler and J.

Kindahl [1970] have argued that the relevant series is prices at which

buyers and sellers transact a sale. They have indicated based on their

study that transaction prices are highly variable and the price stickiness

reported above may be an illusion. However, as'Welss [1977] has argued

persuasively that changes in Stigler—Kindahi price series and BLS data

(which is often used in studies mentioned above) reflect each other and

therefore the Stigler—Kendall conclusion is not valid. Further new econo-

metric studies using transaction prices indicate that firms in their imme-

diate response to disequilibrium, are more likely to react immediately with

an output change than a price change.

       2. Survey of Market Transactions

       Another source of evidence of whether prices are inflexible is pro-

  vided in an interesting study by Canton [1979].      Tables 1 and 2 provide

  evidence on the pattern of transactions prices in a sample of businesses

 during a relatively non—inflationary period 1957—66. Table 1 lists by pro-

 duct the average duration of price inflexibility in months and the standard

 deviation of duration. The results
                                         suggest several important points: For

 many transactions between individual buyers and sellers, price once set

 tends to remain unchanged for a substantial period of time. This suggests

 that quantity adjustment and not prices may be the mechanism used to allo-

 cate some goods when supply or demand changes. Since the standard

 deviation of length of price rigidity is quite high we can infer that a

 wide variety of contracts have differing price flexibility; i.e., some

 contracts with very flexible prices while others with very inflexible pri-

 ces for the same broad commodity group. Finally, there
                                                            are very large dif-
ferences across industries in degree of price
                                                  inflexibility.
     The results in table 2 show the frequency of price rigidity by the

duration of contract i.e., annual and monthly. it seems that the

contracting structure for each product is not only different but there are

many annual   contracts   whose prices change well before one year is elapsed

while there are many monthly contracts whose prices often do not change for

one year. Thus the contract terms seem to be very flexible and adaptable

to changes in market condition. Perhaps ongoing relations between buyer

and selLer account for this behavior. Also the monthly contract prices

vary more frequently than those for the annual contracts which implies that
                                     —7—


there are contracts whose prices remain unchanged at the same time that

demand and supply forces are changing other contract prices for the same

commodity group.

     From these results it is likely to draw the conjecture that markets

resemble liquid markets with flexible prices performing the allocative role

and markets which resemble illiqiild markets with fixed prices and quantity

allocations performing the ailocative role. Nonferrous metal, petroleum

and plywood are likely to have submarkets that are highly liquid while

steel, paper and chemicals seem likely to have submarkets that are highly

illiquid. For some goods highly liquid and illiquid submarkets may exist

as well. These observations suggest there are different degrees of price

inflexibility in different markets and for different products which are

likely to change over time and among different industries.

     An econometric study using monthly transaction prices and output

changes of individual firms in various German industries substantiates the

results noted above and confirms the hypothesis of differentiated behavior

in different markets. Kawasaki et al [19821 develop a dynamic dise-

quilibrium model taking account of inventories and unfilled orders in

determining the adjustment path of prices and output in response to changes

In demand.   Their   results show that both prices and output flexibility vary

markedly across industries reflecting some of differences among industries

noted above. They show that prices are in the short—run inflexible in

industries such as stone and clay machinery; electrical equipment, iron,

tin and other products, glass and products and clothing. While nonferrous

metals, textiles, plastic and products exhibit short—run price flexibility.
                                     —8—


  The results also indicate that each firm changes its output whenever there

  is an inventory or unfilled order disequilibrium
                                                     but changes its price only
  when disequilibrium persists long enough to reflect permanent changes in

 demand or costs. However, there is no evidence of asymmetry in their price

 behavior i.e., prices are no less flexible downwards than upward. When

 firms face high level of inventories, they are just as likely to cut their

 prices as they are to raise their prices when inventories are too low.


      3 EvIdence from Disaggregated Prices Studies

      The most thorough study of behavior of prices during periods of

 recession has been published by Cagan [1975].   Using approximately iioo BLS
 wholesale price series for 1947—70, he demonstrated that in each succeeding

 recession since World War II there was a tendency for a smaller average

 decline in prices. The pattern is especially clear when the rate of price

change in a recession is regarded as a decline from the rate of price

increase in the immediately preceding
                                        expansion. The important question is
whether the distribution of recession rates of
                                                 price change differs between
classes of industries with different levels of concentration ratio.

Cagan's results are unequivocal for all recessions except the 1969—70

period. The average decrease in the rate of price change has been greater

for less concentrated industries. In the 1969—70 recession the average

price of the high concentration group increased less than the mean price of

the intermediate group, but both average rates increased, whereas the

average rate for the least concentrated group declined relatively to the

preceding expansion.
                                       —9--.




     There are two principal points to be noted in connection with Cagan's

study:


     1)   The responsiveness of all prices to recessions declined during the
          post World War 11 period.

     2) The prices in less concentrated industries were more responsive
         than the prices in more concentrated industries.

The evidence seems to favor the view that all prices have become less

responsive to decline in aggregate demand. Also Wachtel and Adeisheim's

[1977] results imply that, even if cost changes are taken into account, the

concLusion reached by Cagan on   the   growing downward inflexibility of prices

in successive recessions is reaffirmed.

     An examination of the empirical evidence of other disaggregated stu-

dies suggest several important conclusions:


     1. Factor costs such as wage rates and material prices are the domi-

          nant determinants of industry price changes. The importance of

          factor costs is overwhelmingly supported by cross—sectional and

          time—series studies. This finding is consistent with studies of

          aggregate price behavior.


     2. Prices are generally much less sensitive to demand changes than to

          cost changes.
                                       — 1()   —




       3.    Pricing behavior is related to the level of industry con-

             centration. Although costs are important determinants of prices

             in all industries, the influence of demand varies considerably

             among industries. Short—run demand changes have an effect on

             price changes in the competitive industries. In contrast,

             long—run trend of aggregate demand influences prices in more con-

             centrated industries. This implies that short—run decline in

             demand can be expected to have minimal effect on many industry

             prices. This finding of disaggregate studies may explain why the

             demand variable has been often found insignificant in aggregate

             price equations.


      4. Prices are often perversely affected by a decline in demand, that

            is, a type of compensatory pricing behavior seems to have occurred

            in some industries.


      5. An important conclusion is that the structure of the economy has

            changed in the 1960's toward domination of costs on prices. This

            is manifested in the upward shift in the distribution of price

            changes; there is less downward flexibility of prices in

            recessions. In the most recent recessions wholesale
                                                                  prices have
            not generally fallen.


     From the evidence presented here it seems that prlcs are subject to

•sl'igglsh adjustment En the postwar period. Unever, the degree and
                                                                         per-
vasiveness of price adjustment vary considerably over time, markets,
                                          — 11   —




industries and    countries.      The response    to a change in demand in the short—

run, however,    is mainly   to adjust output and to a much smaller extent pri-
ces. The questions that arise are:          Why      such   asymmetry in response of

prices and quantitities in majority of industries?                Whether the market

structure such as the degree of concentration has some relationship with

price inflexibility? And how the various degrees of price Inflexibility in

different markets, for whatever reason, may led to aggregate price level

inflexibility?    These are       some of the questions we shall attempt to address

below.


         Section II. The Theoretical Rationale for Price Inflexibility

     There are varieties of theoretical rationale for firms to be reluctant
to change their prices in face of a short term change in demand. If firms
are interested in long term profits they may equate their long term margi-

nal revenue to long term marginal cost and then prices may become invarient

to changes in the short run. If firms are producing multiple output they

will    face the problem of jointly setting prices            for all of their product.

The    cost associated with price adjustments may induce the firms to have
a   stable price policy even if the demand for the individual product fluc-

tuates. Firms may be interested in goals other than profit maximization

such as increasing market share, stable profit margin or target rate of

return on investment.        In   such a case firms may want to change their prices

infrequently. It is impossible to present all the theoretical arguments

and    evidence for why   prices are inflexible. We shall discuss some of the

main    theoretical models put forward to rationalize why price inertia may
arise    from an optimizing behavior.

       1.   Industrial Structure and Price Behavior

       One of the most important structural features of the Western

  industrial economies is the difference between individual industries in the

 extent to which particular markets are dominated by one or a few large

 sellers. The traditional view has relied on the difference in the discre-

 tionary power over the price as the main explanation of the differences in

 the pricing behavior between oligopolistic and competitive industries.

 Thus prices in competitive markets are supposed to arise out of interaction

 between market demand and supply, whereas prices in oligopolistic

 industries are set by some implicit collusive agreement between few oligo—

 polistic firms dominating the industry.

      The notion of differential price behavior in concentrated and uncon—

 centrated industries was first raised by Gardiner Means [19621. He

advanced the "administered price" thesis, i.e., administrative control over

prices in markets where there are relatively small numbers of firms results

in less price flexibility than is found in more competitive markets:

prices in concentrated industries tend to fall less than competitive prices

during periods of recession and to rise less than the market determined

prices during expansionary periods.

     Studies attempting to verify or reject Means' hypothesis have been

basically empirical with little theoretical explanation of the process

underlying the differential pricing behavior of the concentrated and uncon—

centrated industries. The usual criticism of the traditional view has

centered on the lack of explicit price determination mechanism in both

types of industries. In the absence of Walrasian actioneer it is not clear
                                      — 13 —




               in the competitive markets are in fact "made" as a result of
how   prices
interaction of supply and demand. On the other hand, theories of oligopo—

listic pricing have been generally ad—hoc and lack rigorous theoretical

foundations [Frydman and Nadiri (1978)1. However, recent studies have

clarified to some extent the basic issues involved and has led to a more

sophisticated understanding of the possible relationship between industrial

structure and pricing behavior.

       Phelps and Winter [19701 have developed an atomistic competition made

of price behavior. In a significant departure from traditional analysis

the authors assume that each atomistic firm     is   in a position of a transient

monopolist and it is a price setter. Due to imperfect and costly infor-

mation as to the currently set prices, the result will be not one price in

the competitive market, but a distribution of prices. Thus, each firm will

not lose its customers instantaneously when it raises its price above the

average of competitors' prices and will also not attract a substantial

number of customers at the instant in which it lowers its prices below the

average of market prices. The firm will fix its price according to stan-

dard theory of price settings under monopoly conditions with the signifi-

cant difference that it will have to take explicitly into account the cost

of setting the price which is different than the mean industry price. The

Phelps—Winter model replaces the fiction of Wairasian actioneer with expli-

cit account of price setting under conditions of atomistic competition.

The recent advance in theory of disequilibrium pricing suggested by F.

Fisher [1981] and others also substantiates the rationale of inertia or

relative inflexibility of prices in the competitive industries.
                                         — 14 —




           From the point of view of our discussion the importance of the

  Phelps—Winter model lies in the apparent blurring of the distinctions bet-

 ween oligopolistic and competitive pricing behavior. The differential

 pricing behavior is dependent on the degree of response of rivals. What is

 important to note is the information aspects of price setting that underlie

 price formation inalimarkets [Frydman and Nadiri (1978)].          This,
 however, does not lead to the conclusion that prices in oligopolitic and

 competitive industries are set in the same way. The crucial difference

 lies in the likelihood of collusion among firms in a given industry. G.

 Stigler [19641 has argued that when the number of sellers is lower, the

 ability to detect price cutters is much stronger and a collusive agreement

easier to maintain. This argument provides an essential link between the

likelihood of collusion among firms and degree of industry concentration.

Recently Phlips [1980] has derived a price rule which links price behavior

to the parameters representing market structure, degree of cooperation

among firms and the possibility of entry. It is shown that price rigidi-

ties can result from an intertemporal optimizing behavior. The optimal

path of the firms price rule is obtained from an intertemporal price

discrimination model where firms accumulate inventories and the possibility

of entry of exist. The industry price equation takes the following form:



     P =     (—)  a+ (—)

on industry price and the better the cooperation among firms (for given m)

the larger cS and the stronger is the negative impact of the threat of entry

on price. Other implications of this model are: In more concentrated

industries costs increases are less fully transmitted into prices than In

less concentrated industries; changes in demand are transmitted more fully

into prices in concentrated industries than in more competitive industries;

for a given industry structure an increase in industry demand will have

smal   Ier lmpact on   jrices than an increase    in   average marginal normaLized

costs. These are testable hypothesis and Phlips' empirical results for a

select group of industries in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France confirm

them. Particularly costs turn out to be the dominant factors affecting

prices in different catagories of industries and the barrier to entry has a

highly significant positive effect on prices.

        An important question is to substantiate whether there is a link bet-

ween the likelihood of collusion among firm and the degree of Industry con-

centration. We noted Stigler's [19641 argument in favor of this

propostion. However, to establish Its validity, it is important to show

whether collusion among firms leads to higher long term profits. Some

evidence is provided by the studies of the relationship between con—
                                     — 16 —




 centration   and profits. Weiss [19741 concludes on the basis of extensive

 survey of empirical evidence that, "The bulk of the studies show a signifi-

 cant positive effect of concentration of profits or margins." Since impli-

 cit cooperation is usually found in concentrated industries, these findings

 imply that collusion seems to be profitable for cooperating firms.

      But how does the process work? Ross and Wachter [1975] provide an

 explanation for an observation that firms in oligopolistic Industries act

 so as to maintain fixed pricing strategies (although not
                                                            necessarily or

 generally fixed prices), which they alter at regular points of time. The
 interval of time in which the pricing strategy is unchanged is called the

 planning period. Thus their model is not an explanation of price deter-

mination under oligopoly, but it provides an analysis of timing of price

changes in concentrated industries. They assume that the firms are denied

a possibility of outright collusion and that particular equilibrium

industry structure has developed. The implication of this equilibrium is

that none of the firms or any coalition of firms, bound
                                                          by the implicit
collusive agreement, views it to be in their interest to alter the

equilibrium structure. As the demand and supply conditions of the
                                                                     industry
change, in deciding on whether or not to adjust to the new developments,

the firm is forced to balance the loss of profits due to inappropriate

price structure against the potential profit loss if an attempt to alter

prices should lead to a breakdown in the level of
                                                    oligopoly cooperation.

     The significance of Ross—Wachter's model lies in Its applicability to

a wide variety of market structures. The firms in the competitive

industries will repsond continuously to changes in market conditions, since
                                   — 17 —




the atoniistlc firms find it impossible to collude and therefore will not
face the trade off between benefits of collusion and losses due to inappro-

priate price structure. On the other hand, the firms in oligopolistic

industries will move in discrete time intervals. The conclusion regarding

competitive firms should he modified, however, to take account of the fac-

tors elaborated in the Phelps—Winter model, i.e., informational structure

of the market would cause firms in the competitive markets to respond, also

in dscrete time intervals.


     2. Inventory and Price Stickiness

     A firm's profit maximizing inventory strategy may also cause the firm

to react differently to a change in demand depending on whether the firm

perceives the change to be transitory or permanent. The assumption about

the demand fluctuation is essential in models which link inventory deci-

sions and price inflexibility. Since demand fluctuates randomly around a

given mean, the firms respond to these fluctuations by changing their level

of inventories because they cannot instantaneously adjust their prices or

outputs. The inventory change is followed in the next period by a change

in the rate of production to restore their equilibrium inventory stocks

while leaving their prices unchanged. Kawasaki et al [1983] constructs a

model of dynamic profit maximization under uncertainty and imperfect com-

petition to derive an analogue of repeated Cournot equilibrium framework.

Using such analytical framework they demonstrate that firms change their

output in response to     demand change but change their prices in response

to only permanent demand changes. A. Blinder [1982] also reaches similar
                                     — 18 —




 conclusions though using a different analytical framework. That
                                                                   is, both
 prices and output respond less to a transitory demand shock than to a per-

 manent demand change and when output becomes more "inventorable." Prices

 will become sticky when inventories can be stored without much cost and

 when the demand shocks are transitory. In both of these models the

 existence of inventories reduces the flexibility of prices In all states of

 demand and in both directions. In fact, the
                                               empiricial results reported by
 Kawasaki et al [1982] as was noted earlier suggest no evidence of asvm—

 metrical response of prices, i.e., prices are less flexible downwards than

 upwards.

      Note that these models provide an explanation of the relative price

inflexibility and not sluggish absolute prices. However, changes in rela-

tive prices can affect the rate of inflation
                                               [see Fischer [19821 J. The
models described here can be modified to relate firm price decision to their

expectations about aggregate price expectations or demand fluctuation.      If

the mean of the firm demand functions stated above shifts, a new

equilibrium emerges with each firm having a new target Inventory stock and

perhaps a new price. This can arise if firms form expectations about

future changes in aggregate demand or general price levels and use them as

indicators of how the mean of the individual demand functions will shift.

This will lead to possibility of linking the sluggishness of relative pri-

ces and absolute prices as shown by J. Rotemberg [1982] and R. J. Gordon

[1981].

        3.     Adjustment Costs in Changing Prices

        The degree of price infiexbility, in econometric price equations is

measured by the coefficient of lagged price variable. The estimates of

this coefficient imply that firms incur a cost for not being able to change

its price readily. The partial adjustment of prices in these equations are

mainly ad—hoc in the same way as the adjustment lags were postulated in

econometric investment finctEons prior to the advent of the cost of

adjustment models. If the firms know the costs involved in adjusting their

prices in face of a changed demand condition it is logical for them to take

these costs into account in their optimization behavior. The adjustment

costs for changing prices are due to administrative cost of changing the

price lists, etc. and more importantly due to potential unfavorable reac-

tion of consumers to frequent price changes. J. Rotemberg [1982] has deve-

loped   an     interesting   eqiifllbrium model of    monopolistic   price   adjustment

with    cost    of adjustment of prices explicitly taken into account. The model

is like the Lucas [1972] equilibrium model of business cycle and incor-

porates the Phelps—Winter type of monopolistic pricing behavior. Firms

optimize their objective function taking the prices set by other firms as

given; they make the best full use of the current information i.e., they

form their expectations rationally. The firms produce differentiated pro-

ducts, they observe their demand and cost functions before setting their

prices, they know the prices of their suppliers, the price level and the

level of aggregate nominal money balances. The cost to changing prices is

assumed to be a function of the square of the price change and the monopo-

lists set their prices optimally given that it is costly to change them.
                                      — 20 —




  Rotemherg shows that in the presence of adjustment costs changing prices

  today will affect tomorrow's profit and the pricing rule for the firm will

  be the usual partial adjustment equation used in most empirical studies

  i.e.,



                   + (1—y)


 where     in the expectation formed by firm i of its optimal price; Pj

 depends on the cost of changing prices, say C; and p the discount rate.

 When c increases price increases i.e., it will take longer for current

 prices to adjust toward their long run value. The effect of changes in p

 on speed of adjustment is ambiguous; a decrease in p makes it relatively

 cheaper to change prices in the future but it also penalizes the monopo-

 lists relatively more for current deviations of actual prices from their

long run values.


If each firm picks its
                                 optimally given the prices charged by other
firms and expects its decision not to influence the path of aggregate

variables such as the stock of
                                 money or the aggregate price level, then

Rotemberg shows that the industry equilibrium can be established and an

aggregate price equation analogous to the one stated above can be derived,

i.e.,


     Pt = Ape_i + (1—A) P


where Pt is the price level "desired" at t and A is the partial adjustment

coefficient of aggregate price level. This type of equation is often
                                  — 21 —




used to estimate the aggregate price level [Gordon (1981), Nadirl—Gupta
(1977)]. The virtue of Rotemberg's model is that it derives the partial

adjustment price equations for both Individual and aggregate prices from an

optimization model, links the parameters of the aggregate and individual

price equations and develops a cost of adjustment model of prices based on

rational expectations in which producers are aware of their true trading

opportunities and information in aggregate statistics concerning the pre-

sent is available to them.


    4. Uncertainty and Price Inflexibility

     Production is essentially a dynamic phenomenon i.e., it takes time and

therefore is subject to uncertainty. Firms may take different steps to

reduce uncertainty. In a world of dynamic uncertainty firms will perform

Intertemporal arbitrage. The market variation is met only in part by

market adjustment in sales and the remainder is met by the firms internal

adjustment in inventory and to a lesser degree in production. In a world

of static certainty when the market is purely competitive through price and

entry and exit of firms the market adjusts to variation in demand and

supply. When the firm faces an uncertain market environment and a multi—

period decision horizon, price flexibility may not be a necessary condition

for efficient allocation of resources [Wu (1979)]. A stable price will

have certain benefits both to the sellers and buyers; it will cut the

search cost of buyers of the firm and eliminate the necessity for buyers to

accumulate precautionary inventory used to guard against price uncertainty.

These factors may encourage buyers to buy more at a given price or pay more
                                            — 22 —




  for   a given quantity of goods in exchange for reduction in price uncer-

  tainty. This could mean a higher demand for sellers.          On the   other   hand,
  any price cut     could   be construed in most industries as an attempt to obtain

  a larger market share which      wiLl   be resisted by rivals and may lead to
  lower   revenue   for the seller.

         Another way to mitigate the haphazard results of uncertainty in a

 world where production takes time is the use of contract [Davidson (1977)].

 The wage Contract implicit       or explicit   is the most pervasIve agreement in
 the economy. If it were constantly revised and recontracted, the transac-

 tion cost will be so high that it would
                                                 likely inhibit production in a
 decentralized market economy. To a lesser degree the same argument applies

 to other types of costs and       products.    When contracts are taken into con—
 siderat ion then the past and future of
                                                economic activities becomes part of
 the economic process and provides the element of inertia i.e., the

 overlapping labor contract as a source of
                                                  inflexibility of prices. Because
 if money wages are determined outside the theoretical market system
                                                                     over
the forthcoming three year interval, then prices will adjust to money
                                                                      wages
rather the converse.

        The inflexibility of wages arises from a number of factors. The most

widely accepted is based on the behavior of unions where collective

bargaining introduces lags in wage response of some Industries. In absence

of unions firms may want to pay premium wages in order to have a queue of

available skilled labor and therefore the firms
                                                       will not change wages imme-
diately as labor conditions change [Wachter (1976)]. Also firms may

desire an ongoing relationship with their labor force, especially if the
                                         — 23 —




jobs are    ideosyncratic in   nature and    require specific skills and training.
The wages for these type of jobs wiU he determined by the internal wage
structure and the    short—run market forces will he ignored in this situation.

      5. Heterogeneity of Markets and Price Inertia

      A number of models have been proposed which emphasize        the   diversity

and heterogeneity of different markets as the source of inertia of the

aggregate    price level. The basic notion is that the economy       Is composed of

a variety- of markets with different characterIstics and different rules of

behavior.     Sticky prices may be a rational outcome in certain markets in
the economy which in turn      may   impart the price inertia at the aggregate
level.     Arthur Okun, W. t'ordhaus and R. J. Gordon have     discussed   various

aspects of how models of       heterogeneous markets may lead to price inertia at
the   aggregate level.

      The Okun [19811 model is       based   on a "contract—theoretic" framework     and

states that in order to economize on transaction costs with one and other,

economic agents will trade repeatedly with each other. Wages and price

behavior are explained in a search theoretic framework. In markets with

heterogeneous products prices tend to be inflexible because information

about prices is difficult to obtain and there is a continuing relationship

between the buyer and seller. The transactions costs are very high and

price stability is in the interest of both parties. In these types of

markets called "customer markets" both customers and producers have an

interest in stable prices. The customers would like to avoid excessive

search cost and are willing to pay a premium to do business with customary
                                      — 24 —




  suppliers.   Firms have an incentive in stable prices to encourage customers

  to return using yesterday's prices as a guide. But if permanent changes in

  demand and costs have accrued and both the customers and firms have this

 knowledge, prices could change without inducing customers to do comparison

 shopping. Price stability is considered as a service in Okun's model which

 is a complete reversal of Means' model of administered prices noted

 earlier. The auction or what we called liquid markets clears instan-

 taneously and there is no incentive to induce long term contractual

 arrangements, infrequent price changes and quantity rationing. In markets

 with homogeneous products information flows rapidly and the market macha—

 nism is impersonal.

      Nordhaus [1976] elaborates further this line of thinking. The economy

 can be divided into "auction" and "administered" markets.   In the auction

markets competitive supply and demand forces prevail and prices are

flexible. In the administered markets either buyers or sellers have signi-

ficant market power and one use of that power has been to restrain price

movements. Prices and wages are set In these markets on some principle of

"normal pricing" i.e., cyclical fluctuations are largely removed In setting

prices and wages. The effect of demand on aggregate price will be fairly

weak and there will be an effect from what Nordhaus calls the "momentum

effect." Demand changes affect prices through three channels: through the

mark up In the administered market prices
                                            equation, through unemployment In
the wage equation and from "auction" market.   The combination of these

forces due to nonhinearities are likely to be weak at low levels of demand

but high when the economy operates at capacity. The "momentum effect" of
                                    — 25 —




current and past wage and prices in the administered markets of the economy
dominates   their short term movements. The effect of demand policies will

be small in the initial stage .but would be spread out over a long period.

The third effect comes from the auction prices which may be due to such

factors as oil price increase, increases in commodity prices, changes In

weather, speculation, etc.   If these changes are significant, then as Bruno

and Sachs [19821 have shown, input price shocks can affect aggregate prices

significantly.
     An elaborate model of price behavior is outlined by R. J. Gordon

[19811. No adjustment costs are formally included in the analysis but the

emphasis is put on diversity of circumstance facing firms in differnt

markets and the cost of communication and coordination through a complex

input—output network of relationships among firms.    Firms may face diverse

sets of circumstances in various markets: they may have distinct tech-

nologies, produce heterogeneous products, discover information about

changes in their own demand and costs and the aggregate demand and cost

changes with different degrees of certainty. The learning capacity of

firms are usually not the same [Frydman (1981)1 i.e., there may be long

lags in formation of expectations [Maccini (1981)1.    What emerges In

Gordon's model is the crucial role of the local vs. aggregate components of

demand and costs i.e., the ratio of the variance of local to the sum of

variances of local and aggregate components of demand shift and the ratio

of the local to the sum of the local and aggregate components of costs.

These ratio's are likely to be zero in periods of war and hyperinflation

when there is extreme pressure for prices to change; the variance of the
                                       — 26 —




  aggregate components of demand and costs will dominate in such
                                                                 periods and
  Individual prices respond immediately to changes in aggregate demand and
  costs.

       A further extension of the idea that the network of Input—output or

  stages of production matter in pricing behavior of firms has been developed

  recently by Blanchard [19831. Some of the simplifying assumptions are that

  production is instantaneous, alt goods
                                           are perishable, input supply is an
 increasing function of its real price,
                                           output demand depends posItIvely on
 real money balances and money is neutral and affects only the level of all

 prices. Firms choose their relative
                                        prices every two periods and their
 prices depend on current and expected input prices for the next two

 periods. Assuming rational expectations and uncertainty Blanchard shows

 that if the firm's price decisions
                                      are not completely synchronized the
 price level will depend on three elements: the actual and expected past

 input prices, the actual value and past expectations of current Input pri-

ces and both past and current expectations of
                                                 input prices. As the number
of stages of production increases the dependence of the price level on

input prices further in the past and expected in the future. Price level

will react less and adjust more
                                  slowly to changes in money if real input
prices are insensitive to market conditions.
                                                 Increase in money affects the
structure of prices; prices early in the chain of production move more and

adjust faster, prices further in the chain move less and adjust more

slowly. When a nominal disturbance requires
                                                a change in the price level
what will likely follow is a change in prices of a complex structure of

final goods, intermediate goods and
                                      inputs. These adjustments will not be
                                  — 27 —




taken continuously nor in the same manner in different markets or
industries. Thus the desynchrouizatiofl of individual price decision can

generate price level inertia observed at the aggregate economy or industry

level.

     There is some empirical evidence that suggests that the response of

prices by stage of process to a change in demand differ substantially. The

model of stage of process developed by Popkin [1977] links the movements of

crude, intermediate and finished goods components of the WPI with each

other and with the CPI. The results of the twenty—one sector price model,

when viewed as a whole, suggest that it is in the primary and semi—finished

goods industries, rather than in the finished goods producing and distri-

buting sectors, that changes in demand affect the relationship between the

output and input prices. The initial response in the finished goods

industries is to reduce output and not prices. Cutbacks in orders for

materials and supplies placed by these industries are often larger than

they would be if prices had been flexible. The fluctuations in output are

much larger at the earlier stage than at the latter stage of production and

also the ratio of price of output to the weighted price of inputs behave

not procyclically in the finished goods sectors while that for the primary

and semi finished products it moves procyclically. In response to a cut-

back of orders from the finished product manufacturers, the prices in the

primary product manufacturing industries weaken. Such weakness then feeds

forward to final demand prices, with a lag, affecting prices in all

finished manufacturing and service sectors. Thus, the amplitude of output

and price responses to changes in final demand vary considerably among dif—
                                      — 28 —




 ferent   stages of production arid there is a dynamic relationship among the

 response pattern through the input—output structure of the economy.


 III. Asymmetrical Price Increase

      We have noted that not only most prices have become less responsive to

 decline in aggregate demand but they may also rise in a recession. What

 can explain this perverse behavior? There are several lines of reasoning

 for this phenomenon to occur.

     Under the conditions of monopoly the traditional theoretical explana-

tion for rigidity of prices in the presence of contraction in demand is

based on the difference between short and long run price elasticity of

demand. Since the short—run elasticity of demand is less than the long run

elasticity, and in many cases must be less than one. It implies that a

monopolist considering a price cut to deal with a temporary recession would

face a possibly negative marginal revenue compared to marginal revenue it

would face in making general price policy. The natural conclusion seems to

be that optimal price policy in a recession would often be to hold prices

stable or to change them only in response to changes In long—run

expectations.

     This reasoning has some relevance to the explanation of price inflexi-

bility during recessions of oligopolistic prices. Spence [1976] has

suggested the concept of market share equilibrium and showed that there

exists the set of market shares having the property that no firm can

increase its profits if all others react by maintaining their market share.

In this framework market shares serve as basis of strategic interaction
                                   — 29 —




among lirms in oligopolistic industry. Suppose now that the fall in

industry demand affects proportionately all the firms so they continue to

be in the market share equilibrium. It is clear that If industry demand

becomes inelastic the firm would not find it profitable to lower their

prices given that other firms will react to maintain their market shares.

Lowering of the price by individual may be considered by other firms as

"competitive" price cutting and lead to the breakdown of implicit collusive

agreement and benefits associated with such agreement. Moreover con-

siderable uncertainty will exist as to the true value of industry's price

elasticity of demand. Therefore, it is very likely that known benefits of

implicit collusion will outweight highly uncertain benefits of contemplated

price reduction. On the other hand if costs during the recessions because

of "momentum effect" build in past contracts rise, the firm will likely to

pass these prices without any danger of retaliation from its competitors.

Cost increases are likely to be experienced by all the firms In the oligo—

polistic industry where firms are likely to follow a normal pricing deci-

sion rule with respect to prices of inputs and outputs.

     Another rationale for asymmetric pricing behavior is suggested by

Kuran [19831. He argues that prices of monopolistic firms with

nonincreasing price elasticity of demand and nonincreasing marginal costs

can be relatively more rigid downward than upward. Such firms raise their

prices to a greater extent when they expect inflation, than they lower them

when they expect equivalent reduction in demand. In response to an

Increase in price level uncertainty these firms will increase their prices.

These results follow from the notion that the monopolist's loss is greater
                                        — 30   —




 from charging a price below the monopoly price than the loss from charging

 above it by a proportionally equivalent amount. A price cut may trigger a

 reaction from competitors while an increase in prices may not.

        To show that relative prices variability can be linked to variation In

 the rate of inflation require that prices respond asymmetrically to distur-

 bances. If prices behave asymmetricaly in either direction the association

 between relative prices and rate of inflation can be established and not if

 prices are equally sticky in recessionary and expansionary phases of the

 business cycle. Fischer's [1982] results indicate that there is a strong

 link between unanticipated inflation and relative price variability for

 both   U.S.   and Germany. There are weaker links between the variation of

relative prices and rate of inflation. Unanticipated inflation was found

to affect relative price variability much more than a deflation suggesting

support for the asymmetric price response hypothesis.

        But why should many firms in the competitive industry raise prices

when demand falls? The only conceivable circumstance is the perception of

the decrease in the short—run elasticity of demand coupled with increase of

marginal costs of firms in the competitive industry. In such a case, If

properly perceived by individual firms the proper profit maximizing

response is the increase, not decrease in the price [Frydman and Nadiri

(1978)]. Since the firm contemplating the price change will be highly

uncertqin as to the price elasticity of demand for its product but it wilt

be able to observe the increases in its costs, it might decide to increase

its price. If all firms perceive the Situation in this way the fall in

demand will be mostly reflected in the output changes.
                                         — 31   —




       The overall, conclusion from the above reasoning is that when contrac-

tion of demand is accompanied by increases in direct costs the rational

response of both competitive and oligopolistic firms might be to raise

prices. This phenomenon will be considerably strengthened, if the firms in

both   oligopolistic and competitive industries expect the contraction in

demand to be temporary, while cost increases are perceived to be permanent.

It is also clear that due to the element of implicit collusion in oligopo—

listic industries the increase in prices should be more widely observed in

more concentrated industries.

       An interesting explanation of this perverse behavior of prices is pro-

vided by Cagan [1979]. If the anticipated trend of prices is upward and

price changes over the cycle are the cyclical deviations from the trend,

then prices will rise in the recession, however, less than the trend. The

long trend in prices can he subject to rational expectations. This antici-

pation factor will be incorporated in contract prices of inputs or some

input supplies will be withheld from the market. Thus, the anticipated

rise in price trend can limit decline of prices in the recession and may

cause prices to rise if the anticipated trend is rising fast enough. But

the anticipated price trend will be revised by rational agents depending on

the severity and duration of current and past business cycles.


IV. International Competition and Pricing Behavior

       In the previous sections we have examined a pricing behavior across

industries in the domestic economy. A number of the Industries considered

produce   goods that are   sold in the   foreign nmrkets.   In many industries
                                      — 32 —




 foreign   firms have a significant share of the domestic markets.   Moreover,
 many industries use inputs that are traded internationally. Therefore, the

 developments In the world markets, trade patterns and currency fluctuations

 have a potentially important role in understanding of the pricing adjust-

 ment in domestic industries. Unfortunately, no systematic theoretical and

 empirical analysis of price formation seems to exist for industries pro—

 ducing exportable or import—competing goods. Therefore, the discussion in

 this section wilL necesarily be limited to few observations on the possible

 significance of these issues.

      We noted earlier that barriers to entry could play an important role

 in pricing behavior of firms. Competition in the world market could have

the same effect as entry of a competitor in the domestic economy. For

example, Wachtel and Adelsheim [1977] have argued that in U.S. automobile

industry foreign competition provides an extraordinarily intense com-

petitive check on what had traditionally been a mature oligopoly with

routinized pricing behavior. Due to this competition, price increases for

domestically produced cars have been restrained and price markups In the

automobile industry have declined in recent years.

     Even though similar calculations have not been performed for other

Industries the potentially significant effect of imports can be inferred by

noting that between 1960 and 1970 imports increased in high concentration

industries by the following percentages: Machinery and transportation
equipment — 662 percent; rubber tires and tubes — 876
                                                      percent; iron and
steel mill products — 352
                          percent. These developments suggest caution in

the use of concentration ratios as a basis for studying price behavior
                                  — 33 —




across industries. In the presence of substantial volume of imports, the
concentration ratios might significantly overstate the degree of market

power or possibility of implicit price coordination in domestic industries.

[Frydman and Nadiri (1978)].

     As we noted earlier, material costs are generally very significant in

explaining industry price behavior. Since many of raw materials are

traded internationally, it is clear that the domestic prices will be

strongly affected by the conditions in the world commodity markets. Also,

the effect of changes in exchange rate in addition to having an effect on

Import prices, will have an effect on domestic prices of import competing

goods.

     Some empirical results are available on the role played by changes in

import prices and particularly the recent increase in material prices.

Nordhaus and Shoven [1977] have decomposed the rate of Inflation of 58 sec-

tors in the U.S. economy during 1972—1974 into its components. They have

considered the effect of acceleration in agricultural prices, rise in

mining and domestic fuel prices, imports price increase, and Increase in

labor costs. Several results stand out: First, the contribution of these

components vary considerably in different sectors; In some Import prices

dominate, in a few the rise in agricultural prices stands out, while in

some others the labor cost increase seems to be the major component of the

sectoral inflation rates; second, about 85% of the inflation was explained

by the pass—through of hikes in the commodity prices and wages, suggesting

the dominance of the costs in prices behavior; third, there were shifts in

the composition of the inflation over the two years 1972—74. In the early
                                      — 34 —




 parts   of the period wage increase was the major contributory factor to

 inflation, while prices of agricultural products accounted for two third8

 of the inflation in November 1972 to August 1973; imports contributed about

 16% to Inflation in this period. In the last part of 1973—74 period

 imports dominated the picture. 36% of total inflation was due to rise In

 import prices and the price rise of the domestic crude oil and natural gas

 contributed significantly to inflation in this period.

        Grubb et al [1982J explore the causes of stagflation in 19 OECD

 countries and estimate the contributrion of slowdown in productivity

 growth, the unfavorable trends in relative import prices and the higher

 level of unemployment. They show that in the average OECD country relative

import prices made inflation in 1980 5% higher than it would have been if

 import prices had continued their pre 1973 trend. Lower
                                                             productivity
growth had art equal effect in raising Inflation. These two effects were

offset by the effect of higher unemployment measured as deviation from its

trend. Bruno and Sachs [1982] also have argued that input price shocks

can lead to decline in growth of output and productivity, real wages, and

capital accumulation. When real wages are sticky these effects are greatly

magnified leading to greater unemployment and decline in output. With real

wage inertia profitability is reduced significantly by the rise in input

prices and investment tends to become sharply reduced. Their empirical

analysis suggests that recent sharp increases in material prices has been a

ma)or   contributory of the increase in the   rate of inflation in most of the

OECD countries. Since materials is a major     component of the imports in
these   countries, the exogeneous increase in prices of materials and oil
                                    — 35 —




since   1973 was one of the major factors in the stagflation of the Western

economics.


V. Concluding Remarks

     In this paper we have looked at some empirical evidence on price

inflexibility and presented some of the theoretical bases for why price

stability in the face of a decrease in short run demand may be an outcome

of rational maximization behavior. The response of firms to uncertainty,

the cost of adjusting prices, the contents of the long—term contracts

(explicit or implicit) in the goods and input markets, the extent and

variability of excess demand may differ among firms and industries. The

structure of the Industry, the degree of heterogeneity of the products in a

market, the network of input—output relationship among industries, the

nature of international competition, the process of formation of expec-

tations shocks from monetary and fiscal policies and Input price increases,

all may Interact and create the ever changing environment of the firms.

There is a continual interplay of institutional forces, market arrangements

and cultural factors and customs that govern the behavior of firms with the

governmental policies and macroeconomic forces, which will result in price

rigidities in the short—run. These rigidities will evolve over time and

will vary across different markets, industries, or countries. In the long

run the Institutions and market arranginents will also change when they are

no longer useful and serve their purpose.

     In the presence of the price rigidities, the conventional monetary and

fiscal restraint can achieve price stability at a high cost of high
                                    — 36 —




 unemployment.   This would result from the momentum of built in lags in the

 costs and if people form their expectations by extrapolating past rates of

 inflation. The cost of restraining inflation could be fairly high as

 recently documented by Gordon [1982b]. On the other hand there is con-

 vincing evidence that monetary and fiscal restraints have been very suc-

 cessful in reversing the inflationary spiral in hyper—inflations

experienced by a number of countries in the early 1920's (Sargent [1982]).

The cause of such hyper—inflations may have been the excessive increase of

money and peoples' expectations that the government will accommodate the

inflationary developments. To end the hyper—inflation the governments were

forced to adopt a dramatically new strategy of a coordinated set of poli-

cies. An abrupt change in government policies and an effective inforcement

of the new legislations were the prerequisites for ending the hyper—

inflations. Though there are not any specific estimates of costs of such

anti—inflationary policies, it seems they did not lead to any widespread

unemployment that are implied in the models discussed in this paper.

     In hyper—inflationary situations the transaction costs of holding money

Is so high that all contracts expressed in money terms become excessively

burdensome and the length of contracts dramatically shrinks; the distortive

effects of high inflation on incentives could lead to disorientation of the

business and consumers, the distribution of income and wealth gets

distorted and finally the self generating nature of Inflationary expec-

tations become very much understood by the public and the government. In

such situations the government will get the mandate to follow dramatic

anti—inflationary policies to break the inflationary expectations and put
                                   — 37 —




the economy on a stable course. However, at low rates of inflation a con-
sensus often does not exist for a decisive action. In democractic

societies, the governments will not have the ability to sustain anti—

inflationary policies for too long and with sufficient force to achieve

growth with stable prices. The central point to stress is that the ability

of governments to combat inflationary expectations is eridogenous in the

system. There is a nonlinear relationship between the costs of inflation,

the ability of the government to pursue effective anti—inflationary poli-

cies, and the public's acceptance of the needed adjustments.

     What kind of policy options are open In an economy with moderate rates

of inflation which exhibits, in the short—run, price inflexibility for the

reasons described in this paper? This is a very difficult question and

would require considerable analysis and space beyond the scope of this

paper. A few such options can be mentioned here but only briefly. If the

price inflexibility Is partly due to Imperfect and costly information or

its uneven distribution and utilization then such a market failure can be

corrected with timely and relevant information provided by policy makers

and emergence of firms that could make the needed information available.

If the problem is partly due to overlapping wage contracts and institu-

tional rigidities in other markets, or if it Is due to disynchronised

nature of pricing decision, then the possibility of successes in the short—

run is not encouraging. Only a consistent policy targeted at the disaggre—

gated industry levels and sustained for a number of years might dampen the

effects of these structural forces. If the price inflexibility is partly

in response to uncertainty and inability to determine precisely the changes
                                        -38--




in aggregate demand, then governmental policies can minimize potential distur--

bances by avoiding erratic and sizeable shifts in its monetary and fiscal poli-

cies. Government policies that lessen the degree of concentration -in domestic

markets and encourage international
                                      competition may dampen the potential effects
of monopoly power on prices. But international agreements may also be required

to stabilize prices of inputs such as raw materials, which can exert significant

effect on the level of prices when the domestic prices are inflexible.

Promoting increase in productivity and technical change may be one of the impor-

tant ways to lower the rate of inflation and reduce
                                                      price inflexibility.
Further, the price structure of government services and the effect of govern-

mental regulations on price behavior must be examined carefully for they may

impart significant inflexibility to the price structure.
