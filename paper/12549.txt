                                          ABSTRACT


Within-country ethnic diversity in high-wage immigrant nations is driven by long distance
migration. This paper documents the migration-diversity connection for the first global century
before 1914 and the second global century after 1950. It distinguishes between ethnic diversity
among the foreign-born, between the foreign-born and native-born and for total populations
using country-of-birth data. It exploits the polarization index made popular in the recent
diversity-growth debate and exploits an emigration life cycle model to predict the connection. It
also shows how policy matters.

                            Diversity and Migration: Setting the Stage



         Why do some parts of the world have much greater ethnic and cultural diversity

than others?

         Let me begin by stating the obvious: ethnic diversity can only come about for one

reason – long distance migration. Ceteris paribus, regions which have undergone greater

immigration in the past will exhibit greater ethnic diversity in the present. The ceteris

paribus qualification is essential since most observers only pay attention to immigration

rates and foreign-born shares. Who the immigrants are and their ‘ethnic distance’ from

the native-born matters just as much as the overall immigration rate; both dictate the size

of the economic, cultural and linguistic diversity in the host country.1 The interesting

issue, then, is how the combination of immigrant ethnic diversity and the immigration

rate work to forge the migration-diversity connection in the host country and whether

there is an economic explanation for both.

         It seems to me that if we understand what determines who and how many migrate,

then we understand what determines ethnic diversity. The most parsimonious explanation

of migration, and thus of diversity, appeals simply to wage gaps between sending and

receiving regions (Lucas 1988: 6). I call this demand side thinking. It tells us

unambiguously that labor surplus regions -- which have, historically, always sent

emigrants abroad -- will also be regions at the bottom of the real wage, living standard

and GDP per capita pecking order. These poor parts of the world will also tend to be the

least diverse since they do not pull in migrants. Symmetrically, it also tells us that labor


1
  There is a very large literature that tries to measure within country ethnic diversity, or what I call here
‘ethnic distance’, and a recent survey of it can be found in Alesina and La Ferrara (2005).


                                                        3
scarce regions -- which have, historically, always received immigrants from abroad --

will be regions at the top of the real wage, living standard and GDP per capita pecking

order.2 They will also tend to be the most ethnically diverse.

        The foreign-born share in the advanced economies today is 8.7 percent and the

share for the developing countries is 1.5 percent (Freeman 2006: 146), roughly

confirming the prediction of the parsimonious model. Table 1 offers far more detail. The

world population-weighted foreign-born ratio reported there is 2.98, but the range across

major regions is huge: the two highest are Western Europe and North America (10.07,

3.4 times the world average) and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (8.24, 2.8 times the

world average); the three lowest are East Asia (1.05), Latin America and the Caribbean

(1.01), and South Asia (0.92). The high FB ratio for Eastern Europe and Central Asia

may appear to be a surprise, but the explanation is simply that what had been internal

migration in the USSR became external migration after the break up. The second surprise

may appear to be sub-Saharan Africa, where the FB ratio is 3.66, but there has long been

cross-border churning in that region (Hatton and Williamson 2002). Finally, while

foreign-born shares of 10 percent may not sound like high levels of cultural and ethnic

diversity, remember that the foreign-born concentrate in gateway cities. Thus, while the

foreign-born share is ‘only’ 4.3 in the United Kingdom, it is 28 in London, a ratio of

almost seven to one! Similarly, the share for Paris (23) is almost two and a half times that

of France (10). Big multiples also apply to modern high-wage gateway cities in the US

like Boston (FB share 30.1; multiple 30.1/11.1=2.7), Los Angeles (40.2; 3.6), Miami


2
  One has to assume, of course, that the migration fails to eliminate wage differentials across countries.
History confirms that assumption: whatever produced the wage gap in 1830 at the start of modern mass
migration has persisted to the present. World migration has always been constrained, even during the age of
‘free’ migration.


                                                    4
(58.2; 5.2), New York (35.5; 3.2), and San Francisco (35.5; 3.2).3 The same was true, of

course, for 19th century Boston, Buenos Aires, New York, and São Paolo.

        Figure 1 illustrates the parsimonious demand-side model with foreign-born shares

(FB) plotted against GDP per capita, both for the year 2000, and covering 130 countries.4

When FB is regressed against GDP per capita (Table 1) – controlling only for country

size (area) -- the estimated coefficient is 0.294 with a t-statistic of 3.84. This world

relationship is robust to the addition of geography and other controls (not reported here).

But the big surprise in Table 1 is this: while the parsimonious relationship works very

well in explaining world migration, it does not work very well in explaining migration

within regions (with the exceptions of East Asia and Latin America). The moral seems

clear: While the parsimonious model is effective in explaining long distance migration

between rich and poor regions (between which ethnic distance is greatest), a more

complex model is needed to explain migration within regions where income per capita

variance is so much smaller (as are ethnic distances).

         The parsimonious demand-side model may work well in accounting for world

variance in foreign-born shares, but it fails to take account of a force which has a

powerful influence on ethnic diversity among the foreign-born. The migration of the poor

has always been constrained on the supply side by poverty (Faini and Venturini 1994;

Hatton and Williamson 1998, 2005), the cost of long distance moves, and the population

share in the mobile age group. These supply constraints interfere with what otherwise

might produce a perfect correlation between living standards, immigration and ethnic

diversity, with the causal direction going from living standards to migration to diversity.5

In fact, ever since ‘free’ mass migration started two centuries ago it has always been true

that the richer of the poor regions, and the richer within poor regions, are the first to make

the long distance move to the richest regions. Thus, while the United States had a lot of

foreign-born in 1820 – before the big secular migration boom that started in the 1840s,

most were ethnically, culturally and linguistically almost identical to the native-born.

That is, new British and German immigrants joined old British and German immigrants.

Similarly, new Italian and Spanish immigrants joined old Italian and Spanish immigrants

in 19th century Argentina, new Italian and Portuguese immigrants joined the old in 19th

century Brazil, and new United Kingdom immigrants joined the old in Australia, Canada

and New Zealand. Only as the poverty trap was unlocked in poor European countries, as

a glut of young adults emerged in those same countries as they underwent demographic

transitions, and as the cost of long distance travel between the poor sending and rich host

countries fell, only then did the ethnic gap between immigrant and native-born rise and

diversity increase in the overseas host countries.



                                    The Emigration Life Cycle



        About 60 million Europeans set sail for the labor scarce New World in the century

following 1820. Most moved to escape European poverty. European famine, revolution

and ethnic cleansing certainly helped push the first great mass migrations, but it was

5
 Most of the economics literature has looked instead at the impact of ethnic diversity on public goods and
economic growth (e.g. Easterly and Levine 1997; Alesina et al. 1999; Alesina et al. 2003). This seems
unwise given that ethnic diversity is determined endogenously by migration.


                                                     6
underlying economic and demographic labor market fundamentals that made each

subsequent surge bigger than the previous up to World War I. If my only purpose was to

explain why so many Europeans emigrated in the first global century, this section would

be very brief: after all, living standards were a lot lower in labor abundant European

sending countries. But why did emigrating countries trace out the life cycle pattern in

Figure 2? That is, emigration rates typically rose steeply from low levels (A: where

emigration rates e0 are zero and wages low at w0) as successful economic development

took place in poor sending countries, after which the rise began to slow down, emigration

rates reached a peak (B: e1 and w1), and subsequently fell off (C: e2 and w2). This

emigration life-cycle has been documented again and again for the first global century

before 1914.6 What accounts for this stylized fact?

         Figure 3 contains the explanation (documented in Hatton and Williamson 1998,

2005), where movements along some downward-sloping home country emigration

function (EM) are distinguished from shifts in the EM function. The EM function is

downward sloping for the usual reasons: ceteris paribus, higher wages at home retain

workers and produce lower emigration rates. But what about the ceteris paribus, violated

here by rightward shifts in the EM function? In pre-industrial episodes, small or even

nonexistent emigration rates (e0 = 0, at A) and low wages (w0) co-exist, that is, those who

have the most to gain from a move are trapped in poverty. Industrialization and other

events then serve to shift the emigration function rightward to EM' and to raise real

wages to w1. The shift in EM dominates in this example since emigration rates have risen

to e1 (at B); in the absence of the shift in EM, emigration rates would have fallen to e1'

6
  Economists obsessed with contemporary cross sections have noted that fast growth is often, but not
always, correlated with emigration rates (Beine, Docquier and Rapoport 2003; Freeman 2006: 160),
inferring that emigration can foster growth. Figures 2 and 3 suggest that they have the causation wrong.


                                                     7
(where, in this example, they actually would have become immigration rates, at B’). In

later stages of development, EM is more stable so that further improvements in real

wages at home, to w2, cut back emigration rates to e2 (at C). Thus, the emigration life-

cycle in Figure 2 is reproduced in Figure 3: starting at low wages and no emigration at A,

emigration booms in the poor but developing country to B, then falls to C, and finally

becomes a high-wage immigrating country at D.

        What, then, might account for the rightward shifts in EM during early

industrialization and its stability (or even leftward shift) thereafter? The first explanation

appeals to the cost of migration and imperfect capital markets. Although there may be a

strong incentive to flee pre-industrial poverty and rural subsistence, the costs of a long

distance move are prohibitive for most poor laborers. Thus, enormous and historically

persistent wage gaps between industrializing, resource-rich, high-wage countries and

agrarian, resource-poor, low-wage countries are quite consistent with low emigration

rates. As industrialization takes place in the poor sending countries, real wages rise and

the supply constraints on emigration are gradually released: more and more potential

emigrants can finance the move, and, in contrast with conventional theory, the home

wage and emigration are positively correlated. As industrialization continues, the backlog

of potential emigrants is slowly exhausted as more and more workers find ways to

finance the move.7 The demographic transition adds to that rightward shift in EM: the fall

in infant mortality rates tends, after a 15 or 20 year lag, to create a fatter cohort of mobile

young adults, thus contributing even more to the emigration boom. In addition,

remittances from previous emigrants help finance the move of family left behind (the

friends and relatives effect). As a final contribution to the rightward shift in EM, the cost

of long distance migration fell steeply before 1914 (Shah Mohammed and Williamson

2004). When the demographic transition reaches a crescendo, when remittances level off,

when industrialization at home has released the migration cost constraint, and when the

cost of long distance migration ceases its fall, the rightward shift in EM stops and begins

to drift inwards to the left. Further increases in the sending country real wage causes the

emigration rate to decline from the peak and the emigration life cycle is complete. The

length of a country’s emigration life cycle varied with the intensity of the industrial

revolution and demographic transition at home, but 50 years was the typical length in the

first global century before 1914. The emigration life cycle is shorter today since the

demographic transitions and the industrial revolutions are faster and shorter. This

contrasting length in the emigration life cycle is likely to have made ethnic diversity rise

more steeply to higher levels before 1914 than after 1950. The shorter length of the

emigration life cycle implies fewer regions emigrating at any given time.

       In summary, emigration histories typically pass through two regimes, the first

emigrant supply constrained, and the second emigrant demand constrained. The

emigrant-supply-constrained EM regime was consistent with the rising emigration and

rising home wages since powerful rightward shifts in EM dominated. But at some point,

home wages were high enough so that financial constraints were less binding: further

increases in the home wage (relative to the foreign wage) then served to reduce the

emigration incentive, the emigration rate fell as the economy moved up a more stable EM

function, and emigration experience entered the demand-constrained regime. Emigration

rates then fell as now-more-economically-mature sending regions began to catch up with

the richer receiving regions.



            Migration and Ethnic Diversity: The First US Global Century



       The emigrant life cycle is consistent with conventional qualitative histories of the

first global century. It implied an evolving change in immigrant source, quality and

ethnic distance (from the native-born norm) through time. As the transport revolution

unfolded between 1820 and 1913, the cost of long distance moves declined dramatically

in terms of railroad fare to port, steerage rates between ports, and foregone income in

transit. More potential migrants from more distant eastern and southern Europe could

now make the move. Furthermore, as industrial revolutions started among the late-comers

in eastern and southern Europe, the ratio of migration cost to annual income fell even

more dramatically in those poor parts of Europe. The spread of the transport and the

industrial revolutions both served to extend the reach of global migration: more potential

emigrants in the poor rural hinterland of western Europe could make the move, and more

potential emigrants from distant and backward eastern and southern Europe could make

the move. Thus, migrant origins shifted to more backward and poorer regions, countries

that were late-comers to modern economic growth. In addition, as each of these countries

went through its own emigration life cycle, the share coming from poorer and ethnically

different countries soared: those coming from the richer parts of Europe, with ethnic

attributes similar to the native-born, declined in numbers as their emigration life cycle

was completed; those coming from the poorer parts of Europe, with ethnic attributes

different than the native-born, rose in numbers as their emigration life cycle began. Thus,


                                             10
the ethnic gap between the native-born and the new immigrant widened in host countries

and they became culturally and ethnically more diverse.

        This dramatic shift in immigrant source obeyed economic and demographic laws

of motion. As I have already noted, the shift in immigrant source induced a rise in host

country ethnic diversity. It also induced a decline in the quality of immigrants (as judged

by labor markets) and an even bigger decline in the quality of immigrants relative to the

native-born (who were increasing their human capital at a fast pace). The fall in

immigrant quality and the rise in their ethnic ‘distance’ from the host country norm both

had a great deal to do with rising negative attitudes towards immigration in the US,

especially the positive interaction between them. These trends helped produce the 1917

Literacy Act, the Quota Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1927, as well as the ban on Asians

(Hatton and Williamson 2005: Chp. 9). All of these Acts were consistent with a racist

policy retreat from ethnic diversity, and they persisted until the immigration reforms of

1965. Although the US was by far the main destination of European emigrants, other

labor scarce immigrant countries underwent the same negative response to the rise (or a

threatened rise) in ethnic diversity: Australia and New Zealand imposed ‘whites only’

policies (which persisted until the 1970s and 1980s), and racial strife broke out in tropical

regions that had been relying on Asian contract labor for almost a century.

        In short, the first global migration century came to an end, and the rising trend in

host country ethnic diversity ceased. Or so says the conventional historical wisdom. Can

it be confirmed with quantitative evidence? The US census reports country of birth

starting with 1850, so I shall use these data to explore the hypothesis. True, country of

birth isn’t exactly ethnic diversity (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005), but it’s a start. I will



                                              11
also use the RQ index that is so common in the literature that explores the impact of

ethnic diversity on economic growth and public goods expenditure (Esteban and Ray

1994; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2002; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005):


                 RQ = 1 – Σ ([0.5 - si]/0.5)2 si                                        (1)


where si is the share of the foreign-born from origin-country i in total foreign-born

population or in total population. The growth-public goods literature calls this a

polarization index – reflecting its negative impact, but I will adopt the more benign view

of migration and call it a diversity index. In any case, RQ reaches a maximum when two

groups are of equal size and declines as their relative importance deviates: a high RQ

indicates ethnic diversity. Of course, one would like to weight by the ‘ethnic distance’

between groups (e.g. by language and religion), but no such empirical analysis has yet

been attempted (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005: 794), and the US authorities did not offer

such judgments (although US native-born citizens certainly did). I will come back to the

issue of ‘ethnic distance’ since it will shade our interpretation of RQ levels and trends.

        Table 2 uses the US data on country of birth to construct RQ at census benchmark

dates 1850-1960, as well as changes in the RQ index over the open, free migration era

1850-1910 and the closed and discriminatory period 1920-1960. The RQ calculations are

made according to eight world regions, and the country allocations to those regions are

given in the Appendix.8 Table 2 also reports RQ within the foreign-born group (diversity

among the foreign-born), between the foreign-born and native-born (diversity between

the two groups), and total diversity. Note the following in Table 2: Total ethnic diversity

some aggregation.

reached a peak in 1860 (0.512), which it has not regained since, this despite the fact that

diversity among the foreign-born was almost at its lowest (0.099). The explanation is that

the RQ between index (the FB share) was at its peak (0.516).

        Now consider the details, starting with the age of free migration 1850-1910. As

predicted by the emigration life cycle model, within and total RQ changed far more

dramatically than did the between RQ index (driven by the FB share). In the half-century

before 1910, the within RQ rose five times faster than did the between RQ. The United

States already had a high level of ethnic diversity in 1850 with RQ = 0.401. The

subsequent rise in US ethnic diversity was driven almost entirely by the increased

diversity of the immigrants themselves, an event which had important political

implications, as I have argued.

        Now consider the 1920-1960 period when immigration policy was so restrictive.

Before WWI, the US did not discriminate against poor source countries (except for the

ban on Asians after 1882). Between WWI and 1965, the US used quotas to favor west

Europeans and suppress immigration from poor countries. After the Immigration Act of

1965, the US leveled the playing field again back to what it was in the first global century

(except for that post-1982 anti-Asian bias). Total ethnic diversity fell sharply, but its

main source was the fall in immigration and the FB share (RQ between), not the more

modest fall in RQ within. This is a bit of a surprise given that the intent of the quotas was

to exclude ‘new’ source countries from the immigration flow.9




9
 It must be said, however, that there was no quota on immigrants from south of the border, and Mexicans
poured over in very big numbers during the 1920s.


                                                   13
           Migration and Ethnic Diversity: The Second US Global Century




       Annual immigration to North America and Oceania rose gradually to the mid

1970s before surging to a million per year in the 1990s. The absolute numbers were by

then similar to those reached about a century earlier, but they were smaller relative to the

population and labor force that had to absorb them. Thus, the US annual immigration rate

fell from 11.6 per thousand in the 1900s to 0.4 per thousand in the 1940s, before rising

again to 4 immigrants per thousand in the 1990s. The proportion of the US population

foreign-born had fallen from a 1910 peak of almost 15 percent to an all-century low of

less than 5 percent in 1970. The postwar immigration boom increased the foreign-born

share to more than 8 percent in 1990 and more than 10 percent in 2000. Thus, it appears

that the US has reclaimed the title “a nation of immigrants” after a half-century retreat.

Has it also reclaimed the title “an ethnically diverse nation” after a half-century of

retreat?

       As this audience well knows, what happened to the United States after World War

II also happened world-wide (Table 3). The foreign-born share increased by about a third

in Oceania between 1965 and 2000 – from 14.4 to 19.1 percent, more than doubled in

North America – from 6 to 13 percent, and more than tripled in Europe – from 2.2 to 7.7

percent. Of course, the addition of undocumented immigrants would raise these foreign-

born shares, and perhaps even raise their increase over time. Illegal immigrants will also

raise the ethnic diversity measures, since they tend to be unskilled from the poorest

countries, individuals which host country immigration policy tries to keep out. Thus,

restrictive immigration policy tends to make the social problems associated with ethnic


                                             14
diversity even worse: the larger the share illegal, the bigger the ethnic distance between

and host country native-born norms.

        While world migration has surged, the labor market quality of these immigrants

(relative to native-born) has declined as their ethnic ‘distance’ from host country native-

born norms has increased. For example, US immigrant males earned 4.1 percent more than

native-born males in 1960, but they earned 16.3 percent less in 1990. The wage of

recently-arrived US immigrants (relative to the native-born) deteriorated by 24 percentage

points between 1960 and 1990. Although the average educational attainment of US

immigrants improved, it did not increase as rapidly as that of the native-born. The

percentage of newly-arrived US immigrants with less that 12 years education was 5.6

percentage points higher than native-born in 1970, but 20.4 percentage points higher in

1990, an increase of almost four times. Most of this decline in immigrant relative quality is

due to changes in the source country composition (Table 4), and, of course, the same is

true of the rise in ethnic diversity. I think it is important to stress the coincident fall in

immigrant quality and the rise in ethnic diversity in the recent half-century since that

combination contributed dramatically to anti-immigration sentiment a century ago. In any

case, both trends have been driven by four massive shifts in world migration patterns over

the half century since World War II.

        The first shift involved Europe’s decline as an emigrant source. Part of this drop

can be explained by the resurgence of migration within Europe (including Turkey): foreign

European nationals increased from 1.3 percent of the western European population in 1950

to 10.3 percent in 2000. The rise would have been even higher if it included the foreign-

born that became naturalized. More recently, western and southern Europe have become



                                               15
destinations for immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and since the demise of

the Soviet Union in the 1990s western Europe has also absorbed immigrants from the east

including the former Soviet republics. As a result, annual net immigration into the

European Union (EU) has soared since the 1980s such that it now surpasses that of the US,

and it would exceed it by even more if illegal immigrants were included.

       The second shift involved emigration from Eastern Europe. This traditional east-

west European flow has a long history, but it was stopped cold by postwar emigration

policy in the centrally planned economies. Things changed dramatically in the 1980s

when Poland and Romania opened up, and they changed even more dramatically when

the Berlin Wall fell in November of 1989. Emigration from these transition economies

increased by five times between 1985 and 1989. The annual outflow stayed at levels

exceeding a million until 1993, when they eased off a bit. In any case, Europe seems to

have re-established its old east-west migration tradition.

       The third shift involved the transformation of Latin America from a major

emigrant destination to a major immigrant source. The emigrant life cycle leads us to

expect that poor, low-wage and agrarian countries should send out more emigrants as

they industrialize, but at some point they should start to retain their own and receive

immigrants as they get fully industrial and high-wage. Latin America is an exception to

the rule: it went from hosting (net) 1.8 million foreign-born in 1960, to having (net) 1.8

million of their own hosted abroad in 1980. The explanation for this unique regime

switch appears to be that Latin America has a much richer and faster growing northern

neighbor close by.




                                             16
       The fourth shift during the post-war decades involved Asian, African and Middle

Eastern immigrants, whose numbers rose from a negligible to a huge flow. This evolution

repeats the emigration life cycle experience of the first global century. Early

industrializations and demographic transitions unleash a surge of emigration as the

migration poverty trap is unlocked. Thus, the East Asian miracle first fostered an

emigration surge, the rate of rise then slowed down, peaked, and subsequently declined as

modern development ensued. The Middle East pattern has been delayed, as has been its

development. The African pattern has been delayed even longer, as its growth over the

past half century has been so disappointing.

       Before moving on to the evolution of the RQ index since 1965, I want to stress

the role of host country immigration policy. To repeat, in the first global century shifts in

the source country composition were the result of the spread of the industrial revolution,

rising incomes and demographic transitions in the poorer and more distant parts of

Europe. That is, demographic booms and early industrial revolutions generated a surge in

emigration from ethnically different countries, while demographic busts and mature

industrial revolutions generated a fall in emigration from ethnically similar countries.

Falling transport costs between sending and receiving regions amplified these forces, as

did the friends and relatives effect. These forces also slowly reduced positive selection:

the really poor could finance the move only late in the first global century, as their

incomes at home rose and as the cost of passage fell. Exactly the same forces have also

been at work in the modern era although policy has served to strengthen them. In the US,

these included the abolition in 1965 of the country-of-origin quotas (and Asian bans) that

had previously favored Europe, the shift to a worldwide quota, and the emphasis on




                                               17
family reunification as a key criteria for admission. Other OECD countries also leveled

the source-country playing field, but the effects on immigrant composition (and ethnic

diversity) were not quite as dramatic.

       Now consider US experience with ethnic diversity since 1970 as reported in Table

5. Note two important facts. In spite of all the debate about US immigration, the total

ethnic diversity index in 2004 had only recovered its 1940 level, and it is unlikely that

future levels will recover the peaks attained in the first third of the 20th century (see Table

2). The big surprise is that all of the rise in total US ethnic diversity since 1970 has been

due to rising immigration rates and FB shares. None of the rise has been due to greater

ethnic diversity among the foreign-born since the within RQ has not risen over the past

35 years. The surge in immigrants from East Asia and Latin America, then eastern

Europe and the Middle East, then South Asia, and finally Africa has not left its mark on

aggregate foreign-born diversity since each of those new sources simply replaced old

sources.

       While very few EU countries supply long time series on country-of-birth, three

Scandinavian countries do and they are presented in Table 6. They confirm the US trends.

Namely, total migrant diversity has risen since 1970 in Denmark, Norway and Sweden,

but the rise has been driven entirely by increasing FB shares. As with the US, diversity

among the foreign-born themselves has actually fallen over time.




                                              18
                         Which Countries Are the Most Diverse?



        Most countries do not report country of birth data, but it is available for eleven

industrial countries in 2001 plus France for 1990. Table 7 summarizes the data for all

three RQ measures.

        The total migrant ethnic diversity measure is highest by far for Australia (0.598)

and Canada (0.518), well above the unweighted average of the twelve (0.319). Both

Australia and Canada recorded a total RQ index above that which the United States

recorded in 1910 at the height of the free mass migration period (Table 2: 0.482). To the

extent that observers at that time felt that immigrant assimilation problems were

sufficiently difficult to warrant the restrictions passed in 1917 and the 1920s, it is all the

more surprising that Australia and Canada have done so well on that front. Those

immigrant countries with moderate total ethnic diversity levels in 2001 are Austria

(0.405), Ireland (0.358), the Netherlands (0.347), France (0.343) and the United States

(0.319). These figures are roughly comparable to those recorded by the US in 1930 and

1940 (Table 7: 0.385 and 0.327) after the quotas were in place and after the great

depression. The big surprise here, given all the rhetoric about the US being a nation of

immigrants, is that the US figure is at the bottom of the list of moderates, exactly the

average of the twelve. The lowest total ethnic diversity levels are recorded for Denmark

(0.208), Finland (0.111), Norway (0.149), Sweden (0.193) and, surprisingly, the United

Kingdom (0.285).

        The within migrant diversity range is much lower across these twelve. Still,

Australia (0.671), Austria (0.761), Denmark (0.622), Finland (0.729), France (0.688),



                                              19
Sweden (0.658) and the US (0.683) all recorded very high diversity among the

immigrants themselves. Furthermore, six of these seven countries, the exception being

Denmark, recorded a higher within RQ figure than did the US in 1910 (Table 7: 0.635),

including the US itself. The other five – Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and

the UK – all had lower diversity among the immigrants themselves, but not all that lower

than the US 1910 figure. The interesting question is how much of this variance is

explained by policy, and how much by the standard variables that explain migrant

destination choice.

       The much wider range on between RQ – driven by the foreign-born share – can be

explained, one supposes, mostly by policy. Except for Australia and Canada, these

countries had in 2001 (and France in 1990) lower between RQ figures than did the US

under unrestricted immigration in 1910 (Table 7: 0.508).




                  Two Concluding Words about the Research Agenda




       My motivation in this paper is to offer measures of migrant diversity that are

comparable across countries and over time, so that they can be used to assess its impact

of public attitudes towards immigrants. To that extent, this paper offers only the first step.

It seems to me that there are two more steps to be taken before the political economy

analysis can begin in earnest. First, our migrant diversity measure must be made richer by

assigning the language, religion and other cultural attributes of source countries to

foreign-born by country of birth. By so doing, it will attach weights to migrants by source




                                             20
given the cultural ‘distance’ they are from the native-born. Second, late 19th century

migration backlash was driven by the interaction of rising migrant numbers (between

RQ), with migrant diversity (within RQ) and the level of skill. Those with low skills

(below the skills of the native-born median voter) -- controlling for the other two

dimensions – appeared to face more difficult assimilation problems. To see whether the

same thing is true today, we need to interact the migrant diversity index with measures of

skill by country of birth.
