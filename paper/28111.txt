The Inexorable Recoveries of US Unemployment

JEL No. E32,J64

                                        ABSTRACT

Unemployment recoveries in the US have been inexorable. It is a remarkable fact that, prior to
2020, after unemployment reached its peak in a recession, and a recovery began, the annual
reduction in the unemployment rate was stable at around 0.1 log points per year. The economy
seems to have an irresistible force toward restoring full employment. Unless another crisis
intervenes, unemployment continues to glide down to its minimum level of approximately 3.5
percentage points. The observed behavior of unemployment casts doubt on the common
assumption that there is a constant natural rate of unemployment around which unemployment
oscillates. Instead, the natural rate of unemployment during recoveries tracks actual
unemployment on its downward path.

   We undertake a close examination of the behavior of unemployment over the period from
1948 to 2019 using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that during this
period unemployment has shot upward 10 times as the economy has experienced economic
crises. Following a crisis, the unemployment rate glides downward on a predictable but
slow recovery path. In some cases, the path ends with unemployment still above its minimal
level, and in others, such as the longest recovery, from 2009 to February 2020, unemployment
reached 3.5 percent, which may be the current minimal level. Unemployment reached its
historical minimal level over the entire period in the early 1950s, at 2.5 percent.
   This paper is empirical, and we do not venture outside our sample data. We are not
informed about recoveries lasting longer than the one that ended in February 2020. We are
only partly informed about the current recovery following the pandemic crisis of the spring of
2020. Further, we do not enter the thicket of general equilibrium models or Phillips curves.
Rather, we study the behavior of unemployment in completed recoveries recorded in the
CPS. After documenting a regularity of the process, we discuss implications for inferring the
path of the natural rate from the observed behavior of unemployment.
   We find that rather than vibrating around a fixed natural rate, the observed behavior
of unemployment comprises (1) occasional sharp upward movements in times of economic
crisis, and (2) an inexorable downward glide at a low but reliable proportional rate at all
other times. The glide continues until unemployment reaches a low barrier of approximately
3.5 percent or until another economic crisis interrupts the glide.
   We focus on recoveries. Our measurement starts in an economy that has been hit recently
by an adverse shock that triggered a recession. These shocks have heterogeneous sources.
The major recession that began in 1981 is generally viewed as the result of a sharp monetary
contraction, while the major recession that began at the end of 2007 got much of its strength
from the financial crisis of September 2008. This paper recognizes that the shocks that propel
unemployment sharply upward are heterogeneous. It is about the homogeneity of historical
recoveries.
   Figure 1 shows our main evidence. It displays the log of the unemployment rate during the
10 completed recoveries since 1948, with the recession spells of sharply rising unemployment
left blank. The key fact about recoveries is apparent in the figure: Unemployment declines
smoothly but slowly throughout most recoveries most of the time, at close to the same
proportional rate. In the log plot, the recoveries appear as impressively close to straight
lines. In terms of levels rather than logs, this behavior implies that unemployment falls
in a year by one tenth of its level at the beginning of the year. For example, in a year
starting with 7 percent unemployment, the rate falls by 0.7 percentage points during the
year. We document this regularity within the two main statistical approaches to business-

cycle analysis and measurement: (1) construction of a chronology of turning points, and (2)
estimation of a Markov regime-switching model.
   Based on our findings, we discuss what can be learned about the natural rate of un-
employment from the observed behavior of unemployment during recoveries. We take the
non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) to be a synonym for the natural
rate. It captures a key property of that rate: Times of stable inflation are times when the
unemployment rate is at its natural level. Most commentators have taken the natural rate to
follow a smooth, low-volatility path determined by demographics. In recoveries, by contrast,
we find that the natural rate follows the smoothly declining path of the actual rate.
   We cite work by Gal´
                      i, Smets and Wouters (2011) that finds an estimated path for the
natural rate with high volatility, tracking the actual unemployment rate, including during
recoveries. We also present simple non-parametric evidence of systematic cyclical movements
of the natural rate, closely tracking the observed rate during recoveries. We conclude that
our findings about the actual rate carry over closely to the natural rate. In other words,
recoveries are times when the gap between the actual unemployment rate and the natural
rate is small. We do not take a position on the gap during contractions when unemployment
is rising rapidly.
   As we write, the United States and the world are in the throes of a major pandemic and
resulting deep slump. The recovery of the US unemployment rate has been vastly speedier
so far than its low historical value, dropping from its maximum of 14.7 percent in April to

                                                                      4
6.9 percent in October. In a separate paper (Hall and Kudlyak (2020a)), we discuss how
recalls of a completely unprecedented volume of unemployed individuals to their existing
jobs accounts for the highly unusual rate of decline of unemployment, and why it is likely
that the normal pattern of low but reliable decline of unemployment will resume once those
individuals are back at work. Also see Fujita and Moscarini (2017) on recalls in general and
Gregory, Menzio and Wiczer (2020) on the role of recalls in the recovery from the pandemic.
   We are not the first to study the time-series properties of US unemployment. The basic
asymmetry between the sharp rise of unemployment in contractions and the slow pace of
expansions is well known, and studied carefully with new results and a thorough discussion
of the earlier literature in Dupraz, Nakamura and Steinsson (2019). We note that a well-
documented property of the unemployment rate--most recently confirmed by Dupraz and
co-authors--is that unemployment rises rapidly in response to a significant aggregate adverse
shock and then gradually recovers to a level of 3 to 5 percent of the labor force. Like fuel
prices, unemployment rises like a rocket and falls like a feather. Our addition to this literature
is our demonstration of the astonishing reliability of the recovery process. We measure the
rate of recovery of unemployment from recession-highs and demonstrate how uniform the
rate is. Based on our findings, we discuss what can be learned about the natural rate of
unemployment.
   In a separate paper (Hall and Kudlyak (2020b)), we point out the puzzle of slow decline
of unemployment in recoveries. Initially pointed out by Cole and Rogerson (1999), the puzzle
is that unemployment declines much slower than the measured individual job finding rates
would seem to indicate. In that paper, we also discuss models in the Diamond-Mortensen-
Pissarides tradition that can account for this observation.
    Recently, the Federal Reserve Board announced that, in future expansions, policy would
not lean against a glide path that brought unemployment below 4 percent until there were
clear signs of rising inflation (Powell (2020)). The Fed's new policy of not resisting the
downward glide in unemployment during periods of calm is consistent with our conclusions.


1     Business Cycle Measurement
1.1    Our measure of the business cycle
To study recoveries, we need a measure of the business cycle. Romer and Romer (2019)
discuss cycle measures in detail. They conclude that the preferred defining characteristic of
the measure is its ability to capture unused resources. In current business-cycle research,
the primary alternative definition is to extract a higher-frequency component from real GDP
or other output measure. That component is the higher-frequency series from the Hodrick-

                                                5
Prescott or other bandpass filter. We agree with the Romers that tying the business cycle
to unused resources is conceptually superior to tying it to higher-frequency movements.
    Our view further adopts the Romers' conclusion that the unemployment rate, or a mea-
sure derived from the unemployment data from the Current Population Survey, is the best
available measure of the cycle. The unemployment rate appears to contain almost no move-
ments associated with productivity or similar forces that would call for filtering out. A mod-
est slow-moving demographic component of the unemployment rate is present--see Hornstein
and Kudlyak (2019) and Crump, Eusepi, Giannoni and Sahin (2019).

1.2    Econometrics of business-cycle measurement
We treat log-unemployment as the sum of a latent trend component and a latent stationary
component capturing survey sampling errors and other deviations from the trend. In a crisis,
the trend is fairly sharply upward. During a recovery, the trend is modestly downward. Our
objective is to measure the central tendency and dispersion of the rate of decline of the latent
systematic component of the monthly change of log-unemployment rate during recoveries.
   We consider the general class of models

                                         f (ut ) = xt + t ,                                 (1)

where f (·) is a monotonic transformation, xt is the systematic trend component capturing
the business cycle, and   t   is the random unsystematic component, taken to be uncorrelated
with xt . The model for xt describes the random arrival of peaks and troughs with linear
paths connecting these turning points. We use the log transformation because it fits the data
quite a bit better than a model where the level of unemployment is the dependent variable.
In Figure 1, the implied linearity of the recovery paths of log unemployment is quite clearly
confirmed.
   In the specification with log ut on the left-hand side, the slope with respect to xt is mea-
sured in log points, that is, percent changes in unemployment per unit of x. Where possible,
we avoid stating the results in the potentially confusing terms of percents of percents, but
that is the actual implication of the specification. We use the term log points and state them
as decimals. For example, a typical finding is that unemployment declines during a recovery
by 0.1 log points per year, which is 0.7 percentage points if the unemployment rate starts at
7 percent of the labor force.
   The literature has focused on two general classes of specifications for the systematic
component. One is chronology-based and proceeds by assigning turning points--dates when
recessions end and recoveries begin and dates when recoveries end and recessions begin.


                                                 6
Chronologies are available from published sources, notably the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research, which identifies monthly dates of turning points in a latent measure called
economic activity. They can be created for a particular time series, such as the unemploy-
ment rate, as an exercise in human pattern recognition. And chronologies can be created by
algorithms, such as the one described in Dupraz et al. (2019).
   Given a chronology, one can approximate the systematic component xt by interpolating
between the turning points and measuring the noise t as the residual between log ut and xt .
The systematic trend component xt is a smooth function of t. We take it to be a straight
line between the turning points of the series, so xt has equal increments over time, between
the turning points. Overall, the trend component is a linear spline.
   The other class of models focuses on regime switching, where the systematic component
modeled as a statistical time series that obeys one model in contractions and another in
recessions. Hamilton (1989) launched the econometric literature on Markov-switching models
in this class.
    The key difference between these classes is that turning points are latent unobserved
events in regime-switching models. The models yield a probability that a given month is a
turning point, not an unambiguous turning-point date.


2     Estimation Methods
2.1     Estimation based on chronologies
We consider three monthly business-cycle chronologies:

    1. NBER: The chronology maintained by the National Bureau of Economic Research
      identifying turning points in economic activity, as described in detail at NBER.org

    2. DNS: The chronology produced by the DNS algorithm based on US unemployment
      from January 1948 through February 2020, with size parameter 1.5

    3. HK: The chronology produced by the authors based on observed business cycle peaks
      and troughs, using the same data as DNS

    DNS developed an algorithm that maps a time series into another time series taking
on three discrete values: trough, peak, and neither. For unemployment, most months are
classified as neither a trough nor a peak, but rather a continuation of a previous trend.
The DNS algorithm is based on judgment about how to extract turning points from time-
series data, but its application banishes human judgment from the actual determination. The
algorithm is a filter that applies prior beliefs embodied in the algorithm to determine turning

points. Because the algorithm makes it cheap to extract a chronology from hypothetical data,
and because it is a function, producing a single chronology from any particular input, it is a
suitable basis for experimenting with the use of a chronology in a situation where noise partly
obscures an underlying true chronology. We have subjected the algorithm to thousands of
experimental paths of unemployment in this endeavor.
   Our procedure (HK) delivers turning points similar to the DNS algorithm. However,
we pick the latest points for peaks and troughs, consistently with our definition of the
recovery. The results based on the HK chronology are quite similar to those based on the
DNS chronology.
   Figure 2 shows the three chronologies. One disagreement is immediately apparent--the
NBER chronology has a recovery beginning in July 1980 and ending 12 months later in
July 1981. There is no comparable recovery in the other chronologies. In general, DNS
and HK are similar to one another and differ from NBER. The reason is that DNS and HK
are chronologies for unemployment alone, while NBER is a chronology for latent economic
activity. For the dates in the table starting with January 1980, NBER.org has published
explanations of the various indicators that form the basis for the determination of the dates.




                                                     8
   We measure the recovery rate as the average annual decline in log unemployment over
the entire set of recoveries and over individual recoveries. Although the mean is the natural
estimator irrespective of the time-series process of the shocks , the process does matter for
the standard error of the sample mean.
   Given a recovery running from an initial high point of unemployment, which we number
as zero, to the following low point, which we number as T , our model for a single recovery is

                              12(log uT - log u0 ) = - T +      T.                        (2)

We include the 12 so that the recovery rate  is in log points per year. We use the estimator

                                 ^ = - 12(log uT - log u0 ) .
                                                                                          (3)
                                                T
We use a modified bootstrap procedure, described later in the paper, to approximate the
sampling distribution of ^.


2.2    Estimation using the Hidden Markov Approach
Our second approach to modeling business cycles posits the same basic cyclical structure,

                                       log ut = xt + t ,                                  (4)

where xt is unobserved, but hypothesized to be piecewise linear, with switching between
positive and negatively sloped segments at random, according to a Markov process. Under
the assumption that the disturbance is a random walk,  t = t , with t being white noise,
the model becomes
                                      log ut = i + t .                                    (5)

The monthly increment, i , i  {1, 2}, shifts back and forth between i = 1 for recessions
and i = 2 for recoveries. We focus on 2 , the log-decline in unemployment during recoveries.
James Hamilton pioneered the econometric analysis of this class of models. He derived the
likelihood function in a computationally convenient form (Hamilton (1989)).
   We note that the assumption that       is a random walk is essential to our application of
the hidden Markov model. We need the assumption to justify taking first-differences, which
has the effect of isolating i on the right-hand side of the equation. This step also puts
the iid innovation t on the right-hand side, a property that is the starting point for the
regime-change class of models. However, we know that       has a high AR(1) parameter  but
somewhat less than one. Thus first-differencing does not yield the true innovation  , but

    Because Hamilton's approach is an application of maximum likelihood, the information
matrix is the basis of an estimator of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. But
this principle only applies in the absence of specification error. Our application involves the
specification error just mentioned. Consequently, we estimate the model as if were a random
walk, and then validate the estimator by bootstrap. Marcelo Perlin provided the Matlab
package for estimating hidden Markov models that we used (Perlin (2015)). Our validation
efforts supported the accuracy of the results of his package but found that the standard error
from the information matrix was considerably smaller than from the bootstrap. We report
both.

2.3     Sampling distributions of the estimators of the recovery rate
We use a modified bootstrap procedure to approximate the sampling distribution of the
estimates of the recovery rate and its standard deviation across recoveries. We resample
the innovations  from the HK chronology, form the AR(1) values of the disturbances using
 = 0.92, and construct simulated chronologies using the transition probabilities from the
HK chronology. Next we calculate a time series of corresponding values of the unemployment
rate as the sum of the calculated disturbances and the fitted values from the HK chronology.
We then pass the simulated unemployment numbers through the DNS chronology software.
Using the resulting chronology, we calculate the recovery rates by recovery and the averages
for the full sample and the later sample. We also re-estimate the hidden-Markov model. We
repeat the process 10,000 times for the chronology-based estimates and 500 times for the
hidden Markov calculations, which are much more computationally intensive.
   This procedure captures the variation in the estimates arising from the disturbances,
from the randomness of the underlying constructed chronology, and from the blurring of
the chronology from the added disturbances. It understates the resulting standard errors on
account of omitting the variation arising from the estimation of  and from estimating the
transition probabilities. We believe the understatement is small.

indexed by r. The upper panel covers the entire sample period, from October 1949 through
February 2020. The left three columns show the recovery rate  in log points per year using
the chronology approach, along with the standard deviation of the recovery rate, both with
bootstrap standard errors.
    For the NBER chronology with the full sample, the decline rate pooled across recoveries
is estimated as 0.087. Recovery rates for the DNS and HK chronologies are similar to
each other and are well above the NBER level, at 0.129 and 0.132. The DNS and HK
chronologies, constructed from unemployment alone, are more successful at capturing the
movements of unemployment during recoveries because they are better synchronized with
the actual movements. Of course, DNS and HK would be correspondingly poorer at tracking
economic activity, the concept behind the NBER chronology.
   We illustrate the interpretation of the annual decline figures in the table with an example
from the recovery rates based on the NBER chronology. Consider the situation just after a

                                                                11
severe recession, with the unemployment rate starting at 10 percent. The expected unem-
ployment rate a year later is 10 exp(­0.087) = 9.2 percent. With the higher recovery rate
based on DNS, the rate a year later would be 8.8 percent, essentially the same as with the
HK chronology. According to the DNS rate, starting from 6 percent, the unemployment rate
a year later would be 5.3 percent.
    The recovery rates for the sample running from May 1961 through February 2020, shown
in the lower panel of Table 1, are somewhat lower, because, as shown in Figure 3, the first
three recoveries in the full sample had substantially higher recovery rates than did any of
the later recoveries.

3.2    Estimates by recovery
Figure 3 shows the results of estimating each of the 10 recoveries in the HK chronology
separately. The separate rates from 1961 onward cluster close to 0.10. Over that 60-year
period, with 7 recessions and recoveries, some mild and two quite severe, the recovery rates
are remarkably similar. Table 1 summarizes this finding in terms of the standard deviations
across either the 10 recoveries of the full sample or the 7 recoveries of the later sample.
   The standard deviations across the individual recoveries over the full sample, shown
in the upper panel, are all around 0.08 with standard errors around 0.12. As the figure
shows, the first three recoveries have rather higher recovery rates than the later seven. The
hypothesis of equality, that is, a standard deviation of zero, is easily not rejected, but the
confidence interval is fairly wide, for all three chronologies. On the other hand, the standard
deviations of the seven later recoveries have point estimates of 0.025 or under confirming
the visual evidence of the figure. And the confidence intervals, constructed with standard
errors of 0.39 or 0.38, are tight. These results nail down the primary thesis of our study--the
uniformity of recovery rates over the past 60 years.
   Why is there a widespread impression that the recovery from the 2007 recession and
financial crisis of 2008 was slower than previous recoveries? The answer is that recoveries
tend to be judged in terms of output. Both actual growth of real GDP and growth of
potential GDP were lower for a number of reasons, including especially the decline in the
rate of productivity growth--see Fernald, Hall, Stock and Watson (2017). The facts are that
output growth was substandard during the recovery but the decline in unemployment was
at the normal rate for recoveries after 1960.

                                   Figure 3: Estimated Recovery Rates by Recovery

3.3    Recovery rates by demographic group
We repeated the chronology-based estimation for the unemployment rates of four different
demographic groups, using the DNS chronology function and the post-1959 sample. Recovery
rates are, for young people (age 16 to 25), 0.091; women (age 16+), 0.095; non-white (age
16+), 0.110; prime age (25 through 64), 0.125; total (age 16+), 0.106, as in the lower
panel and DNS column of Table 1. The uniformity across demographic groups confirms the
robustness of our findings and conclusions.

3.4    Results for the hidden Markov approach
The column of Table 1 labeled Hidden Markov shows results from estimating the hidden
Markov model using the full sample and the sample starting in 1961. For the full sample,
the estimated recovery rate is 0.066, well below the earlier results for the chronology-based
estimates, especially in the case of DNS and HK. Estimates for the post-1960 sample are
closer, at 0.070 for hidden-Markov and 0.103 for DNS. The NBER estimate concurs with the
hidden-Markov one, but we have good reason to believe that it is downward biased relative
to estimates that are based only on the unemployment rate, which include hidden-Markov.




                                                                 13
3.5    Comparison of the two approaches
In the lower right-hand corner of both panels of Table 1, we report the difference between
the HK variant of the chronology-based estimate of the pooled recovery rate and the hidden-
Markov-based estimate. Below each estimate, we give the bootstrap standard error of the
difference, based on the difference in 500 replications of the bootstrap simulations. In both
cases, we reject the hypothesis that the difference arises from sampling variation alone. The
rejection is stronger for the full sample than for the later sample.
    One reason for the disagreement between the two estimators is that the theory of the
application of the hidden-Markov setup to our problem requires the assumption that the
disturbance is a random walk, whereas it is actually an AR(1) process with coefficient
somewhat less than one. The disagreement between the information-matrix estimate of
the hidden-Markov standard error and the bootstrap may also result from this conflict.
    The chronology-based estimator can be considered an application of Bayesian thinking,
in that it imposes prior beliefs about the process. The posterior, so to speak, may involve
a higher implied value of the recovery rate because the prior belief pushes the likelihood in
that direction.
    In any case, the two statistical approaches agree that the basic structure that they share
is supported in the data. It really is true and not the result of an optical illusion that
unemployment rises rapidly and then declines slowly and uniformly over the business cycle.
Figure 4 shows how well the fitted value from the HK estimation with different recovery
rates for each recovery (those shown in Figure 3) fits the data. The R2 of the fit is 0.91.


4     The Natural Rate of Unemployment
Milton Friedman introduced the natural rate of unemployment (Friedman (1968)), a con-
cept that came to dominate macroeconomics under that name or its synonym, the non-
accelerating inflation rate of unemployment rate or NAIRU. Friedman's analysis implies
that years of stable inflation are years when the unemployment rate is at its natural level.

4.1    Inferring the natural rate of unemployment from periods of
       stable inflation
Figure 5 takes a non-parametric, minimal-assumption approach to inferring the natural rate
of unemployment. The dots in the figure identify calendar quarters when the acceleration of
the GDP price deflator is within a narrow band around zero. To identify those quarters, we
first form the inflation rate in the normal way as the percentage increase of the index in one

quarter over its value 4 quarters earlier. Using the 4-quarter span dramatically reduces the
role of transitory influences. Second, we calculate acceleration as the 4-quarter change in the
inflation rate. Finally, a quarter has price-level acceleration close to zero, and appears as a
dot in the figure, if the absolute value of its acceleration is less than 0.20 percentage points.
   In the most recent recovery, there were 7 quarters of stable inflation by our measure. In
the first four, unemployment was high--well above the five-percent level of most estimates
of the natural rate based on demographics, which we discuss below. The figure shows that
quite a wide range of unemployment levels are identified as time-specific values of the natural
rate of employment, but no value above 8 percent received that designation.

4.2    Existing evidence that the natural rate of unemployment closely
       tracks the actual rate during recoveries
A large literature has developed that tracks the evolution of the natural rate arising from
changes in the demographic composition of the unemployed. Estimates of the long-run de-
mographic trends in unemployment are often taken as the estimate of the natural rate. For
example, the Congressional Budget Office maintains estimates of the path of the natural
rate which show it rising gradually to a maximum in the 1970s, on account of a bulge of
young workers more prone to unemployment, then declining as that cohort aged and enjoyed
lower unemployment. Recent estimates of the long-run demographic trend in unemploy-

ment are available from Crump et al. (2019), Hornstein and Kudlyak (2019), Barnichon and
Mesters (2018) and Barnichon and Matthes (2017). These recent studies and their numerous
predecessors consider only demographic change.
   Capturing the other forces that affect the natural rate of unemployment is a challenge. In
principle, if we knew the slope of the Phillips curve, we could back out the implied natural
rate from the observed relation between inflation and unemployment. Few investigators
have attempted this approach, because they need outside evidence on the natural rate to
identify the slope of the Phillips curve. Studies of the Phillips curve often use a smooth, low-
volatility path determined by demographics as the natural rate. Recent influential studies of
the Phillips curve include Hazell, Herreno, Nakamura and Steinsson (2020), Jorgensen and
Lansing (2019), Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Stella and Stock (2013), Meier (2010),
Laubach (2001), Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997). Crump, Nekarda and Petrosky-Nadeau
(2020) surveys this literature.
   Gal´
      i et al. (2011) undertake the challenge of backing out the natural rate from an eco-
nomic model. That paper employs a New Keynesian model with a full sub-model that deals
explicitly with unemployment. It solves the model to find the implied value of the natural
rate. Figure 10 in that paper plots the calculated natural rate from 1965 through 2011. The
path of the natural rate is completely different from the paths calculated with demographic
adjustments. It does capture the bulge of unemployment in the 1970s, but it also rises


                                                                          16
substantially in harmony with actual unemployment, especially after the serious recessions
of 1981 and 2007-2009. The natural rate does not account for all of the cyclical movement
of actual unemployment--the gap between actual and natural unemployment accounts for
some of the cyclical movements. The authors reach their conclusion in the context of a
particular model that embodies many prior beliefs and parametric restrictions. But the
key conclusion is similar to the one reached from our non-parametric, minimal-assumption
approach in Figure 5.
     Stock and Watson (2010) present evidence consistent with our conclusion that, in recov-
eries, the natural rate follows the smoothly declining path of the actual rate. They show
that inflation takes a step downward early in a recession, but then remains unrelated to
unemployment changes as the business cycle progresses through recovery--see their Figure
2.
     A number of studies based on the Phillips curve note that there have been several in-
stances when large movements in the unemployment rate have coincided with small changes
in the inflation rate. Taking a smooth demographic trend as the measure of the natural
rate, the studies have invoked non-linearities in the Phillips curve where the coefficient on
the unemployment gap in recoveries is close to zero. These studies include Barnes and Olivei
(2003), Dotsey, Fujita and Stark (2018), Ashley and Verbrugge (2020), Doser, Nunes, Rao
and Sheremirov (2017), and Hooper, Mishkin and Sufi (2020). We view these studies as
performing a variety of parametric extensions, in the Phillips curve framework, of the facts
revealed in our Figure 5.

4.3     Takeaway about the natural behavior of unemployment
The most radical potential conclusion about the relation between the observed rate of un-
employment and the natural rate is that there is no difference--observed unemployment is
at its natural level all the time. This conclusion would cut the heart out of the Phillips curve
and the distinctive features of the New Keynesian model. It would deny unemployment any
role as a measure of inflationary pressure. That conclusion goes beyond the evidence, how-
ever. We have relatively few observations of stable inflation in times of rising or really high
unemployment. We believe that a reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that, during
long, slow, reliable recoveries with gradually declining unemployment, unemployment is at
the natural rate and is not a measure of inflationary pressure. Under those conditions, there
is no meaningful unemployment gap.




                                              17
5     Concluding Remarks
We have developed a parsimonious statistical model of the behavior of observed unemploy-
ment. It describes: (1) occasional sharp upward movements in unemployment in times of
economic crisis, and (2) an inexorable downward glide at a low but reliable proportional
rate at all other times. The glide continues until unemployment reaches approximately 3.5
percent or until another economic crisis interrupts the glide.
   Using the premise that times of stable inflation are times when the unemployment rate
is at its natural level, we use our findings on the observed behavior of the unemployment
rate to infer the behavior of the natural rate of unemployment. Our evidence from a simple
non-parametric exercise shows that instead of oscillating around a constant or slow-moving
time-varying trend, the natural rate follows the smoothly declining path of the actual rate
during recoveries. A similar conclusion follows from the general equilibrium model of Gal´
                                                                                         i
et al. (2011).
   As for policy, the Fed's new policy of not resisting the downward glide in unemployment
during periods of calm is consistent with our conclusions.
