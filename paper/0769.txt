                 Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration:
                          Prescriptions for the Blue Flu



                                     ABSTRACT



      This paper reveals that municipal police departments are much less
likely to strike in states that have collective bargaining laws than in
states with no police bargaining law or when police bargaining has been
outlawed. Unlike previous research which has used the state as the unit
of observation, this study examine.s the municipal level decision to strike
for a pooled cross—section of 2998 municipal police departments.
     Pooled cross—section estimates of this study reveal two important
relationships. First, municipalities in states that provide for collective
bargaining in any form experience significantly fewer police strikes than
do municipalities in environments where there is no law or where police
bargaining is specifically outlawed. Second, among states with duty—to—
bargain rights for police, those with compulsory arbitration provisions
experience significantly fewer strikes. Fixed—effect estimates that consider
strike probabilities of the same cities under different statutes qualifies
the first finding. Municipalities that experienced a change from a "no
law" environment to a bargaining law environment are less likely to experience
strikes while in the "no law" environment than are municipalities which
have always been in no law environments. However, fixed—effect estimates
confirm the finding that a compulsory arbitration provision significantly
reduces strike propensities. Interviews with representatives from cities
that experienced a police strike suggest that state agencies responsible
for the administration of arbitration mechanisms could help avoid strikes
by avoiding lengthy delays in the arbitration process after the expiration
of contracts.

          Strikes by public safety employees in the government sector inter-

  rupt vital services and may pose serious threts to life and property.

  To avoid such interruptions, state policy makers have enacted a wide range

 of regulations for the process that determines compensation and working

 conditions. Strikes by government employees with few exceptions are

 illegal in all   states   and for all occupational categories. Such regu-

 lations do not eliminate public sector strikes, as strikes by government

 employees have become more numerous over recent years reaching a historical

 high in 1978 with 481 strikes involving 193,700 workers. Other state

 laws provide for different degrees of collective bargaining rights for

 public employees and for various dispute resolution mechanisms sometimes

 including compulsory binding arbitration.

         How would one expect these various statutory provisions for bar-

 gaining rights and impasse procedures to affect the incidence of strikes

 by public employees? The institutional forces embodied in state bargaining

 laws could influence work stoppages in several ways. Environments with

collective bargaining may experience more industrial conflict than those

without statutory bargaining frameworks, with some control for the level

of union activity in other sectors of the environment, since collective

bargaining formally institutes a process which may increase the inter-

action of labor and management representatives and thereby increase the

opportunity for bringing up issues that are difficult to resolve.

        Conversely, despite increasing formal communication, a process

which increases the voice and participation of employees may tend to lessen

conflict by presenting opportunities for parties to work out issues with

a hrondcr perspective on possible solutions. Furthermore, by providing

for unit certification procedures, collective bargaining statutes could

reduce the likelihood of recognition strikes.

                                                               of the studies
mecrianisms has been studied extensively in recent years. Many

have focused on the impact of these statutory provisions on compensation

of public employees with particular emphasis on the effect of compulsory

arbitration.2' Yet, specifically for the case of arbitration statutes,

the intended effect of the statute is the avoidance of work stoppages

by providing for a binding resolution to impasses in negotiations short

of a strike. No study has presented a comprehensive test of the impact

of bargaining statutes and of other factors on public sector strikes.

This study seeks to fill this void by calculating estimates of the impact

of different bargaining laws across the fifty states on strike activity

for the occupation of police.

        The effects of collective bargaining laws on strikes have been

analyzed in rather misleading ways. For example, the Public Service

Research Council (PSRC) found that states that passed collective bargaining

laws experience an increase in the number of public employee strikes per

year after the passage of a collective bargaining law. This study does not

adequately address the existence of a similar time trend in strike activity
                                                      in the number of muni—
for states not passing bargaining laws, differences

cipaLitis across states, or differences in strike activity or bargaining

provisions for different occupational groups; still these shortcomings

do not prevent the PSRC from concluding "that compulsory collective

bargaining in the public sector causes an increase in strikes.. .and that

 a method other than compulsory collective bargaining for conducting employee—

 employer relations in the public sector would be in the public
                                                                interest."1

         Academic research has also been constrained by data availability,

 the most widely cited study to date (Burton and Krider, l975)' limited

 to aggregate state level data for the years prior to 1971. Since then

                                           strike frequencies across states
 other simple descriptive comparisons of
                           l979)' have been conducted. Yet much more sophis—
 (Wheeler, 1975; Kochan,
  tJcated research designs are needed to provide a definitive assessment

  of the effects of alternative laws on strikes6'      Specifically, to achieve

  such an assessment, the design should account for several important con-

  siderations. The design should allow for a comparison of strike ratios

 across environments where no law exists, and where different types of

 impasse procedures exist. To the extent possible, this comparison should

 go beyond a simple dichotomy such as law/no law or factfinding/arbitration.

 The design should also consider differences in the number of municipalities

 and thereby obtain a better control over the number of departments that

 could go on strike. The design should control for other municipal and

 state characteristics that could affect strike frequencies, while also

 considering the specific details of bargaining statutes for different

 occupational groups. Finally, one would want the design to maintain

 valuable time series features and examine the same municipalities in

 different statutory environments.

           This study is able to examine the impact of different bargaining

statutes on the municipal—level decision to strike by integrating all

occurrences of work stoppages for the years 1972, 1973, 1976, 1977 and
19/8 by municipal   police   departments into a pooled cross—section time

series data set of 2,998 municipalities. Furthermore, by examining thir-

teen states which legislated changes in the police bargaining statutes

in time   1/2Lo 1978   period, this study elaborates on pooled cross—section

estimates by examining the same municipalities but in different statutory

environments. To provide a better understanding of the àauses of police work

stoppages these two sets of empirical estimates are enhanced by inter-

views with union and municipal officials from the cities experiencing

wurk stoppages.

          Pooled cross—section estimates of this study reveal two important

rHationships. First, municipalities in states that provide for collective
bargaining in any form experience significantly fewer police strikes than

do municipalities in environments where there is no law or where police
                                               4


bargaining is specifically outlawed. Second, among states with duty—to—

bargain rights for police, those with compulsory arbitration provisions

experience significantly fewer strikes. Fixed—effect estimates that

consider strike probabilities ot the same cities under different statutes

qualifies the first finding. Municipalities that experienced a change

from a "no law" environment to a bargaining law environment are less likely

to experience strikes while in the "no law" environment than are muni-

cipalities which have always been in no law environments. Moreover, though

based on a limited number of observations, municipalities that switch from

a "no law" environment to a duty—to—bargain environment without arbitration

are more likely to experience police strikes in the duty—to—bargain en-

vironment. However, fixed—effect estimates confirm the finding that, among

cities that switched from duty—to—bargain environments without binding

arbitration to environments with arbitration, the arbitration provision sig-

nificantly reduces the strike propensities of those cities.   Interview

responses suggest that state agencies responsible for the administration

of arbitration mechanisms should try to avoid delays in the arbitration

process after the expiration of contracts in order to make this mechanism

as effective as possible in avoiding work stoppages.

        Ilie   remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section
U describes the municipal police data set. Section LII presents the models

used to estimate the hypothesized relationships. Section IV presents the

two sets of empirical estimates of determinants of strike frequency: pooled

cross—section estimates and "fixed effect" estimates that examine the same

citiesin different environments. Section V presents evidence gathered

about the cities experiencing strikes through interviews with labor and

management representatives from those cities. The final section summarizes
 the major   findings.

 II.    Data and IIypotheses

1.      Strike Activity

           Work stoppages among the municipal police departments in the national

sample of cities are measured according to information collected by the

Industrial Relations Unit of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

BLS Form 3006 contains data on work stoppages by occupational category

and level of government. Information for all municipal level work stop-

pages involving police were collected for the years 1972, 1973, 1976, 1977

and 1978. These work stoppages are analyzed along three dimensions——frequency,

duration, and breadth. The frequency of strike activity is determined

by the existence of a work stoppage for a given municipality. The duration

of the stoppage is taken directly from BLS Form 3006, while breadth is

measured by man—days idle which is calculated as the product of duration

and the tijumber of uniformed police officers. The nature of the data col-

lection process by the BLS virtually assures that no police work stoppage

in any city in the national data set is overlooked.7'

2. State Bagining Laws

          The major objective of this study is to gauge the impact that

different legal environments for collective bargaining have on the fre-

quency of police work stoppages. The variables constructed to measure the

leg;1   environment   take into accourLt two principal dimensions of these

laws——bargaining rights and impasse procedures. These bargaining environ-

ments have been defined by networks of state statutes, court opinions,

and opiilioris by state attorney generals.8'

          The most important right granted employees in a state bargaining

environment is the duty—to—bargain. Under such a bargaining right not

only is the public employer required to bargain with representatives of
                               —6—




employee organizations, but employees also have the right to form and join

an organization. Other state bargaining frameworks which permit bargaining

establish the legality of collective bargaining for covered employees.

However, under such frameworks employers are not obligated to participate

in the bargaining process. Other state frameworks establish the right

of employees or employee organizations to "meet and confer" with employers

or the right "to present proposals". In some state jurisdictions collective

bargaining for certain groups of public employees is explicitly illegal,

while in others the law is completely silent on the subject of public

employee bargaining rights.

        In states where the duty of employers to bargain with employee

organizations has been established, impasse procedures for resolving bar-

gaining conflicts have generally been instituted. Dispute resolution

mechanisms in this sector generally are perceived in a hierarchical fashion:

mediation, factfinding, voluntary binding arbitration, and compulsory

arbitration. These third party processes have a tendency of becoming

more formal and judicial in nature the closer they come to compulsory

arbitration in the hierarchical setting.

        in this study, four general classifications of collective bargaining

laws for police are considered. States with no specific provisions for

police cnl1ctive bargaining or states in which bargaining is explicitly illegal

form one category. In a second group are states which grant police labor orga—

nizations the right to present their views to employers regarding terms of em—

ploymeut, hut which fall short of a duty—to—bargain provision.   In the third

category are states which have a duty—to—bargain provision but no compulsory

arhitrrttion mechanism for resolving disputes. Finally, the fourth group is corn—

posed of states which not only have duty—to—bargain laws, but which provide for

compulsory arbitration as well. A complete list of the states and the categorization
                                     —1-P-




 of   their police bargaining laws according to this classification scheme

 is given in the Appendix.

           In formulating these four categories, a degree of subjectivity

 was used in selecting the criteria to differentiate among the state bar-

 gaining laws. States having no explicit law governing police collective

 bargaining are grouped with states in which bargaining is illegal. This

 is partly done in consideration of the historical development of state

 bargaining laws. Until 1958, no state had a municipal employee bargaining

 law and sentiment toward public employee bargaining, particularly for

public safety employees, was hostile. Viewed this way, the absence of a

specific state law is more correctly classified with laws specifically

outlawing police bargaining. A critical distinction between duty—to—bargain

and bargaining permitted provisions is that in the former class the choice

to bargain lies with the employee organization, while with the latter the

choice lies with the public employer. Compulsory binding arbitration within

a duty—to—bargain environment makes another significant change in the bar-

gaining process. In such an environment, police labor organizations need

not rely on the final consent of the public employer to determine the terms

and con(1iI ions of their employment, but rather a neutral third party has

power to arbitrate these contract terms.

          Since this study involves all fifty states, some potentially impor-

tant differences among bargaining statutes within a given category may be

overlooked. Maine's police bargaining statute, for example, does provide

for a degree of binding arbitration; however, the arbitrator's decision

is   only radvisory in regard to salaries and wages".1 Because of the nature
of   salaries and wages a a preeminent subject of bargaining, the Maine
statute   was classified with   duty—to—bargain states having no compulsory

arbitration.   Yet, the Maine   statute does possess an important feature

which   differentiates it   from the other states within that category. Like—
                                —8—



wise, among arbitration statutes, differences between types of arbitration

are overlooked; issue—by—issue arbitration, last—best offer arbitration,

and last—best offer package arbitration are all distinct versions of legis-

lated arbitration but are included wJthin the same category.

        Moreover, differences in state laws regarding strike penalties

are not captured. The New York statute penalizes striking public employees

two—for—one in pay (the loss of a day's pay for not working and an additional

penalty of a day's pay for striking illegally1), while Wisconsin fines

an employee ten dollars per day.1 Both these states are included in

the same hrbitration category. Penalties levied against police employee

organizations involved in a strike also vary within groups. Still, police

strikes (either by statutory language or court opinion) with rare exception

are treated as illegal. Despite these caveats, looking at all fifty states

does have a significant advantage in that the entire spectrum of attitudes

toward police bargaining are considered by examining categories of reasonably

similar forms of state legislation.

3.   Other Bargaining Status Variables

         The collective bargaining status of a municipality with its police

departnent s measured by a dummy variable for the presence of a written

labor contract. This variable is derived from responses to two questions

("does your city have a written labor contract covering wages, hours, and

conditiono 1)1 emplnymcnt for police personnel?" and "what year was the

first written labor contiact signed?") in a survey of municipal personnel

o1[ics by Freeman, Ichiiiowski, and Lauer.12/ It is assumed that cities

responding affirmatively to the first question have continually been party

to a po! fto contract since the date given in response to the second question.13/

Th absence of a contract could be an additional factor that could cause

a strike, as minicipal police officers seek the "recognition" embodied in

a written agreement. This contract variable will examine the possibility
                                 —9.-




 that these -"recognition" strikes are relatively more frequent.

         Also used in the analysis is a variable introduced in the Freeman,

 Ichniowski, and Lauer study which measures the police bargaining environ-

 ment in a state; that is the percentage of all municipalities in a state

 with police labor agreements. This variable is derived from 985 responses

 obtained from the above contract status survey.'4' As hypothesized in

 other research on bargaining statutes,' a high level of this percent

 contract variable may be the result of the passage of a bargaining statute.

 Because of this possibility of collinearity and a causal relationship

 between the law and percentage contract variable, strike frequency equations

will be estimated with and without the latter variable, since part of an

eftect attributable to percent contract may, in fact, be indirectly attri-

butable to the passage of a bargaining law.

4. State—level Control Variables

        Since the bargaining environment is defined along state boundaries,

it is important to control for other state—wide characteristics having an

effect on strike outcomes so that the state bargaining law does not sub—

stflute for the effects of other factors. The collective bargaining variable

(perrent-ige of cities in a state with a written labor agreement with their

police departments) is one such variable. Other state characteristics

used as controls include four geographic region dummy variables (Northeast,

North (:cntral, South, and West),16' the percentage of a state's nongri—

cultural work force who are public employees, and the percentage of the

noungrtcultural work force that is unionized. The latter two controls will

indicate how favorable is the climate toward unions intitiating work stop-

pages. A'so, high levels of unionism should correspond to higher area

wic-'s ad may increase the expectations about a reasonable wage increase.

This would again lead one to expect a positive relation between these

state unionism varinbles and strike activity. Specifically, one wants a
                                    -lu-



negative coefficient on a bargaining law variable in a strike activity equation

to represent more a dampening effect of the law on work stoppages and less

the effect of other state influences which tend to discourage public sector

union activity or militancy.

5. Municipal Level Control Variables

          Other explanatory variables included in this analysis are three

government type dummies (Council—Manager, Mayor—Council, and Commission),

a central city dummy, population, per capita income, total municipal revenue,

number of departmental employees, and maximum step salary for patroimen.1'

          Negative coefficients aie expected for the salary variable since

relatively low salaries should produce greater dissatisfaction among police

officers. In work stoppage equations, the effects of other municipal

level characteristics are less obvious in specifications which include

a police salary level control. For a given level of police compensation,

one might reasonably expect ability—to—pay measures to signal to police

employees unrealized potential wage gains; therefore, positive relationships

should be expected. However, one might expect negative coefficients on

these variables if wealthier communities can use revenues to avert strikes

in wvs other than by granting higher salaries, possibly through better

fringes not captured with the salary variable or by providing better equip—

mont or conditions. Central city status and population might also be

expected to   have   positive coefficients in strike equations with salary

controlled since police duties in urban or high population areas could

be more hazardous. Furthermore, for a municipality of a given population,

a larger department could signal a situation in which it is less likely

that aM enployee interests will be satisfied. In this case, one would

exrcc:t   positive   coefficients on department size. The government type

controls will investigate how differences in municipal government structure

afFect strike activity.
 III. Econometric Models

             In order to identify the correlates of strike activity among police,
                                                        S
 the    most appropriate unit of observation is the bargaining unit level at

 which the decision to strike occurs. Although multiple bargaining units

 do exist within a police department, particularly
                                                            distinguishing superior

 officers from patrolmen in large cities, this study uses the municipal

 police department as the unit of observation.

             To identify the determinants of strike frequency a logit model

 of the following form Is specified:


                                            1
                  P (STRIKE.) =                 ÷
                             1
                                     l+e i
where P(STRIKE.) =        the probability of a police work stoppage occuring
                                   .th
                          in the         municipality
                     = a vector of independent variables of the ith
       -*
and X.

                          municipality

The logit specification overcomes the difficulty that ordinary least squares

regression would have for modeling the binary strike outcome, as the OLS

technique produces inefficient estimates and predictions, possibly out-

side the 0—I range by forcing a normal structure on the error term. Since

no a pori reason exists for preferring the normal cumulative density

function to     that of   the logistic cumulative density function, no attempt

to supplement logit with probit analysis is made. Once            coefficients

are estimated, relative strike probabilities for an average city, differing

only on the bargaining law variable, will be calculated by evaluating the

logistic equation using the mean level of the control variables while

allowing the law dummies to vary.

            Since police strikes are extremely rare events, one would like

to extend the cross—section model given in the logistic equation by uti—

lizing the additional strike information across five years. A pooled
                               -12



cross—section sample using 206 cities for 1972 and 1973 and 862 cities for

1976, 1977, and 1978 is constructed. For the 1972 and 1973 portions of

the sample, 1973 levels of the control variables are used. For the 1976,

1977, and 1978 portions, 1978 levels of control variables are used.18/

For the salary control in 1972, 1976, and 1977, the salary level will be

a salary post—dating certain cities' strikes, so that the salary coefficient

in the strike equation may be distorted by potential impacts of strikes

on salaries in these years. For the bargaining statutes, variables will

reflect the actual environment in each of the five years.

        Despite the weakness of pooled cross—section analysis caused by

possibly inappropriate levels of certain independent variables in some

years, it does have many advantages. It provides additional data on rare

events. Furthermore, municipalities in any one year's cross—section may

not have equal conditional probabilities of striking in that year along

the dimension of an omitted variable, a multi—year contract.   If the multi—

year contracts that do exist do not expire in the same proportion across

the different bargaining environments in any given year and, as one would

expect, the probability of a work stoppage is less during the term of a

contract coefficients on bargaining statute dummy variables in a one

year cross—section equation will not accurately reflect the effect these

1a have on strikes. Municipalities not bargaining in one year should

bc engngl in bargaining during the time considered in the pooled sample.

        The issue which remains is that states with fewer written labor

agreements (most commonly the no bargaining law states) may tend more often

toward an annual salary determination process. To the extent that this

is truc, my positive coefficient on the no bargaining law variable should

bE   akcn as a signal of the salary determination process occuring more

often. This should increase the number of opportunities for police to
                                           -13-



  become disgruntled over the setting of salaries. However, this influence

  should not be viewed as reducing the validityof any law coefficients

  obtained from this analysis. The degree to which the different bargaining

  laws move the parties away from an annual salary determination process,

  is measured by the degree to which this method of reducing industrial

  conflict in this sector is promoted by different statutory bargaining

  environments.

             The pooled cross—section equations to be estimated make a sig-

 nificant methodological improvement in the study of the impact of bar-

 gaining laws on public sector strike activity by controlling for other

 observable state and municipal characteristics that could affect strike

 propensities. Still, there exist two very different explanations for

 any correlations between bargaining laws and strike propensities detected

 in the cross—section equations. One possibility is that the Institutional

 forces embodied in the statutes affect how likely a police department is

 to go on strike according to the arguments presented in the previous section.

Another very different possibility Is that the law—strike relation reflects

 selectivity in the passage of bargaining statutes, with states passing

bargaining laws differing from those without laws in unobserved charac-

teristics. For example, a negative relation between strikes and environ-

ments with bargaining laws may be due to collective bargaining laws reducing

the   proh-1)i   I ity 01   strikes.   Conversely, states that enact bargaining

statutes may be composed of cities that had already been less likely to

strike, so that the negative coefficients would indicate a grouping of

states with cities that were less prone to strike prior to the enactment

of a law.        (Parallel arguments can be made for arbitration—strike relation—

sli i ps)



            By taking advantage of the longitudinal component of the law variables,

a fixed effect model disentangles the two possible causes for a law—strike
                                    -j_1

relationship.      Fixed—effect logit equations cannot be estimated since the

maximum likelihood procedure will not converge for equations using cate-

gories for which there is no variance along tI'e dimension of the dependent

variable. Furthermore, the precise nature of the data set precludes

estimating a fixed effect model using an OLS "differencing from the mean"

procedure. As described above, when municipalities are pooled across the

years 1976, 1977, and 1978, the 1978 levels for the control variables

(other than for the bargaining environment variables) are used. Since 1973

levels o! the control variables are available for a much smaller number

of cities, there will be no variation in the level of most independent

variables for a majority of the municipalities in the sample. Because the

"differencing from the mean" procedure is not well—suited to this data

set, it    is   not possible to control completely for "omitted city—specific"

effects.

           However, by extending the four bargaining statute dummy variables

to reflect information on changes in bargaining statutes, one can specifically

control for those omitted city—characteristics that are correlated with

the passage of bargaining laws by comparing the likelihood of striking

for the nrne municipalities but in different statutory environments.

Over the seven year period examined in this study, states experienced the

following changes: no law to bargaining permitted, to duty—to—bargain and

to   arbitration.     Of particular interest will be comparisons of the "no law"

cnefflcftnts for states that never experienced a change in law status to "no

law" coefficients for states that did experience a law change. Also, special

attention will be given to the comparisons between the before and after

environments of states that switched to arbitration mechanisms during the

period ccmsidered in this study. While the inclusion of this more detailed

set of law variables in an OLS regression does not control for omitted city—

specific effects as rigorously as a "differencing from the mean" procedure,

 i will allow for the examination of selectivity bias in the passage of
 bargaining laws. Moreover, by including a set of law variables that des-

 cribes all possible law changes, the law variables are less constrained
                                               l9/
 than those used in a "differencing" procedure.


 IV. Empirical Results

         Table 1 presents a tabulation of strikes occurring under the dif-

 ferent statutory bargaining environments. For any of the five years,

 strikes were most frequent in the "no law" category. Furthermore, across

 all years, more strikes occurred in the no law category (60.5% of all

 strikes) than all other categories combined. Only 5 strikes, or 6.2%

 of all strikes took place in environments that provided for compulsory

 interest arbitration mechanisms. However, with the number of cities in

 the pooled cross—section sample as a divisor, the strike propensity

aning duty—to—bargain cities is of the same magnitude as it is among no

law cities. These proportions for arbitration and bargaining permitted

cities indicate much smaller strike propensities.

        To investigate this pattern in more detail and to discover to

wliit extent certain bargaining statutes can be thought to reduce the like-

lihood ni police strikes, more rigorous statistical tests are applied to

the daLa. Table 2 presents logit coefficients obtained from estimating

pnoied cross—section equations in which a number of other characteristics

which cn1 afiect strike probabilities are controlled. The results

ar clearS—cut, never affected by the addition of the possibly confounding

pPr(cnt contract variable. Across both the earlier years (1972 and 1973)

and the later years (1976, 1977, and 1978), the point estimates indicate

that cities in environments which provide for some form of collective

bargriiiiio experience fewer strikes than cities in environments outlawing

hugatning or with no provision for bargaining. The consistent ranking

indicates that among these three types of bargaining environments, cities

in states with arbitration are least likely to experience strikes, and

"duty—to—bargain" cities most likely of the three. While the logit co-

efficients on the "duty—to—bargain" law variables are not significant

at conventional levels for the earlier years, all other law coefficients

are significant. To interpret these coefficients in terms of strike

probabilities the column 2 equation is estimated at the mean for all charac-

teristics while allowing the law dummies to vary. This estimation yields

strike probabilities of .0025, .0271, and .0089 for arbitration, duty—

to—bargain and bargaining permitted cities respectively. The estimate

for no law cities is .0367 thr from two to fifteen times greater than the
                                                                            20 /

strike   prcbabilities for cities in states in the other law categories.

         To understand the degree to which the negative relationship

between the passage of bargaining laws and strike activity is causal in

nature, the more detailed set of law variables that describe all changes

in statutory environments is introduced into the analysis. To what degree

is the increase in the absolute value of the negative law coefficients

from the 1972—1973 sample to the 1976—1978 sample in Table 1 the result

of the movement of less strike prone cities from no law environments into

the various bargaining law environments? The law dummies listed in the

left hind column of Table 3 differentiate cities that were always in no

1.-iw environments from cities in no law environments but that moved into

another statutory environment. With 862 cities in the later year cross—

sections, and twelve cities from the earlier year cross—sections that are

nnt contained among the 862 cities, there are 874 distinct municipalities

in this data set. Column 1 of Table 3 gives the number of these cities

in each category, while columns 2 and 3 give the number of strikes and

strikes as     proportion of the 2998 city—year observations in each category.

CLties in "no law" environments through 1978 (line 1) account for all no

that eventually changed to a bargaining statute of some form (column 2 of

lines 2, 3, and 4), one observes no strikes in these cells.       An examination
                                                      S


of   these same cities in their later statutory environments (column 3 of

lines 2, 3, and 4) indicate that these same cities did not experience

strikes if the change was to bargaining permitted or arbitration environ-

ments. However, the cities described in line 3 exhibit greater strike

propensities following a change to a duty—to—bargain environment. Columns

4 and 5 present coefficients from an OLS regression
                                                          for the sample of cities

for which the initial year bargaining environment was no law. OLS point

estimates in column 4 indicate that no law cities that eventually moved

into bargaining law environments were less strike prone than other no

law cities.        In fact, the movement from no law to duty-to—bargain produces

a significant increase in strike activity for the same cities. These results,

while based on a limited number of observations in certain cells, indicate

that part of the negative relationship observed in bargaining law coefficients

in Table 1, is the result of a "selectivity" scenario in which states with

cities less prone to strikes under no law environments pass bargaining

legislation.

           \flen   one makes the same sort of comparisons between duty—to—bargain
environments with and without compulsory arbitration one arrives at a very

different ronciusion. The proportions in Column 3 indicate strike propen—

sitics fr it ins in citity—to—bargain environments for all seven years of

.(H,   (line     7) and .007 for cities in environments with arbitration (line 9).

Tracking    the    set of cities which moved from duty—to—bargain environments

without arbitration to environments with arbitration, one observes an

even greater reduction in strike probabilities (.084 in column 2 of line 8

aol .005    in   column 3 of line 8). The coefficients from the OLS regression

presented in columns 6 and 7 for the sample of city—years for which the

stntutory environcnt was arbitration by 1978 corroborate these results.

Arbitration coefficients, whether it is arbitration throughout the seven

 year period    or arbitration preceded by another environment, are all virtually

 identical in magnitude. For this set of coeficients, the only coefficient

significantly different from zero is a significantly positive coefficient

for cities with duty—to--bargain preceding arbitration (line 8, column 6).

Results for the entire 2,998 sample using the complete set of detailed law

variables are given in columns 8 and 9 and consistently reflect the above

patterns.

          While these results lend support to the argument that part of the

negative relationship for bargaining law coefficients discerned in the

cross—section estimates of Table 2 is due to states with less strike prone

cities passing bargaining laws, the impact of a compulsory arbitration

mechanism is unambiguous. Even among those cities moving from duty—to—

bargain environments without arbitration to environments with arbitration,

one observes a significant decrease in strike frequency consistent with

the earlier cross—section estimates. Compulsory arbitration provides an

effective dispute resolution mechanism to avoid strikes. However, a duty—

to—bargain provision without arbitration is in some ways a "half—way house"

which grants employees the right to bargain but is not necessarily coupled

with an effective means to settle contract disputes. The evidence suggests

that   strike   activity in states with a duty—to—bargain provision could be

reduced icnificantly providing for a compulsory arbitration mechanism.

V. Fe! ic Strikes — Evidence from Interviews

         The    sample of 81 strikes were also investigated separately. However,
quantitative estimates from equations which modeled strike duration as

a function of the array of independent variables yielded no significant

partial 'orrelatjons. This is consistent with the previous literature of

strkc activity which indicates that factors which explain one dimension

of strike activity well (frequency), do not generally provide much ex—

planatory power for other dimensions of strike activity (duration in days
                                    —'-

                21/
or man—days).         Part of the explanation for this is due to very little

variation in strike duration. Across all statutory environments, police

strikes are short. For the 81 strikes, the average duration was 6.1

days with 51% 3 days or less and 84% 9 days or less.

        Still, important questions remain about these 81 strikes. Most

obvious is that despite the consistency of the finding that compulsory

arbitration mechanisms reduce strike frequency, five municipal police

departments in such environments did strike during the period considered

in this study. What differentiates these departments, and what problems

in the bargaining relationship could the arbitration provision not over-

come? To answer such questions interviews with labor and management

representatives from the five cities with arbitration strikes were con-

ducted. Also interviewed were representatives from the municipalities

which experienced police strikes in any state in 1978. Compensation and

working conditions were of course issues in the majority of these strikes;

however, the interviews were intended to find out why the various processes

available for arriving at the terms and conditions of employment could

not avert work stoppages.

        ic)r the five police work stoppages in states with compulsory interest

nrbitration mechanisms, the most common reason cited by labor and manage—

mont representatives was the occurrence of lengthy delays in the dispute

resolution proccss and frustration over the length of time that had elapsed

since the expiration of t.he last contract. These delay related causes

wcrc cited for four of the five strikes. In one instance, a lack of con-

tinuity in the city's representative helped to cause the delay with the

city having seven city managers in the seven year period prior to the strike.

Fwthcrmore, this department, operating without a successor contract, felt

the management was in no hurry to reach a settlement because of a state

1o mandating a 3% cap on interest on back pay awards. In another instance,

the   strike   occurred over the first contract ever negotiated under the state's

arbitration law, and the parties' lack of famliarity with the system

helped to cause delays. Related to the problems of delays in the arbitration

system are unclear communications between negotiators or within a negotiating

team. In one case, a police union representative said the department's

attorney had misinformed union officials of the city's most recent contract

offer and this helped to induce the strike. In the situation involving

the turnover of seven city managers, communications channels were further

confused by the practice of union officials of lobbying the members of

the city council to transmit their bargaining proposals to the city manager.

In two cases, additional problems were caused by the attempt to gain the

recognition of a written agreement for the first time. In one of these

cases, a department for a small town of about 3,000 people, negotiators

were unfamiliar with the workings of the arbitration mechanism. In the

other case, involving a city of approximately 39,000 people, management

refused to recognize the employees' right to make use of the arbitration

procedure, relying instead on the long—standing practice of deciding the

terms of employment unilaterally in meetings between the mayor and police

chief

            For the other three statutory environments, representatives from

the 21 municipalities and their police departments which experienced strikes

in 1978 were contacted. Representatives of four of these 21 municipalities

would not respond to telephone or written inquiries, including three from

"no I aw"   environments and the only   1978 strike in a "bargaining permitted"

environment.

            For the three duty—to—bargain strikes, one was a sympathy strike
for a firefighters work stoppage; another was a protest of the demotion

of a police chief who then joined the rank—and—file police on the picket

line.    The final strike was specifically aimed at obtaining a contract
  provision providing for a local option to arbitrate future contract dis-

  putes. While the department was successful in securing this contract

  language, the local option to arbitrate contract disputes has not since

 been employed.

          For the fourteen "no law" strikes, six involved municipalities

 without written contracts and eight with contracts. In five of the six

 municipalities in which some form of bargaining had led in the past to

 written agreements, police representatives cited the absence of any pro-

 cedures to address impasses as forcing the strike to bring additional

 pressure to bear on the dispute. In five of the eight strikes in a no

 contract situation, representatives cited the desire of the police to

 obtain a written agreement as a major issue leading to the strike. The

 final reason listed in this category in Table 4 is political tension.

 While this factor is evident to some degree in many strikes, in two cases,

 it was given particular emphasis. In one case, the newly appointed police

 chief, a former marine corps general, was attempting to change department

procedures drastically, and a protest strike eventually occurred. In

another case, the police department's persistent difficulties with the mayor,

who had a penchant for tearing up tentative agreements in front of the

employees' representative, was a major cause of the strike.

VI. Conclusion

        The statutory bargaining environments under which police bargaining

is conduL ted have a significant impact on the likelihood that a municipal

police department will be engaged in work stoppages. Simple cross—section

estimates indicated that fewer police strikes occur in states with some

statutory provision for bargaining. Fixed—effect estimates revealed that

this roIionship is due to greater strike propensities for municipalities

in sLates that never enacted a bargaining law. Cities in "no law" environ-

ments that did enact a bargaining statute were less likely to experience

;t:rikes than cities in no law environments that never enacted any such pro—
visions. Furthermore, cities that did switch from no law environments to

duty—to—bargain environments without arbitration were significantly more

likely to experience strikes after the enactment of the duty—to—bargain

law.

          By providing for a compulsory binding arbitration mechanism to

resolve disputes over negotiations of police contracts, states reduce the

likelihood that their municipalities will experience police work stoppages.

ThIE   result is   especially clear in comparisons between duty—to--bargain

environm'nts   with and without arbitration provisions, and is borne out
in both the simple cross—section estimates and the estimates that        control

for    selectivity bias.   Based on   the less rigorous tests   in other research,

one    could reasonably extend this   finding to the occupation of firefighters.

Milwaukee    and New York City, which is subject to a special city—level
law and not the state law, provide the only examples where firefighters
have engaged in a work stoppage where a compulsory arbitration law existed.22/

           Questions remain to be answered. Precisely how costly are these

interruptions in essential services caused by work stoppages by public

safety employees in terms of the threat to lives and property?          What costs

are incurred in providing the administrative mechanisms for dispute reso—

lution ncjianisms? What are the incremental costs in providing art arbitration

mechanism where the dispute resolution procedures such as mediation and

frict firtcling already exist? It is clear that the sentiment of voters and

                                                                       In a 1980
tax payr toward public employees is changing significantly.

public referendum, Massachusetts voters followed the lead set by taxpayers

in California in passing a "tax—cap" provision. Moreover, the language

of Massachusetts' Proposition 2 1/2 included a rider for the repeal of its

compuloory arbitration mechanism for police and firefighters——the first

 si H 'Thniigo back from an environment with arbitration. It is clear that

 legislative debate will be influenced by a wide variety of economic and

 political factors. Still, legislators should have the benefit of the best

 evidence possible concerning the impacts that public employee bargaining
legislation are likely to have on outcomes as important as the interruption

of ssential protective services. Finally, while some evidence exists

on the impact of the bargaining provisions on other outcomes such as corn—

pensation,231it would be instructive to calculate the impact of such statu-

tory provisions on salaries, fringe benefits and work stoppages for the

same data set. In this way, one can see whether a dampening effect of
arbItration on strikes is obtained at the price of higher levels of corn—

pensation, or whether such a statutory provision is preferable over a

range of industrial relations outcomes. Research with this data set is

in progress to obtain such estimates.

6/         Research in progress by Craig A. Olson, James L. Stern, Joyce

pations overcomes these problems to some extent. Their empirical tests

focus on   sx   states all with duty—to—bargain provisions, so that results

apl)iy only to a limited sample of states.

7/         Eugene Becker, Director of the Industrial Relations Unit of the

Bureau of Labor Statistic;, described the process of collecting work stoppage
data. This unit of the BLS tracks strikes through the Federal Mediation

and Conciliation Service, the Census of Governments, and a network of news-

paper clipping services. Because of the public attention given to police

strikes, Eugene Becker was confident that police strikes in any munici-

pality with a population over 10,000 are captured by a data collection

process which surveyed newspapers extensively. Since the only munici—

paflties with populations less than 10,000 are ones which submitted strike

forms to the BLS, it is unlikely that the strike variable is mismeasured

for the mur'icipalities in this data set. Among the 81 municipalities

experiencing police strikes, 16 had populations of less than the 1978

10,000 person lower limit that existed in the I.C.M.A. Municipal Yearbook

data. Still, simply entering these cities into the equations will con—

tarninate the results with an obvious effect of biasing the coefficient of

the population variable downward. In the econometric models to follow,

this problem is accounted for in two ways. First, a dummy variable is

added to the strike equation which assumes a value of one for cities with

less than 10,000 people. Second, cities of less than 10,000 are dropped

from the sample. In the latter case, results can be viewed strictly as

those for a sample truncated at populations of 10,000 so that results

only can be extended to the smallest communities with caution. For OLS

estimates for 1972 to 1978 pooled cross—section equations (equivalent

to the equation in column 2 of Table 2) all coefficients are virtually

unchanged from the truncated sample to the full sample with the less than

10,000 population dummy. While the population dummy attains the signifi-

cant positive coefCicient one would expect given this sampling procedure,

the coellicients on the population variable are —.023 in the truncated

snmpie and —.024 in the full sample both with standard errors of .009.

18/     In this data set, certain municipal level characteristics were

wi missing for 47 of the 862 observations in the large sample of cities.

19/       A "differencing from the mean"     procedure   would produce four law

change variables: a no change group; and three other groups for those

changing into bargaining permitted, into duty—to—bargain, and into arbitration.

In the differencing procedure, a city that remained arbitration throughout

would obtain the same value for the change—in—law variables as a city

that remained no law throughout (i.e., all change—in—law variables will

be zero). The more detailed set of law variables can differentiate between

such groJju. Also, with the more detailed set of law variables, one can

obtain a direct estimate of the difference between a city that changed

ft-cm a duty—to—bargain to an arbitration environment; whereas, with the

differencing procedure, the strike propensity of such a city would be

constrained to be the difference between the "change to duty—to—bargain"

ani   "change to arbitration" coefficients.
20/       Calculating the differences in strike probabilities for an "average

city"   bitt in different legal environments is suspect since characteristics
of 'iticc    vary significantly across   states in different bargaining environ-

ments; that is, the "average city" in the "no law" category is different

than the "average city" in the "arbitration" category. To compute how

much of the difference in    strike   propensities is attributable to differences

                            liv   trike—inriiicing rFiarncterintfrs acrnss en—
vironments, separate strike equations are estimated for cities in no law

environments and for cities in environments with some form of bargaining

law. When one evaluates the "bargaining law" strike equation using the

mean level of characteristics from cities in "no law" states, one estimates

a hypothetical strike probability of .010. While the two groups' strike

equations indicate that strikes in "no law" cities are over four times as

likely (predicted strike frequencies of .025 for "no law" cities and M0

for "bargaining law" cities), only 21% of the 1.9 percentage point dif-

ference can be attributed to differences in the characteristics of the

cities between the two different kinds of statutory environments.

         Separate strike equations were also estimated for the sample of

cities with and without written contracts. From information contained

in the BLS strike form, 48 strikes for recognition are identified and all

such strikes do in fact occur in the no contract sample. The number of

recognition strikes and the percentage of cities without contracts by law

category are: arbitration — 2 (of 5) and 4.3%; duty—to—bargain — 9 (of 20)

and 33.5%; bargaining permitted — 5 (of 7) and 33.5%; no law — 32 (of 49)

and 79.1%. Bargaining statute logit coefficients have the same rank order

in both -arn1es, but tend to be smaller in magnitude for the recognition

strikes in the no contract sample. For the law variables, the coefficients

from the no contract and contract samples respectively are: arbitration ——

—2.78 and —3.51; duty—to—bargain —— —.16 and —.42; and bargaining permitted ——
