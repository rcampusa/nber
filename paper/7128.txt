      Following monetary union with the west in June 1990, the employment rate for east German
18-54 year olds fell from 89% to 73% in six years. Early retirements caused a larger fall for 18-64
year olds, from 85% to 64%. These falls came about in the rst two years of transition, after
which employment and the employment rate stabilized but did not recover. This employment fall
is possibly the worst of any European transition economy. Yet, one might have expected the east
German transition to have been the swiftest and most successful. Thanks to uni cation with the
west, well{tested legal, industrial relations and political systems were immediately available, as
well as large transfers. These transfers have indeed cushioned the e ect of the employment loss,
and large real wage gains distinguish east German workers from their counterparts further east.
However, the low employment rate is a clear indicator that east Germany is not on the track to
economic eciency, and may even be caused by the rise in wages. In this paper I seek insight
into the problem by examining the determinants of transitions between non{employment and
employment, using the 1990{1996 survey years of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).          1




      Lower employment rates and economic eciency would not be incompatible if the reductions
in employment rates represented voluntary reductions and convergence with western norms. How-
ever, this does not appear to be the case. Of the population aged 18{54 in 1994{1996, 10% were
unemployed; that is, both searching and available for immediate work. A further 4% were available
for immediate work but not searching, possibly due to discouragement. These two groups account
mechanically for most of the fall in the employment rate. Further, the employment category in-
cludes the 4% of the population in public works jobs, as well as the bene ciaries of government
  1   The statistics cited in the introduction are from the sample{weighted GSOEP data.

                                                1
subsidies. The 3% of the population in government training programs are variously counted as
employed or not depending on their self{identi cation.
   The situation is more dramatic for women than for men. For 18-54 year olds, the female
employment rate fell by 4 percentage points more than the male rate, from 85% to 67%, and
the 1994{1996 unemployment to population ratio was 12% for women and 8% for men. 6% of
the female population was available for immediate work although not searching, compared to 3%
for men. These statistics suggest that if the labor market diculties of women could be reduced
to \only" those of men, this alone would have an important impact on the overall labor market
situation.
   The main hypothesis with regard to the cause of the employment fall links the wage rises, which
were brought about by trade unions, to the persistence of low labor demand. For women, possible
e ects of discrimination and the large post{communist reduction in child care are also invoked.
My earlier paper (Hunt 1997) shed some light on these issues by examining the determinants of
transitions to non{employment of individuals who had been working at the time of monetary union.
An important observation in this earlier paper was the strong negative e ect of the pre{monetary
union wage on the risk of leaving employment. This e ect was found to operate through the risk
of layo , and hence through labor demand rather than supply. It seems likely that despite changes
in the labor market, the pre-monetary union wage continued to proxy for skill. Since workers with
initially low wages were found to have the largest wage gains, the results were consistent with a
negative e ect of trade union wage gains on labor demand. Another possibility, supported by the
case studies of Turner (1998), is that labor demand for all skill types fell, but rms wished to

                                                2
hoard high skill workers fearing that they would otherwise emigrate.
    Controlling for the pre{monetary union wage eliminated more than half the large gender gap
in the hazard to non{employment. The presence of children in the household did not appear
to play an important role. These results suggested that the gender gap may in large part have
represented a skills gap, and that policy aimed at reducing the gender gap through mechanisms
not targeting this skill gap might be misdirected. An alternative explanation is that rather than
representing skill di erences that are valued similarly in the capitalist system, the 1990 wage gaps
represented a type of discrimination against women under communism that has carried over and
is now nding expression in employment gaps. Turner (1998) reports the decision of Volkswagen
to rehire few women from the Saxony auto plant it took over, following its decision to use rotating
shifts.
    In this paper I begin by presenting some further results on transitions to non{employment,
before examining the determinants of transitions from non{employment to employment. As a
sensitivity check, and for comparison with existing work, I also examine transitions out of unem-
ployment. I assess the importance of age, gender, education and the presence of children, and I test
whether the 1990 wage in uences non{employment duration to the same extent as employment
duration. I am also interested in whether as much of the gender gap in transitions to employment
can be explained as was the case for transitions out of employment.
    If the 1990 wage e ect on employment duration re ected a greater departure of unskilled wages
than skilled wages from the market{clearing wage, the e ect might be similar (although opposite
in sign). If it re ected labor hoarding behavior, it is possible that the e ect on non{employment

                                                 3
duration could be smaller. Another possibility is that skill might have become devalued during a
non{employment spell, and the 1990 wage might have a lower e ect on re{employment chances.
For example, even if there is no absolute skill depreciation, the non{employed are becoming
relatively less skilled as their employed counterparts learn to put in western e ort levels and to
adopt work practices and techniques in some cases more modern than in the west (see Turner
1998). In addition to these labor demand considerations, the wage could also operate through
labor supply for non{employment duration. For example, if high{skilled workers require a more
speci c match, they might tend to search longer, which might o set labor demand considerations.
   My analysis improves on existing work on east German unemployment duration by testing
sensitivity to di erent speci cations, by testing sensitivity to the choice of sample, by considering
non-employment as well as unemployment spells, by studying the e ect of the 1990 wage, and by
extending the sample period.
   Focusing on the group which had been working at the time of monetary union, I nd that
the variables in uencing the incidence and duration of non-employment are similar (results for
unemployment duration and for broader samples are similar). Age and gender are the most im-
portant determinants, with individuals over fty and women having much longer non-employment
durations. Women with very young children have longer non{employment spells, but there are
not enough such women for this to be an important factor in the gender gap. The provision of
better child care might therefore not have a large impact.
   More skilled individuals, as measured by their education and 1990 wage, have shorter non-
employment spells. The e ect of the 1990 wage is smaller than it had been for the incidence of

                                                 4
non-employment, although not signi cantly so. This symmetric result is thus consistent with the
hypothesis that trade unions have pushed unskilled wages farther above the market clearing wage
than skilled wages. However, I cannot rule out that the 1990 wage might also operate through
labor supply for non{employment duration.
   The most crucial di erence between the duration of employment and non{employment is that
the 1990 wage explains much less of the gender gap in the latter case: the raw 50% gender di erence
in both hazards is reduced by 60% when the 1990 wage is added in an employment duration
regression, but by only 20% in the non{employment duration regression. The addition of covariates
does not change the conclusion that overall the analysis is much less successful in explaining the
non{employment duration gender gap than the employment duration gap. Apparently women's
re{employment chances are a ected by something unobservable that was much less important
for employment duration. This could work through labor demand and possibly discrimination, a
possibility the Volkswagen case study is consistent with, or through labor supply.


1 Background and Existing Literature
Monetary union between east and west Germany took place on 1 July 1990. Some economic
changes had been occurring earlier in 1990, but monetary union marked the beginning of the
east's shock therapy. East German wage contracts were converted to west German Marks at a
rate of one for one (Krueger and Pischke 1995). By mid-1991 most industries' wage bargaining had
been taken over by the western unions, who bargained at the industry level with the appropriate


                                                5
employer federation. The unions successfully bargained for large wage increases, which varied
considerably, however, according to the union's perception of the health of the industry.
      In 1993, in the industry whose union is always at the vanguard of change in Germany, metal-
working, employers revolted against the contracts designed to bring convergence with the west by
1994, and convergence was delayed until 1996. Employers generally sought ways to avoid paying
the high wages, and did this either by reopening contracts, by illegally paying below the contract
wage, or by not joining the employers' federation, and either concluding a rm-level agreement or
not being a party to the wage contracts.
      Average wage growth was enormous. The median real monthly wage for workers 18-54 rose
83% from 1990 to 1996, and rose most for the initially lowest paid. The bottom three deciles had a
rise of more than 100%. (See Hunt 1997,1999.) The east{west ratio of nominal monthly wages, as
reported by the Statistisches Bundesamt, was 75% in the rst half of 1997 (and hence the hourly
wage ratio was slightly lower, since eastern hours are longer, and end of year bonuses lower). It has
been common to attribute the employment decline to the high wages, and especially in the early
years some economists called for wage subsidies to remedy this (Bedau 1996, Bellmann 1994, Begg
and Portes 1992). Hunt (1997) also provides some evidence supporting this hypothesis. Eastern
GDP per capita for the rst half of 1997 was 57% of the western gure, measured in current prices,
re ecting the fact that eastern workers have progressed farther than easterners generally.  2

program with western-level bene ts, that allowed those 55 or older to retire. This program resulted
in almost all workers eligible for the early retirement program taking advantage of it before it ended
in December 1992. Public works jobs were also widely used. The western system of short-time
work, where workers are put on reduced hours, and have their lost hours partially compensated
by the government, was widely used, particularly in the rst year of the transition. Government
training programs have also been used to combat unemployment. In 1995, 1,047,000 individuals
were registered as unemployed, 419,000 were in public works jobs or in a subsidized job, and
254,000 were in public training programs (Vogler-Ludwig 1996).
   The greater fall in employment and rise in unemployment for women is a topic of wide dis-
cussion. Since the close attachment of women to the labor force is acknowledged (see Holst and
Schupp 1992, for example), the hypothesis that this is driven by a desire on the part of women
to adopt labor supply behavior more similar to that of women in the west is not given serious
consideration. One hypothesis is discrimination, while the other is the great fall in child care (see,
for example, Brinkmann et al. 1993). Under communism, child care had been cheaply and readily
available, while after monetary union the number of children in child care dropped precipitously.
However, it is dicult to distinguish the links between the fall in fertility and the fall in child
care, particularly since child care availability is not measurable, only child care use. In other
post{communist countries the reduction in child care is believed to have played an important
role in reducing female labor supply. For the Czech Republic and Slovakia, for example, Chase
(1996) nds that the fall in female labor supply is concentrated among young married women,
and that young children have a larger deterrent e ect on women's participation after communism

                                                  7
than during communism.
   Two existing studies include a regression analyzing the determinants of the duration of un-
employment, both using the GSOEP data. Steiner (1994) analyzes the hazard rate from unem-
ployment to employment for all unemployed for the period from monetary union through 1992.
His results di er somewhat from mine, apparently due to his earlier time frame and his inclusion
of household income in the regressions. This is discussed further later in the paper. My original
motivation for examining unemployment as well as non{employment spells was to reproduce his
results. Berger et al. (1996) consider two states, full-time work and other, and examine the haz-
ard rates between these two states for the group employed in July 1989, for the period July 1989
through 1991. Exact signi cance levels are not reported, but the authors nd important e ects
of age and sex, and also some e ects of education. Licht and Steiner (1994) analyze the hazard
from employment to non{employment.


2 Data
The data used are from respondents to the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) who resided
in east Germany when that region was rst surveyed in June 1990, immediately before monetary
union. Individuals who moved to western Germany or who subsequently worked in western Ger-
many are not removed from the sample, and hence the analysis refers to eastern Germans, the
group whose welfare is of interest, rather than to eastern Germany.
   To analyze non-employment and unemployment, I use the \calendar" section of the GSOEP:


                                               8
respondents 16 or older indicate for the calendar year preceding the interview what their labor
force status was month by month. This allows the construction of spells from June 1990 through
1995, using the 1991{1996 survey years. Non-employment spells are composed of those months
where the respondent was neither in full-time, part-time, irregular nor short{time employment.
Unemployment spells are composed of months where the respondent either indicated being regis-
tered at the unemployment oce, or indicated being in a training spell associated with payments
from the labor oce. Months in public training programs are treated like months of registered un-
employment since individuals in this training, while clearly not employed in the usual sense, have
a closer labor force attachment than those out of the labor force. This also ensures consistency
with Steiner (1994). Of the observations in the unemployment spells, 18% are due to months in
public training programs. The wage used is gross earnings in the month prior to the interview,
not adjusted for end of year bonuses (weekly or hourly wages are not available). (See the Data
Appendix for details on this and other variables).


3 Sample
One aim of the paper is to continue Hunt (1997)'s analysis of individuals who had been working
at the time of monetary union. One sample is therefore the set of rst non-employment spells
for those members of the Hunt (1997) sample who experienced non-employment before the end
of 1995. A second sample is the set of rst unemployment spells for members of the Hunt (1997)
sample experiencing unemployment before the end of 1995. A third sample is the set of rst


                                                9
unemployment spells for all individuals aged 18{65 who experienced some unemployment in the
July 1990{1995 period. I refer to these samples as the non-employment and unemployment spells
of experienced individuals, and the broad unemployment sample. I considered that the behavior
of individuals not working and not unemployed might di er greatly between the majority of
individuals who are closely attached to the labor force and the minority that did not work even
under communism, and I therefore do not attempt to study non-employment spells for all non-
employed. The Hunt (1997) sample focused on those working in June 1990 for whom a meaningful
wage was available, and thus excluded the self-employed, workers in agriculture (15% of the work
force), and apprentices. Workers under 18 years old or over 60 in 1990 were also excluded.
   Some discussion of the di erence between non-employment and unemployment spells in theory
and in practice is appropriate. In theory someone experiencing an unemployment spell is available
and searching for work. Non-employment spells then in theory include months of unemployment
and months where the individual is out of the labor force. One would not generally expect to
 nd transitions to employment from out of the labor force, but there could be exceptions to this,
such as when a woman returns to her job from maternity leave, or when an individual nds a
job so quickly that no period of unemployment is recorded. Therefore, one reason to look at
non-employment as well as unemployment spells would be to look at the determinants of search
and search success simultaneously, as well as the determinants of search success separately. In
practice the categories are not de ned as they should be in theory.
   The GSOEP allows identi cation of spells of registration at the labor oce and of public
training. Registering at the labor oce is a necessary condition for receiving unemployment

                                               10
bene ts, but other individuals might also be registered to receive job search help, or if their
bene ts are exhausted. Recipients of unemployment bene ts need only be available for a job, and
are not required to search on their own, although in principle the labor oce is searching on their
behalf. Conversely, individuals who are not working and not registered may also be searching for
a job.
   The extent of the blurring of the \true" unemployment and out of the labor force categories
may be gauged from GSOEP questions put to respondents not employed at the survey date. For
the years 1994{1996 respondents were asked both if they were available now were a suitable job
presented to them, and whether they had searched in the last three months. For the purposes of
calculating the \true" or \ILO" unemployment rate for this section and the introduction only, I
count as unemployed individuals answering yes to both questions.
   I consider months of spells that correspond to interview months, for the sample of experienced
unemployed. About one quarter of the registered unemployed were either not searching or not
available, and hence not \truly" unemployed. Of those in public training programs, almost half
indicated that they were working and were therefore not asked the appropriate questions. Of the
remainder, about half were \truly" unemployed. If those who indicated that they were working
were not searching, an argument could be made for grouping these months with the months out
of the labor force. In practice this makes little di erence to the analysis below of the hazard to
employment. Due to the empirical blurring of the categories, the analysis of unemployment spells
is probably best seen as a sensitivity check and an opportunity to compare with other studies,
rather than something allowing deep additional insight.

                                                11
4 Descriptive Statistics
Tables 1 and 2 provide descriptive statistics for the non-employment and unemployment spells
of individuals who had been working at the time of monetary union (experienced individuals),
and the broad sample of unemployment spells, as well as for the younger subsets of these samples.
The means are computed across all the person-month observations. The variables, which are those
used in the regression analysis below, are time-varying with the exceptions of sex and the 1990
wage, and also age which refers to age at the start of the spell.
      The rst column of Table 1 describes the non-employment spells for all experienced individuals.
64% of the full sample is female. Also, 33% of the full sample is aged over 55 at the start of the
spell, and a further 20% is aged 51-55. The sample age restriction (no older than sixty at monetary
union) was chosen for consistency with employment duration analysis of Hunt (1997). However,
due to the early retirement of most of those aged 55 or older at monetary union, the full sample
of non-employment spells has a large share of spells of retired individuals whose behavior will be
una ected by most covariates. Therefore, it is worthwhile also to analyze a sub-sample of younger
individuals who would not be facing a retirement option.
      Column 2 therefore contains means for experienced individuals who were aged fty or less at
the time their spell began, while columns 3 and 4 split this subsample by gender. Compared
to men, women earned less in 1990, have more young children and are much more likely to be
married or living in the west. The women's educational distribution is also somewhat di erent
                                3



  3  The mean 1990 wages are coincidentally identical to the numbers reported in Hunt (1997) for
the sample of workers. However, Hunt (1997) reports wages in 1985 Deutschmarks, whereas in
this paper wages are in 1991 Deutschmarks. Hence, as expected, the subsample of 1990 workers
                                                  12
from the men's. Fewer women had \general schooling" as a highest quali cation (no vocational
or apprenticeship quali cation or higher degree), but fewer had a tertiary degree (\university").
Women were hence more likely to have either an apprenticeship (implying the dual system of rm
training and classroom education) or a vocational degree. The last line of the table reports the
mean spell lengths: six months for younger men and fully seventeen months for younger women.
   Table 2 describes the unemployment spells of experienced individuals and of the broad sample.
The age distribution of the full sample is not as skewed to older age groups, as was the case for
the non{employment spells, but the sub-sample aged fty or less at the beginning of the spell is
nevertheless examined. Median spell lengths are ve and twelve months for experienced younger
men and women respectively, so unemployment and non-employment spells are of similar length
for men, while non-employment spells are considerably longer for women.
   Figure 1 shows a series of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the three di erent samples, while
Figure 2 reproduces the equivalent curves for the subset of individuals who were 50 or younger
when their spell began. The top left panel of Figure 1 shows curves for the non-employment spells
of experienced individuals. The curves are computed separately for men and women, and the
 gure shows that the survival rate of women is considerably higher than that of men. Despite the
fact that this group had been working at the time of monetary union, the survival rate attens out
at quite a high level. Retirements are in large part responsible for this, as the equivalent panel in
Figure 2 indicates: younger non-employed males almost all eventually return to employment, and
who experienced non-employment had been lower{paid when working. The gures reported by
gender in Table 1 are furthermore for the younger subset, which a ects the means and gender gap
slightly.

                                                 13
the survival rate of younger women in non-employment is also much lower. Since the retirement
behavior of the men and women is not dissimilar, the male-female gap is larger for the younger
sample.
   The lower left panel of Figure 1 plots the survival rate for transitions from unemployment
to employment for experienced individuals. Here, as elsewhere in the paper, the competing risks
analysis of the transition from unemployment to employment is performed by recording spells with
a transition to out of the labor force as right censored. Again the gender gap is important, and
men but not women eventually seem to return to work. The equivalent plot in Figure 2 is similar,
since retired individuals are not registered as unemployed. The lower right panel of Figure 1 and
the equivalent panel for younger unemployed in Figure 2 plot the survival rate for escapes from
unemployment to employment for the broad sample. The plots for the broad sample are similar to
those for spells of experienced individuals. By comparison, Hunt (1995) shows that for transitions
from unemployment to a job in west Germany, the survival rate at twelve months is about 40%
for both sexes pooled, similar to the eastern male rate shown here. In the United States less than
10% of unemployment spells last more than twelve months (OECD 1998).
   Finally, the upper right panel of Figures 1 and 2 plot the survival rate for escapes from
unemployment to out of the labor force for experienced individuals (escapes to employment are
recorded as censored). The survival rates do not look signi cantly di erent for men and women,
and are based on only a small number of completed spells.

5 Results
The hazard model used to analyze the durations of spells is the Cox partial likelihood proportional
hazards model. The hazard is assumed to be of the form

                                         (t; z) =  (t)ez t ;

with ties (more than one spell ending in a given period). Exponentiated coecients are reported
for ease of interpretation.
      To set the stage for the analysis of the non-employment spells, the Appendix Table shows
results of the hazard from employment to non{employment of those working in 1990, the topic of
Hunt (1997). The rst two columns show that the female hazard is 47% higher than the male

is controlled for. The subsequent columns divide the sample by sex and assess the competing risks
of being laid o versus other types of separation. The e ect of the 1990 wage is shown to operate
similarly for men and women, but through the risk of layo only, suggesting a labor demand story.
For both men and women the most in uential variables are the dummies for eligibility for early
retirement, and for women only the presence of a child age 0{1 increases the non-layo hazard.
Since few women had a child aged 0{1, in part due to the fertility rate plummeting, children and
hence child care are not judged to be an important factor. In fact, even under communism women
had typically stayed at home for the rst year of their baby's life. Being married made men but
not women less likely to leave employment, while women with apprenticeships but not men were
more likely to leave employment than their counterparts with vocational training. These results
thus account for the greater proportion of married women, women with small children, and women
with apprenticeships amongst the non-employed in Table 1.
   Turning to the determinants of non-employment and unemployment durations, I rst investi-
gate whether the 1990 wage is as important for these durations as it was for employment duration,
in terms of the coecient magnitude and in terms of explaining the gender gap. Table 3 exam-
ines the hazard to employment for the experienced non{employment sample and the experienced
unemployment sample, and the younger sub{sample of each, controlling rst for sex only and
then adding the 1990 wage as a covariate. The odd{numbered columns of Table 3 show that the
female hazard to employment is about half the male, or slightly more when the retired men and
focused on \attachment" spells where the individual might leave employment for up to four months.

                                               16
women are included (in column 1). The raw gender gap is thus similar in the hazard rate from
employment to non{employment and vice{versa (the female hazard is about 50% higher and lower
respectively). In the even{numbered columns the log 1990 wage is added to the covariates. The
columns other than column 1 indicate a signi cant (exponentiated) coecient of between 1.5 and
1.7. The magnitude of 1.6 for the younger non{employment spells in column 4 implies that a 10%
higher wage is associated with a 5% higher hazard rate to a job. The (exponentiated) magnitude
of 0.49 on the wage in the Appendix Table (column 2) indicates that a 10% higher wage is asso-
ciated with a 7% lower hazard rate to non{employment. The coecient of 1.6 in Table 3 is not
signi cantly di erent from one implying a 7% e ect (a coecient of 2), but the di erence in the
point estimates is a partial explanation of why the gender gap is reduced only by between 16%
and 22% when the 1990 wage is added as a covariate in Table 3. Also, it might be argued that a
7% fall in a hazard is a larger e ect than a 7% rise in a hazard, which would also suggest that the
wage plays a lesser role in exits from non{employment. However, most of the di erence must lie in
some gender{speci c e ect that a ects non{employment duration but not employment duration.
   Table 4 investigates in more detail the determinants of the hazard from non-employment to
employment for those who had been working at the time of monetary union. Column 1 controls for
education, age and sex only, while column 2 also controls for marital status, presence of children
of di erent ages, whether the individual was living in the west and the 1990 wage. In the third
column the sample is restricted to those 50 or younger at the start of the spell. All regressions
in this and subsequent tables also include year dummies. Dummies for federal state were always
jointly insigni cant, and hence were not included.

                                                17
   The rst three columns paint a similar picture. As expected, older individuals, who are likely
to have retired, are much less likely to leave non-employment. The hazard for those over 55 at the
start of the spell is only 4% of that of the omitted 36-45 year old group, and the 51-55 year old
hazard is 30% of that of the reference group. The next most important factor is gender, with the
female conditional hazard only half the male hazard, despite the presence of more covariates than
in Table 3. The small number of individuals with only general schooling have half the conditional
hazard rate of the omitted group with vocational training, while those with an apprenticeship have
70{80% of the hazard of those with vocational training. The 1990 wage has a signi cant positive
e ect on the hazard rate. Since workers with vocational training are better paid than those with
an apprenticeship, these results are consistent with shorter spells for more skilled individuals.
Married individuals also have a higher hazard rate, by 38%, compared to unmarried individuals.
The presence of a child age 0{1 reduces the hazard by 40%. If we compare with the results of the
Appendix Table, we con rm that similar variables a ect the transitions between employment and
non{employment, but in opposite directions: age, sex, marital status, education, the 1990 wage
and the presence of a child aged 0{1.
   Columns 4 and 5 split the sample of column 3 by gender. The main di erence lies in the
coecients on the child variables. Not surprisingly, the reduced hazard due to the presence of
a child age 0{1 in columns 2 and 3 was being driven by women. The presence of such a child
reduces the female hazard by 60% (a smaller magnitude than the 700% e ect found for employment
duration in the Appendix Table). The presence of older children appears to have no signi cant
e ect. More surprisingly, men with children appear to have signi cantly higher hazard rates by

                                               18
40{60%. This bene cial e ect of children for men was not found for employment duration, and
is in fact not robust to modi cations to the sample of non{employment spells. The regressions
have been repeated with all non{employment spells included (not just the rst), and for a sample
that, while restricted to those who were working in 1990, includes individuals who had been in
agriculture or self{employment or who had had a missing wage (the wage is therefore omitted
from the regressions). In these regressions the coecients on the child dummies for men had point
estimates of about 1.25 and were insigni cant (these results are not reported).
   To assess the importance of the child variables I can predict the twelve month survival rates for
men and women based on the coecients of columns 4 and 5, then nd the predicted rates under
the counter{factual of children having no e ect. The predicted gender gap in the survival rate at
twelve months is 0.30. If children aged 0{1 are constrained to have no e ect on women, the gap
falls to 0.25, a modest fall due to the scarcity of young children. If the coecients for all ages of
children are set to zero for women, the gap falls to 0.23 (but the coecients on older children are
in fact insigni cant). The large but puzzling coecients for men mean that if the child coecients
are set to zero for both men and women the predicted gap falls considerably, to 0.15. Since the
mechanism through which children would a ect the male hazard is unclear, however, to say that
half the gap has been explained would be misleading.
   In light of these results, one could ask whether reduced child care was likely to have had an
important e ect. Reduced child care might have increased the impact of a child, but we can see
this could not have had a large e ect given the small number of young children. Reduced child
care could have reduced the fertility rate, but this e ect would have had to be very large for child

                                                 19
care to be an important player. The e ects of children may in fact be overstated, if young children
are endogenous in the way envisioned by Witte and Wagner (1995). They believe that women
who become unemployed increase their fertility as the opportunity cost of doing so falls.
   General schooling is the only variable other than children to have a signi cant coecient in
the male regression. The unreported coecients on the year dummies for the regressions are of
some interest. For women they indicate a falling hazard over time, while for men no pattern is
present. The general e ects of the two modi cations to the sample described above are to reduce
signi cance slightly, particularly for the wage, in the case of the repeated spell sample, and to
increase signi cance slightly in the case of the sample including more former workers (these results
are not reported).
   Table 5 performs similar regressions to those of Table 4 to analyze the competing risk of
escaping to a job from unemployment for experienced individuals (spells with exits to out of
the labor force are recorded as censored). The covariates are the same as in the corresponding
columns in Table 4. Coecients on dummies for federal state are generally signi cant, but since
they a ect other coecients little, for consistency with Table 4 the results of the regressions
including these dummies are not reported. A more interesting issue is that of possible inclusion
of information about receipt of unemployment insurance. Most individuals (about 90%) who had
been working at the time of monetary union had enough experience to be eligible for unemployment
insurance. Therefore, if dummies for receipt are included in the regressions for non-employment
of Table 4, they principally proxy the state of registered unemployment, and are signi cantly
but uninterestingly positive. Similarly in the unemployment regressions of Table 5, the dummies

                                                20
principally proxy the state of registered unemployment versus a government training program.
If included their coecients are again positive and signi cant and large, indicating that those
on the training programs are probably doing much less search, but indicating nothing about
the disincentives of unemployment insurance. Therefore no information about unemployment
insurance is included in the regressions presented. Its existence may well lengthen spells, but a
much more subtle approach would be needed to tease out the magnitude of the disincentive.
   The conditional female hazard is again close to half the male hazard in Table 5. Age e ects are
somewhat smaller in the rst two columns of Table 5 than the corresponding columns of Table 4,
presumably due to the absence from the sample of those older workers who are retired. As for the
skill coecients, the coecients on the 1990 wage are signi cant for the regressions pooling men
and women, but not generally as large as in Table 3 now that additional covariates are present.
The coecients are more similar to those in Table 4. The coecient on apprenticeship is negative
and generally signi cant and of similar magnitude to that of Table 4, while the negative coecient
on general schooling is signi cant only in column 1. The coecient on living in the west is now
large and signi cant, however: the hazard rate for a person living in the west is more than double
that of someone in the east, and this e ect is driven by women (see columns 4 and 5). Few
unemployed men in fact reside in the west. The coecient on being married is now insigni cant.
   In columns 4 and 5 we see that the coecients on children are much less signi cant than in
Table 4, the only signi cant one being on the presence of a child age 7{11 in the male regression.
This is in fact the only signi cant coecient in the male regression, and the hypothesis that all
coecients are zero can only be rejected at the 10% level. The unreported coecients on the year

                                               21
dummies in columns 4 and 5 indicate that the hazard rate for women is declining, as was the
case for the non-employment spells, while there is again no pattern for men. If the regressions of
Table 5 are run with all spells included, rather than just rst spells of unemployment, the results
are similar, except that the coecients are slightly less signi cant (these results are not reported).
Adding individuals who had been excluded for having originally worked in agriculture etc. makes
the coecients slightly more signi cant (these results are also not reported).
   Table 6 considers the hazard rate to employment for the broad sample of unemployment spells;
that is, it includes spells of individuals who were not working at monetary union. For this reason
the 1990 wage is not included as a covariate, but otherwise the speci cations are the same as in
Tables 4 and 5. The results are similar to those in Table 5 for most variables, and the gender gap
remains about 50%. In similar analysis for west Germany in the 1980s, Hunt (1995) found the
female hazard to be 78% of the male hazard from unemployment to employment, and one's prior
might have been that the gap would be lower in east Germany where women are more attached to
the labor force. Thus, while the sign of the e ect is not surprising when compared to other labor
markets, the magnitude is.
   The child coecients are all individually insigni cant in Table 6. The coecients are somewhat
sensitive to the choice of age range for the presence of children: if the youngest category is de ned
as children age 0{3, its coecient is 0.65 in the female regression and signi cant. The signi cance
of the coecient on young children in the samples of the earlier tables was not sensitive to the
exact choice of age.
   For this sample there are no signi cant variables in the male regression, and the chi-squared

                                                 22
test cannot reject the hypothesis that all the coecients are zero. The sample size of 451 male
spells is not especially small, and the lack of signi cant coecients is surprising.
   The nding using the broad sample that the female hazard is reduced by the presence of
children aged 0{3 agrees with the results of Steiner (1994), who uses a similarly broad sample
of unemployment spells. Another of Steiner's ndings is that gender has an e ect only through
interaction terms (the coecient on the gender dummy alone is insigni cant). This result is
markedly di erent from mine, and my replication of Steiner's speci cation suggests that this is
due to his inclusion of household income (and its interaction with sex) as well as his much shorter
time period. It is dicult to ensure that the household income variable (which refers to the
month before the survey) is really matched to the beginning of a spell, which is essential, and the
coecients on sex as well as age are sensitive to exactly how the matching is done. However it is
done, I can make sex and age signi cant by extending the time period somewhat: I noted above
that the hazard for women but not men is falling over time.
   The analysis of the competing risk of leaving unemployment for the state of out of the labor
force has also been carried out, although results are not reported. For the sample of experienced
individuals, a child aged 0{1 or living in the west raises the hazard greatly, for women only. Indi-
viduals aged 55 or older also have a signi cantly higher hazard. The results for the broad sample
are similar (in addition, married individuals have a signi cantly lower hazard, indviduals with
only general schooling higher). The coecients on sex and the 1990 wage are always insigni cant.




                                                 23
6 Conclusion
An earlier paper (Hunt 1997) found that the duration of employment spells in east Germany was
strongly positively related to the wage a worker had been receiving at monetary union in 1990.
The fact that this e ect operated through labor demand, and that those with the lowest 1990
wage had received the highest wage rises, appeared consistent with the hypothesis that wage rises
negotiated by trade unions have reduced employment.
   In this paper I complete the study of transitions between employment and non{employment
by focusing on the duration of non{employment (and also unemployment, for which results are
similar). An important nding is that the 1990 wage has a negative e ect on non{employment
duration, insigni cantly di erent in absolute value from its e ect on employment duration. This
is consistent with the hypothesis that trade unions have contributed to the continued low employ-
ment. It is possible, however, that the magnitude for non{employment spells is similar due to a
smaller e ect through labor demand and an additional e ect operating through labor supply.
   I nd that in general the variables in uencing the duration of employment and non-employment
are the same. Age and gender are the most important determinants, with workers over fty and
women having much longer non-employment durations. More skilled individuals, as measured by
their education and 1990 wage, have shorter non-employment spells. The presence of a very young
child increases non{employment duration for women (and reduces employment duration), but the
low fertility rate means that this does not explain much of the gender gap in the hazard rate. This
suggests that, unless fertility is very responsive to child care, the reduction in child care was not
a major determinant of the employment gender gap.
                                                 24
   An important di erence between the employment and non{employment analysis is that while
the 1990 wage explained 60% of the gender gap in transitions to non-employment, it explains only
20% of the gender gap in transitions out of non-employment. This indicates that the gender{
related issues in ending and beginning a spell of employment are not the same. Whether the
additional e ects relevant for returning to employment operate through labor demand, and pos-
sibly discrimination, or through a labor supply e ect not captured by marital status and the
presence of children could not be determined.

Data Appendix
An individual who indicates being in vocational training in the calendar le could be in rm
training, including apprenticeship, in private training outside the rm, or in a government training
program for the unemployed. Through 1994 vocational training spells are identi ed as this last
type if the income calendar le indicated that \Umschulung/Fortbildung" payments from the
labor oce had been received in any portion of the spell. After 1994 a vocational training spell
was thus identi ed if these payments had been received in the year of the spell (the months of
the payments no longer being available). Individuals undergoing rm training generally indicate
simultaneously being employed, and are counted as such.
    The number of rst non{employment spells examined should equal the number of uncensored
employment spells examined in the Appendix Tables, if both types are drawn from the group
working in 1990 (experienced individuals). In fact there are 991 non{employment spells and
937 uncensored employment spells. About half the di erence is due to non{employment spells
beginning in 1995 (the employment analysis was based only on data through 1994). Most of the
rest is due to cases where the employment spell was interrupted by some months of missing data.
The employment spell is thus recorded as censored, but the non{employment spell is retained
despite the possibility that it is the second and not the rst non{employment spell since 1990.
    The wage used is gross earnings in the month prior to the interview, not adjusted for end of year
bonuses. Wages for respondents living in the west are adjusted using the western consumer price
index (1991=100). The eastern consumer price index is adjusted so that a meaningful comparison
of the price levels between east and west may be made, using the results of a 1991 study of the
relative price levels in the east and west (Krause 1994). The wages of those living in the east are
thus de ated with this adjusted index, so that the real wages of those in the east and west should
have comparable purchasing power. It should be noted, however, that the price index for the east
in 1990 is not considered as reliable as in the subsequent years.
    Information about the month of birth of a child is used in constructing the dummies for presence
of children. The youngest age category is constructed in such as way as to allow anticipation of a
birth by one month.
