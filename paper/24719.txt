Financial Asset Ownership and Political Partisanship: Liberty Bonds and Republican Electoral
Success in the 1920s

                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze the effects of ownership of liberty bonds, which were marketed to households during
World War I, on election outcomes in the 1920s. In order to address the endogeneity of liberty
bond subscriptions, we utilize the local severity of the fall 1918 influenza epidemic, which
disrupted the largest liberty bond campaign, as an instrument. We find that counties with higher
liberty bond ownership rates turned against the Democratic Party in the presidential elections of
1920 and 1924. This was a reaction to the depreciation of the bonds prior to the 1920 election
(when the Democrats held the presidency), and the appreciation of the bonds in the early 1920s
(under a Republican president), as the Fed raised and then subsequently lowered interest rates.
Our results suggest the liberty bond campaigns had unintended political consequences and
illustrate the potential for financial asset ownership to increase the sensitivity of ordinary
households to economic policy decisions.

1. Introduction

        Scholars and pundits alike have long argued that ownership of financial assets influences political

behavior. Holding a stake in financial markets, the theory goes, causes households to identify as

members of the investor class, shifting their preferences towards business-friendly policies. There is even

some evidence that the Bush Administration’s 2005 proposal to privatize social security was partly

motivated by this theory; by reconfiguring retirement finance, they sought to shape the preferences of the

electorate.1 Yet the political consequences of public policy changes that make financial assets more

widely held may not be so simple. Owning financial assets exposes households to the flows of income

they produce, but also to the fluctuations in those flows of income. In response to such fluctuations,

voters who were induced to hold financial assets may be inclined to punish incumbents when markets

perform poorly, or reward them in response to strong returns, in a pattern consistent with models of

retrospective voting behavior. Such models (e.g., Achen and Bartels 2016; Healy, Persson, and

Snowberg 2017; Hibbs 2000; Key 1966; Kramer 1971) argue that voters’ choices are driven by

backwards-looking assessments of how well the government has performed during an incumbent’s tenure.

        We study the electoral consequences of the liberty bond drives of World War I, which induced

millions of American households to purchase government bonds for the first time. Prior to the war,

relatively few Americans held financial assets other than bank accounts. But ordinary citizens subscribed

to the liberty loans at extraordinary rates, and by 1919 the fraction of American households that owned a

liberty bond was likely greater than the percentage of modern American households that own stocks.2 As

a result, a large share of the U.S. electorate held financial assets whose value was sensitive to fluctuations

in financial markets. And beginning in late 1919, in an effort to restrain the growth of credit and prices,

the Federal Reserve enacted a series of extraordinary increases in interest rates. This caused the market

  Data from a 1918-19 BLS survey discussed below indicated that two-thirds of middle-income households owned a
liberty bond. Gallup survey data indicates that in 2016, 52 percent of American households own stocks, down from a
peak of 65 percent in 2007 (McCarthy, 2016).

                                                        1
prices of liberty bonds to fall, and millions of American households suffered capital losses. Then in 1921

the Fed began to lower interest rates, causing liberty bonds to appreciate again.

        Using new data on liberty bond subscription rates, we test whether liberty bonds led to changes in

voting outcomes in presidential elections in the 1920s relative to those in the previous decade, in a panel

of about 1,400 counties. The 1920s were a period of Republican dominance in presidential politics, with

Harding, Coolidge and Hoover winning substantial majorities of the popular and electoral votes in 1920,

1924 and 1928. Previous scholarship has attributed these victories to the breakdown of the coalition that

had supported Wilson (Bagby, 1962; Burner, 1968; Murray, 1976). We posit instead that voters

responded to changes in liberty bond prices by voting against the incumbent Democrats when they

depreciated in value, and later voting for the incumbent Republicans following their appreciation. The

results of our empirical analysis indicate that counties with higher liberty bond participation rates did

indeed turn against the Democrats, relative to their voting patterns in earlier elections.

        Our estimation framework includes county and state-year fixed effects, which control for any

time-invariant county characteristics, such as a historical propensity to vote for a particular party, as well

as trends in states’ political preferences. Yet liberty bond subscriptions may have been influenced by

unobservable county attributes not reflected in historical voting patterns, which nonetheless influenced

voting behavior in the 1920s. For example, the level of per capita wealth in a county, which was likely an

important determinant of liberty bond subscriptions, may have influenced voting outcomes in the 1920s to

a greater extent than in the previous decade, as high wartime tax rates made income tax policy questions

more politically important. In order to address this possibility, we instrument for liberty bond

participation using a measure of the predicted local severity of the fall 1918 influenza epidemic.

        The most lethal wave of the epidemic, which occurred in October 1918, coincided the largest of

all of the liberty bond drives, the fourth loan. Our measure of the predicted severity of the influenza

epidemic is based on a county’s distance to large military training camps, which were the most likely

source of the epidemic within the civilian population. Greater distance from military camps was strongly

correlated with participation in the fourth loan, as the bond drive was hampered by both the influenza

                                                       2
epidemic itself, and by efforts to control the spread of the epidemic. Our IV estimates of the effect of

liberty bond ownership on the Democratic Party vote share indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase

in a county’s liberty bond participation rate led to a decrease in the Democratic share in presidential

elections of 3.3 percentage points on average over the 1920-32 period. The liberty loan campaigns were

guided by the ideal of increasing support for the war and sharing the burdens of war finance equitably

(Sutch 2015), but their unintended consequences contributed to an electoral backlash against the party

that created them.

        In order to assess whether the electoral effects of liberty bonds could have been decisive, we

estimate the same empirical model using state-level data. We focus on the 1920 presidential election, in

which Democrat James Cox won only 12 states and Harding won 37, for electoral vote totals of 127 to

404. Counterfactual estimates of the Democratic Party vote share for the 1920 presidential election by

state indicate that in the absence of the liberty bonds, the Democratic Party would have won 12 additional

states, but would still have lost the electoral vote. That is, the effect our analysis attributes to liberty

bonds contributed significantly to Republican electoral margins but was unlikely to have been decisive.

        This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between the composition of

households’ wealth and their political beliefs and voting behavior (Guiso et al., 2003; Schreiner and

Sherraden, 2006; Ansell, 2014; Lewis-Beck, Nadeau, and Foucault 2013; Rahn and Dancy 2009). Some

have argued that the broadening of stock ownership in recent years has led to greater identification with

the Republican Party and increases in the Republican vote share (Cotton and Davis, 2012; Duca and

Saving, 2008, Lewis-Beck and Nadeau 2011; Rahn and Dancy 2009). However, this literature generally

cannot convincingly address the problem that financial asset ownership may itself be influenced by party

identification, or by other factors related to party identification (Huberty 2011).3 This paper contributes

to that literature by studying a context with plausibly exogenous variation in financial asset ownership.

An additional advantage of our setting is its focus on bond values. The depreciations and appreciations in

the prices of liberty bonds that occurred between 1919 and 1924 were clearly related to changes in

monetary conditions that originated in decisions by the Fed and by the Treasury. In contrast, booms or

crashes in the stock market can have a broad range of plausible explanations and in some cases may be

seen as only indirectly related to government policy choices. The more direct connection between

economic policy and bond prices likely makes our test of pocketbook concerns in retrospective voting

somewhat stronger than those conducted with modern stock ownership data.

        Our analysis also contributes to the literature on policy feedback. Reversing the notion that

public policies result from mass preferences and political participation, the policy feedback literature

argues that “policies make politics” by affecting how people define their self-interest, calculate the stakes

of politics, understand the meaning of citizenship, and express their political identities (Campbell 2012).

Much of this work is focused on social policies, although recently a number of other areas have become

part of the literature.4 A few contributions have considered feedback from policies that stem from

military engagements.5 We contribute to this body of work by analyzing war financing issues, which

have not been considered in the literature. We argue that the policy choices political elites make about

how to pay for a war “affect what individuals think, feel, and do as members of the polity” (Mettler and

Soss 2004). In the case of World War I, bonds were sold to ordinary households not only to help finance

the war, but to give them a financial stake in the war effort. Marketing these assets to American

households likely had its intended effect on attitudes toward the war. But as we show, it also had more

complex and longer-term effects on public attitudes towards economic policy. Turning ordinary

Americans into bond owners made them sensitive to changes in interest rates, and likely shifted their

preferences towards greater stability and conservatism in public finance.

criminal justice (Weaver and Lerman 2010), health policy (Barabas 2006, Pacheco 2013) and disaster relief (Chen
2013).

  Theda Scokpol’s (1992) landmark book on civil war veterans’ pensions, in fact, is often seen as field-defining.
Another well-known example is Suzanne Mettler’s (2005) study of the effects of the GI Bill on veteran’s civic
participation. And a spate of recent articles has examined the impact of military casualties on support for war
(Althaus, Bramlett, and Gimpel 2012), the fate of political incumbents (Grose and Oppenheimer 2007; Kriner and
Shen 2010; Karol and Miguel 2007), and voter turnout (Davenport 2015; Koch and Nicholson 2016).

                                                         4
        The policy feedback effects of debt finance have long played a role in American public policy.

For example, in 1790 Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton argued for the issuance of federal debt to

finance the assumption of state debts from the Revolutionary War in part because he understood that

doing so would give the wealthy individuals who would buy the new debt an incentive to support his

efforts to strengthen the federal government (see Hamilton, 1790). Conversely, the efforts by the

Jacksonians to pay off the federal debt were enacted in part to end this source of support for a strong

federal government. The liberty loan campaigns of World War I represent a later example of the

operation of the same principles, but one in which the longer-term political consequences of the financing

decisions may not have been anticipated by policy makers.

        Finally, this paper also contributes to a growing literature on the significance of the liberty bond

campaigns in American economic history (Garbade, 2012; Sutch, 2015; Kang and Rockoff, 2015; Hilt

and Rahn, 2016). Closely related is Julia Ott’s When Wall Street Met Main Street (2011:54), which

analyzes the political significance of the loan drives, arguing that they “propagate[d] an investor theory of

political economy.” Yet Ott’s book mostly neglects the prices of liberty bonds, which we argue are

critical for understanding their political consequences. Republican political campaigns in the early 1920s

made frequent references to the fact that liberty bonds were trading well below the prices subscribers paid

for them. We argue that the most important political legacy of the liberty bond campaigns, which the

literature has overlooked, is that they created a large popular class of securities holders who suffered a

significant depreciation in the value of their investments under a Democratic president, and then

experienced a significant appreciation in the value of their investments under the Republicans.



2. Financing World War I

2.1 Bond Finance

        The scale of the expenditures required for the American effort in World War I were completely

unprecedented. By 1919, total expenditures of the federal government had grown to $18.5 billion, a



                                                      5
nearly 25-fold increase over the expenditures over those of the years 1913 to 1916.6 While Treasury

Secretary McAdoo was considering his options for financing the war effort, vigorous debates raged

outside and inside Congress about whether to rely on taxes or debt. McAdoo eventually settled on a plan

for a 1/3rd-2/3rd split between taxes and borrowing; in the end, taxes financed about one-quarter of the cost

the war (Kang and Rockoff 2015; Garbade 2012; Sutch 2015).7

        In addition avoiding heavy taxation, financing the war through borrowing offered another

advantage. Purchases of war bonds were seen as giving American households a financial stake in the war

effort and increasing support for the war. McAdoo believed that people who were unable to support the

country by fighting would welcome a chance to do their share in the “financial trenches” at home

(McAdoo 1931). It was also believed that bond sales drives would have propaganda value, demoralizing

the enemy if the American public responded with great enthusiasm to the chance to demonstrate their

patriotism.

        Policymakers were keen to make liberty bonds attractive to ordinary Americans: “This was

important because the strength of Government finance, like the strength of Government policies, rests on

the support of the people” (U.S. Treasury 1918:7). Several features of their marketing were designed to

facilitate purchases by people of relatively moderate means. The bonds were sold in denominations as low

as $50, and subscriptions could be fulfilled through installment plans, both of which made the bonds

accessible to a broad range of American households.8 For example, a $50 liberty bond could be

purchased by a payment of $4 up front, and then 23 weekly payments of $2. In addition, Treasury

allotments were weighted toward smaller investors (Garbade 2012; Sutch 2015). As a result of these

  The various War Revenue Acts put in place a steeply progressive income tax structure, lowered personal
exemptions, thereby subjecting more American households to the federal tax, added income surtaxes, including a
65% surtax on incomes over $1 million, and levied taxes on “excess” corporate profits, a measure popular with the
public and progressive politicians (Gilbert 1970, Rokoff 2012, Saldin 2011; Witte 1985).

  Adjusting for inflation, $50 in 1919 is equivalent to about $673 in today’s money. This was not an insignificant
sum, but an amount similar in magnitude to the cost of many common household appliances. It was feared that
bonds of smaller denominations might circulate as money, contributing to inflation.

efforts, tens of millions of Americans became owners of financial assets other than bank accounts for the

first time.

         Borrowing on such an enormous scale required extraordinary efforts to market the bonds.

McAdoo studied the experience of the Civil War for insights into the design of such efforts. As one

method of raising revenue, then-Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase tapped the financier Jay Cooke to try

and sell government debt directly to ordinary Americans. Cooke did so by organizing a sales force paid

on commission. Motivating sales agents through financial self-interest, McAdoo believed, was a

“fundamental error…Chase did not capitalize the emotion of the people, yet it was there and he might

have put it to work” (McAdoo, 1931, p. 374). McAdoo put the emotion of the American people to work

in the marketing of liberty bonds. Rather than the continuous sale of a single issue, the loans were

marketed in a series of campaigns, each with a specific opening and closing date and sales goal, in order

to keep engagement levels high. A final victory loan drive was conducted after the Armistice.

         Table 1 presents summary data on each of the individual loan drives. The bonds were all sold to

investors at par, meaning that their initial yield to maturity was equal to their coupon rates. As the high

levels of government borrowing began to put pressure on credit markets, the later bonds were issued with

higher coupon rates. All told, the five bond drives raised around 24 billion dollars. As a constant share of

GDP, this would be equivalent to more than $5 trillion today.9 Sales of the fourth Liberty Loan alone

totaled nearly seven billion dollars, with nearly twenty-three million people, more than 20 percent of the

U.S. population, subscribing.



2.2 The Liberty Loan Drives

         The organization and conduct of the liberty loan campaigns has been described in detail

elsewhere.10 Briefly, the Treasury Department directed the Federal Reserve Banks to manage bond sales

within their geographic districts. They did so by creating state liberty loan committees that in turn

selected local notables to comprise county- and city-level organizations. Virtually all of civil society was

enlisted by these committees, and organizations as diverse as women’s clubs, the Boy Scouts, and

fraternal and religious organizations all contributed to the effort. Local committees recruited a salesforce

from these associations, forging “patriotic partnerships” (Skocpol et al. 2002) to market the bonds as

broadly as possible. Over two million people volunteered as foot soldiers for McAdoo’s financial army

(U.S. Treasury, 1919). Shoe leather was augmented by extensive advertising and promotion in

newspapers, magazines, movie theaters, and department stores. The nation’s economic institutions did

their part too. Employers released their workers for liberty loan events, larger companies offered payroll

deduction to employees as a way to pay for liberty bond subscriptions, and the nation’s commercial banks

advertised the loans to their customers, processed their subscriptions, and offered them safety deposits

boxes free of charge for their liberty bond certificates.

        Some perspective on the extent to which ordinary households were induced to purchase the bonds

can be found in data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 1918-19. In those years, the

BLS conducted one of the first-ever surveys of American households’ incomes and expenditures.

Although it was unconnected to the liberty loan drives, the households’ responses to the survey’s

comprehensive questions revealed whether they had purchased liberty bonds within the previous year.

The BLS surveyed nearly 13,000 families in the middle of the earnings distribution, who resided in 99

cities.11 Among the surveyed households, nearly 68 percent had purchased a liberty bond in the previous

year.12 This is considerably higher than the rate at which households near the median of the income

distribution today own shares of corporate stock, the most widely held risky financial asset.13




11
   The data from the original survey manuscripts were are collected and presented in Olney (2005). Further
information on the surveyed households is presented in Feigenbaum (2016).

   Authors’ calculations from the data in Olney (2005).
13
   In the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, 51.8 percent of households whose income was between the 40th and
60th percentile of the income distribution owned stock, either directly or indirectly.

                                                       8
        Some of the rhetoric of the liberty loan campaigns emphasized the attractiveness of the returns

that the securities would offer.14 Yet these were negotiable securities whose values were subject to market

forces, and uninformed investors with no experience with financial assets may not have understood that

the prices of the bonds could fall. Secretary McAdoo’s later testimony in Congress suggests he did not

anticipate that a depreciation of liberty bond prices would anger ordinary investors:

        There is a curious feeling in the breast of the average man that if he buys a Government
        bond…[and then] gets tired of his investment and wants to get his money back, that he
        ought to be able to sell that bond at par…It is extraordinary the extent to which that
        feeling exists…It is a perfectly unreasonable feeling…15

The Treasury did offer non-negotiable war savings stamps to investors of more modest means; for

example, stamps that paid $5 in 1923 were sold for just above $4 in January 1918 and could be redeemed

prior to 1923 on a fixed schedule of prices (see Garbade, 2012: 66-67). Many investors would likely have

been better off purchasing war savings stamps, or some vehicle like them, but the Treasury did not

promote them as aggressively.



2.3 Evolution of Liberty Bond Prices

        The World War I years were a period of high inflation in the United States, due in part to rapid

expansion of money and credit (see Friedman and Schwartz, 1963). Yet even after the Armistice in

November of 1918, money and credit growth continued, as did inflation. National banks had committed

to lend to subscribers to the fourth loan and the victory loan at 4.25 percent until late 1919, as part of a

“borrow and buy” program that helped sell the issues (Meltzer, 2003: 93). The Fed supported this

program by offering a discount rate that generally ranged from 4.0 to 4.25 percent, and then-Treasury

Secretary Carter Glass, who was by nature of his office Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, opposed any




14
   For example, an article in McClure’s magazine in November 1917 stated, “when peace comes liberty bonds will
have no rivals as investments. Remember, therefore, that when you subscribe you are not only helping the
Government, but yourself as well” (“Line forms to the Right for Liberty,” pg. 48).

   Testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, 1918, reproduced in U.S. Treasury (1921).

                                                       9
rate increase.16 Inflation continued, and concerns mounted that artificially low interest rates were fueling

speculation.

         Finally, in December 1919, the Treasury withdrew its objection to rate increases, and the Federal

Reserve Banks began to raise their discount rates, with the blessing of the Board. Partly as a result of its

inexperience with such matters, these rate increases were “not only too late but also probably too much”

(Friedman and Schwartz, 1963: 231). The New York Fed’s discount rate was increased from 4 percent to

4.75 percent in December 1919, then 6 percent in January 1920, and finally 7 percent in June 1920, an

extraordinary level that was not reached again until the 1970s.17 Some of the Reserve Banks began to

impose “progressive” or increasing rates on banks that were heavy borrowers at their discount windows

as well (Melzer 2003: 106). This induced a rapid contraction in financial markets and in economic

activity, triggering a severe recession. The Fed began to lower its rates in April of 1921 in a series of 0.5

percent cuts that ultimately brought the discount rate back down to four percent by June 1922.

         Liberty bond prices were closely connected to these changes in the Fed’s policies. The increases

in the Fed’s rates in 1919-20 led to increases in the yields on liberty bonds, which were produced by a fall

in prices. In addition, large quantities of the issues that had been purchased through the “borrow and buy”

policies were sold by the original subscribers when the rates on loans collateralized by liberty bonds

increased; this selling pressure likely contributed to the fall in prices as well.18

         Figure 1 shows how this process unfolded. Panel (a) shows the New York Fed’s discount rate,

and how it ratcheted up quite steeply in late 1919 and early 1920 and was then lowered beginning in

1921. Panel (b) presents the steep drop in the prices of the loans that resulted, in a pattern that varied

   On the struggle between the Fed and the Treasury over the appropriate course of monetary policy during this era,
see Meltzer (2003) and Wicker (1966).
17
   Whereas today, the Federal Reserve quotes a single discount rate, in the 1920s each of the twelve Federal Reserve
District Banks could quote their own somewhat different rates, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
By December of 1920, five of the twelve reserve banks’ discount rates had been raised to 7 percent; the remaining
rates were all 6 percent.
18
   As Wicker (1966: ch. 3) notes, part of the goal of the change in discount rates was exactly to stimulate such sales,
as the Fed was concerned that too much of the liberty bond issues were held by the commercial banking system.

inversely with the New York Fed’s discount rate. Beginning in 1921, those prices begin to recover, and

the price increases continued into 1922-24.

        An indication of the effects of these fluctuations for ordinary investors during the presidential

campaigns of 1920 and 1924 can be found in Figure 2, which presents the cumulative returns received by

subscribers to the fourth loan, in both nominal and real terms. Over the two years between the issuance of

the bond and the 1920 election, the depreciation in the prices of the bonds dominated the coupon income,

and the total cumulative returns received by holders of the fourth loan were negative: -5.8 percent.19 The

subsequent appreciation of the bonds produced very strong returns over 1921 and 1922, and by the time

of the 1924 election, cumulative returns had risen to 32.3 percent, slightly better than what a constant 4.25

percent annual yield would have produced.

        Panel (c) of Figure 1 presents an additional consequence of the Fed’s tightening: deflation, and in

particular a sharp decrease in commodities prices. The collapse of farm product prices in 1920-21 had

devastating effects on rural areas and presents an alternative potential source of discontent regarding

incumbents in the 1920 elections that will be addressed below.



3. Political Impact of Liberty Bond Price Changes: Narrative Evidence

        The fall in liberty bond prices in 1919-20 was widely reported in the financial press and aroused

considerable agitation. Given that millions of households had been induced to become bond holders by

the federal government, the collapse in their values was perceived as a betrayal. In one response,

Representative Walter Magee, a Republican from New York, introduced HR 501 in April of 1920, calling

for the appointment of a special bipartisan committee to investigate the decline in liberty bond prices. In

a hearing before the House Rules Committee a month later, Magee inserted in the Congressional Record a

variety of written material from around the country accusing the government of reneging on its promise to

provide its patriotic citizen investors with the safest investment in the world. The public, the committee

  The cumulative returns paid by the third loan up through November 1920 were -3.8 percent. The details of these
calculations are presented in the Appendix.

was informed by the editors of the Syracuse News, was “disillusioned—distressingly so…It is sore and

disgusted and does not disguise the fact.” The editorial went further, averring that the people of the

United States “will not care to be singed twice in the same place” should the government need to come

calling again (U.S. Congress 1920).

           For most liberty bond owners, the capital losses suffered as a result of the price depreciation were

probably relatively modest. At its nadir, the price of a $50 share of the forth liberty loan was about

$42.50, implying a loss of about $7.50. For comparison, the median income of liberty bond owners in the

BLS survey was about $1,500. In the context of a deep recession and rise in interest rates, many

households likely suffered far greater losses on the values of their homes, on crop income due to the fall

in agricultural commodity prices, or in labor income if they became unemployed or saw their hours

reduced. But this is precisely why the depreciation of the bonds aroused such rancor: at a time when the

money was needed most, 15 percent of it was gone. Although these were merely paper losses that would

be reversed if the bonds were held to maturity, many subscribers of modest means had to sell their bonds

at the bottom of the market “to furnish cash for living expenses.”20

           During the 1920 campaign, the Republicans seized the opportunity to criticize the Democrats for

the financial mismanagement that they claimed had led to the price declines. The Republican National

Committee ran newspaper advertisements in several states that pointed out that after making sacrifices to

buy the bonds, subscribers “must make further sacrifices, if compelled to sell those Liberty Bonds, in

order to meet the abnormal conditions confronting you…”21 But perhaps the clearest indication that the

welfare of liberty bond subscribers was central to the 1920 election campaign was their prominent

appearance in the Republican Party platform:

           The fact is that the war to a great extent, was financed by a policy of inflation, through certificate
           borrowings from the banks, and bonds issued at artificial rates sustained by the low discount rates
           established by the Federal Reserve Board…The results have been a greatly increased war cost, a
           serious loss to the millions of people who, in good faith, bought liberty bonds and victory notes at
           par (emphasis added).

The Republicans appealed to securities holders who had seen their investments fall in value, and their

message likely resonated among a broad segment of the electorate.

        Harding won with a substantial popular and electoral majority. Some commentary following the

election did suggest that the depreciation of liberty bonds was among the “fundamental causes” of the

Democrats’ defeat.22 One commentator suggested a connection between the enfranchisement of women

and the turn against the Democrats: since many women “pinched and saved” to purchase liberty bonds,

only to see those investments lose value, “women changed many normal Democratic votes to Harding.”23

        As the Fed eased interest rates in 1921 and 1922, liberty bonds appreciated in value. Senator

Simeon D. Fess of Ohio, in a speech construed to be a semi-official announcement of Harding’s re-

election bid, extolled the accomplishments of the President and invited the public to behave just like

models of retrospective voting say they ought to: “President Harding has been in office just two years.

Those two years have been crowded with a great volume of constructive and remedial work. The record

is now made up; the results are apparent upon which the people must give their verdict of approval or

disapproval (emphasis added).”24 The return of liberty bonds to par was specifically mentioned by Fess

as an indicator of the prosperity occasioned by the Administration’s policies.

        Harding did not live to see himself re-nominated. His vice-president, Calvin Coolidge,

succeeded him, and received the Republican nomination for president the next year. Despite Democratic

charges of corruption and a whistle-stop campaign featuring a Signing Teapot (Shulman 2015), Coolidge

went on to a comfortable win. The Republican Party platform of 1924 began by reminding voters just

how bad things were when the party took over: “there were four and half million unemployed; industry

and commerce were stagnant; agriculture was prostrate; business was depressed; securities of the

government were selling below their par values” (emphasis added). Now, thanks to Republican rule,

especially its economic policies, things were considerably improved: The federal budget deficit had been

erased, taxes lowered, and “[g]overnment securities increased in value more than $3,000,000,000.” If

holders of liberty bonds behaved as retrospective voters, we would expect them to “Stay Cool with

Coolidge” by rewarding his administration with their votes.

        Although some portion of the fluctuations in liberty bond prices that occurred during 1919-24

was clearly beyond the immediate control of the President or Congress, retrospective voters who owned

liberty bonds and attributed at least some part of the fluctuations in their value to their elected officials

would have been critical of the Democrats in the 1920 election, and supportive of the Republicans. The

historical record indicates that political elites were aware of this potential, and the Republicans

incorporated statements about liberty bond prices and returns into their appeals to voters. But it remains

to be seen whether those appeals were effective, and whether liberty bond ownership actually mattered for

election returns.



4. Data and Methods

        For the purposes of this paper, we assembled a new dataset of county liberty bond subscriptions

for several Federal Reserve Districts. In this section we provide a brief overview of our sources and

variable definitions; more detail is provided in the Appendix.

        Our subscription data were collected from pamphlets published by the Federal Reserve Banks’

liberty loan committees, which presented information on sales of one or more liberty loans to help with

marketing a subsequent loan. We focus our analysis on the Fourth Liberty Loan, the largest issue, and

the one for which we found data for the greatest number of counties. As we are interested in voting

outcomes, we utilize data on subscription rates, defined as the number of subscribers reported for a

county, divided by the county’s 1920 population. The fourth loan had the highest participation rates of all

the loans, and the subscription rate for that loan provides a reliable indicator for the minimum extent to

which the county participated in the liberty bond drives.

        We match these liberty bond subscription rates to data on county voting patterns from a dataset

compiled by Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale (2006). In order to control for county characteristics, we also

match these counties to 1920 county characteristics reported in historical federal censuses, compiled in

                                                       14
Haines (2010). Summary statistics for the 1920 values of the main variables in the dataset are presented

in Table 2. As we are focused on electoral outcomes, these summary statistics, and all of the subsequent

statistical analysis, are weighted by 1920 population.

        Our liberty bond subscription data is illustrated in Figure 2, which presents a map of the counties

for which we have data for the fourth loan, shaded by the level of subscriptions. The irregular pattern of

coverage reflects the fact that we have data for this loan from the Fourth District (Cleveland Fed), Fifth

District (Richmond), Eighth District (St. Louis), Ninth District (Minneapolis), and Twelfth (San

Francisco), plus the state of Iowa. The data in the figure present some clear regional patterns:

subscription rates were relatively low south of the Mason-Dixon line and higher in the upper Midwest and

West.

        This presents a challenge for the analysis: geographical variation in liberty bond participation

rates may produce spurious correlations with variables with similar geographic patterns, including voting

outcomes. In order to address this issue, we estimate the effects of liberty bonds in a panel framework

with county fixed effects and state-year fixed effects, so that the influence of any fixed county

characteristics (such as location) are eliminated, and the differences over time are estimated only from

variation within states’ borders. Later in the analysis, we will also utilize an instrumental variables

framework to address the endogeneity of liberty bond participation rates.



5. Estimation

5.1 OLS Results

        In order to analyze the effects of liberty bond participation on election outcomes, we estimate the

following model of the democratic vote share in presidential elections, from 1908 to 1932:

                                                                    18               ,      (1)

where    is a county fixed effect,    is state-by-year fixed effects,                        18 is an

interaction between the county’s liberty loan participation rate and an indicator for elections in the years

following the liberty loan campaign, and        is a vector of 1920 county characteristics, also interacted

                                                      15
with a post-1918 indicator. The main coefficient of interest is , which represents the differential effect

of liberty loan participation in elections following the liberty loan campaigns.

        Table 4 presents the results. Column (1) in Panel A presents the estimates from a baseline

specification which includes post-1918 interactions with 1920 county homeownership rates and the

fraction of the population residing in major urban areas, variables that likely influenced both liberty bond

participation and electoral outcomes. The estimated effect of liberty bonds implies that a one-standard-

deviation increase in participation led to a decrease in the Democratic Party vote share of about 1.3

percentage points (=-0.12 × 11.1). As the median margin of victory for the Republican Party among the

sample counties was 5.6 percentage points, this effect is modest, but not irrelevant.

        The recession induced by the Fed’s tightening in 1919-20 created significant financial distress,

which was concentrated in agricultural areas (Jaremski and Wheelock, 2018). If the geographical

intensity of these shocks was correlated with liberty bond participation, then this may account for the

change in voting patterns attributed to liberty bond participation in column (1). In order to address this

possibility, in the remaining columns of Panel A, we include variables related to the extent of economic

distress in agriculture as additional controls. Consistent with economic dislocations causing voters to turn

against the Democrats, change in crop income from 1919-24 (column (2)) had a positive effect on the

Democratic vote share, and the amount of suspended bank deposits per capita in 1920 (column (3)) had a

negative effect. During the war years, wheat prices were partly controlled, whereas cotton prices were

not, and wheat farmers resented the Democrats’ preferential treatment of Southern cotton growers

(Bagby, 1962; Burner, 1968). Although the collapse of wheat prices beginning in mid-1920 was not as

severe as that of cotton prices (see the Appendix), wheat farmers may have been especially likely to turn

against the Democrats, and the estimate associated with the fraction of acres devoted to wheat (column

(4)) indicates that this was indeed the case. Yet none of these variables substantially changes the

estimated magnitude of the effect of liberty bonds on election outcomes in the 1920s.

        Many German-Americans opposed Wilson’s decision to enter World War I and resented the

terms of the Treaty of Versailles, while immigrants from other countries opposed the League of Nations

                                                     16
and the Democrats’ anti-immigration agenda (Bagby, 1962; Burner, 1968). For these reasons,

immigrants turned against the Democrats in the early 1920s (Tabellini, 2017). As immigrants were

singled out by the liberty loan campaigns and purchased the bonds at high rates (Hilt and Rahn, 2016),

their voting patterns in the 1920s, which may not have been driven by the returns to owning liberty bonds,

could be responsible for our results. Yet including measures of the fraction German born or foreign born

(Panel B of Table 3, columns (1) and (2)) does not affect the magnitude of the estimated effect of liberty

bonds on the Democrats’ vote share.25 Finally, in columns (3) and (4) of Panel B, measures related to

wealth and inequality—tax returns per capita, and farm tenants per capita—are included. Again, the

parameters associated with liberty bonds are not substantially changed.

         To explore the timing of the estimated effects in greater depth, we re-estimate equation (1) with a

modified specification in which we replace the post-1918 liberty bond interaction with election-by-

election interactions. This enables us to observe the changing magnitudes of the effects over time, and

also to address the possibility that the estimated post-1918 effects represent the outcome of an ongoing

differential trend. The estimates of a specification with all the same controls as that of column (1) in

Table 3 is presented in Figure 4.

         Reassuringly, the pre-1920 estimates display no apparent downward trend over time; the large

negative effect of liberty bond participation appears for the first time in 1920. Liberty bond prices were

relatively stable in the second half of the 1920s, and over time the amount in the hands of the initial

subscribers decreased, and the U.S. Treasury purchased outstanding shares with the proceeds of new debt

offerings. As a result, liberty bond prices lost their political salience over time, and one would expect the

effect of liberty bond subscriptions to diminish substantially after 1924. Consistent with expectations, the




25
  The positive sign of the parameters for German born and foreign born reflects the fact that it is estimated for all
post-1918 presidential elections. In the Appendix, we show results for election-by-election interactions which
indicate a strong negative effect for the share German born in the 1916, 1920 and 1924 elections, which are then
reversed in the 1928 and 1932 elections.

                                                          17
magnitude of the effect of liberty bonds on the Democratic Party vote share decreases significantly in

1928 and 1932, relative to 1924 and 1920.26



5.2 An Instrument: Predicted Severity of Influenza

         The campaign for the fourth loan, which was conducted between September 28 and October 19,

coincided with the beginning of the most significant wave of the 1918 influenza epidemic in the United

States.27 Efforts to promote the fourth loan were hampered by many individuals’ reluctance to attend

public events for fear of exposure to influenza, by sickness and incapacitation among the members of the

organizations tasked with promoting bond sales, by lost incomes due to illness and business closures, and

by measures imposed to halt the spread of the epidemic, such as prohibitions against public assemblies.28

Treasury officials stated that the epidemic created “a great handicap” for the loan campaign.29 The goals

for the campaigns’ total sales were ultimately met, but the subscription rates within the population—the

focus of this study—were likely reduced, as the campaign organizers leaned more heavily on institutional

purchasers to meet their sales goals. If the epidemic reduced subscription rates to varying degrees around

the country, and if it had no consequences on election outcomes beyond those resulting from its effects on

the loan campaigns, then it would represent the source of a valid instrument.

         With regard to the exclusion restriction, there is some evidence that the influenza epidemic did

not have significant direct electoral consequences. Achen and Bartels, for example, review the existing

literature and present a careful analysis of the 1918 Congressional elections. They conclude that voters

“thought of the pandemic as part of the natural world rather than as part of the social world” and did not

punish incumbents in places where the outbreak was more severe (2004: pg. 34).
26
   One concern that might be raised about these estimates is that they focus only on the fourth loan, whereas the
population clearly also subscribed to the other loans. In the Appendix, we show that these results are robust to
controlling for participation in the second and third loans for the limited set of counties for which we have data for
all three loans.
27
   The 1918 influenza epidemic occurred in three waves: the first around March of 1918, the second and most
widespread and deadly in the fall of 1918, and the third in early 1919. See Crosby (2003) and Byerly (2005).
28
   The latter included prohibitions against public gatherings, which resulted in the cancellation of some Liberty Loan
parades and rallies; the closure of movie theaters, where the bond purchases were promoted; and the closure of
churches and schools. See Bootsma and Ferguson (2007).

        The severity of the outbreak did vary significantly across the country. Influenza deaths per

100,000 residents for seven major cities are plotted in Figure 5. Among the cities in the figure, there was

considerable variation in the severity of the influenza epidemic, both during the fourth loan campaign and

overall, with Philadelphia enduring more than 600 deaths per day during the week of October 19, whereas

Portland and Minneapolis suffered to a far lesser extent. Unfortunately, data on influenza deaths are

available only for a small number of cities, and deaths from all causes are available only for a few

hundred.30

        Yet the observed death rate from the disease may not, in fact, accurately reflect the extent to

which the influenza epidemic hampered the fourth loan campaign. Efforts to halt the spread of the

disease, such as local prohibitions against public gatherings, likely suppressed both influenza and the

bond drive.31 Alternatively, in cities where the campaign was permitted to be prosecuted aggressively

with large parades and public rallies, the bond drive may have spread influenza and increased the number

of deaths from the epidemic.32 Both cases would produce a positive correlation between liberty bond

participation and influenza deaths, obscuring the deeper negative relationship between the two.

        Instead, we utilize a measure of the predicted severity of the epidemic, based on proximity to its

source within the United States: military camps. During the war, draftees were sent mainly to 32 large

camps to receive training, and sometimes later sent to a handful of additional camps to prepare for

deployment overseas. These camps were often quite overcrowded, and as they were populated by young

men—those at an age that made them unusually vulnerable to the 1918 influenza—they constituted an

30
   Weekly data on influenza deaths are available for 45 American cities. Unfortunately, the cities are not
geographically representative (five are located in Massachusetts alone), and are often incomplete—many cities made
influenza a reportable cause of death well after the death rate from influenza had risen significantly. The raw data
are from US Bureau of the Census (1917-1920), and also reported in Ministry of Health (1920) and Crosby (2003).
Monthly data on deaths from all causes are available for about 530 cities in about 370 counties in US Bureau of the
Census (1920).
31
   Suggestive evidence of the effectiveness of these measures is presented in Hatchett et al (2007), Bootsma and
Ferguson (2007), and Markel et al (2007).
32
   For example, the decision of the Mayor of Philadelphia to permit a huge Liberty Loan parade to be held on
September 28, against the objections of some local public health officials, may have contributed to the severity of
the outbreak in that city (Hatchett et al., 2007). Crosby (2003:53) notes that public health officials in Chicago
permitted a Liberty Loan parade to be held, but in a reflection of the state of medical knowledge at the time,
“instructed all of the marchers to go home right afterwards, remove all clothing, rub the body dry, [and] take a
laxative” in order to reduce the risk of contracting influenza.

                                                        19
ideal environment for the spread of the epidemic.33 Although the camps were put under quarantine when

large numbers of soldiers fell ill, these quarantines were often enacted too late and enforced imperfectly,

making the armed forces “the foci from which the civilian population received the disease.”34

        The locations of the military’s camps are shown in Figure 6. Proximity to these camps has been

linked to the severity of the influenza epidemic; Crosby (2003:71), for example, suggests that

Philadelphia’s location near both Camp Dix and Camp Meade contributed to the outbreak in that city.

In addition, the movements of troops spread influenza not only among the camps, but also into the

civilian populations along the routes followed by railroads that connected the camps’ locations. We

therefore use the average distance from a county to each of the camps, depicted in Figure 6A, as our

measure of predicted flu severity. These distances for our sample counties are illustrated in Figure 6B.

        To verify that these distances are correlated with the severity of the 1918 influenza outbreak, we

investigate their relationship with mortality rates within the 369 counties for which deaths from all causes

can be observed.35 And in order to verify that any October 1918 mortality effect does not simply reflect

something present in all months (say, due to persistent differences in public health conditions or

demographics), the relationship between county distance to the camps and mortality is estimated for every

month in 1917 and 1918, in a framework with county fixed effects. The estimated coefficients, presented

in Figure 7, show very clearly that distance to the camps was an important determinant of county

mortality in October 1918, but not in other months. The negative effect on mortality in October 1918 has

a large standard error but is nonetheless consistent with a substantial mortality advantage during the fall

influenza outbreak.




33
   The influenza epidemic was so acute within the military that total deaths due to influenza among American
military personnel were similar in number to deaths in combat. See Byerly (2010).
34
   Crosby (2003: 56). Similarly, Byerly (2005: 79) notes that “the epidemic in the United States most likely
originated in military installations.”
35
   These data are constructed from monthly death rates from around 530 cities located in 369 counties. The city data
are summed for each county, and then divided by the county’s 1920 population. This introduces some noise into the
measure, both because some counties contained cities for which no death data are reported, and because the county
population was likely different in 1918. The raw data are from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1920).

                                                        20
        The validity of the distance measure as an instrument for participation in the fourth loan is

explored in Table 6. The table presents cross sectional regressions of the relationship between distance

to camps and participation in the fourth loan for the 1,426 counties for which we have liberty bond data.

(These are cross-sectional versions of the first stage from the panel regressions presented below.) The

regressions include state fixed effects, which means that the parameter on the distance to camps variable

is estimated only from within-state variation in those distances. The results in columns (1) and (2)

indicate that distance from military camps had a robust positive effect on liberty bond participation,

consistent with greater distances resulting in a less severe outbreak of influenza, and therefore fewer

influenza-related problems in the conduct of the bond drive. In order to address any remaining concern

that the result could be somehow driven by the South, in column (3) all counties from Southern states are

deleted from the sample, and the result remains largely unchanged.

        The mechanism behind the distance measure proposed here is that its effects operate through the

influenza outbreak, and not through other institutional or economic characteristics that may also be

correlated with distance from the camps. In order to address the latter possibility, column (4) presents a

falsification test: the distance measure (and other county characteristics) are regressed on participation

rates for the third liberty loan, which was conducted in April 1918—before the lethal influenza outbreak

in the fall. If distance to the camps led to higher participation in the fourth loan because it was correlated

with institutional or economic characteristics associated with greater wealth or higher levels of civic

engagement, then it should also be correlated with higher participation in the third loan. Yet the estimate

in column (4) indicates that its effect on the third loan is far smaller. Reassuringly, most of the other

estimates are similar to those in column (2), indicating that the determinants of participation in the third

loan were generally similar to those of the fourth loan.

        Additional evidence in support of the hypothesized relationship among distance from the camps,

influenza, and the fourth loan campaign can be found in an official account of the progress of the drive for




                                                      21
the fourth loan printed in newspapers on October 18, including the New York Times.36 The statement

included one-sentence accounts of the state of the campaign in each district, some of which mentioned

problems related to influenza, whereas others did not. For example, the statement from the Federal

Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was “Making a real battle against enormous odds caused chiefly by

influenza,” whereas that of San Francisco said simply “Maintaining steady increase in face of bad

agricultural conditions in some sections.” Comparing the average distance to military camps among the

counties in districts where influenza was and was not mentioned as an important hindrance to the loan

drive reveals that the districts where influenza was not mentioned were indeed located farther away from

the military camps, by about 215 km.37



5.3 IV Estimation

         We now turn to IV estimation of our model. The equation to be estimated is the same as (1), with

county and state-year fixed effects, only the                               18 variable will be instrumented with

                            18 . The results are presented in Table 5.38

         Column (1) in the table presents baseline OLS results, and column (2) presents the results of the

same specification estimated with 2SLS. The main parameter of interest, the effect of liberty bond

participation on the Democratic Party vote share, is more than twice as large than the OLS estimate. The

greater magnitude of the estimate may reflect the subset of the population from which the parameter is

identified: persons who were induced to purchase liberty bonds, or not to purchase liberty bonds, purely

as a result of their county’s distance to military camps (and therefore, the local severity of the influenza

epidemic). The severity of the influenza epidemic impacted the conduct of the liberty loan campaign,

often resulting in canceled parades and rallies. Investors who purchased liberty bonds due to the relative

mildness of the influenza epidemic in their area were therefore likely induced to do so by attending one of

those events. They are therefore likely to have been less committed to purchasing liberty bonds, either

due to financial resources or ideology, and probably can be thought of as marginal investors in the bonds.

These are exactly the investors for whom a fall in the bond’s prices would have constituted a surprise and

betrayal, and it is not unreasonable to imagine that they may have responded to a greater extent in their

voting than the average liberty bond investor. It is not surprising that the local average treatment effect

for this subgroup could be quite large.

           Columns (3)-(5) add some of the same controls as in Table 4; the first stage of each equation is

presented in the lower panel.       Particularly important is the regression in column (5), where we control

for the fraction of the county’s agricultural acreage devoted to wheat. As noted above, wheat farmers

may have been particularly resentful against the Democrats, and the average distance to military camps

was often quite high in the wheat-growing regions of the upper West.39 The positive correlation between

the instrument and this marker for differential hostility to the Democratic Party could therefore explain

our IV results. Yet controlling for wheat acreage does not change our main estimates.

           Our preferred specification is that of column (2). The estimated effect of liberty bonds implies

that a one-standard-deviation increase in subscription rates led to a 3.3 percentage point (=-29.9 × 0.11)

decline in the Democratic Party’s vote share in the elections of the 1920s. Another way to judge the size

of this effect is to note that it implies that the Democratic Party’s vote share fell by a population-weighted

6.1 percentage points on average across all sample counties, due to the effects of liberty bonds. This is a

reasonably large effect, but it is estimated for only about half of American counties. To determine

whether it was actually decisive, we later estimate a similar model at the state level.

           One natural concern about these results relates to the exclusion restriction for the instrument.

One can certainly imagine channels through which proximity to military bases may have influenced

electoral outcomes that were unrelated to influenza. However, it is worth noting that many of these

potential channels would operate in the opposite direction of the one observed. For example, some of the

military camps were closed at the end of World War I, and one might imagine that the decline of

economic activity associated with the demobilization in the areas surrounding the camps may have led to

39
     The correlation between the distance instrument and wheat acreage is 0.171.

                                                           23
discontent with incumbent politicians. Yet Table 6 presents the reduced-form version of our IV model

and shows that the effect was the opposite: the closer a county was to military camps, the less likely they

were to turn against the incumbent Democrats in 1920 or toward the incumbent Republicans in 1924.

Similarly, one might imagine that high levels of influenza mortality may have led to frustrations with the

public response to the epidemic, leading to discontent with incumbents. Yet once again, the effect is the

opposite: places with lower flu mortality were more likely to turn against the incumbent Democrats to a

greater extent, relative to their historical voting patterns.



5.4 Further Validation of the Instrument: Household-level Data

        Additional insight into the mechanisms through which the instrument influenced liberty bond

subscriptions can be found in the micro-level data from the 1918-19 BLS survey, available in Olney

(2005). The survey was administered in 99 different cities, creating variation in the distance measure

among the responding households, and the survey instrument accounted for all household income,

expenditures, and savings. In addition, the survey dates ranged from July 1918—before the fourth liberty

loan and the influenza outbreak—until February 1919, well afterwards. Comparisons between surveys

from before and after the fourth loan can therefore serve as additional falsification tests for the

instrument; distance to the military camps should not matter for liberty bond subscription rates until the

fourth loan and the influenza outbreak of October 1918.

         Table 7 presents the results of household-level regressions of a binary indicator for the purchase

of a liberty bond within the previous year on various household characteristics. Column (1) presents a

baseline specification, using surveys administered following the fourth liberty loan campaign. The

reported estimates indicate that greater log income was associated with a higher probability of liberty

bond purchases, and, consistent with the IV results presented above, greater distance from the military

camps was also associated with a higher probability of a liberty bond purchase. But in addition, the

regression includes an interaction between log income and distance, and the estimated effect is negative:

in cities farther away from military camps, the effect of log income on liberty bond subscriptions was

                                                        24
smaller. If this is an indication that the more extensive loan campaigns conducted in regions where the

influenza outbreak was less severe, then this could account for the greater magnitude of the IV estimates

presented above.

        Column (2) adds an indicator equal to one if a household subscribed to a newspaper in the past

year (as indicated in the survey by some amount spent on newspapers). This is positively associated with

liberty bond purchases, indicating that better-informed households were more likely to subscribe. The

estimated interaction between newspaper subscriptions and distance reported in the table is negative, a

possible indication that the more extensive liberty loan campaigns in the regions where influenza was less

severe reached less-informed households. However, this effect is imprecisely estimated.

        Finally, columns (3) and (4) estimate the same regressions using the responses to the survey

administered prior to the fourth loan and the influenza outbreak. These likely reflect the effects of the

third liberty loan campaign. The results indicate that, as in columns (1) and (2), household income was an

important determinant of liberty bond purchases. However, distance to the military camps was not, and

there was no income-distance gradient as with the fourth loan. This is inconsistent with the notion that

distance to the camps led to liberty bond subscriptions through some mechanism other than influenza.



5.5 Mechanisms Behind the Effects

        We argue that fluctuations in the liberty bonds’ values induced voters to punish or reward

incumbents in presidential elections. An alternative explanation for our results could be that the

ownership of financial assets caused voters to join the investor class and support business-friendly

politicians. As the business-friendly candidates were the Republicans, the empirical implications of the

alternative story are the same.

        Some suggestive evidence of the importance of the price fluctuations can be found in Republican

political rhetoric, which appealed to liberty bond subscribers not merely as securities holders, but as the

owners of depreciated securities. For example, among the most contentious issues in 1920s politics was

the plight of World War I veterans, and proposals to pay them a bonus in compensation for the low (real)

                                                     25
value of the wages they had received during the war. Harding rejected such proposals during the 1920

campaign, arguing that the additional borrowing they required would cause a further depreciation in

liberty bond prices.40 When Congress later passed a bonus bill, President Harding vetoed it.41

        Additional evidence can be found by examining the outcomes of Congressional elections. The

sale of the liberty bonds and the subsequent policy decisions that influenced liberty bond prices, were

conducted by the executive branch. Voters upset about price depreciations or pleased with price

appreciations should have responded by punishing or rewarding the incumbent in presidential elections.

They would therefore be more likely to vote in Congressional elections in presidential election years. In

contrast, if voters’ holdings of liberty bonds made them feel like members of the investor class and

supportive of business-friendly policies, they should have voted for Republicans at higher rates in all

elections, including mid-term Congressional elections.

        In Table 8, we present results of regressions of the same specification as above, but for

Congressional elections. Columns (1) and (3) present the results for presidential election years, whereas

(2) and (4) present results for mid-term elections. The estimated effect of liberty bond subscriptions on

the Democratic vote share in presidential election years is quite similar to those presented in Tables 3 and

5. But the effect in mid-term elections is considerably smaller, and statistically insignificant. This

implies that voters were not simply turning to the Republicans in all elections, but were voting

Republican in elections in which the policymakers responsible for liberty bond values were on the ballot.



6 The 1920 Election: Results from State Data

        Finally, we investigate whether or not the estimated effects of liberty bonds on election outcomes

were decisive, by re-estimating (1) using OLS and 2SLS with state data. Our instrument for liberty bond

participation is re-calculated as the population-weighted average distance of all of a state’s counties to the


40
   The New York Times, “Harding In Doubt As to Bonus Bonds,” 4 September 1920: “After remarking that a cash
bonus would cost perhaps $2,000,000,000 Mr. Harding said: ‘Now, with our present Liberty bonds below par, what
would be the result if we proceeded to issue more bonds?’”

   A veteran’s bonus was finally paid in 1936; see Hausman (2016).

                                                      26
military camps. As we are limited to 48 states, we view this analysis as a simple exercise in which we

can assess the plausibility of our estimates and determine whether they could have been decisive. But it

also enables us to verify that the effects we found for our sample of counties are not unique to those

regions of the country, as the state data includes the entire United States.

           The results are presented in Table 9. The baseline OLS estimate presented in column (1) is larger

than that obtained from county data, reflecting both the differences in the level of aggregation of the data,

and the fact that the state data covers a broader geographical area. The 2SLS estimate in column (2) is

again larger than the OLS estimate but the ratio of the two is roughly similar to that obtained from the

county data. As with the county data, the distance measure creates a strong first stage, minimizing any

concerns regarding weak instruments.

           In order to determine whether these effects were decisive, we calculate counterfactual Democratic

Party vote shares for the 1920 election, assuming that the liberty loan campaigns had never been held, and

therefore the subscription rates for liberty loans were zero. That is, for each state, we calculate a new

Democratic vote share as the old one plus the added share from setting the liberty bond subscription rate

to zero, or                            .

           The 1920 election was a Republican landslide, with electoral vote totals of 404 to 127. Our

estimates imply that in the absence of the liberty bond campaigns, the Democrats would have won 12

additional states, and the electoral vote totals would have been 292(R) to 239(D).42 Thus, this exercise

indicates that the effects of liberty bond ownership likely did not tip the balance in the outcome of the

election. The Republicans still would have won, only in less of a landslide.



7. Conclusion

           This paper has investigated the political effects of the liberty bond drives of World War I. Our

analysis indicates that counties that subscribed to the bonds at higher rates turned against the Democratic

Party in the 1920 and 1924 presidential elections, relative their voting patterns over the previous decade.
42
     The actual and counterfactual vote shares for each state are presented in section 3.6 of the Appendix.

The 1920s were a period in which the Republicans dominated American politics, and the effects of liberty

bond ownership contributed significantly to that development, although they were unlikely to have had

decisive effects.

        As David Mayhew (2005) reminds us, wars have had significant consequences for the path of

American political development. Wars “generate new ideas, issues, programs, [and] preferences,” the

effects of which set policy agendas and forge new electoral coalitions. The need to finance the massive

expenditures required for America’s participation in the Great War led Treasury Secretary McAdoo to

conceive of Liberty Bonds and a new way to market the government’s war debt. Their very design

embodied a hoped-for policy feedback effect in the form of greater support for the war. However, an

unintended consequence of this attempt to engineer policy feedback was to turn citizen investors into

Republicans.

        This outcome likely reflected voters’ assessments of economic policy outcomes under Democrats

and Republicans. Liberty bonds depreciated substantially in late 1919 and in 1920, which came as a

shock to many subscribers who had not understood the risks of their investments. This was partly due to

McAdoo’s decision to mass-market negotiable securities to inexperienced investors, and to his

successors’ reluctance to allow the Fed to increase interest rates in early 1919, which contributed to the

Fed’s decision to increase them quite dramatically when they were finally permitted to do so. Then

subsequent Republican Administrations benefitted from the timing of those rate increases, as the Fed

finally eased rates in 1921 and 1922, and again in 1924, and liberty bond holders experienced substantial

capital gains. This made voters receptive to Republican campaign messages that their leadership

promoted prosperity.

        Our results constitute clear evidence that the composition of assets owned by households can

influence their political behavior. In our context, bond ownership made the finances of ordinary

American households more sensitive to changes in financial markets, which led them to reject incumbents

who had presided over asset price decreases, and to support political candidates who claimed that they

had brought fiscal stability and higher bond prices. This is consistent with a ‘pocketbook’ view of

                                                     28
retrospective voting behavior. But this result may not generalize to modern households. During World

War I Americans were pressured to buy liberty bonds by their government. This made the impacts on

households’ wealth in response to market fluctuations a direct consequence of government policy.43

Although the ownership of equities by modern households is related to government policy choices, such

as the changes in the tax code that led to the proliferation of 401(k) plans or the creation of new, tax-

exempt investment vehicles such as 529 college savings plans, the connection is less direct, and

government promotion of asset ownership more subtle and less nationalistic, than in the early twentieth

century. The value of modern households’ financial assets may therefore not have the same political

significance.

        Policymakers learned lessons, both positive and negative, from the Liberty Bonds experience.

When the federal debt grew during the Great Depression, then-Treasury Secretary Morganthau introduced

“baby bonds” (savings bonds)—government securities sold through the nation’s post offices on a

continual basis, that were, by design, nonnegotiable. These bonds protected investors from price

fluctuations, and they could be redeemed on demand according to a schedule that incentivized longer

holding periods (Garbade 2012). The “baby bonds,” known formally as Series A, B, C, and D, were

described as “a Share in America” (Olney 1971), and Morgenthau, like McAdoo before him, believed that

their ownership would increase the attachment of ordinary Americans to their nation (Kimble 2006). The

safety of Depression-era “baby bonds” provided the blueprint for the Series E savings bonds used to

finance World War II (Morse 1971; Olney 1971). The marketing of Series E bonds replicated the liberty

loan drives, including the use of short, concentrated, campaigns, and the mobilization of civil society

organizations as a salesforce. To the toolkit inherited from World War I, organizers added the modern

medium of radio and hired social scientists to evaluate bond messaging and “segment” the bond-buying

43
  Achen and Bartels (2016) recently have questioned whether retrospective voting is desirable from the standpoint
of democratic accountability given evidence that voters appear to punish political incumbents for events over which
they have no control such as shark attacks, droughts, or college football team losses (Healy, Malhotra, and Mo
2010). Our view is that liberty bond holders were “reasonably,” rather than “blindly,” retrospective given
government promotion of bond ownership, and policies, such as the Bond Purchase Fund, to protect their prices. In
addition, Republican party campaign rhetoric encouraged voters to blame to Democrats for low bond prices in 1920
and to credit Republicans for their recovery in 1924.

                                                        29
public into discrete target audiences (Samuel 1997). But most importantly, the bonds retained the non-

negotiability of Morganthau’s “baby bonds,” protecting the ordinary households that were induced to

support the war effort from subsequent fluctuations in interest rates.

        But another important legacy of liberty bonds was the experience of one noteworthy subscriber,

Harry Truman. After returning from World War I, Truman had to sell his family’s liberty bonds at

severely depreciated prices to raise money, an experience that apparently infuriated him and made him

suspicious of the motives behind Fed policy. He of course became President in 1945, and at that time the

Fed maintained a wartime policy of actively supporting the prices of government securities by purchasing

large quantities of them. After the end of World War II, in response to high inflation, the Fed sought to

end this policy, but was vigorously opposed by Truman and the Treasury. In 1951, with the Korean War

underway and very high inflation prevailing, the conflict between the Fed and Truman intensified, and

Truman took the extraordinary step of asking the entire Federal Open Market Committee to meet with

him in the Oval Office. In that meeting, Truman stated that he did not want “the people who hold our

bonds now to have done to them what was done to him.”44 The conflict escalated further, and was

ultimately resolved through the negotiation of the Treasury-Fed Accord, which established the

foundations of the Fed’s modern independence.45 In more ways than one, liberty bonds shaped the

evolution of American monetary and fiscal institutions.

                        Figure 5: Weekly Deaths Per 100,000 Residents
               From Influenza and Pneumonia, 14 September - 28 December 1918
The figure plots the number of deaths each week from influenza and pneumonia relative to the city’s July 1
1918 estimated population, per 100,000 residents, for seven cities. Deaths from the 1918 influenza were
associated with acute bronchial pneumonia; thus deaths from pneumonia are also included. The line for
each city is labeled at the point of its peak death rate. The first data point for each city corresponds to the
first week during which influenza is reported as a cause of death. The raw data are from US Bureau of the
Census (1917-1920), and also reported in Ministry of Health (1920) and Crosby (2003).

1. Data: Sources and definitions
1.1 Liberty bond subscription rates
         For the purposes of this paper, we assembled a dataset of liberty bond subscriptions at the county
level for several Federal Reserve Districts from documents found in a number of different archives.
These were mostly pamphlets published by the Federal Reserve Banks’ liberty loan committees or by
state-level liberty loan committees, which were produced as part of the effort to market the victory loan.
          The sources were as follows. For the fourth district, Figuregram for the Fifth or Victory Liberty
Loan in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, Also Important Data on the First Four Loans. Cleveland,
OH: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. For the fifth district, Report on Subscriptions to the Fourth
Liberty Loan of 1918 for the 5th Federal Reserve District. Compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond. For the eighth district, Subscriptions to the Fourth Liberty Loan [Separate Issues by State].
War Loan Organization, St. Louis. For the ninth district, the September 8 1919 issue of the Liberty Bell
magazine, published by the Minneapolis Fed, included county-level subscription data. For the twelfth
district, Fourth Liberty Loan: Report of Amount of Subscriptions, Quotas, Percentage Subscribed,
Number of Subscriptions, and Percentage Population Subscribed. Issued by Liberty Loan General
Executive Board, San Francisco CA. Finally, we also have data for Iowa, which is part of the seventh
district, from Sale of War Bonds in Iowa, by Nathaniel B. Whitney, published by the State Historical
Society of Iowa in 1923. Most of these publications were found at the National Archives, in Princeton
University’s Mudd Manuscript Library, or the Library of Congress.
         Most of these pamphlets do not describe how the data they present were compiled. The pamphlet
from the Richmond Fed, however, does present some information on the methods they used in producing
their tables. They reported that they sent forms to all the banks in the district asking for the number of
subscribers, and in cases where they did not get a reply, they sought information from the leadership of
county liberty loan committees. They also stated that they allocated the subscriptions obtained from large
corporations to the counties where the individual subscribers resided, and they also allocated all other
subscriptions to the counties where the subscribers resided, even if they subscribed through a bank located
in another county.
         We lack data for the first district (Boston Fed), second (New York), third (Philadelphia), sixth
(Atlanta), seventh (Chicago), tenth (Kansas City) and eleventh (Dallas.) These districts do not appear to
have published any county level records for subscriptions to the fourth loan. In the cases of Boston,
Philadelphia and New York, this likely reflects the fact that those reserve banks were more focused on the
sales of liberty bonds to wealthy individuals and institutions; compiling subscription data for small rural
counties in their districts for use in marketing subsequent bond issues in those districts, was probably seen
as not very cost-effective. The New York Fed, for example, grouped its New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut counties into six ‘districts’ and compiled some limited data for those, whereas the Chicago
Fed seems to have compiled only state-level data.
      Table A1 presents some data obtained from an internal memorandum found in the archives of the
New York Fed, which help explain why that institution was less focused on compiling county level data.

         These data show that the total value of the subscriptions of the 106 individuals and institutions
who subscribed to $1 million or more of the bond issue was actually greater than the total amount
purchased by the 2.17 million individuals who subscribed for $10,000 or less. Clearly, in order to
effectively sell large amounts of these bonds, the Liberty Loan Committee in the second district needed to
focus on a relatively small number of institutions and individuals, nearly all of whom were likely located
in New York City. (The fact that the smallest amount reported is $10,000 or less is a further indication
that they were less focused on small subscribers.)
        Liberty bond subscription rates are calculated as the total number of subscribers divided by the
county population, as reported in the 1920 federal census.

        We obtain county level data on the Democratic Party vote share in presidential elections from
1908 to 1932 from Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale (2006). State level data on election outcomes was
obtained from uselectionatlas.org.
1.3 County characteristics
         Most of the 1920 county characteristics were obtained from Haines (2010). We obtained banking
data for 1920 from FDIC (1992), and some additional county data from the 1925 agricultural census was
shared with us by Price Fishback. The definitions of the main variables are as follows, with the variable
names from Haines (2010) or FDIC (1992).
        Home ownership rate, 1920: owned homes (OWNHOM)/total homes (TOTHOM)
      Banks per square mile, 1920: total number of banks, 1920 (V42 in ICPSR 7) / total area of county
(AREA).
        Fraction residing in major urban areas, 1920: fraction of the population residing in cities of
25,000 or more (URB25) /total 1920 population (TOTPOP).
        Log(population), 1920: log value of TOTPOP.

     Share of the population engaged in agriculture, 1920: this is calculated as total number of farms
(FARMS)/total number of families (FAMILIES).
       Suspended bank deposits per capita, 1920: [suspended deposits of national banks (V93) +
suspended deposits of state banks (V127)]/TOTPOP.
        Farm tenants per capita, 1920: farm tenants (FARMTEN)/total families (FAMILIES)
        Change in crop income per capita, 1919-24: (value of crops, 1924 - value of same crops, 1919
[from Fishback])/TOTPOP.
        Change in farm values per capita, 1920-25: from Fishback: (value of farm land and buildings,
1925 [from Fishback] – FARMVAL – FARMBUI)/TOTPOP.
     Tax returns per capita, 1921: from Fishback: total number of tax returns, 1921[from Fishback] /
TOTPOP.
        Fraction acres devoted to wheat, 1924: wheat acres, 1924 [from Fishback] / total acres in farms,
1925 [from Fishback].
1.4 Distance to camps instrument
        The names and states of all World War I military training camps inside the United States were
obtained from U.S. War Department (1920: 1519). Other sources were then consulted to find the county
in which each camp was located. The average distance measure to the camps for each county (the
instrument) was then calculated as the mean value of the distance from each county centroid to the
centroids of the counties in which the camps were located.

2. Campaign advertisements, editorials: Examples

         In order to investigate whether liberty loan prices were reflected in campaign advertising and
rhetoric, full-text searchable newspaper indexes were used to find articles and advertisements containing
terms such as Harding and liberty bonds in the presence of terms such as ‘depreciated’ or ‘below par.’

        Among the most prominent results was an ad, identified as having been paid for by the
Republican National Committee, which ran in a number of western and border states in October of 1920.
This ad, an excerpt of which is displayed as Figure A1 below, prominently mentioned the depressed
prices of liberty bonds, and the “sacrifices” subscribers had to make if they need to sell their bonds to
raise money in the “abnormal conditions” of the fall of 1920. The low prices of liberty bonds were then
linked to what the ad described as mismanagement and waste in the war effort and in public finances
generally.

        At the time, American newspapers were generally quite partisan. Many Republican newspapers
during the campaign season ran editorials attacking the Democrats for the low prices of liberty bonds, and
praising Harding’s statement that they “should make” liberty bonds “worth all its patriotic citizens paid in
purchasing them.” Typical examples of editorials in local Republican papers are presented as Figures A1
to A5 below.

3. Analysis: Additional details and results

3.1 Cumulative returns

        Figure 2 in the paper presents nominal and real cumulative returns for the fourth liberty loan.
Each point in the graph represents the total return earned by a subscriber to the bonds from the time of
                                                                               .
issue. The nominal cumulative return at month t is calculated as ∏       1                       1, where
   is the price of the bond in period t. The annual coupon rate was 4.25%; these calculations effectively
assume that 1/12 of the coupon income is received in each month. The real rate of return is calculated as
         .

∏                                              1, where       is the monthly inflation rate as reflected in the CPI.
       Figure 2 also presents cumulative returns only for the 4th loan. Below in Figure A6, we present
cumulative returns for both the 4th and the 3rd loan, which was the second most widely held issue.

                                                  Cumulative Returns, 3rd and 4th Liberty Loans

The patterns over time are fundamentally similar, but the 3rd loan did not depreciate to the same extent as
the 4th, and its cumulative returns by late 1920 were not as negative.

3.2 Including additional liberty bond issues in the analysis

         All of the analysis of the paper focuses on the participation rates for the fourth liberty loan, which
was the largest and most widely-held of all the liberty loan issues. Yet the population clearly subscribed
to the other loans as well, and those subscription rates are not included in the analysis. The fourth loan
subscription rights might therefore be regarded as measuring the overall subscription rates with error. If


                                                                                A7
this were the case, our instrumental variable estimates will address the problem. However, a different
way to conceptualize the issue would be that we have a problem of omitted variables. If, say, one of the
other loan campaigns were independently politically important, the regression estimates based on the
fourth loan only would suffer from omitted variable bias. We explore this possibility in Table A2 below,
which presents regressions of changes in the Democratic vote share on the participation rates in loans 2
through 4, for the limited set of counties for which we have data for all three.46

     Note: this table presents OLS regressions of the effect of liberty loan participation on the Democratic Party
     vote share in presidential elections, in a panel of counties. In column (1), all counties for which we have data
     for the fourth loan are used. In column (2), counties for which we have data for loans 2-4 are used. And in
     column (3), participation rates in loans 2 and 3 are included in the regressions. All regressions weighted by
     1920 county population. Robust standard errors clustered by county presented in parentheses. ** p<0.01, *
     p<0.05, + p<0.1

     In column (1), we present the results of a regression in which we include only the fourth loan, with
no additional county characteristics included as controls, using the full sample of counties for which we
have data for the fourth loan. The set of counties for which we also have data for the third and second
loans is considerably smaller, and to verify that the effects of the fourth loan are the same in those
counties, in column (2) we restrict the analysis to the counties for which we have data for all three loans.
The estimated effect of participation in the fourth loan is quite similar. Finally, in column (3) we add the
participation rates for the second and third loans. The estimated effect of the forth loan is essentially
unchanged, implying that excluding participation in the other loans from the regressions in the paper does
not substantially bias the estimated effect of participation in the fourth loan.

   We do have some data for the first and 5th victory loans as well, but the set of counties for which we have data for
all of the loans is extremely small, just a few hundred.

replaced by Fed district-by-year fixed effects, because with the Fed district-by-year fixed effects, the
estimates using the small sample of counties for which we have data on all three loans are somewhat more
precise.

3.3 Wheat price controls and the 1920 election

        During the war years, wheat prices were partly controlled, whereas cotton prices were not. As we
document in the paper, this contributed to resentments against the Democratic Party in wheat growing
areas, which was seen as favoring Southern cotton producers. Here we document the evolution of wheat
and cotton prices in order to assess the significance of this issues.

                                                               Cotton prices

                                  Wheat and Cotton Prices, 1914-1925
        The figure plots monthly prices for number 2 red winter wheat, as quoted in Chicago, and
        for middling cotton, as quoted in New Orleans, as reported in US Dept of Labor, Bureau
        of Labor Statistics Wholesale Prices: Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (various
        issues). The values for January 1914 are set to 100.

         Figure A7 presents monthly indexes of wheat and cotton prices from 1914 to 1925, where the
January 1914 value is set to 100. The period in which wheat prices were actually is visible in the figure,
and followed a large spike in wheat prices. That cotton prices were rising around the time that wheat
prices were controlled likely contributed to the resentments of wheat farmers.
         On the other hand, wheat prices were relatively quickly uncontrolled, and cotton prices actually
fell much more than wheat prices prior to the 1920 election. We conclude that although the decision to
control wheat prices and leave cotton prices uncontrolled may have contributed to political resentments
against the Democrats for favoring the South, the economic harm suffered by the wheat farmers in the
months prior to the 1920 election was unlikely to have been greater than that suffered by cotton farmers.

3.4 Effect of the German born on election outcomes

         Regression estimates presented in the Table 3 of the paper do not offer any support for the notion
that the German born or foreign born were responsible for the effects of liberty bonds on election
outcomes that are the focus of this paper. One somewhat puzzling element of those results is that the

                                                                   A9
estimated effects of the German born and foreign born population on the Democratic vote share are
positive for the post-1918 period, whereas Bagby’s (1962) analysis, and Tabellini’s (2017) results,
suggest that it should be negative. To investigate this further, regressions with election-by-election
interactions were estimated. The estimates for the effect of the share German born are presented in Figure
A8.

                       Election-by-Election Effects of German-Born Population

         The estimates in Figure A8 make it clear why the post-1918 effect of the German born was found
to be positive and imprecisely estimated. Counties with large numbers of German born residents turned
against the Democrats in 1916, 1920 and 1924 only; in 1928 and 1932, those counties voted for the
Democrats at roughly the same rate as they did in 1908 and 1912. The effects identified by Bagby
(1962) were apparently reversed in 1928 and 1932. (The estimated effects of liberty bond participation in
the regression that produced those estimates is substantially the same as in regressions in which the
fraction German born are excluded.)

3.5 Evidence of influenza’s effect on fourth loan from the New York Times

         An official account of the progress of the fourth loan, released by the CPI and printed in
newspapers on October 18, including the New York Times, included one-sentence accounts of the state of
the campaign in each district, some of which mentioned problems related to influenza, whereas others did
not. If the mention of influenza in these accounts can be interpreted as a rough indication that the
epidemic inhibited the loan campaign to a greater extent, then comparing the average distance to the
camps for the districts that did and did not mention influenza can provide an additional test of the
mechanisms behind the distance instrument.
         Table A3 presents these comparisons. For each district, the average distance to the camps,
calculated as the population-weighted average distance among every county within the district, is
presented. Those mentioning influenza were indeed located closer to the camps, although the difference
between the two groups, 215 km, is not statistically significant.

3.6 IV results with election-by-election interactions

         In most of the specifications in the paper, we focus on the interaction between liberty bond
subscription rates and in indicator for all post-1918 elections. In order to analyze the temporal pattern of
the effects in greater detail, and to verify that the post-1918 effects do not represent the continuation of a
preexisting trend of some kind in the differences in political behavior of counties with different liberty
bond subscription rates, here we present election-by-election interactions for our IV specification.
         With the IV estimation, the standard errors are quite large. In an effort to gain more precision in
our estimates, we replace the state-by-year fixed effects with Fed district-by-year fixed effects, and
estimate regressions of the form:

                                            ∑                                                  ,    (A1)

where is a county fixed effect,         represents Fed district-by-year fixed effects, ∑
is a series of interactions between a county’s liberty loan participation rate and each election year, and
     includes the same 1920 county characteristics as in column (1) of Table 5 in the paper, the home
ownership rate and the share of the population residing in major urban areas, but interacted with each
election year as well.




                                                        A11
         In order to estimate equation A1 with 2SLS, we instrument for each liberty bond participation by
year interaction with the county’s mean distance to the military camps interacted with that same year. We
therefore have six first-stage regressions for our six included liberty bond interactions.
         We begin with plots of the results, first for OLS. (Figure 4 in the paper presents results for a
similar specification using state-year fixed effects; here we present the results with district-year effects to
be completely consistent with the IV results that follow.) These are presented in Figure A9.

         As in Figure 4 in the paper, these results do not indicate that there was any preexisting trend in
the effect of liberty bond participation on election outcomes. The effect is essentially zero, then becomes
negative for the 1920 and 1924 elections, and then zero again.

         The corresponding IV results are presented in figure A10. In general, the temporal patterns of the
effects are similar to those for OLS, but there are some differences. Most notably, the magnitudes of the
point estimates are much larger. There also seems to be suggestive evidence of an effect in the 1928
election, whereas this was not the case with OLS. And finally, there seems to be an effect in 1908.
However, if anything, combined with the estimate for 1912, this seems to suggest that the counties with
high subscription rates for liberty bonds were seeing greater success for the Democrats prior to the 1916
election. If we can call these points a trend, it was in the opposite direction of the effects following 1918.
         The parameter estimates and some additional details regarding the estimation are presented in
Table A4. Column (1) of the table presents the regression plotted in Figure A8, and column (2) presents
the IV regression plotted in A10. The Kleinbergen-Paap F test in column (2) is 18.9, helping to rule out
concerns regarding weak instruments (p=0.000). Finally, in column (3), we add some additional 1920
county characteristics interacted with year, and find that the parameter estimates are not meaningfully
changed.

3.7 Results for the 1920 election, by state

         Table 9 in the paper presents estimates of the effect of liberty bond subscriptions on election
outcomes, which the paper then uses to compute counterfactual Democratic vote shares. Here we show
the actual and counterfactual Democratic vote shares for each state.
         These are presented in Figure A11 below. The actual Democratic Party vote share in the 1920
presidential election in each state is shown as the solid bar; the outlined bar extending to the right shows
the additional vote share that would have been received had there been no liberty bond subscriptions.
         As the figure makes clear, the effects of the liberty loans were substantial; setting the subscription
rates to zero increases the estimated Democratic Party share significantly in many states.
