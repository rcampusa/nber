News that Takes Your Breath Away: Risk Perceptions During an Outbreak of Vaping-related
Lung Injuries

NBER Working Paper No. 26977

                                          ABSTRACT

We study the impact of new information on people’s perceptions of the risks of e-cigarettes. In
September 2019 the U.S. experienced an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung
injuries (EVALI). The EVALI outbreak created an information shock, which was followed by
additional new information in a later CDC recommendation. We use data on consumer risk
perceptions from two sets of surveys conducted before (using HINTS survey data) and during the
EVALI outbreak (using Google Survey data). The empirical model examines changes in risk
perceptions during the early crisis period when the CDC was warning consumers that they should
avoid all vaping products and during a later period when the message was refined and focused on
a much narrower set of illegal vaping products that contain THC (the main psychoactive
compound in marijuana). Our econometric results suggest that the immediate impact of the first
information shock was to increase the fraction of respondents who perceived e-cigarettes as more
harmful than smoking by about 16 percentage points. As the outbreak subsided and the CDC
recommendation changed to emphasize the role of THC e-cigarette products, e-cigarette risk
perceptions were partially revised downwards. Additional econometric results show that different
demographic groups reacted somewhat differently to the information shock. In particular, we find
that groups who had higher risk perceptions showed a weaker response to the first information
shock but were more likely to later revise their risk perceptions downwards. We conclude the
paper by discussing the public policy issues that stem from having risk perceptions of e-cigarettes
relative to combustible cigarettes remain at these elevated levels where a substantial portion of
consumers believe that e-cigarettes are more harmful than cigarettes.

I.      Introduction
The dissemination of evolving science about health risks related to food and drug products has
enormous potential to influence consumer welfare. In typical markets consumers obtain
information about product risk from a variety of sources that include the product’s
manufacturer through advertising and any associated required warning statements,
dissemination in the news media of the results of scientific studies regarding product risk,
government pronouncements from agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the Surgeon General, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and finally through broad social and conventional media
coverage of such risks. All of these sources of information have the potential to influence risk
perceptions of the product, and in turn affect consumers’ utilization behaviors.
This study focuses on the evolution of risk perceptions of e-cigarettes relative to combustible
cigarettes. The formation of health risk beliefs in this market is especially interesting because
of the active role that the government has played in messaging about e-cigarettes, the
restrictions that the FDA has placed on any reduced-harm statements in advertising and
promotion from the industry, and the recent health concerns about vaping products in general
and vaping products that contain Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in particular. The investigation of
the national outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use lung injury (EVALI) has been intense,
with story after story focusing on the lung complications that e-cigarette users were
experiencing. In some cases these complications led to death. Statements issued by the CDC
during the early ‘crisis’ period were direct and clear suggesting that individuals should stop
using all vaping products in the late summer of 2019 (Perrine et al. 2019).1 Coverage of the
epidemic in the mainstream press generally echoed the CDC’s messaging, conflating all vaping
products during the initial phase of the crisis when the direct causes were still unknown.2



1
  On September 27, 2019, the CDC issued the following statement through Twitter: “Lung injury assoc. w/ e-
cigarette product use/vaping was recently reported in most states. CDC & others continuing to investigate. CDC
recommends considering refraining from using e-cigarette/vaping products, especially those with THC” (see
https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1177673832909430787). While THC was specifically referenced, the
statement conflated all e-cigarette and vaping products and recommended that “while this investigation is
ongoing…persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those containing
THC” (Perrine et al., Morbidity and Mortality Weekly, October 4 2019). Messages from state health departments
generally followed suit. For instance, the state health department in Wisconsin – which was among the first few
states to experience EVALI cases – “strongly urge(d) people to avoid vaping products and e-cigarettes”
(https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/080219.htm).
2
  See for instance: “The Mysterious Vaping Illness that’s ‘Becoming an Epidemic’ (New York Times, August 31,
2019, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/health/vaping-marijuana-ecigarettes-sickness.html); “Vaping Illness
Epidemic Shows No Sign of Slowing” (NBC News, October 10, 2019,
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/vaping/vaping-illness-epidemic-shows-no-sign-slowing-n1064546); “Vaping is
Suspected in Severe Lung Illnesses” (Wall Street Journal, August 22, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/vaping-is-
suspected-in-severe-lung-illnesses-11566508797); “Death toll rises from mysterious lung illnesses linked to vaping,
prompting CDC to sound alarm on e-cigarettes” (CNBC, September 6, 2019,

                                                                                                                  3
This messaging changed over time as investigation of the cause of the lung injury pointed
toward only a subset of the vaping market. By December and January, the CDC had
significantly changed its messaging, remarking that the CDC, FDA, and state health authorities
have made progress in identifying the cause of the harm.3 It noted that emergency visits
continue to decline and that THC products obtained from informal sources are the ones most
closely linked to the health crisis (CDC, 2020). The warnings to avoid all vaping products have
since been refined. Currently the CDC and the FDA recommend, among other things, that
‘people not use THC-containing e-cigarette or vaping products, particularly from informal
sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers,’ that ‘vitamin E acetate should not be
added to any e-cigarette, or vaping products,’ that ‘adults using nicotine-containing e-cigarettes
or vaping products as an alternative to cigarettes should not go back to smoking,’ and that ‘e-
cigarette or vaping products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are
pregnant”.4
The EVALI outbreak, and the evolution of the CDC statements from the initial conflation of all e-
cigarette and vaping products to a subsequently more refined message about a subset of
vaping products, present a unique natural experiment to study how risk perceptions regarding
e-cigarettes respond to information shocks. Government and media messaging about risk may
be especially impactful on the formation of risk perceptions for e-cigarettes compared with
government messaging impacts in other markets. As noted by Koslowski and Sweanor (2016),
relative risk claims for a reduced-harm product are strictly regulated by the FDA and require
that the manufacturer ex ante prove that such a claim will not have an adverse effect on
population health. They note that this is unique to tobacco regulation and essentially
eliminates all industry-provided reduced risk claims. Consequently, risk information provided
by government, and by traditional and social media, may have an enhanced role in shaping risk
perceptions for e-cigarettes relative to combustible cigarettes. The perceived risk profile for
new products such as e-cigarettes – even if on average lower than that for cigarettes – is also
likely to exhibit greater variability and uncertainty. Thus, risk perceptions for e-cigarettes may
be particular elastic with respect to information shocks as individuals update their beliefs
regarding potential health outcomes and the weights associated with alternate outcomes in the
presence of uncertainty.
Another factor that makes this market important to study is the complicated nature of how
different populations might respond to health risk beliefs of e-cigarettes relative to traditional
cigarettes. As noted above, the CDC and the FDA have shaped meaningfully different messages


https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/cdc-reports-at-least-three-deaths-in-vaping-related-lung-disease-
outbreak.html).
3
  On December 10, 2019, the CDC noted through its official Twitter account that the “CDC recommends that you
do not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC, as data suggest these products play a major role in
the current lung injury outbreak” (see https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1204526209310306304).

                                                                                                                    4
to adult smokers versus youth. While adults are discouraged from moving back from e-
cigarettes to traditional cigarettes, youth are advised to never use e-cigarettes. One can infer
from the advice for adults not to switch from e-cigarettes back to smoking traditional cigarettes
that the FDA and CDC implicitly believe that cigarettes are more harmful that e-cigarettes. The
health risks of smoking traditional cigarettes are well-known and less uncertain. According to
the CDC (Control, 2020) approximately 16 million people are living with a disease attributed to
smoking and more than 480,000 deaths are attributed to smoking each year. If e-cigarettes are
perceived as less harmful than cigarettes, then this presents a potentially attractive alternative
to smoking, either as a mechanism for smokers to attempt to quit, to switch to e-cigarettes, or
to even use a combination of both products while cutting down on the consumption of
cigarettes.

Current recommendations from the CDC and FDA urge all youth not to use e-cigarette and
vaping products because of the harm associated with these products. Most recently, the FDA
has taken additional action in its focus on youth and e-cigarettes by banning certain flavors that
may be appealing to youth. In the statement accompanying this ban, Secretary of Health and
Human Services Alex Azar noted that “(b)y prioritizing enforcement against the products that
are most widely used by children, our action today seeks to strike the right public health
balance by maintaining e-cigarettes as a potential off-ramp for adults using combustible
tobacco while ensuring these products don’t provide an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for our
youth”. 5 It is notable that the FDA chose not to include a more refined message that youth
should not use e-cigarettes or vaping products, but if they were going to start smoking it is
preferable that they use e-cigarettes rather than smoking combustible cigarettes. One can
infer that the CDC and FDA calculated that such a message might implicitly endorse the use of
e-cigarettes by youth. However, the absence of a more nuanced risk statement regarding e-
cigarettes and smoking may also generate equalized health risk beliefs among youth for both
products, which in turn could lead to more youth choosing traditional cigarettes than
otherwise.
Perceived harm of e-cigarettes has been found to be a significant predictor of behavior of
smokers, as they consider quitting or switching some of their smoking activity to e-cigarettes,
and of the behavior of youth, as they consider whether to smoke cigarettes, use e-cigarettes,
abstain from both, or sequence from one product to the other (Pericot-Valverde et al. 2017;
Amrock et al. 2015; Brose et al. 2015). Understanding the formation of risk perceptions and
how they are impacted by external health and information shocks is therefore integral towards
understanding different use patterns and towards the development of policies to rectify
misperceptions and minimize negative public health outcomes. Our study contributes to the
very limited evidence base on this issue, and provides some of the first analyses on how risk
perceptions respond to an adverse information shock and during a period of significant

                                                                                                         5
messaging by the government and media about the risks of vaping. Of critical importance is
assessing whether risk perceptions are altered permanently, whether they undergo further
updating, or revert towards the pre-crisis baseline once the uncertainty regarding the EVALI
outbreak subsided and the public health messaging backed away from all vaping products and
focused on those containing THC and derived from non-official sources. We provide the first
evidence on the trajectory of risk perceptions before, during, and after the EVALI outbreak and
periods enveloping the shift in messaging. We further assess whether these responses differed
across younger and older adults – groups that were subject to potentially differential public
health messaging regarding the use of e-cigarettes.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides some background on the
relative trends of e-cigarette and cigarette use over time for youth and adults. Section III
summarizes the literature on the perceptions of the health risks of e-cigarettes compared with
combustible cigarettes and how such perceptions might influence use of e-cigarettes. Section
IV discusses the timeline of the EVALI outbreak, introduces a model of risk formation and
develops hypotheses about how the flow of information from government and media can
influence perceptions of the relative risk of e-cigarettes compared with combustible cigarettes.
Section V presents an overview of the data and methods used to measure health risk
perceptions over time, with the results reported in Section VI. Section VII outlines the policy
implications of the work and suggested directions for future research that can inform policy.
II.    Background on Use of E-cigarettes

The use of e-cigarettes has risen dramatically in the past decade and the public health
implications of this trend continue to be debated by researchers and policy makers. One key
question that arises in this debate is how consumer risk perceptions of the relative harm of e-
cigarettes compared with combustible cigarettes influence decisions about use of both of these
products. Broad trends in cigarette use over time are consistent with the view that the
introduction of e-cigarettes, and the perception that they may be less harmful than cigarettes,
helped accelerate the pre-existing downward trend in cigarette smoking among youth. Data
from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Surveys, for instance, show a dramatic decline in youth
smoking rates coincidental with the rise of youth e-cigarette use (see Figure 1). Between 2007
and 2013, the 30-day prevalence rate for cigarette use dropped from 21.6% to 16.3%. Over the
subsequent six-year period, from 2013-2019, which witnessed a rapid increase in e-cigarette
use, the 30-day prevalence rate for cigarette use plummeted from the 16.3% to 5.7%. What
was unexpected was the even larger and more rapid increase in e-cigarette use, which
skyrocketed over this same period from 4.5% to 27.5% (National Youth Tobacco Surveys).
Similar to youth, adult smoking rates have also continued their long-run decline (see Figure 2).
Data from the National Health and Interview Surveys indicate that the adult cigarette smoking
prevalence accelerated its decline since 2013, and is currently stands at the lowest level (13.7%)




                                                                                                6
in the past five decades (Creamer et al. 2019). 6 This decrease in smoking prevalence was driven
by significant increases in quit attempts and successful quits, and more recently accompanied
by an increase in e-cigarette use primarily among younger adults ages 18-24. These contrasting
trends between declines in smoking rates and increases in vaping raises, for both youth and
adults, underscore the importance of analyzing the evolution of risk perceptions for these
products over the past decade and how they differ across different populations. Use of
cigarettes and e-cigarettes is mediated by risk perceptions (Popova et al. 2018), and trends in
risk perceptions may be an important driver of trends in e-cigarette use and smoking (Pepper et
al. 2014).
III.      Perceptions of E-cigarettes

Perceptions that e-cigarettes are a safer way to ingest nicotine can lead adult smokers to switch
from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, continue to use a mix of both while cutting down
on the consumption of cigarettes, or use e-cigarettes as a means to quit all tobacco
consumption (Kenkel et al. 2017; Pericot-Valverde et al. 2017). It is possible also that these
perceptions can lead non-smoking adults who otherwise would not smoke combustible
cigarettes into the e-cigarette market. Some of these might be former smokers whose
perceptions of a safer alternative to cigarettes lead them to use e-cigarettes.
Studies have focused on these various populations and their reasons for using e-cigarettes.
Rutten et al. (2015) examine the use of e-cigarettes among current adult smokers and the
correlation between stated reasons for use and quit intentions. Among smokers, 20.4% self-
reported using e-cigarettes with 3.7% being daily users. The majority of respondents indicated
that quitting smoking, reducing cigarette consumption, and reducing health risks were their
main reason for use of e-cigarettes. Perception that e-cigarettes are less harmful than
conventional cigarettes is also a significant predictor of e-cigarette use among adolescents,
including those who have no history of using cigarettes (Amrock et al. 2015).
Using the 2012/2013 data from the Health Information National Trends Surveys (HINTS), Tan
and Bingham (2014) find that 77% of respondents were aware of e-cigarettes, and that among
those who were aware the prevalent view was that e-cigarettes were less harmful than
cigarettes, particularly among more educated respondents and current smokers. Pepper et al.
(2015) drew on data from an online survey administered to a national sample in order to
measure the perceived harm of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes. Participants viewed e-cigarettes as
less likely to cause lung cancer, heart disease, and oral cancer compared with conventional
cigarettes. The belief that e-cigarettes were less harmful than regular cigarettes was robust and
extended to virtually all demographic groups examined. Results also suggest that young adults
who had viewed e-cigarettes as less harmful or in aiding smoking cessation at baseline were
more likely to experiment with e-cigarettes in the future (Choi and Forster 2014).

Perceptions of harm of e-cigarettes have expectedly not remained static over the past decade.
Majeed et al (2017) analyzed data from the Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions surveys
spanning 2012-2015. Whereas 12.8% of adults had perceived e-cigarettes to at least as harmful
as cigarettes in 2012, this perception more than tripled to 39.8% by 2015. In a comprehensive
survey of the literature on risk perceptions across nicotine products, Czoli et al. (2016) conclude
that perceived relative risk on non-combustible nicotine products is highly variable by product-
type and across sub-populations. For e-cigarettes, which represent the newest entry into the
market for non-combustible nicotine products during many of the time periods examined in the
various studies, relative risk perceptions appear to better match epidemiological data than for
other tobacco products.
Viscusi (2016) analyzes data for 2014 from the GfK Knowledge Panel, a nationally-
representative web-based panel, and finds that respondents generally view e-cigarettes as
posing lower mortality risk from lung cancer and overall, when compared with combustible
cigarettes. However, they vastly overestimate these risks associated with e-cigarette use.
Viscusi also finds that intended use is more strongly correlated with health risk perceptions
than other attributes such as perceived nicotine content. Given this link from perceived risk to
actual decisions on the use of various tobacco products, disparities between actual risk and
perceived risk can lead to sub-optimal consumption decisions, and pose a particular challenge
for policy makers with respect to correcting for the internal and external costs of misaligned
consumption decisions. Risk-based misperceptions may also lead to a public health loss if
current or potential smokers are discouraged from switching to other less-risky products
because of an over-estimation of the relative risk of these products.
IV.    Analytical Framework
EVALI Timeline
The outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) began in
2019, with the first cases identified in Illinois and Wisconsin around April. The illness was first
recognized by the CDC in August, with cases peaking around mid-September followed by a
gradual but persistent decline (see Figure 4). Reporting of the outbreak and consumer interest
tracked almost one-to-one with the caseload, as evidenced by trends in Google Searches
(Figure 3). The acronym EVALI – to describe this newly identified lung disease linked to vaping –
was initially used by the CDC in its interim guidance issued to health care providers on October
11th (Siegel et al., MMWR October 11, 2019). As of February 18, 2020 (date of the final CDC
update), there have been a total of 2,807 hospitalized EVALI cases or deaths reported
nationwide, across all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 68 deaths
confirmed in 29 states and D.C.




                                                                                                   8
On September 27, 2019, the CDC issued a statement through Twitter and recommended
“refraining from using e-cigarette/vaping products, especially those with THC”. 7 The interim
guidance for health care providers, issued on October 11, continued to stress that the “FDA and
the CDC have not identified the cause or causes of the lung injuries among the EVALI cases, and
the only commonality among all cases is that patients report the use of e-cigarette, or vaping,
products” (Siegel et al. 2019, p. 924). Drawing on this uncertainty, the guidance underscored
that the “CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that
contain THC” but then also issued the broader statement that the “CDC continues to
recommend that persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that
contain nicotine”. In all of these initial messages, the CDC did qualify that if adults are using e-
cigarette or vaping products to quit smoking, then they should not return to smoking – implying
that nicotine-based e-cigarettes may be safer than smoking; however, the CDC also qualified
that these individuals should use evidence-based treatments – implying that they should switch
out of e-cigarettes to sanctioned nicotine replacement therapy. With respect to youth, young
adults, and pregnant women, the recommendation was that “irrespective of the ongoing
investigation, e-cigarette, or vaping, products, should never be used” (Siegel et al. 2019, p.
924).
As the cumulative caseload increased, and investigation centered on a subset of the vaping
market as the likely cause, the CDC changed its recommendations. Specifically, on December
10, 2019, the CDC issued a recommendation through Twitter urging individuals to “not use e-
cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC, as data suggest these products play a major
role in the current lung injury outbreak”.8 This recommendation currently stands, and further
specifies that people not use THC-containing e-cigarette or vaping products, particularly from
informal sources (i.e. friends, family, online dealers). 9
Model of Risk Perception
The question of how the perceived relative risk of vaping responds to information shocks can
be framed within a Bayesian learning context. The discussion in this section follows Viscusi
(2016). While smoking and vaping can carry a multitude of health risks, it is convenient to
collapse all of the various risks in terms of a single parameter capturing the probability of
dying. 10 In this respect, v represents the perceived e-cigarette related risk of mortality, and s is
an analogous measure of the mortality risk associated with smoking. Since e-cigarettes are a
relatively new product entry in the tobacco market with considerable uncertainty regarding
their health profile, it is reasonable to assume that individuals form their beliefs regarding v

   Media coverage of the EVALI outbreak highlighted deaths associated with the lung injury, and Google searches
for “vaping deaths” and “vaping illness” tracked lock-step from July 2019 through February 2020 (see Figure 3).
Hence, focusing on the relative mortality risk is particularly salient for the study of the EVALI outbreak.


                                                                                                                  9
based on an initial frame of reference – another similar product whose risk profile is less
uncertain and well-publicized – and then update those beliefs based on other information and
sources. Hence, the perceived risk of using e-cigarettes, v, is a function of the perceived risk of
cigarettes, s, and any additional or reduced risk, q, implied by product-specific external
information that is not captured in s.
Assuming that individuals’ prior probability beliefs follow a beta distribution, the posterior
perceived risk of e-cigarettes becomes a weighted-average linear function of the prior
perceived risk, s, and additional implied risk, q. 11
         𝑣𝑣 = 𝜑𝜑 𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾 𝑞𝑞                                                                         (1)
                   𝜑𝜑0                 𝛾𝛾0
         𝜑𝜑 =               , 𝛾𝛾 =                                                                  (2)
                 𝜑𝜑0 +𝛾𝛾0            𝜑𝜑0 +𝛾𝛾0

The informational weights, 𝜑𝜑 and 𝛾𝛾, represent the proportion of total information (𝜑𝜑0 + 𝛾𝛾0)
available to the individual that is represented by risk-related information regarding
conventional cigarettes (𝜑𝜑0 ), which is the reference point, and other available information that
may be specific to e-cigarettes and vaping (𝛾𝛾0). 12
Dividing both sides of equation (1) by s yields the following posterior relative risk of vaping vs.
smoking.
         𝑣𝑣                  𝑞𝑞
         𝑠𝑠
              = 𝜑𝜑 + 𝛾𝛾      𝑠𝑠
                                                                                                    (3)

It can be shown that individuals will perceive e-cigarettes to be less risky relative to cigarettes
  𝑣𝑣          𝑞𝑞
( 𝑠𝑠 < 1) if ( 𝑠𝑠 < 1), that is if the additional implied risk associated with vaping is lower than the
reference risk level.

The EVALI outbreak, and ensuing news reports regarding lung morbidity and deaths associated
with vaping, represented a negative health informational shock (an increase in q).
Furthermore, this was occurring during a time when there was no new information or adverse
health reports regarding smoking. Thus, in terms of information draws, more information
content specific to vaping (an increase in 𝛾𝛾0) was entering the market and informing individuals’
beliefs. In terms of equation (3), this implies an increase in 𝛾𝛾, a decrease in 𝜑𝜑, and an increase
    𝑞𝑞
in ( 𝑠𝑠 ), all of which would lead to a shift in the relative risk perception of vaping towards greater
                                                                 𝑣𝑣
harm compared to smoking – that is, an increase in ( 𝑠𝑠 ). Note that the negative informational
shock regarding vaping leads to a shift in the perceived relative risk due to both an updating

11
   The beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions, applied to random variables that are
constrained along a finite range. Hence, it is particularly well-suited to studying the behavior of perceived
probabilities, which by definition are confined to the 0-1 interval. For Bayesian inference, the beta distribution
also represents the conjugate prior probability distribution for the Bernoulli and binomial distributions among
others.
12
   Given that s and q follow a beta distribution, ϕ0 and γ0 can be interpreted as draws of information, that follow a
Bernoulli process, from the set of total information.

                                                                                                                   10
process, through q, as well as due to a reweighting from the greater emphasis placed on the
new product-specific information (change in the informational weights, 𝜑𝜑 and 𝛾𝛾).
As noted above, initial recommendations and media reports conflated all vaping products and
e-cigarettes, though THC-containing products were referenced in the CDC and FDA messaging
as well as in some of the earlier media reports. Only later (December 10, 2019) did the
government messaging clarify the recommendations as applying explicitly to the subset of e-
cigarette or vaping products containing THC, and reports began to stress that it is these specific
products that are strongly implicated in the current lung injury outbreak. These clarifications
provide an additional informational shock regarding e-cigarettes, in the reverse direction to the
earlier shock that fused all vaping products into a single category. For individuals, potentially
learning that nicotine e-cigarettes derived from official sources were not the cause of the lung
injuries and related mortality, this is akin to a decrease in q, and thus a downward revision of
 𝑣𝑣
( 𝑠𝑠 ). The downward revision is reinforced further by an increase in 𝛾𝛾, the weight placed on the
new informational content. However, this scenario implicitly assumes symmetry in the
updates, that is once an individual has revised their relative risk upwards, any further new
information to the contrary leads to a similar effect in reverse. If individuals are sticky in their
beliefs, or weight new information that contradicts their priors differently, then the
clarifications in the messaging by the CDC and the media may not lead risk perceptions for
nicotine e-cigarettes to revert to baseline.

In the empirical analyses that follow, we specifically probe respondents’ risk beliefs regarding
nicotine e-cigarettes and those containing THC in order to analyze the evolution of these beliefs
as the information content shifted. Given the ambiguity in how respondents may update their
risk beliefs once the reporting coalesced around the main cause and no longer implicated
nicotine e-cigarettes, it remains an empirical question how these risk beliefs shifted during the
early and latter parts of the EVALI outbreak. It is possible that the risk beliefs will stabilize at a
permanently new steady-state level. It is also possible that they will revert, either fully or
partially, towards the risk beliefs held prior to the crisis. Each of these scenarios has important
implications for optimal consumption decisions, public health, and rationales for informational
regulations.
V.     Empirical Analyses
Data
We use data on consumer risk perceptions from two sets of surveys conducted before and
during the EVALI outbreak. The first set of surveys are cycles of the National Cancer Institute’s
(NCI) Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). The HINTS data are a set of repeated
cross-sections that provide nationally representative estimates of consumer information about
a range of health topics. HINTS cycles conducted in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019
measure consumer perceptions of the risk of e-cigarettes relative to combustible cigarettes.
The sample sizes of these cycles range from 3,630 to 5,438 per year, and sampling weights are

                                                                                                   11
provided to generalize results to the national population. 13 In these cycles the surveys asked:
“Compared to smoking cigarettes, would you say that electronic cigarettes are much less
harmful, less harmful, just as harmful, more harmful, or much more harmful?” The most recent
HINTS cycle that asked about e-cigarettes was conducted in February through April of 2019,
before the EVALI outbreak was recognized.
Second, to collect information during the EVALI outbreak, we commissioned a series of online
Google Surveys (GS) that included versions of the HINTS question on the harmfulness of e-
cigarettes compared to smoking cigarettes. GS is a commercial organization that recruits
respondents from internet users who visit websites that use a “surveywall” where the site’s
content is blocked until the user completes the survey. GS reports that they can reach tens of
millions of unique daily internet and smartphone users (Sostek and Slatkin 2017) and describes
how it works to eliminate biases (Sostek, 2019). The sample sizes of our GS repeated cross-
sections range from 2,656 to 3,679. GS provides sampling weights to approximate the target
population, which is the national population of internet users, derived from estimates from the
Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement.14 Close to 90% of the
adult population has internet access (based on the 2018 American Community Survey), and
polls from the Pew Research Center (conducted in January-February 2019) also indicate that
90% of all adults are internet users.15 Thus, the population represented by HINTS (adults) and
the GS (adult internet users) for 2019-2020 almost fully overlap. We adjust for the sampling
weights provided in the HINTS and the GS to produce summary statistics, and to show the
comparability of the samples. We also provide differential estimates by age groups, since for
non-elderly adults the GS and the HINTS are essentially representing the same population. 16
Academic researchers in marketing and social sciences increasingly rely on online opt-in surveys
as a valuable source of data on a range of topics (Hulland and Miller 2018). Several studies have
been conducted of the accuracy and biases of online opt-in survey data (Mercer, Lau, and
Kennedy 2018, Sostek 2019).
We fielded ten waves of online Google Surveys, bimonthly from September 2019 through the
end of January 2020. For six of these surveys, we used the HINTS version of the question,
asking respondents, “Compared to smoking cigarettes, would you say that electronic cigarettes,
which deliver nicotine through vapor, are much less harmful, less harmful, just as harmful,
more harmful, or much more harmful?”. For the other four surveys, we modified this question

13
   The HINTS is a mail-based survey of the U.S. adult, civilian, non-institutionalized population. We use data from
the following HINTS cycles: 2012 Cycle 2, 2014 Cycle 4, 2015 FDA, 2017 Cycle 1, 2017 FDA Cycle 2, 2018 Cycle 2,
and 2019 Cycle 3.
14
   Since the weights are meant to approximate the national population of internet users, based on their inferred
demographics and geographic region, observations that are missing information on any of this are assigned a zero
weight by GS. We also exclude these observations with non-valid (zero) weights from all analyses.
15
   See: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/.
16
   About 94% of adults ages 64 and below are internet users, and among adults ages 50 and below, the prevalence
ranges from 97-100% (Pew Research Center; https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-
broadband/).

                                                                                                                 12
to probe respondents’ perceived risk of all e-cigarettes and vaping products, including those
that may deliver THC, by asking “Compared to smoking cigarettes, would you say that
electronic cigarettes, which deliver nicotine or other substances such as THC oil through a
vapor, are much less harmful, less harmful, just as harmful, more harmful, or much more
harmful?”. 17 After accounting for missing information on age, gender, and geographic region,
the combined sample size across all of the GS waves is 21,184 observations. The sample of
analysis for our econometric model consists of the pooled HINTS and GS data, which provides a
sample size of 37,015 observations.

In order to disentangle shifts in risk perception due to the EVALI outbreak from other policy
shifts, we match information on cigarette excise taxes, e-cigarette taxes, e-cigarette work
restrictions, and the minimum legal sales age for e-cigarettes, to the HINTS and the GS data
based on the survey month/year and the respondent’s residential census division.18 We also
similarly match and control for an index of anti-smoking sentiment. This measure, first
introduced by DeCicca et al (2008), used the Tobacco Use Supplements from the CPS to
measure respondent attitudes toward smoking based on their opinions on topics such as
policies that restrict tobacco use in public places, policies that relate to the promotion and
advertising of tobacco products, and whether they allow smoking in their homes. These
measures are then aggregated at the state level to obtain a state specific measure of anti-
smoking attitudes. Studies have used this measure as a control variable when examining
tobacco use (DeCicca, et al. 2008).
To provide an overview of the data, Tables 1-3 present summary statistics from the pooled
sample of data from the HINTS and the GS, separately for both surveys, and for various
subgroups. Overall, for the period spanning 2012-2020 as captured by the pooled HINTS and
GS data, about 22% of adults perceived e-cigarettes to be more harmful than cigarettes. This
mean masks a substantial increase in this perceived harm pre- and post-EVALI outbreak, from
9% in the HINTS (October 2012 – April 2019) to 31% in the GS (September 2019 – February
2020). Comparing the socio-demographics between the HINTS and the GS, the samples are
highly similar across gender, age groups, and representation of the geographic regions,
providing some validation on their comparability. Table 2 provides a breakdown of these


17
   The surveys, on the harm perception of nicotine-based e-cigarettes, were fielded as follows. Wave 1: 9/17/2019
– 9/19/2019; Wave 2: 9/23/2019 – 9/25/2019; Wave 3: 10/18/2019 – 10/20/2019; Wave 5: 11/19/2019 –
11/21/2019; Wave 8: 12/20/2019 – 12/23/2020; Wave 10: 1/27/2020 – 1/29/2020. Surveys, on the harm
perception of all e-cigarette products including those that deliver THC, were fielded on: Wave 4: 10/28/2019 –
10/31/2019; Wave 6: 11/25/2019 – 11/27/2019; Wave 7: 12/17/2019 – 12/19/2019; and Wave 9: 1/20/2020 –
1/22/2020. All surveys also included an option for respondents to choose “I don’t know”. The percent of
individuals choosing this option fairly substantial but stable over time, across both the HINTS and the GS.
18
  Policy variables were collected using the CDC STATE system. While we are able to observe inferred state of
residence in the GS (based on the internet protocol address at the time of responding to the survey), the smallest
level of geography in the HINTS is census division. Hence, for consistency, we match the policy data to all records
bases on census division. Our main results are virtually unchanged if we match the GS records based on the
residential state.

                                                                                                                 13
statistics across age groups and across gender, which suggest that perceived relative risk of e-
cigarettes is generally similar for adults between the ages of 18-44 (around 20%) but then
significantly increases for older adults (around 24% for adults ages 45+). Males are also more
likely to perceive e-cigarette use to be more harmful compared to smoking (24%), relative to
females (20%). Interestingly, we do not find any substantial or significant difference in
perceived risk across respondents from GS that asked about nicotine-based e-cigarettes vs. all
e-cigarettes including those containing THC (Table 3). This may reflect the conflation of all e-
cigarette products during the early phase of the crisis.

Figure 5 shows the fraction of HINTS and GS respondents over time who reported that e-
cigarettes were more harmful or much more harmful than smoking cigarettes. The fraction is
sharply higher in the GS data collected after the EVALI outbreak. The HINTS data from October
2012 through April 2019 show an upward trend in the fraction perceiving e-cigarettes to be
more or much more harmful. Based on a linear trend fitted to the HINTS data points, the
fraction reporting more or much more harmful is predicted to be 18% in September 2019. In
the actual GS data after the EVALI outbreak in September 2019, over 30% of the respondents
report that e-cigarettes are more or much more harmful than smoking cigarettes. 19 The 2018
HINTS included questions about internet use. Compared to HINTS respondents who do not use
the internet, HINTS respondents who use the internet tend to perceive e-cigarettes as less
harmful, although the differences are small and statistically insignificant. Because all
respondents in the GS samples are internet users, by this factor alone we would predict that
compared to the HINTS samples, the fractions reporting the e-cigarettes are more or much
more harmful in the GS should be slightly lower, not sharply higher.
Figure 6 provides a closer look at the GS data collected during the EVALI outbreak. From
September 2019 through January 2020, the fraction of respondents reporting that e-cigarettes
are more or much more harmful has stayed fairly stable at around 30%, with a slight decline in
the most recent samples. There is no apparent systematic difference between the responses to
surveys that mention THC and those that did not mention THC.

These descriptive statistics suggest that there was a sharp upward revision in the relative harm
perception of e-cigarettes during the EVALI outbreak, and little downward correction even after
the CDC had clarified its message to specifically apply only to THC-containing e-cigarettes.
Below, we test for these shifts more formally, while accounting for trends and other potential
confounding shifts over this period.
Methods




19
  We use the HINTS and the GS sampling weights in generating the data points in Figures 5 and 6. The results are
similar if for weighted data points.

                                                                                                              14
We begin with a baseline specification to test whether or not there were significant breaks
from trend in risk perception after the EVALI crisis. Specifically, drawing on the EVALI timeline,
we evaluate two salient periods as the crisis unfolded, and estimate the following specification:

𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝜋𝜋1 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜋𝜋2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 [ + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜃𝜃 ] + 𝜗𝜗𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 +
 𝛿𝛿 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                                         (4)

The subscripts denote the ith respondent residing in census division c and interviewed in year t.
Equation (4) represents a reduced-form of equation (3), wherein the right-side of equation (3)
capturing the informational weights and the information shock is proxied by the crisis
indicators. Above, R is a measure of the relative risk perception of e-cigarettes compared with
            𝑣𝑣
cigarettes (𝑠𝑠 in equation 3), and is an indicator for whether the respondent perceives e-
cigarettes to be more or much more harmful compared with cigarettes. 20
We capture two relevant aspects of the crisis period. The first indicator, Outbreak, captures the
periods of the EVALI outbreak and equals one for all surveys fielded after August 2019. This is
when the CDC identified the outbreak of illnesses associated with vaping. As noted above,
during the initial phase of the crisis, there was uncertainty regarding the cause(s) and the CDC
recommendations (along with the media reporting) conflated all e-cigarette products including
those that delivered only nicotine. These recommendations were subsequently revised and
clarified on December 10, 2019, as vaping products containing THC emerged to be the likely
cause; the CDC backed away from its earlier blanket recommendation regarding all e-cigarette
products, now urging individuals to not use any vaping products containing THC. The second
indicator, Clarification THC, therefore turns on for all surveys fielded after this revision and
reflects responses to this new information shock. The parameters of interest are the vector 𝜋𝜋,
which captures how these phases of the EVALI outbreak impacted respondents’ relative
perceived harm.
The above model controls for whether the GS wave reflected risk perception for nicotine-based
e-cigarettes or included a specific reference to THC (THC Mention). Finally, in order to assess
that the effects picked up by the crisis indicators are not due to secular trends, we also
parametrically control for a linear time trend in year. 21
We extend the above baseline specification in several ways to address additional issues. First,
we expand the model to account for observed demographics (indicators for gender and age
groups) and geographic region (indicators for census division) (denoted X in equation 4). Given
that the GS sample is drawn from a slightly different population (adult internet users) than the
HINTS (all adults), and given that internet use is a strong function of age and other observed
demographics, these controls may address any differences due to the sampling scheme. If the
estimates are robust to controlling for the socio-demographics, this provides further validation

20
  We estimate all models using OLS. Results (marginal effects) are robust to using logit or probit estimates.
21
  We present models with linear trends for ease of exposition. Estimates are not sensitive to controls for a
quadratic trend.

                                                                                                                                           15
for the comparability of the HINTS and the GS. Second, we further include a vector of policy
controls (denoted Z in equation 4) to assess whether the observed breaks in risk perception
during the EVALI outbreak are driven by other confounding factors.
Next, we assess heterogeneity in the response of risk perception during the EVALI outbreak,
across socio-demographic factors. Table 2 indicated that certain groups (younger adults,
females) were less likely to view e-cigarettes as being harmful compared with conventional
cigarettes. We modify equation (4) to including interactions between the crisis indictors and
socio-demographics (age groups, gender) in order inform which groups were most elastic in
updating their belief, and whether these groups were more likely to further revise their
perceived risk following the CDC’s revised recommendations.

Finally, to better understand how prior belief affects risk perception updating, we consider
whether the groups that experience the biggest changes in risk perceptions are those groups
that started with low levels of e-cigarette harm expectations, or if groups with higher pre-EVALI
risk perceptions experience the greater informational shock. One should expect that if groups
are more susceptible to information that supports higher e-cigarette harm relative to
cigarettes, than these groups will have larger jumps in risk perception around the information
shock. Alternatively, groups with low levels of risk perception could be more influenced by the
shock simply because they have more room to adjust.
In order to evaluate these hypotheses, we first estimate a model relating risk perception to
observed demographics and policy factors prior to the crisis, based on the HINTS data.
𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜃𝜃 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                (5)

The vector X is now fully-interacted, and includes interactions between age groups, gender, and
census divisions. This model is used to estimate predicted risk perception for each respondent,
for the full dataset, based on their observed age, gender, geographic region, and the policies in
effect at the time. We define an indicator (High Risk) for whether the predicted risk perception
is higher or lower than the median. Using this predicted risk perception indicator we re-
estimate equation (4) but interacting predicted risk with all variables in the model. 22

𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝜋𝜋1 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜋𝜋2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜋𝜋3 (𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) +
𝜋𝜋4 (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜗𝜗𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 +
 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                                                              (6)
The coefficients of interests are 𝜋𝜋, with 𝜋𝜋3 and 𝜋𝜋4 specifically indicating whether groups who
held a relatively higher perceived risk of using e-cigarettes, prior to the EVALI outbreak,
adjusted their beliefs more (𝜋𝜋3 > 0) or less (𝜋𝜋3 < 0) due to the information shock, and whether


22
  For convenience, we subsume the other interactions in the reported Equation (6). However, these interactions
are included in the estimation. Results are robust to excluding interactions between predicted risk perception and
the other variables in the model.

                                                                                                                                            16
they updated these beliefs more (𝜋𝜋4 < 0) or less (𝜋𝜋4 > 0) following the revised information from
the CDC regarding the role of THC.
VI.    Results

Table 4 presents our baseline estimates for equation (4), for how respondents’ changed their
perceived harm of e-cigarettes vs. smoking during the EVALI outbreak. Model 1 presents
results from a parsimonious specification, suggesting that there was a significant increase in
perceived risk following the outbreak. Specifically, the probability of regarding e-cigarettes as
more harmful compared with cigarettes increased by 15.9 percentage points following the
outbreak. This represents a substantial updating of perceived harm, 175% relative to the mean
across all periods prior to the outbreak, and about 80% relative to the perceived harm in the
HINTS wave directly preceding the outbreak. This increase is conditional on, and beyond what
would be predicted by, the trend in perceived harm, which is significantly positive at a rate of
about two percentage points each year.

We also find that there was a slight downward revision of perceived risk, following the CDC’s
shift in recommendations highlighting THC-containing e-cigarettes and media reports centering
on this subset of vaping products as the common cause of the EVALI outbreak. Model 1
suggests that respondents significantly readjusted their harm perception downward by about
two percentage points; however, this downward revision was partial and substantially smaller
than the upward revision during the early phase of the outbreak suggesting some stickiness in
harm perceptions once they have been adjusted upwards. Hence, overall, belief that nicotine
e-cigarettes are more harmful than cigarettes remained significantly higher (by 13.7 percentage
points) even after messaging had zeroed in on THC as the cause of the lung injuries. Consistent
with the means reported in Table 3 and shown in Figure 5, there is no significant difference in
perceived risk across nicotine-based e-cigarettes and all e-cigarette products, including specific
reference to THC, over the EVALI outbreak. This is consistent with respondents conflating all e-
cigarette products, and thus exhibiting stickiness in their downward revisions once relative
positive information on nicotine-based e-cigarettes was implied after narrowing down the
cause to only THC-containing vaping products.
Model 2 adds in controls for demographics and geographic region, and model 3 further includes
policy controls. The estimates are robust to these controls, continuing to suggest about a 16-17
percentage points upward revision in perceived harm following the outbreak, and a slight two
percentage point downward revision following news and recommendations regarding THC.
This instills a degree of confidence that the observed break in trend is not driven by differences
in the populations surveyed across the HINTS and the GS or by concurrent policy shifts.
Next, we consider heterogeneity in this updating process across demographic groups. Models 1
and 2 in Table 5 assess differential effects by interacting the outbreak indicators with age
groups and gender. Estimates are not sensitive across the basic (model 1) and the extended
specification (model 2), and we discuss here estimates conditional on the full set of controls.

                                                                                                17
We find that both males and females revised their perceived harm of e-cigarettes upwards
following the crisis; however, the upward revision was significantly lower for females (9.6
percentage points) than for males (16.8 percentage points). This difference may be driven by
variation in tobacco use across gender. In 2018, 21% (13%) of males (females) were smokers,
and use of e-cigarettes among males (4.3%) was almost double that among females (2.3%)
(2018 National Health Interview Surveys). If women have less experience with tobacco
products in general, and e-cigarettes in particular, they may find information shocks less salient
and thus may be less responsive. There is no significant difference in the downward revision of
perceive risk following the THC clarification (both genders exhibiting about a 2.2 percentage
points decrease). This, however, does imply heterogeneity in how males and female update
their harm perceptions. Males responded more strongly to the adverse informational shock,
and “corrected” their beliefs by only about 14% (2.3 / 16.8) in response to more precise
information on the cause of the EVALI outbreak. Females, on the other hand, responded less
strongly in their upward revision, and when the new information on THC products was
disseminated they were relatively quicker in their downward revision (about 2.3/9.6 = 24%).
Neither gender, however, completely reverted their risk perceptions to pre-EVALI levels.
We also find a significantly stronger response to the outbreak among older adults. Specifically,
adults ages 44 and younger revised their perceived harm upwards by about 16.8 percentage
points; in comparison, older adults updated their beliefs by an additional statistically significant
8-13 percentage points, with this increase being monotonic with age. There are no significant
differences across age groups in further updating these harm perceptions following reports
pointing to THC; however, the point estimates for older adults (ages 55+) are negative (-2.9
percentage points) which suggests that these groups are also quicker to revised their revisions
downwards. In order words, older adults experienced a larger swing in their risk perceptions,
both on the upside (from the negative information shock) and on the downside (from the
relative positive information shock relating to nicotine e-cigarettes as THC was identified as the
cause).
While the demographic differences may be related to variation in use and experience with
tobacco products, they may also reflect baseline differences in risk perceptions. To further
assess whether groups with a higher perceived harm at baseline were more or less likely to
update their beliefs, we present estimates for equation (6) in models 3 and 4 (Table 5). These
results indicate that those groups who had a higher perceived harm of e-cigarettes relative to
cigarettes exhibited a significantly weaker revision of their beliefs on the upside, but were also
quicker to revise their beliefs downward following the THC clarification. Specifically, the
estimates indicate that groups who had a higher (lower) perceived risk (predicted risk score
above median vs. below median) witnessed an increase in their perceived harm by 14.4
percentage points (21 percentage points). This suggests that groups with low levels of risk
perception are more influenced by the initial information shock; interestingly these groups do
not revise their beliefs downward in any significant manner after the waning of the uncertainty
regarding the cause of the EVALI outbreak. Groups who started out with a higher level of risk
                                                                                                  18
perception were less responsive to the adverse informational shock; however, after the
revisions in the CDC recommendations and reports on the involvement of THC, these groups
were also more likely to re-update their beliefs and revise their harm perceptions downwards.
Estimates in model 4 indicate that these groups reduced their perceived harm by about 4.8
percentage points following the THC clarification, correcting their initial upward adjustment still
only partially by about one-third (4.8 / 14.4).
VII.   Discussion
In this paper we study the impact of new information on people’s perceptions of the risks of e-
cigarettes. The EVALI outbreak in September 2019 created an information shock, which was
followed by additional new information in a later CDC recommendation. Our econometric
results suggest that the immediate impact of the first information shock was to increase the
fraction of respondents who perceived e-cigarettes as more harmful than smoking by about 16
percentage points. As the outbreak subsided and the CDC recommendation changed to
emphasize the role of THC e-cigarette products, e-cigarette risk perceptions were partially
revised downwards. Additional econometric results show that different demographic groups
reacted somewhat differently to the information shock. In particular, we find that groups who
had higher risk perceptions showed a weaker response to the first information shock but were
more likely to later revise their risk perceptions downwards.
One approach to public policy towards e-cigarettes follows the precautionary principle that
emphasizes the scientific uncertainty about the long-run health consequences of vaping. The
EVALI outbreak is an example of the unforeseen risks that the precautionary principle protects
against. The early versions of the CDC EVALI recommendations were also consistent with the
precautionary principle; the early recommendations broadly advised against the use of e-
cigarettes without making distinctions between nicotine and THC products or distinctions
between youth and adult use. Our econometric results suggest that an unintended
consequence of this approach was that most people did not perceive the extra risks of THC
products.
Ironically, the precautionary principle to protect against unforeseen consequences can itself
have unintended consequences. More targeted advice about the risks of THC e-cigarettes might
have more effectively reduced the use of those products, potentially preventing EVALI cases.
Moreover, the increase in e-cigarette risk perceptions might discourage adult smokers from
using e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking, despite evidence from a clinical trial that e-
cigarettes are a more effective cessation method than FDA-approved products such as the
nicotine patch (Hajek et. al. 2019). More controversially, the increase in e-cigarette risk
perceptions might slow the downward trend in youth smoking (Pesko and Warman, 2017).
Future work should develop evidence on the links between risk perceptions and vaping and
smoking behaviors. Evidence on these links would help complete quantified cost-benefit
analysis to inform public policy towards e-cigarettes.

Notes: Summary statistics are presented from the seven HINTS waves for 2012-2019 and the ten GS waves
from 9/2019-1/2020. Means are reported, with standard deviations in brackets. Sampling weights are
utilized when presenting the statistics separately for the HINTS and the GS, but not for the pooled model due
to non-comparability of the scale of the sampling weights between the HINTS and the GS. Weighted and
unweighted statistics are highly similar.
