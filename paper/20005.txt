                                         ABSTRACT

In a complex economy, production is vertical and crosses jurisdictional lines. Goods are often
produced by a global or national firm upstream and improved or distributed by local firms
downstream. In this context, heightened products liability may have unintended consequences for
consumer safety. Conventional wisdom holds that an increase in tort liability on the upstream
firm will encourage that firm to improve safety for consumers. However, in the real-world, policy
actions in a single jurisdiction may not be significant enough to influence the behavior of an
upstream firm that produces for many jurisdictions. Even worse, if liability is shared between
upstream and downstream firms, higher upstream liability may decrease the liability of the
downstream distributor and encourage it to behave more recklessly. In this manner, higher
upstream liability may perversely increase the sales of a risky good. We demonstrate this
phenomenon in the context of the pharmaceutical market. We show that higher products liability
on upstream pharmaceutical manufacturers reduces the liability faced by downstream doctors,
who respond by prescribing more drugs than before.

         A common feature of modern, complex economies is vertical production that crosses
jurisdictional lines. Upstream firms supply inputs for downstream firms who add value and sell to
consumers. Firms at all levels have grown in scale and scope, and they now often serve many markets
across a range of different jurisdictions. This geographic expansion is perhaps even more pronounced
for upstream firms, because downstream firms, such as distributors and retailers, often need to retain a
well-defined local presence.

        To remain effective, the legal regime must carefully account for the value and risk added by
each firm in the vertical chain of production. To some extent, tort law has adapted. For example, in the
19th century, a doctrine called “privity” prevented individuals from suing upstream firms for injuries
from products of downstream firms. However, cases such as MacPherson v. Buick Motor Company (N.Y.
1916) and Smith v. Peerless Glass Co (N.Y. 1932) abandoned the doctrine of privity and allowed
consumers to sue firms further upstream (Prosser 1960). Indeed, contemporary products litigation is
now characterized by suits against several firms in the vertical chain of production.1 It is also
economically significant. Overall torts liability grew four times faster than the overall economic growth
rate between 1930 and 1994 (Sturgis 1995). By 2009, total payments in products liability suits alone
amounted to $248.1 billion, or 1.74% of U.S. GDP (Towers Watson 2010). In health care, suits against
doctors amount to 1-2% of physician expenditures (Mello, Chandra et al. 2010), and suits against drug
companies amount to 2.26% of all drug expenditures.2

          However, in other ways, US tort law has lagged the modern economy, especially in its insistence
upon state, rather than national or global, tort rules. This has encouraged beggar-thy-neighbor policies
by states who have incentives to shift liability from local downstream defendants to upstream national
defendants lacking a local presence (Krauss 2002). For instance, 22 states have reduced the products
liability local retailers face but not the liability that upstream manufacturers face (Shepherd 2012).
Nearly 30 states have caps on total or non-economic damages that physicians face in medical
malpractice actions. In litigation involving injuries from prescription drugs or devices, these caps shift
liability from local doctors to upstream national medical products and drug companies. While the legal

  For example, plaintiffs sue both the manufacturer of the car whose tire burst and the manufacturer of the tire
(e.g., In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., S.D. Ind. 2003), the home builder that used contaminated materials and the
maker of those materials (e.g., In re Chinese Manufactured Drywall Products, E.D. La. 2010), the grocer that used
spoiled food and the company that supplied the grocer with the spoiled food (e.g., cases against retailers and
farmers implicated in the 2006 E. coli outbreak), and the doctor that prescribed a drug as well as the company that
produced it (e.g.,Wyeth v. Levine, U.S. 2009) This last example is also the topic of the empirical application in this
paper.

  This estimate is derived from all settlement special items reported in the income statement. For pharmaceutical
companies this represents provisions to alter reserves for litigation and settlement. For other companies the
amount would include insurance payments from the firms general liability policy but pharmaceutical firms do not
typically have insurance against loses in litigation. As such the sum of the settlement special items represents
unexpected payments in litigation. Although some of this litigation is likely not related to product liability the vast
majority of loses in excess of reserves is likely major product liability cases—a fact reflected by disclosures in the
10k statements. We sum the total special reserves incurred from 2002-2008 and divide this by total sales over the
same period to get the ratio of 2.26%.

system recognizes the multiple-jurisdiction problem, the strategies employed for addressing it are
widely viewed as inadequate.3

         The economics literature on tort liability and products regulation has neglected the implications
of vertical production for tort rules.4 The majority of the literature assumes a single producer (Spence
1977; Polinsky and Rogerson 1983; Landes and Posner 1985). The economics literature on joint and
several liability does tackle the problem of multiple tortfeasors (Landes and Posner 1980; Sykes 1984;
Kornhauser and Revesz 1989; Miceli and Segerson 1991; Kornhauser and Revesz 1994; Currie and
MacLeod 2008). However, it typically abstracts from the contracting between upstream and
downstream firms that is central to vertical production.5 A partial exception is Hay and Spier (2005),
which discusses optimal allocation of tort liability between a producer and a consumer when the
consumer’s use of a product may injure third parties. However, Hay and Spier, like the articles cited in
the prior paragraph, assume that all actors operate in one jurisdiction. Moreover, their model assumes
the consumer (or, by analogy, the downstream firm) can contract on quality. This strong assumption
contrasts with the large literature on incomplete contracts (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005).

        In this paper we present and empirically test a model of products liability that studies the
implications of both vertical and multi-jurisdictional production. The upstream firm in our model




3
  One such strategy is the use of model codes and restatements of law that are meant to harmonize laws across
states. However, these uniformity movements tend to stop at the national border, and they often have patchy
adoption across states. For example, about half the states have punitive damages caps and less than two-third
have reformed joint and several liability Malani, A. and J. Reif (2013). Interpreting Pre-trends as Anticipation:
Impact on Estimated Treatment Effects from Tort Reform.. The second device is the class action suit. Yet the
hurdles to meet class action status remain high. The threshold for certification is even higher if the class involves
residents from multiple states. For example, a prior study on a sample of lawsuits shows that 82% of class actions
involved residents of a single state Pace, N. M., S. J. Carroll, et al. (2007). Insurance class actions in the United
States. Santa Monica, CA, RAND Corporation.. Moreover, these suits have been criticized as resulting in
settlements that benefit producers and plaintiffs’ attorneys at the expense of plaintiffs Hensler, D. R. (2000). Class
action dilemmas: Pursuing public goals for private gain, Rand Corporation.. The last is national regulation of safety.
These regulations are porous and leave a large role for state tort actions (e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, U.S., 2009).
Further, the legal system tends to disfavor preemption of state suits by federal regulation, so product liability still
varies across states Schwartz, V. E. and C. Silverman (2009). "Preemption of State Common Law by Federal Agency
Action: Striking the Appropriate Balance that Protects Public Safety." Tul. L. Rev. 84: 1203..
4
  This modeling choice contrasts, for example, with the economic literatures on tax and regulatory competition,
which assumes that legal rules vary across jurisdictions and that firms can operate in multiple jurisdictions and can
change jurisdictions to avoid regulation Oates, W. E. and R. M. Schwab (1988). "Economic competition among
jurisdictions: efficiency enhancing or distortion inducing?" Journal of public economics 35(3): 333-354.. The
regulatory competition literature does not address the exact analogue of the case we consider here: the effect of a
single jurisdiction’s liability rules when firms operate in that and other jurisdictions.
5
  This contracting has an important effect on welfare: it may be possible by allocating liability asymmetrically
among tortfeasors to achieve the first best. This is similar the insight that contracting between agents can address
moral hazard in teams without a budget breaker Legros, P. and S. A. Matthews (1993). "Efficient and Nearly-
Efficient Partnerships." The Review of Economic Studies 60(3): 599-611..

operates in multiple jurisdictions.6 Tort rules allocate liability between upstream and downstream firms.
And, in many cases, increases in upstream liability reduce the liability flowing downstream, and vice-
versa. We assume that consumers cannot contract over product safety, so that products liability can
theoretically improve welfare. We also assume that the downstream firm cannot contract with the
upstream firm over safety, a second contrast with Hay and Spier.7 Downstream firms do, however,
contract over quantity, i.e., purchase from the upstream firm, distinguishing our model from the prior
literature on multiple tortfeasors.

         The central implication of our model is that, when upstream firms operate in multiple
jurisdictions, efforts by a local jurisdiction to impose greater liability on upstream firms may increase
output of the hazardous good, a result that runs contrary to all prior models of tort liability.8 Because
the upstream firm operates in multiple jurisdictions, its nationwide precautionary behavior – and thus
its supply function – does not change dramatically in response to local tort reforms. However, since
higher upstream liability often reduces the share of liability that flows downstream, the local
downstream distributor’s demand for the hazardous upstream product increases. The perverse result is
higher equilibrium output of the risky good in a local jurisdiction that imposes stricter tort liability
upstream. Product liability imposed on the upstream firm functions as a type of insurance for the
downstream firm. The result is analogous to moral hazard, as the downstream firm produces more of
the hazardous good in light of its extra insurance.

        From a normative point of view, the presence of multiple jurisdictions undermines the typical
welfare logic of tort rules. With a single, uniform legal regime, the upstream firm passes on its liability
costs to the downstream firm in the form of its price. This “pass-through” liability cost plus the
downstream firm’s own direct liability cost ends up being exactly equal to the total liability associated
with the product. In this case, the downstream firm faces exactly the right incentives, and efficiency
ensues. However, this logic breaks down when the upstream firm operates in multiple jurisdictions.

         With multiple jurisdictions, the upstream firm’s liability costs are equal to the market-weighted
average liability cost across all jurisdictions. It continues to transmit these costs downstream in its
pricing, but in this case, the “pass-through” cost plus the downstream firm’s local liability cost may not
add up to the true liability in each locale. With multiple jurisdictions, incentives are aligned only in those

  In contrast to Spence Spence, M. (1977). "Consumer misperceptions, product failure and producer liability." The
Review of Economic Studies 44(3): 561-572., we assume consumers do not underestimate (or overestimate) risk,
so that mistaken beliefs do not drive inefficiency in our model.

Studies 14(3): 535-567.. In a prior working paper, however, we show that, if there are transactions costs, higher
tort liability can increase demand and thereby increase equilibrium supply, but, unlike in the current paper, there
we did not consider the relationship between upstream and downstream liability.

jurisdictions where the upstream liability rule is exactly equal to the average liability imposed by all
jurisdictions together. States imposing above average upstream liability costs will suffer excessive
output of the risky good, because downstream firms will behave too recklessly. In these states, further
increases in upstream liability exacerbate the inefficiency and lead to even more sales of the risky good,
and vice-versa.

          We test the positive predictions of the theory using data from the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
We use punitive damage caps to measure liability on upstream pharmaceutical firms. We show that an
increase in upstream punitive damage liability on drug companies lowers the absolute level of liability
faced by downstream doctors.9 We then find that higher upstream drug liability leads to an increase in
prescribing by downstream doctors. However, in states where noneconomic damage caps already limit
liability for doctors, we find that changing the liability of upstream firms does not affect prescribing by
downstream doctors.

          Table 1 provides a simple illustration of our main empirical findings. The table reports average
drug sales—measured as the number of prescriptions written per outpatient visit—by state according to
the products liability and malpractice liability regimes.10 Surprisingly, states with higher products
liability for upstream drug manufacturers have 2.3% more drug prescriptions per visit as compared to
states with lower liability exposure for manufacturers.

          Closer inspection reveals that this increase is driven by the subset of states where liability is
shared across doctors and drug companies, rather than by the states in which liability is targeted
exclusively at drug companies themselves. States that cap malpractice liability for physicians are
effectively shifting all, or nearly all of, the liability upstream, without sharing it across the vertical chain
of production. Thus, increases in upstream liability have no spillover effects on the liability faced by
downstream firms. In these states, higher upstream liability has the expected effect of reducing
prescribing by 5.2%. However, among states without caps where liability is shared between drug
companies and doctors, greater upstream liability leads to a 7.4% increase in prescription drug
utilization. While these results are unadjusted for other factors, we obtain qualitatively similar findings
even with a full set of regression controls and various fixed effects specifications.

        This result stands in stark contrast with the prior empirical literature on tort liability. A number
of studies find that higher tort liability reduces quantity of output in health care, at least as measured by
the supply of physicians or physician services (Kessler, Sage et al. 2005; Klick and Stratmann 2007; Matsa
2007; Currie and MacLeod 2008; Helland and Showalter 2009; Helland and Tabarrok 2012; Malani and
Reif 2013). In general, no prior studies find that higher liability is associated with increased output,
though there is much recent evidence that the threat of malpractice liability does change physician
9
  One concern is that higher permissible punitive damages do not merely shift liability from downstream doctors to
upstream drug companies, but rather increase liability of both actors. Punitive damages are easier to obtain,
however, if the doctor testifies against the drug company. Thus plaintiffs frequently give doctors a break on
liability in order to increase the expected punitive award from drug companies. Moreover, doctors rarely pay
punitive damages.
10
   The data and methods used to construct the table are described in detail in Section II.



                                                        4
treatment patterns (Cotet 2012; Frakes 2012; Frakes 2013; Avraham and Schanzenbach 2015).
Moreover, no papers find (or explain) that the effect of higher liability on upstream firms depends on
the liability of downstream firms. We find that the spillover effects of liability on upstream firms on
downstream firms are an empirically significant phenomenon, at least in the pharmaceutical industry.

        The remainder of the paper can be outlined as follows. Section I presents models of tort liability
with vertical production and an upstream firm that operates in multiple jurisdictions. Section II presents
our empirical application. We conclude with topics for future research.

I.   Theory

A.   Economic environment

         We begin with an upstream firm that produces a hazardous input that it sells to downstream
firms in 𝑁 different legal jurisdictions. For simplicity, each downstream firm operates in only one market
or jurisdiction. The latter assumption does not sacrifice generality so long as downstream firms can set
retail prices differentially across jurisdictions in order to reflect different levels of liability risk.

         The amount of hazardous input sold in jurisdiction 𝑖 is denoted 𝑥𝑖 . Each representative firm in
jurisdiction 𝑖 produces an output 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ), which is sold at the price 𝑝𝑖 . Downstream production is
increasing and concave (𝑓𝑥 > 0, 𝑓𝑥𝑥 < 0).11 The hazardous input has marginal cost of production 𝑐 and
associated input price 𝑤.

        We make two simplifying assumptions here that are relaxed in the appendix. First, to focus on
the most relevant aspects of the problem, we assume production depends only on the risky input, not
on any safe inputs. Second, to abstract from welfare costs due to market power, we assume upstream
and downstream firms are competitive.

         The upstream hazardous good producer may have various tools at its disposal for managing
harms, depending on the nature of the good being produced. Some manufacturers may be able to make
direct safety investments in production that reduce risk – for instance, firms producing consumer goods
like clothing and tires. Others may be unable to influence the actual safety of the good, but able to warn
users about the product’s risks. Pharmaceuticals are a prime example. U.S. tort law addresses the first
situation in “design defect” and “manufacturing defect cases” and the second in “failure to warn” cases.

        The product in our empirical application – pharmaceutical drugs – is legally exempted from
design defect liability. Courts have concluded that drugs are inherently unsafe and hold pharmaceutical
companies liable only for failure to disclose known side effects to physicians.12 Therefore, we present a


11
   We consider the allocation of liability between an upstream and downstream firm. However, the model can be
extended to the case of a single producer and a consumer, where the consumer’s use of the product can harm
third parties, as in Hay and Spier Hay, B. and K. E. Spier (2005). "Manufacturer Liability for Harms Caused by
Consumers to Others." The American Economic Review 95(5): 1700-1711..

   See Restatement (Second) of Torts §402a, cmt. K.



                                                       5
model in which the upstream firm can only warn users about product risks. The appendix analyzes a
model of an upstream firm that can also change the safety of its products.

         The harm to consumers in jurisdiction 𝑖 from the hazardous input is proportional to its utilization
in the final product according to ℎ𝑥𝑖 , where ℎ is a fixed factor beyond the upstream firm’s control.13
Conceptually, ℎ is the summation of different risks associated with the input. For example, it could be
the sum total of harms in the aviation industry associated with aircraft engine failure, body failure,
electronics failure, and so on. The upstream firm can choose to report some of these harms, but not
others. To capture this, we let the upstream firm choose to report the share 𝑟 of these harms.

         We make three critical assumptions that govern the harm from the hazardous input. First, we
assume the upstream firm sells a common product across jurisdictions, so it cannot customize warnings
by jurisdiction. In a national or global marketplace, arbitrage forces the upstream firm to sell at a
common price across jurisdictions. If upstream firms can easily price discriminate across jurisdictions,
the multiple jurisdiction problem collapses to the single-jurisdiction model, which behaves in a more
standard fashion. However, this price-discrimination is often difficult to achieve, particularly across
state lines within the US.

       Second, we assume that, while the upstream firm knows the harm from its product, the
downstream firm does not. It must infer harm from the tort environment and any disclosures that the
upstream firm makes.

         Third, we assume that demand for the final output does not depend on the harm ℎ𝑥𝑖 . This is a
common assumption in the literature on products liability. The typical justification is that, if the
assumption failed to be true, consumers would be able to observe and contract directly for the level of
safety they desire, without products liability rules (Miceli 1997).14 This type of contracting or demand
behavior is not typically seen, either because safety is not observable at the time of contracting, or
because it is costly to negotiate a settlement after the safety of the product is revealed through use.
Another possible justification is that consumers have health, life, or property insurance that makes them
indifferent to the harm. Each of these justifications appears plausible in the pharmaceutical industry,
which is the subject of our empirical application.


13
   We abstract from dynamic decisions relating to product withdrawal and introduction.
14
   There may be a role where consumers demand heterogeneous levels of safety but there is only one (upstream)
producer and it can only supply one level of safety. For example, Choi and Spier Choi, A. H. and K. E. Spier (2014).
"Should Consumers be Permitted to Waive Products Liability? Product Safety, Private Contracts, and Adverse
Selection." Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization 30(4): 734-766. Consider the case where safety depends
on precautions by a single producer and consumers differ in the probability of being harmed by a product. The
firm may choose to lower its precaution in order to select for lower risk consumers much as insurance companies
may reduce coverage on a given policy in order to adversely select for lower risk beneficiaries. Non-waivable
products liability, like an insurance mandate, stops this selection. Note that the sale of multiple products with
different levels of safety and price, as in Hay and Spier Hay, B. and K. E. Spier (2005). "Manufacturer Liability for
Harms Caused by Consumers to Others." The American Economic Review 95(5): 1700-1711. , can do the same,
though it reduces cross subsidization.



                                                          6
          The total damages awarded by courts in jurisdiction 𝑖 are given by ℎ𝑥𝑖 . Whereas final
consumers cannot easily observe product safety, courts – through evidentiary discovery – are able to
both observe and punish lapses in safety. This too is a common assumption in the literature on products
liability. The amount of total damages captures the legal restriction that damages cannot generally
exceed the losses suffered by consumers.15 A critical issue in our context is how the total liability is
shared across upstream and downstream firms. We assume this depends on two parameters. First, the
upstream firm can protect itself by disclosing more harms. Therefore, the upstream firm’s share of
liability falls with 𝑟, the share of harms disclosed. Second, the policy regime might influence the
allocation of liability across upstream and downstream firms. For example, in the pharmaceutical
context, state laws protecting downstream physicians from large tort claims might reduce the share of
liability that flows downstream, and vice-versa. Therefore, we express the upstream firm’s share of
damages in jurisdiction 𝑖 as 𝑎𝑖 = 𝑎(𝑡𝑖 , 𝑟), which depends on some tort policy parameter, 𝑡𝑖 ∈ [0,1], and
the rate of disclosure. Note that tort law may vary across jurisdictions, but a firm’s disclosure is
constrained to be the same across jurisdictions, because information travels freely. We assume
upstream share of liability rises in the tort parameter, i.e., 𝑎𝑖𝑡 > 0. Moreover, we assume that the
upstream firm’s share of liability 𝑎 is decreasing in the share of harms it discloses: 𝑎𝑟 < 0. We also
assume disclosure, if anything, relieves greater tort liability the higher is that tort liability, i.e., 𝑎𝑡𝑟 ≤ 0.

         We do not explicitly model the disclosure game that upstream and downstream firms play, and
thus the inferences that the downstream firm draws from an upstream firm’s disclosure signal. A
specific disclosure game would limit the generality of the analysis. Instead, in order to keep the analysis
simple and at a price-theoretic level, we make two assumptions. First, we presume that the upstream
firm fails to disclose all the hazards associated with its product. As we show later, this assumption
implies that downstream firms will believe a good is riskier whenever the upstream firm discloses more
harms. Second, we assume that, whatever game firms play, downstream firms update their beliefs
about product hazards purely on the basis of upstream firm disclosures, and not the tort law regime per
se. In other words, 𝐸[ℎ|𝑡′, 𝑟ℎ] = 𝐸[ℎ|𝑡′′, 𝑟ℎ] ∀ 𝑡 ′ , 𝑡′′, where 𝐸[ℎ|𝑡, 𝑟ℎ] reflects the downstream firm’s
inference about the hazards of the upstream output given tort law and upstream disclosure. While this
assumption rules out complex effects of the policy configuration on beliefs, it captures the fairly intuitive
first-order effects of disclosure.

B.      Liability rules, behavior, and welfare

        The upstream firm embeds its expected liability costs in the price that it transmits downstream.
We first show how liability rules mediate the relationship between liability costs and pricing.

           Upstream firm. The upstream firm’s objective is

                                           max Σ𝑗 𝑥𝑗 (𝑟)(𝑤 − 𝑐 − 𝑎(𝑡𝑗 , 𝑟)ℎ)
                                             𝑟




15
     An exception is punitive damages, a topic we will take up in the empirical section.



                                                            7
When upstream profits are zero due to competition, the optimal price 𝑤 passes on the average
upstream tort liability: 𝑤 = 𝑐 + 𝑎̅ℎ, where 𝑎̅ = Σ𝑗 𝑎(𝑡𝑗 , 𝑟)𝑥𝑗 (𝑟) is the sales-weighted average of the
upstream firm’s liability allocation across jurisdictions. The firm’s optimal disclosure policy 𝑟 ∗∗ balances
the reduction in demand against the reduction in average tort costs. However, policy changes within a
single jurisdiction have much smaller effects than analogous changes that apply globally. To see this,
observe that:

                                        𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ −𝑥𝑖′ 𝑎𝑖,𝑡 ℎ − 𝑥𝑖 𝑎𝑖,𝑟𝑡 ℎ
                                             =                         > 0, ∀𝑖
                                        𝜕𝑡𝑖           −𝑆𝑂𝐶

The 𝑆𝑂𝐶 term in the denominator is the second derivative of the objective function and is thus negative.
This effect of jurisdiction 𝑖′𝑠 tort law on disclosure is always positive, as are the corresponding effects of
each independent jurisdiction 𝑗. Therefore, it follows that adding up the effects of tort changes across
the individual jurisdictions will magnify the total effect on disclosure, or that:

                                       𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ −𝑥𝑖′ 𝑎𝑖,𝑡 ℎ − 𝑥𝑖 𝑎𝑖,𝑟𝑡 ℎ      𝜕𝑟 ∗∗                              (1)
                                            =                         < Σ𝑗       ,
                                       𝜕𝑡𝑖           −𝑆𝑂𝐶                  𝜕𝑡𝑗

where 𝑆𝑂𝐶 < 0 is now the upstream firm’s second order condition in the heterogeneous legal
environment. In the limit, as the share of jurisdiction 𝑖 in total output goes to zero, an increase in
upstream liability will have no effect on disclosure.16 In contrast, when legal regimes are homogeneous
and policy changes occur in lockstep across jurisdictions, changes in liability rules always affect
disclosure behavior.

        Downstream firm. The downstream firm’s objective is

                             max 𝑝𝑖 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ) − (𝑤 + E[(1 − 𝑎(𝑡𝑖 , 𝑟 ∗∗ ))ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ ])𝑥𝑖
                               xi

After plugging in the upstream firm’s prices into the first-order condition from this problem, the optimal
input usage for the downstream firm satisfies:

                                    𝑝𝑓𝑥𝑖 = 𝑐 + 𝐸[𝑎̅ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ] + 𝐸[(1 − 𝑎𝑖 )ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ]

        Note the effect of heterogeneous legal rules on this expression. If all jurisdictions move in
lockstep, then 𝑎̅ = 𝑎𝑖 , and this expression collapses to 𝑝𝑓𝑥𝑖 = 𝑐 + 𝐸(ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ). Here, tort rules have no
effect on downstream firm behavior, because the input price charged by the upstream firm perfectly
embeds the cost of liability borne by the upstream firm. From a normative point of view, efficiency
obtains in this case so long as tort policies induce downstream firms to make accurate inferences about
harm, or that 𝐸(ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ) = ℎ.




  Since disclosure 𝑟 is bounded in [0,1], we know that the change in Σ𝑗 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑗 must also be bounded. As
16

Σ¬𝑖 𝑥𝑗 → ∞, the ratio of 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑗 to Σ𝑗 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑗 must go to zero for (1) to hold.




                                                           8
         If instead jurisdictions vary in their tort rules, the incentives of the downstream firm depart from
efficiency even if they have accurate beliefs. Downstream firms typically face private liability costs that
are higher or lower than social costs; perfect equality is a knife-edge case. Specifically, within
jurisdictions where the local upstream share of liability is lower than average, the downstream firm will
overutilize the input, relative to the efficient level.

        Comparative statics imply that increasing upstream liability share affects output as follows:

     𝜕𝑥   1     𝜕𝑎̅ 𝜕𝑎𝑖       𝜕𝑎̅ 𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗                                  𝜕𝐸[ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ] 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗
        =    [{( −      ) + ( ∗∗ − ∗∗ )     } 𝐸[ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ] + (𝑎̅ + (1 − 𝑎𝑖 ))                    ]
     𝜕𝑡𝑖 𝑝𝑓𝑥𝑥 𝜕𝑡𝑖 𝜕𝑡𝑖        𝜕𝑟   𝜕𝑟    𝜕𝑡𝑖                                    𝜕𝑟 ∗∗      𝜕𝑡𝑖

When legal regimes are homogeneous, the above expression is negative, and imposing greater liability
upstream results in less production of the risky good. However, for heterogeneous legal regimes, the
sign of the above effect is uncertain. While additional tort liability in jurisdiction 𝑖 has positive direct
effects on upstream liability (𝜕𝑎̅/𝜕𝑡𝑖 > 0), this effect is offset by greater disclosure ((𝜕𝑎𝑖 /𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ )(𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /
𝜕𝑡𝑖 )).

In the limit, as the upstream firm operates in more and more jurisdictions beyond 𝑖, the effect becomes
clearer. As 𝑋 = Σ¬𝑖 𝑥𝑗 → ∞, the effect of a single jurisdiction’s actions on average liability goes to zero,
so that lim𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑎̅/ 𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0. At the same time, the effect of a single jurisdiction’s tort rules on the
upstream firm’s disclosure decision also goes to zero, so that lim𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0. For this limiting
case, higher upstream liability in jurisdiction 𝑖 results perversely in greater use of the hazardous input:

                                     𝜕𝑥   1      𝜕𝑎𝑖
                                        =     (−     𝐸[ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ]) > 0
                                     𝜕𝑡𝑖 𝑝𝑓𝑥𝑥    𝜕𝑡𝑖

When a single jurisdiction imposes more liability on the upstream firm, it fails to affect its behavior,
because it is too small to do so. However, it does encourage its own local downstream firms to behave
more recklessly, because they face less liability risk.

        The following two propositions summarize the positive and normative implications of this
analysis, respectively.

Proposition 1. Suppose the upstream firm cannot affect the safety of a product, the upstream firm has
chosen an interior value for disclosure, and the downstream firm has chosen interior values for the
hazardous input.

    A) In a homogenous legal environment, a global increase in upstream liability share will reduce
       downstream usage of the hazardous input, and its associated output.
    B) In a heterogeneous legal environment, an increase in upstream liability share within one
       jurisdiction has effects that are in general ambiguous.
    C) In a heterogeneous legal environment where the share of each jurisdiction in aggregate output
       goes to zero, an increase in upstream liability share within one jurisdiction will increase the use
       of the hazardous input in that jurisdiction.




                                                        9
Therefore, when legal regimes are homogeneous, imposing greater liability on upstream firms has the
intended effect. Under heterogeneity, however, greater liability on upstream firms may perversely
increase the use of the hazardous input, especially when each individual jurisdiction makes up a
comparatively small share of output.

From a normative point of view, efficiency requires that downstream firms make accurate inferences
about harms, and that upstream pricing appropriately embeds liability risk. The following proposition
summarizes these findings.

 Proposition 2. Suppose the upstream firm cannot affect the safety of a product, the upstream firm has
chosen an interior value for disclosure, and the downstream firm has chosen interior values for the
hazardous input.

      A) In a homogeneous legal environment, the first best is achieved if the tort parameter causes the
         downstream firm to make correct inferences about the harms of the hazardous input.
      B) In a heterogeneous legal environment, the first best is achieved if: (1) the tort parameter causes
         the downstream firm to make correct inferences about the harms of the hazardous input; and (2)
         the upstream share of liability within a jurisdiction is equal to the average share of upstream
         liability across all jurisdictions.
      C) In a heterogeneous legal environment where downstream firms make correct inferences about
         harms: (1) If the tort law parameters cause upstream share in jurisdiction 𝑖 to be greater (less)
         than average upstream share, then the downstream firm will use more (less) of the hazardous
         input 𝑥𝑖 and produce more (less) output 𝑦𝑖 than is socially optimal; and (2) as the output share of
         jurisdiction 𝑖 falls to zero, a change in tort law that causes upstream share to rise in jurisdiction 𝑖
         with above average upstream liability share 𝑎𝑖 will reduce (increase) both welfare in jurisdiction 𝑖
         and global welfare.

The claim in Proposition 2C is proven in the appendix, but the intuition is straightforward. Jurisdictions
with higher than average upstream liability are encouraging inefficiently reckless behavior by
downstream firms. In such jurisdictions, further increases in upstream liability exacerbate this
inefficiency and make the jurisdiction worse off.

II.   Empirical analysis

A.    Empirical predictions

        Proposition 1 implies a number of testable predictions for the real-world case in which
individual jurisdictions have small or minimal effects on global or national output.

      1. Policy changes within a single jurisdiction will affect neither the liability exposure nor the
                                                         ̅
                                                        𝝏𝒂       𝝏𝒓∗∗
          disclosure behavior of the upstream firm, or 𝝏𝒕 = 0,   𝝏𝒕𝒊
                                                                        = 0,. Therefore, tort rules that increase
                                                             𝒊
          the liability faced by the downstream firm will lead unambiguously to less output in a
                             𝜕𝑥
          jurisdiction, i.e., 𝜕𝑡 𝑖 𝑑𝑡𝑖 <, if 𝑑𝑡𝑖 < 0.
                               𝑖




                                                        10
    2. Within a single jurisdiction, tort rules that increase the upstream share of liability perversely lead
                                                 𝜕𝑥
        to more output in that jurisdiction, i.e., 𝜕𝑡 𝑖 𝑑𝑡𝑖 > 0, when 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑎̅/ 𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0, 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /
                                                   𝑖
       𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0, and 𝑑𝑡𝑖 > 0.
    3. As a corollary of #2, tort policy changes will not affect output if downstream firms are insulated
                               𝜕𝑥                 𝜕𝑎
        from liability changes, 𝜕𝑡 𝑖 𝑑𝑡𝑖 = 0, when 𝑖 = 0, 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑎̅/ 𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0, 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑋→∞ 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0,
                                  𝑖               𝜕𝑡   𝑖
        and 𝑑𝑡𝑖 > 0.

Notice that effects 2 and 3 imply that the positive impact of upstream liability on output should be
larger when downstream firms share liability than when they do not. Thus, the interaction effect
between higher upstream liability and the imposition of liability for downstream firms should be
positive. This is the empirical prediction generated by the theoretical model, and which we test in our
empirical analysis.

         We study the empirical context of state-level tort rules applied to the pharmaceutical market in
the US. The pharmaceutical market is a useful setting in which to test our model, because it is
populated by upstream drug manufacturers that produce drugs and downstream physicians’ practices
that use drugs as an input in the delivery of health care. Upstream drug manufacturers operate in
multiple jurisdictions with different legal environments, which in our application are US states. In
contrast, each downstream physician operates in only one state due to state licensing laws. Due partly
to arbitrage opportunities and partly to the institutional detail that a small number of pharmacy benefit
managers negotiate drug prices for most insurance plans, upstream drug companies sell any given drug
at the same price across states and cannot fully control the quantity of sales within each state
(Lakdawalla and Yin 2013). Downstream doctors can control sales within a state because, other than
over-the-counter medications, drugs cannot be dispensed without a prescription. Finally, while branded
drug manufacturers are not competitive, the Appendix demonstrates how our results generalize with a
monopolist firm upstream. Positive and normative results are similar, holding fixed the standard
deadweight loss from monopoly.

         One difference between the pharmaceutical market in practice and the theory is the possibility
that physicians may not internalize the full financial cost of drugs. In some cases they do, such as for
physician-administered products, where traditionally physicians purchase drugs and then administer
them in exchange for some reimbursement per unit administered (Polite, Conti et al. 2015). In other
cases, they will internalize prices only partially, whether through altruism for the well-being of a patient
that faces costs of taking a drug (Godager and Wiesen 2013), or through insurance companies that
impose prior authorization or other costly compliance procedures on physicians before they can
prescribe expensive products (LaPensee 2003). Mispricing will thus lead to overutilization through a
different channel. Our theoretical results continue to apply, however, provided we compare them to a
“second-best” equilibrium in which the only market failure is the underpricing of drugs to physicians.

         We use the presence of punitive damage caps on products liability awards as the policy variable
that increases the liability of upstream drug manufacturers relative to downstream physicians. We use
the presence of a noneconomic damage cap on medical malpractice awards as the policy variable that


                                                       11
imposes liability on downstream physicians. Later, we explain how these policy parameters have the
necessary effects on the allocation of liability upstream and downstream.

        We begin by describing the various sources of data we use, in Section B. Section C provides
background on products liability for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and then provides evidence that
punitive damage caps shift liability from upstream drug manufacturers to downstream physicians, and
vice-versa. Section D presents and tests some basic assumptions of our identification strategy, and
discusses our empirical specification for the tests of the model. Section E presents our results.

B.   Data

1.   Quantity of drug sales

        There is no single, nationally representative source for drug utilization data. We derive
measures of the utilization of prescription drugs from a large database of private-sector health
insurance claims. These data are drawn from the Touchstone database of Optum, a healthcare
consulting firm. We received information on all pharmacy spending and utilization for all covered
patients from 1997 to 2007. These data have been used in a number of prior analyses of pharmaceutical
drug utilization (Joyce, Escarce et al. 2002; Goldman, Joyce et al. 2004; Goldman, Joyce et al. 2006).

          Using these data, we construct aggregate measures of utilization by drug, state and year. While
the Touchstone data track national numbers reasonably well, they are not designed to be a nationally
representative sample. To address possible differences in sampling by state over time, we reweight the
utilization data so as to be nationally representative by gender and age category. We begin by
calculating state-level enrollment in Touchstone by gender, and 8 age categories (0-10, 11-19, 20-29, 30-
39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-64, 65+). Next, we use the Current Population Survey (CPS) to calculate total US
insured population by state, gender, and age cells.17 The CPS data are used to weight the Touchstone
data and construct total utilization at the drug-state-year level. To normalize prescribing behavior
according to population size and utilization of health care, we focus on the number of prescriptions for
each drug per 1,000 total outpatient physician visits in a state and year.18

2.   Tort liability rules

          Our identification strategy relies on legislative changes that impact expected tort liability
separately for upstream manufacturers and downstream doctors. Our primary treatment variable for
manufacturer liability comes from caps on punitive damages. Later we argue that these caps affect the
share of upstream liability relative to downstream liability. We proxy for expected punitive damages
liability using a variable that is set to zero if a state caps punitive damages and one otherwise. Thus we

17
   The insured population includes individuals covered by private insurance or Medicare. We include Medicare
because may of the old insureds in the MIDas data have both private coverage and Medicare.
18
   Note that not every prescription requires a visit to a physician. Some prescriptions could be written at hospitals
or in emergency departments. Also, we focus on 30-day equivalent prescriptions, so any refills count as separate
physicians. So this measure should not be interpreted as the probability that a prescription is filled conditional on
a visit.



                                                         12
interpret our treatment variable as legislation that creates high products liability within a state.
Similarly, we use noneconomic damage caps as shocks to the medical malpractice liability of doctors.19
Our treatment variable for downstream doctor liability is set to zero if a state has a damage cap in place
and one otherwise; it can be interpreted as the presence of high malpractice liability.

        The data on legislative reforms come from Avraham’s data (Avraham 2014). In the case of
punitive damages, we utilize only legislative changes that apply to products liability. Since Avraham’s
data focus primarily on medical malpractice litigation, we supplemented these data with our own search
using state statutes to determine the rules governing products liability.

        Table 2 describes the legislative changes that occurred during the timing of our study sample.
During our sample period six states (AL, AK, AR, ID, MS, MO, and OH) adopted punitive damage caps
that applied to products liability cases, while two states (PA and IL) repealed caps. During this same time
period, 8 states (FL, GA, IL, MS, NV, OH, OK, TX) adopted non-economic caps for medical malpractice
cases.

3.   Drug characteristics

         In our regression analyses, we control for other characteristics of drugs that could relate to
sales. These include the generic status of the drug, as well as the number of generic competitors within
the same therapeutic class. We use the 2007 Red Book20 to provide information on generic status and
therapeutic class by drug. Broadly speaking, the therapeutic class is a means for grouping drugs
according to their use in clinical settings (e.g., “beta blockers”). Our data included 74 different
therapeutic categories.21 To construct the number of generic competitors, we sum across drugs within
class for all the drugs in our sample by year.

       While generic drugs are older on average, the age of a drug could have an independent effect on
demand. Older drugs have more established track records of real-world use, potentially generating
more information on safety or real-world efficacy that cannot be gleaned from clinical trials of a few
thousand patients. We use information on a drug’s age, defined as current year minus the year of
approval, which we obtain from the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Orange Book database.

        Finally, we also use information on black box warnings on the package inserts of prescription
drugs. “Black box warnings” represent official disclosures from the manufacturer of adverse event risks.

19
   We focus on noneconomic damage caps because these reforms are generally found to have the strongest and
most robust impact on expected liability Danzon, P. M. and L. A. Lillard (1983). "Settlement out of court: The

   The Red Book™ is a database on pharmaceutical produces published by Truven Health Analytics that includes a
comprehensive set of identifiers on all brand, generic and over-the-counter products.
21
   This includes a category in which we pooled together relatively rare drugs where there were insufficient
observations to include class fixed effects separately (about 5% of drugs fell in this category).



                                                     13
If manufacturers disclose safety risks in the form of trial or other data, the FDA may choose to require
the issuance of a black box warning for the drug. Data on black box warnings were gathered by hand
from archived MedWatch reports available on the FDA website. Our black box warning data cover the
warnings in effect between 1996 and 2009.

        Table 3 summarizes the quantity and other drug utilization statistics. In total, we have data on
up to 1,227 drugs for up to 10 years in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since some drugs are
introduced or withdrawn from the market during the sample, we end up with 510,969 observations
(approximately 8 years per drug per state). There are about 1.8 prescriptions per 1,000 visits on
average, with an average price per prescription of about $198. The share of observations with high
products liability and high malpractice liability is almost the same, about 60%, but this masks
considerable variation across states. About 22% and 24% of observations are states and years with only
high products liability or malpractice liability, respectively, and 36% of observations have both.

4.   Products liability and medical malpractice liability

         We employ data on actual liability payments by drug manufacturers and physicians, in order to
investigate how our tort policy variables affect upstream versus downstream liability. We gathered data
on drug litigation from the LexisNexis book Guide to Drugs in Litigation. This book, commonly referred to
as the “Grey Book,” is updated annually and covers all drug suits in LexisNexis’s extensive database of
litigated cases. Like all publicly available litigation data, its sample frame is limited to cases that go to
trial and generate a written opinion and/or trials and settlements discussed in other public sources.

         Our data on physician malpractice liability payments come from the National Practitioner Data
Base (NPDB). The NPDB is a nationwide database of payments in malpractice cases and includes
payments that result from settlements and plaintiff wins at trial. The database contains information on
over 200,000 medical malpractice payments made on behalf of practitioners in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia.22 We aggregate these data to the state-year level. We employ data from the
period 1992 to 2007 in our analysis.23 One limitation of the NPDB is that it does not contain dropped
cases. Ideally we would like to capture the full cost of litigation to doctors, which would include the time
and reputation costs of dealing with all cases even those which are eventually dropped (Seabury,
Chandra et al. 2013). This limitation is arguably less important in our application since doctors are
typically named in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and then given a reduced settlement or

   The NPDB is the most comprehensive, publicly available database on malpractice claims, but also has some
problems with incomplete reporting Government Accounting Office (2000). Major Improvements Are Needed to
Enhance Data Bank’s Reliability. Washington, DC, GAO.. However, for our purposes it is important to note that it is
unlikely these reporting issues would be differentially affected across states or across types of claims (e.g.,
medication-related or other).



                                                        14
the case against the doctor is dropped in exchange for their testimony against the manufacturer. Since
we are only capturing the reduction in payments by the physician, and not the increase in dropped
cases, our estimates are biased toward zero.

        A few well known caveats about the NPDB should be mentioned. First since the NPDB includes
only paid claims it does not reflect physicians’ liability from uncompensated claims (i.e. lost time and
legal costs). As such our estimates of the impact of tort reform represent a lower bound on changes in
physician risk, because legal reforms may also reduce the incentive to file cases in the first place. The
second is that we utilize information on medication error cases in determining the impact of punitive
damage caps on physician liability. Not all of these cases involve “failure to warn” since the category
would include cases involving known drug interactions, prescribing the wrong medication or the wrong
dose. Nonetheless “failure to warn” cases would fall into this category. As such our results will again be
biased toward zero since there is no reason to think that punitive damage caps should increase
physician liability in cases that do not involve a pharmaceutical company.

C.   Background on products liability and punitive damages for pharmaceutical manufacturers

1.   Failure-to-warn liability in pharmaceuticals

          Drug companies are exposed to products liability primarily through failure to warn suits, which
subject companies to damages if they fail to disclose to physicians all drug side effects about which they
should have known. Drug companies are not subject to design defect liability, because courts believe
that drugs are inherently unsafe and companies cannot reformulate them to eliminate side effects
(Restatement (Second) of Torts, §402A, comment K). Drug companies occasionally face liability for
defects that arise during the manufacturing of a drug. Such cases are not thought to create significant
liability, however, because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates companies’ manufacturing
processes, reducing the frequency of manufacturing defects.24

         There are several indications that products liability is an important cost of production for
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Products liability is a primary driver of the pharmaceutical industry’s
legal liabilities (Viscusi 1991). In Table 4, we summarize information from the LexisNexis Drugs in
Litigation reports (the so-called “Grey Book”) from 1990-2009. We abstracted data from 665 trials. The
average award in this sample was $6.49 million. When a damage award was granted, the average award
was $15.85 million (approximately 41% of cases involved a damage award). Note that these numbers
reflect only a fraction of the total costs of products liability to pharmaceutical manufacturers, as the vast
majority are paid in out-of-court settlements and are not included in these figures. Also note that, in
contrast to doctors, who purchase liability insurance against medical malpractice cases, drug companies
are typically self-insured against products liability.



24
  For our empirical analysis, our predictions about the impact of liability on the quantity of drugs sales will be the
same regardless of whether the source of liability is from failure to warn or manufacturing defects, though the
predictions about the impact on safety could differ.

2.   Sharing of liability between physicians and manufacturers

We rely on the idea that punitive damage caps lower the share of liability faced by upstream
manufacturers. The crux of our argument relies on the position of a physician in drug safety litigation. In
particular, when drug manufacturers face greater liability, they are more attractive targets for litigation,
and it is more valuable to secure the cooperation of a physician to testify against the manufacturer. As
such, punitive damage caps reduce the absolute liability faced by upstream manufacturers and make it
less likely that doctors will be able to avoid liability themselves. In this manner, they reduce both the
level and share of liability faced by manufacturers. We first flesh out the institutional details that
underlie this argument and then substantiate it empirically.

         Although punitive damages are relatively uncommon, they are frequently responsible for the
largest verdicts in products liability (Eisenberg, Hannaford‐Agor et al. 2006), and they are an important
source of liability in failure-to-warn suits against pharmaceuticals. Table 4 shows that $1.37 million
(21%) of the average award in all pharmaceutical products liability cases were for punitive damages.
Punitive damages are only granted in 4% of cases and 11% of cases with an award, but when they are
granted, they average $43 million.

         Doctors and pharmaceutical manufacturers share liability in failure-to-warn drug cases for
several reasons. First, the doctor’s presence as a defendant allows plaintiffs to sue in state court. The
doctor is local, but the drug company is often out of state. Therefore, suing the company directly would
give rise to diversity jurisdiction and move the case to federal court (Willig 1985). Second, a failure to
warn case hinges on doctor’s testimony. Because the doctor is a so-called “learned intermediary,” the
adequacy of the warning depends on what the doctor knew rather than what the patient knew. If the
doctor is named as a defendant, his or her best strategy is fairly clear: The doctor will argue that the
drug’s warning was not sufficiently clear to prevent injury. This would absolve the doctor of
responsibility, but would make liability more likely for the drug manufacturer.25

         These conflicting defenses set up a possible commonality of interest between doctors and
plaintiff’s attorneys in cases involving pharmaceuticals. A doctor’s liability for malpractice is effectively
capped at their insurance policy limit (usually $1 million or less for a specific incident). Thus,
compensatory damages are close to the maximum that a plaintiff can get from individual doctor.
Moreover, winning any amount for a doctor is very difficult and costly. Approximately 80% of
malpractice claims against physicians result in no payment for a plaintiff (Jena, Seabury et al. 2011).26 In

25
   For example, a doctor could argue that the manufactures promotion was unclear about risk or not mentioned by
drug reps. It has long been established drug companies have a duty to warn of potential adverse reactions in
detailing see Yarrow v. Sterling Drug, Inc. 263 F. Supp. 159 (D.C.S.D. 1967).
26
   Despite this, physicians still report high levels of fear and anxiety over malpractice liability risk Carrier, E. R., J. D.
Reschovsky, et al. (2013). "High physician concern about malpractice risk predicts more aggressive diagnostic
testing in office-based practice." Health affairs 32(8): 1383-1391., possibly because of the long and costly process
for resolving a claim irrespective of outcome Seabury, S. A., A. Chandra, et al. (2013). "On Average, Physicians
Spend Nearly 11 Percent Of Their 40-Year Careers With An Open, Unresolved Malpractice Claim." Health Affairs
32(1): 111-119..



                                                             16
addition, the doctor’s testimony is often required to be able to win punitive damages (Willig 1985). Thus
the most direct path to success in a pharmaceutical product liability cases is to either to let the doctor
out of liability altogether in exchange for testimony or to reduce the portion of the compensatory and
non-economic damages the doctor must pay in the settlement.27 This argument appears to be
confirmed by our review of the Grey Book data, where 56% of cases involved a doctor named as a co-
defendant (Table 4). Focusing on the subset of cases that break out total payments into portions paid
by doctors and pharmaceutical companies, doctors typically settle for very small amounts and often no
payment at all.

         Further evidence for the importance of doctors’ testimony in products liability cases comes from
the silicone breast implant cases of the 1990s and early 2000s. Following Surgeon General Kessler’s 1992
decision to withdraw implants from the market, the already substantial volume of litigation picked up
dramatically and did not abate until the mid-2000s (Hersch 2002; Viscusi 2007). Much like
pharmaceutical litigation, medical device litigation requires doctors’ testimony to successfully prosecute
a case (Tancredi and Nelkin 2010). We examined data on 6,095 closed medical malpractice claims
against plastic surgeons from a single, large, nationwide malpractice insurer from 1991-2005.28 Within
these claims, 1,648 (27%) involved breast implants.29 For the claims that did not involve an implant,
approximately 11.5% involve some kind of indemnity payment to the plaintiff. This was comparable to
other surgical fields, in which the payment rate is 10.9%. However, just 5.4% of claims that involve an
implant also result in physician payment to the plaintiff. If we further restrict the sample to cases
involving ruptured implants (about 8%), the physician payment rate is just 1.2%.

          In our empirical tests, we use punitive damage caps as exogenous shocks to manufacturer
liability that (1) reduce the expected liability of manufacturers and (2) transfer that liability to increase
the expected liability for physicians. For this approach to be reasonable, we need to establish that
punitive damage caps indeed result in both these effects. The impact of punitive damages caps on
expected products liability is relatively straightforward to see. For example, in 2005 a jury in Texas found
Merck & Co. liable for a the death of a man who took the painkiller Vioxx and awarded his widow more
than $250 million, the vast majority of which came from punitive damages.30 However, even at the time
at which the verdict was awarded, it was widely understood that the plaintiff would be able to receive
no more than $26 million, because of the presence of a cap on punitive damages in Texas. Because

27
   Deals in which the plaintiff and a defendant reach a secret agreement to reduce one defendants damages at the
expense of another are so common that there name for them in product liability. They are called Mary Carter
agreements after the defendant in the case Booth v. Mary Carter Paint Co. 226 Cal. App. 2 d 8 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
1967.) Typically in drug cases the doctor remains a defendant to avoid diversity and testifies as an adverse witness
without admitting personal liability.

   We identify these with a text search of whether “implant” appears in the claim description field. Our results are
essentially the same if we replace “implant” with “silicone” in the text search.

punitive damage awards represent a significant share of the large “blockbuster awards,” and the threat
of these can be important tools for settlement negotiations, caps on punitive damages likely have an
impact on expected liability far beyond just their direct effect on verdict awards.31

         Moreover, the data suggest that punitive damage caps divert liability away from manufacturers
and on to doctors. Using malpractice awards data from the NPDB, we can empirically test this
hypothesis that punitive damage caps shift liability from the manufacturer to the physician. Let 𝐷𝑝𝑖𝑗𝑡
represent the malpractice damage award in case 𝑝 that occurred in state 𝑖 that involved an alleged error
type 𝑗 in year 𝑡. For our purposes, the key distinction is between damage awards for cases with
medication error, as opposed to other types of medical errors. We estimate the regression model:

                𝐷𝑝𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜃𝑈 𝐿𝑈 𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃𝐷 𝐿𝐷 𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃𝑈𝑗 𝛼𝑗 × 𝐿𝑈 𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑋 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑝𝑖𝑗𝑡

The policy variables are the tort rules 𝐿𝑖𝑡 in state 𝑖 at time 𝑡. We consider separate tort rules that
impact the upstream manufacturer (𝐿𝑈 ), the downstream physician (𝐿𝐷 ) and the interaction between
the two (𝐿𝑈 × 𝐿𝐷 ). Heuristically, these can be interpreted as “high products liability,” “high malpractice
liability” and “high products liability and high malpractice liability,” respectively. Specifically, “high
products liability” is the absence of punitive damage caps, and “high malpractice liability” is the absence
of noneconomic damage caps.

We also included several additional controls for state laws. Specifically we include whether the state has
a split recovery for punitive damages, whether the state has modified the collateral source rule so that
payments from third parties are deducted from any award, whether punitive awards have a higher
evidence standard, whether tort awards are must be paid out periodically over multiple years rather
than as a lump sum, whether the state has capped contingent fees, whether the state has limited joint
and several liability and finally whether the state has a patient compensation fund that pays a portion of
any award. In contrast to non-economic damage caps that directly limit physician liability by statute and
punitive damage caps that primarily limit products liability awards we do not have strong priors on
whether these limitations have a larger upstream or downstream impact and hence they are included
only as controls.

Our goal is to test the hypothesis that punitive damage caps increase the damage awards paid by
physicians only in cases involving medication errors. Defining medication error cases as type 𝑗 = 𝑑, the
most direct implication of this hypothesis is that 𝜃𝑈𝑑 < 0. We also expect that punitive damage caps
should have no effect on awards for other types of cases, or 𝜃𝑈 = 0. Finally, we expect that
noneconomic damage caps will lower physician damage awards, or 𝜃𝐷 > 0.




31
  Some of the effect of caps on damage awards could be muted if they simply supersede adjustments that would
be made anyway (e.g., reductions on appeal). Nevertheless, appeals are time consuming and costly, so even a
reduction that occurs sooner will result in lower expected costs.



                                                     18
The regression model includes fixed effects for state, error type and year, as well as a vector 𝑋 of other
characteristics of the state in which the case occurred (including the fraction male, the fraction
nonwhite, income per capita and the share of the population in 5-year age ranges).

        Results of this regression are reported in Table 5. The first two rows report the effects of
noneconomic damage caps and punitive damage caps, respectively, on the log malpractice payment per
case, where malpractice payments data are taken from the NPDB. The third row reports the interaction
term between products liability and cases involving medication errors.

          As expected, we find that noneconomic damage caps (lower malpractice liability regimes) are
associated with lower average payments across all specifications. The impacts range from a 6%
reduction when controls are included to a 12% reduction when state, year and malpractice type fixed
effects are included. Our findings also confirm that punitive damage caps (lower products liability
regimes) have no direct effect on medical malpractice liability. However, when we focus on cases
involving medication errors, punitive damage caps (lower upstream liability) increases damages paid by
physicians by 13-14%. These results are consistent with our argument that punitive damage caps shift
liability from upstream manufacturers to downstream physicians.

D.    Empirical strategy

        We test the effects of state liability rules using a difference-in-difference design that compares
drug sales in a state that changes liability rules from year t to t+1 to a state that does not change during
that span. Let 𝑌𝑔𝑖𝑐𝑡 represent the sales of drug 𝑔 in state 𝑖 in year 𝑡, where drug 𝑔 is a member of
therapeutic class 𝑐. Our regression specification is

     𝑌𝑔𝑐𝑖𝑡 = 𝛾𝑔 + 𝛾𝑖 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛽𝑈 𝐿𝑈 𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝐷 𝐿𝐷 𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑈𝐷 𝐿𝑈 × 𝐿𝐷 𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝑀 𝑀𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾𝐺 𝐺𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋 𝑋𝑔𝑐𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑔𝑐𝑡          (2)

The regression includes fixed effects for drug (𝛾𝑔 ), state (𝛾𝑖 ), and year (𝛾𝑡 ). The treatment variable is the
tort rule 𝐿𝑖𝑡 in state 𝑖 at time 𝑡. We consider separate tort rules that impact the upstream manufacturer
(𝐿𝑈 ), the downstream physician (𝐿𝐷 ) and the interaction between the two (𝐿𝑈 × 𝐿𝐷 ). These can be
interpreted as “high products liability,” “high malpractice liability” and “high products liability and high
malpractice liability,” respectively.

          The coefficients 𝛽𝑈 , 𝛽𝐷 and 𝛽𝑈𝐷 represent our test of the model of liability with vertical
production. From the theory, we expect that high malpractice liability should reduce sales, because
prescriptions subject physicians to liability risk (so 𝛽𝐷 < 0). We expect that high products liability
should increase sales because it shields physicians from liability and removes the disincentives against
prescribing (so 𝛽𝑈 > 0). Finally, we expect that this shielding effect of products liability should be
strongest when physicians are subjected to the most risk (so 𝛽𝑈𝐷 > 0). Absent the liability spillovers
from vertical production, we might still expect high malpractice liability to lower sales if drugs are
considered potentially risky products, but we would not expect to find positive effects of products
liability. If anything, absent the liability spillovers we would expect higher products liability to reduce
sales by increasing costs.




                                                      19
         It might also be true that “failure-to-warn” liability risk is mechanically higher, when
manufacturers have indeed failed to warn. As a result, it is plausible that drugs with a greater share of
disclosed safety risks will face more muted effects of liability rules on liability risk and on output. We
test this hypothesis by stratifying our estimates for drugs with and without black box warnings, which
represent officially disclosed safety risks. We then estimate 𝛽𝑈 , 𝛽𝐷 and 𝛽𝑈𝐷 separately in both samples.

        In addition to the fixed effects and liability indicators, our empirical model controls for the effect
of competition by including the number of branded competitor drugs (𝑀𝑐𝑡 ) and the number of generic
competitor drugs (𝐺𝑐𝑡 ) in the same therapeutic class 𝑐. Note that drugs are nested within classes, so we
do not include separate fixed effects for class. Finally, the regression equation includes various controls
𝑋𝑔𝑐𝑡 to address measurement issues and potential confounders.

         Our liability shocks occur at the state level, so it is important to allow for correlation in the error
terms across states (i.e., clustering). However, we also observe the same drug across states and years,
and it is unlikely that the error terms are independent across drugs. Therefore, we estimate standard
errors using the two-part clustering approach of Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2011) to allow for
clustering across states and therapeutic classes. Because drugs are nested within class, this approach
allowed for a more flexible combination of possible correlations.

         An important identifying assumption for this approach to provide valid estimates is that the
adoption of tort reform is exogenous with respect to the pharmaceutical market in a state. This concern
is mitigated by a free-rider problem across states. Since drugs are sold on a national market, any given
state has a very limited impact on the profitability of a product, so producers have less incentive to
invest lobbying efforts in that state. Moreover, since the punitive damage caps tend to affect all cases,
these are more likely to be driven by general business interests than solely pharmaceuticals.

         To strengthen our confidence that treatment variables are exogenous, we conduct two sets of
validity tests. First we conduct a quasi-balancing test that compares adoption of damages caps across
states by various outcome variables measured in the first year of the sample, 1997. The states are first
binned into quintiles based on prescriptions per outpatient visit, total number of prescriptions, mean
drug price, or outpatient visits in 1997. Then the figure plots the number of states with punitive and
non-economic damages caps in each quintile. The findings of these tests are reported in Figure 1. Each
outcome variable is reported in a separate panel. Importantly, we find no obvious monotonic pattern in
adoption of either cap by any outcome measure. Using Wilcox rank-sum tests, we fail to reject the
equality of the distribution of the number of adoptions of either punitive or noneconomic damage caps
across quintiles for any of the outcome measures.

         Our second validity check is to test for the presence of pre-existing trends in drug sales leading
up to the adoption of either punitive or noneconomic damage caps (or both together). Specifically, we
estimate Equation 3 including policy leads of 1, 2 and 3 years prior to the change in policies. If changes
in the pharmaceutical market are driving the adoption of tort reform, we would expect to see significant
effects in the pre-period of magnitudes similar to our “post-period” coefficients of interest. The results




                                                       20
of this test are discussed below in Section E, but we note here that we find no evidence of pre-existing
trends.

E.   Results

          Table 1 presented raw descriptive statistics consistent with our model. Namely, the table shows
that prescriptions rise with higher upstream liability for states in which liability is shared across
physicians and drug manufacturers. Table 6 presents the analogous regression results, which are
consistent with the raw data. As before, the top two rows in panel A report the direct effect of products
liability and malpractice liability, respectively, and the third row represents the interaction effect, which
is predicted to be positive. The direct effect of products liability is statistically insignificant, while the
direct effect of higher malpractice liability is to lower drug sales by 15-19%. This is consistent with the
prediction that global drug manufacturers will not materially respond to changes in one state’s laws,
even though physicians will.

          The interaction effects are positive and significant, as predicted. Panel B aids in the
interpretation of these by reporting the predicted change in prescribing behavior that would result from
higher products liability, stratified by states with low and high malpractice liability. When malpractice
liability is low, higher products liability has no statistically significant effect on prescriptions, consistent
with the heterogeneous legal environment model. However, higher products liability boosts drug
utilization by over 20% in states where physicians share liability.

          In Table 7A and 7B we report the findings stratified according to drugs with and without black
box warnings. Table 7A reports the coefficient estimates (analogous to the top part of Table 6), and
panels I and II report the estimates for drugs with and without a warning in place, respectively. Since
drugs with black box warnings have already disclosed more of their health harms, more of the liability
risk is already shifted downstream to doctors. Thus, increasing upstream liability should lead to more
muted effects on quantity, because there is less upstream liability to shift onto doctors. This is roughly
what we find. In Table 7A we note that the direct effect of products liability is small and insignificant
among both sets of drugs. Malpractice liability reduces sales in both cases, but the effect is only
significantly offset by increases in producer liability when there is no black box warning in place.

        Table 7B shows that in our preferred specification (with state and drug fixed effects), high
products liability is always associated with statistically insignificant effects on sales in states with low
malpractice liability, as expected. In states with high malpractice liability, higher products liability boosts
sales by 24.9% for drugs without a black box warning, but just 12.3% (which is also insignificant) for
drugs with a black box warning.

          In Table 8 we report the results of our validity check that tested for pre-existing trends in
prescriptions prior to the adoption of reforms. Reporting results only for the preferred specification
(with state and drug fixed effects), columns I, II and III report the estimated effects for high products
liability, high malpractice liability and the interaction, respectively. The top row reports the main effect
while the next rows report the 1, 2 and 3 year lags. These results confirm the basic findings and suggest
no evidence of pre-existing trends. The lead variables are generally smaller in magnitude and


                                                      21
inconsistent in sign compared to the main effects, and none of them is statistically significant. This,
combined with the findings reported in Figure 1, support the case for the exogeneity of our policy
variables.

III. Conclusion

         This paper examined the implications of different tort liability regimes on output in a market
defined by vertical production. We show that vertical production spread out across multiple
jurisdictions can lead to unintended consequences of higher products liability rules. Conventional
wisdom holds that an increase in tort liability on the upstream firm will (weakly) reduce sales of a risky
product and improve safety. The theory of vertical production across jurisdictions, however, predicts
that higher upstream liability may actually shield downstream distributors from liability and increase
their sales of a risky product.

          We test this prediction in the pharmaceutical market, where drug manufacturers face product
liability and physicians—who are essentially the downstream distributors of pharmaceutical products—
face malpractice liability. The regulation of these two forms of liability differs substantially across
jurisdiction. We find that liability on the upstream pharmaceutical company increases the quantity of
drugs sold when liability is shared with physicians, but has no effect when downstream physicians are
insulated from liability risk. In other words, higher products liability by a single jurisdiction never has its
strictly intended consequence, and can even generate perverse unintended consequences.

        From a normative perspective, we have shown that upstream firms that are national in scope
should face the same tort regime as localized downstream firms. In this way, the theory makes a case
for harmonized liability rules across jurisdictions. Indeed, it even suggests that individual states can
move towards efficiency by aligning their rules with the global average liability rule. This provides some
hope for improving the structure of the liability regime. That is, states that focus on the welfare of their
own consumers, and that understand the efficiency issues outlined in this study, may have incentives to
harmonize with the broader market.

         In practice, the political economy of state liability reform encompasses more than just consumer
welfare. There may be electoral incentives for individual states to “act tough” on large, upstream firms,
or be friendly towards large upstream firms that are housed in their own states. A full analysis of these
political economic incentives lies beyond the scope of this paper, but if significant, this would suggest
the value of national tort liability rules that naturally harmonize rules across states. Even so, there may
continue to be misalignment across countries, since many upstream firms – drug manufacturers
included – operate in multiple national jurisdictions. This issue is somewhat mitigated though by the
greater ability to price-discriminate across national borders in some cases, including that of the
pharmaceutical industry.

        Our study suggests the value of investigating how the interaction of multiple independent firms,
operating across multiple independent jurisdictions, complicates the effectiveness of tort liability rules.
Further research may investigate interactions across goods markets, where multiple risky goods are
used to produce a given output. More research is also needed on how these considerations affect the


                                                      22
political economy of tort reform at the state and national level. A competitive, complex, and
disintegrated economy appears to have important implications for how we study tort reform, and how
the economic analysis of tort reform should continue to evolve.

Notes: Table reports the results of regression of the number of prescriptions per
outpatient visit against the products liability and malpractice regime of the state.
High products liability is defined as states with no punitive damage cap in place; high
malpractice liability is defined as states without a noneconomic damage cap in place.
Each column reports the results of a different regression based on the fixed effect
structure included. Data are at the drug-state-year level. Robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses, computed to allow for two-level clustering within states and

A.   Proof of Proposition 2C

If the downstream firm makes correct inferences about safety from the upstream firm’s disclosure,
welfare in jurisdiction 𝑖 is

                                         𝑊𝑖 (𝑥𝑖 ) = 𝑉𝑖 (𝑓(𝑥𝑖 )) − [𝑐 + ℎ]𝑥𝑖

𝑉𝑖 is the value of the output to consumers in jurisdiction 𝑖. Welfare in the jurisdiction is equal to the
value of output net of the true costs associated with the use of the hazardous input. Total welfare
across all 𝑁 jurisdictions is the sum of the above expression across all jurisdictions 𝑖. An increase in the
upstream tort parameter in jurisdiction 𝑖 has the following effect on welfare in jurisdiction 𝑖:

                            𝜕𝑊𝑖 (𝑥𝑖∗∗ )        ′  ∗∗           𝜕𝑥𝑖∗∗ 𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗
                                        = [𝑉𝑖 𝑓 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑐 − ℎ]      (   +          )
                              𝜕𝑎𝑖                              𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑡𝑖    𝜕𝑟 𝜕𝑡𝑖

As explained in the text, the term in brackets is negative if 𝑎𝑖 > 𝑎̅ because that would imply 𝑎̅ℎ +
(1 − 𝑎𝑖 ) < 1 and the downstream firm does not internalize the full health costs of the upstream output.
For the same reason it is positive if 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎̅. The first term in parentheses (𝜕𝑎𝑖 /𝜕𝑡𝑖 ) is positive by
assumption that increases in the tort parameter increase the share of liability upstream. The second
term in parentheses is negative: higher upstream liability increases disclosure, which reduces upstream
liability. It follows that the effect of a local increase in upstream liability is ambiguous.

        Now consider what happens in the limit as Σ¬𝑖 𝑥𝑗 → ∞. A local increase in upstream liability has
no effect on upstream disclosure, i.e., lim 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑡𝑖 = 0, so the term in parentheses becomes positive.
Given that 𝜕𝑥 ∗∗ /𝜕𝑎𝑖 > 0, it follows that the local welfare effect of a local increase in upstream liability is
positive if 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎̅ and negative otherwise.

        The global welfare effect of a local increase in upstream liability is:

                        𝜕𝑊𝑗 (𝑥𝑗∗∗ ) 𝜕𝑊𝑖 (𝑥𝑖∗∗ )                                 𝜕𝑥𝑗∗∗ 𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑟 ∗∗
                   Σ𝑗              =            + Σ𝑗≠𝑖 [𝑉𝑗 𝑓 ′ (𝑥𝑗∗∗ ) − 𝑐 − ℎ]      (          )
                          𝜕𝑡𝑖         𝜕𝑡𝑖                                       𝜕𝑎𝑖 𝜕𝑟 𝜕𝑡𝑖

Unlike in the case of design and manufacturing defects, there is no spillover effect on safety in foreign
jurisdictions because safety is assumed exogenous. Because the global effect is the local effect (first
term) plus the non-local effect (the second term), the impact of a local increase in upstream liability is
ambiguous. However, in the limit as Σ¬𝑖 𝑥𝑗 → ∞, the non-local effect goes to zero because local liability
rules cannot affect upstream disclosure. So the global welfare effect converges to the local welfare
effect.

B.   Proofs for Model with Upstream Monopolist

In this section, we extend and generalize our main results to an environment in which the upstream firm
is a monopolist. For notational convenience, we derive our results for a homogeneous legal
environment in which 𝑡𝑖 = 𝑡. Heterogeneity produces results identical to those described in the text,
but with additional notation.

Upstream firm. In this context, the hazardous good producer solves the following:

                                      max Σ𝑗 𝑥𝑗 (𝑟, 𝑤)(w − c − 𝑎(𝑡, 𝑟)ℎ)
                                       𝑟,𝑤

                                                                     𝜕𝑥𝑖
Input demand falls in the degree of safety disclosures, so that      𝜕𝑟
                                                                           < 0, and it is downward-sloping, so
     𝜕𝑥
that 𝜕𝑤𝑖 < 0. Finally, note that the cross-partial between 𝑟 and 𝑤 is zero. All these results flow from the
                                                                 𝜕𝑎
optimal input demand of the downstream firm. (As before, 𝜕𝑡 > 0.)

This problem has the following first-order conditions:

                                           𝜕𝑥𝑗
                                      ∑        (𝑤 − 𝑐 − 𝑎ℎ) + ∑ 𝑥𝑗 = 0
                                           𝜕𝑤
                                       𝑗                         𝑗

                                      𝜕𝑥𝑗
                                  ∑       (𝑤 − 𝑐 − 𝑎ℎ) + ∑ 𝑥𝑗 (−𝑎𝑟 ℎ) = 0
                                      𝜕𝑟
                                  𝑗                          𝑗

When 𝑡 rises, the FOC for 𝑟 rises, holding 𝑤 fixed, indicating that 𝑟 must go up. The price effect is
offsetting, however, as the monopolist raises her price in response to the higher level of 𝑡. In the
heterogeneous jurisdiction case, however, this effect is negligible. Therefore, an increase in the
upstream tort parameter causes the upstream firm to disclose more risks: 𝜕𝑟/𝜕𝑡 > 0.

Downstream firm. The downstream firm in jurisdiction 𝑖 solves the following problem:

                            max 𝑝𝑖 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ) − (𝑤 + E[(1 − 𝑎(𝑡𝑖 , 𝑟 ∗∗ ))ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ ])𝑥𝑖
                             xi


where 𝑟 ∗∗ is the upstream firm’s equilibrium level of disclosure.

                                           𝑝𝑓𝑥 = 𝑤 + 𝐸[(1 − 𝑎)ℎ|𝑟 ∗∗ ℎ]

Note that the upstream firm’s prices can be expressed as:

                                                             ∑𝑗 𝑥𝑗
                                              𝑤 = 𝑐 + 𝑎ℎ −
                                                               𝜕𝑥
                                                             ∑𝑗 𝑗
                                                               𝜕𝑤

Plugging this expression into the downstream firm’s first-order condition yields:

Provided that the downstream firm makes accurate inferences about expected harm, this simplifies to:

                                                            ∑𝑗 𝑥𝑗                                               (3)

                                                            ∑𝑗 𝑗

Just as in the competitive case, a change in upstream liability due to disclosure is perfectly offset by a
reduction in downstream liability due to that disclosure. Although the downstream firm only observes
the marginal harm 𝑟ℎ that the upstream firm discloses, the upstream price passes on the costs
associated with non-disclosed harms. Disclosure drops out of the marginal condition for input choice
and the downstream firm faces the full marginal harm ℎ from use of the hazardous input. Note that we
are abstracting from the inefficiencies associated with monopoly pricing, which are unrelated to the tort
regime per se.

The following proposition summarizes these findings.

Proposition A-1. Suppose the downstream firm has chosen interior values for the hazardous and safe
inputs. In a homogenous legal environment, a change in tort parameters that increases upstream
liability share 𝑎 will have no effect on the downstream firm’s use of the hazardous input 𝑥𝑖 or its output
𝑦𝑖 .

A remarkable byproduct of this result is that, in the context of vertical production, higher or lower tort
liability and thus higher or lower disclosure has no effect on welfare.

Proposition A-2. Suppose the downstream firm has chosen interior values of the hazardous input.
Suppose further that the downstream firm makes correct inferences about the risks of the hazardous
input. In this case, the allocation of liability 𝑎 across firms and tort rules (𝑡 𝑈 , 𝑡 𝐷 ) have no effect on
welfare. The market is always at the first-best level of welfare.

This result rests critically on certain assumptions we have made. First and foremost, we examine a
homogenous legal environment. In a heterogeneous legal environment, upstream liability is not
perfectly passed on through price and thus changes in tort rules affect downstream input choice.
Second, we have chosen a parameterization of upstream and downstream liability where the consumer
is fully compensated for his or her injuries. A less demanding sufficient condition is that a dollar
decrease in one firm’s liability increases the other firm’s liability by a dollar, even if the consumer is not
fully compensated.

C.   Description of claims data

       The data include enrollment files, medical and pharmacy claims and health plan benefits, and
span 1997 to 2007. Enrollment records allow us to track who is eligible for services as well as basic
demographics (age, gender, three-digit zip code of residence, and relationship to sponsoring employee).


                                                       A3
Pharmacy claims in the data include all outpatient pharmaceutical purchases. Each claim includes the
type of drug, drug name, National Drug Code (NDC), dosage, days supplied, place of purchase (retail or
mail-order), payments by patients and health plans, type of drug dispensed (generic, multi-source
brand, single-source brand), type of pharmacy (retail, mail-order), and type (new/refill).The number of
health plans contributing data varies each year, with more than 40 plans contributing in the last two
years. Thus, there are 421 plan-years of data in the existing data set. About 44 percent of these plan-
years (n=187) cover retiree benefits, so there is substantial representation of older Americans in the
data. Plans also vary in the length of time they appear in the data. Currently, there are 28 plans with
five or more years of data.

        The data are also representative of all major plan types (health maintenance organizations,
HMOs; preferred provider organizations, PPOs; point-of-service, POS, plans; and fee-for-service, FFS,
plans) with members in all 50 states. In 2005, approximately 41 percent of the sample was enrolled in
HMOs; 25 percent, in PPOs; 24 percent, in POS plans; and the remainder in FFS plans. Geographically,
43 percent of enrollees resided in the South, 32 percent in the North Central region, 14 percent in the
West, and 11 percent in the Northeast.

         In the claims data, pharmacy claims are coded by NDC, a unique product identifier created by
the FDA. However, the same “drug” could be assigned multiple NDCs according to different strength,
dose or differences in the packaging or labeling of the product. For example, a search of the drug Lipitor
on the FDA website reveals more than 75 different NDC codes.32 We aggregate these claims to the drug
level according to the active ingredient (also referred to as the molecule name or “generic name”). We
linked the data by NDC code to the 2007 Redbook and aggregated all claims according to the active
ingredient name by the state, year gender and age-category level. Of course, even after adjusting for
the national representativeness of the sample, some of the variation in quantity across states and years
could be driven by variation in the size of the population or the utilization of medical services. Thus, we
also computed the number of outpatient visits—the encounter most likely to results in a prescription—
for each state, year gender and age category in Ingenix. Using the weights constructed by comparing
Ingenix enrollment to the CPS population, we constructed weighted averages of prescriptions per
outpatient visit at the drug, state and year level.
