The Economics of Non-Marital Childbearing and The “Marriage Premium for Children”

                                        ABSTRACT

A large literature exists on the impact of family structure on children’s outcomes, typically
focusing on average effects. We build on this with an economic framework that has
heterogeneous predictions regarding the potential benefit for children of married parents. We
propose that the gains to marriage from a child’s perspective depend on a mother’s own level of
resources, the additional net resources that her partner would bring, and the outcome-specific
returns to resources. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are consistent with the
heterogeneous predictions of this framework. In terms of high school completion or avoiding
poverty at age 25, the “marriage premium for children” is highest for children of mothers with
high school degrees and mothers in their early/mid-20s. For the more advanced outcomes of
college completion or high income at age 25, the marriage premium is monotonically increasing
with observed maternal age and education.

I. Introduction

        For much of U.S. history, a married-couple family constituted the primary unit of social

and economic life for individuals. Married couples birthed and raised children, pooled resources

of time and money, and provided for each other into old age. But, this relationship has been

breaking down for decades, particularly in the context of childrearing.1 By 2014, over 40 percent

of births in the U.S. took place outside marriage. The rate is particularly high among certain

population subgroups: 71 percent among African-Americans, 71 percent among women under age

25, and 62 percent among women with a high school degree or less education.2 This reflects a

dramatic shift over the past 50 years. In 1960, only five percent of children were born to

unmarried mothers.

        One reason the high-level of non-marital childbearing is an economic issue is because

numerous studies show that children raised in single-parent homes fare worse on a number of

educational and economic dimensions as compared to children raised in homes with two married

biological parents. Conditional on other family and parental characteristics, children who grow up

with an unmarried mother have lower levels of educational attainment and higher levels of teen

childbearing, among other outcome differences (e.g., McLanahan and Sandefur; 1994;

McLanahan 1997; Hoffman, Foster, and Furstenberg, 1993; Amato 2005). As adults, they have

   In this paper, we do not explicitly consider the question of what is responsible for driving the rise in non-
marital childbearing. Ellwood and Jencks (2004) provide an overview of the theoretical and empirical
literature on the rise in non-marital childbearing. They note that traditional economic models have
highlighted four potential factors: (i) male earnings (e.g., Wilson and Neckerman, 1986), (ii) female
earnings, (iii) the sex ratio, and (iv) public assistance (e.g., Moffitt, 2001). Recent work by Shenov (2015)
explores the rise of female relative wages as an explanation for the decline in marriage rates. Ellwood and
Jencks (2004) summarize the main noneconomic explanations that have been advanced as including (i)
gender role conflict; (ii) limited confidence and personal efficacy; (iii) altered attitudes and social norms;
and (iv) technological and legal change (e.g., Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz, 1996). Lundberg and Pollak
(2007) provide a thorough review of how the American family has changed between 1960 and 2006.

lower levels of employment, lower levels of income, higher rates of non-marital parenting, and

higher rates of incarceration (e.g., Hill, Holzer, and Chen, 2009; DeLeire and Lopoo, 2014;

Lehrman, Price, and Wilcox, 2016).3 Though none of these studies completely surmounts the

identification challenge inherent in identifying whether the differences are due to marriage, per se,

rather than associated unobservable resources or parental characteristics, the strength of the

association and its robustness to a myriad of controls for observable factors is at least strongly

suggestive of a causal relationship.4

        The academic literature and policy conversation about non-marital childbearing, however,

generally does not distinguish across different instances of non-marital childbearing. Having a

child outside of marriage for a 19-year old woman without a high school degree presumably has

different implications than it does for a 25-year old with some college, or a 35-year old college

graduate. To put it differently, the advantage that marriage would bring to these children is likely

to be different across circumstances. Perhaps older and more educated unmarried mothers are able

to provide sufficiently for their children alone, such that their children do not suffer any sort of

disadvantage in terms of long-term economic outcomes. Perhaps the men who father children

with younger, less-educated women are of sufficiently low income and parenting “quality” that

such a marriage would not appreciably improve a child’s long-term economic prospects.5

  Recent work in economics has considered whether the incidence of single-mother households is related to
racial and gender gaps in behavioral and educational outcomes. Hill, Holzer, and Chen (2009) explore the
extent to which racial differences in family structure might explain racial gaps in education, employment,
and incarceration outcomes. Autor et al. (2015) and Bertrand and Pan (2013) suggest that the growing
gender gap in behavioral and educational outcomes for children is at least partially explained by the
relative disadvantage of boys who grow up in single-mother homes.

  Hill, Holzer, and Chen (2009) and Lopoo and DeLeire (2014) provide excellent reviews of the literature
on family structure and children’s outcomes.

  Sawhill and Thomas (2002) offer evidence to the contrary; they find that simulated marriages between
single-mothers and men with similar characteristics would appreciably reduce child poverty rates.

                                                                 Marriage Premium for Children, p. 3

        In this paper, we consider the notion of a “marriage premium for children” through the

lens of economics, focusing on potential resources and returns. We introduce this term as a

shorthand label for the difference in outcomes between children who are born to married parents

as compared to a single-mother. We maintain an empirical focus on mother’s marital status at

birth mainly for analytical convenience, although a mother’s marital status at birth is highly

predictive of the family structure a child will experience during his/her childhood in the U.S. We

define resources to be those relevant to child development, including parental income, wealth, and

time, among other things.6

        The documented advantage for children, on average, from two-parent homes is consistent

with a model where resources are higher, on average, in married, two-parent households. Not only

does having two married parents in the household increase the total level of resources by virtue of

having two resident parents present, this family structure capitalizes on economies of scale in a

household and enables spouses to specialize across market work, home production, and child

rearing, as in Becker’s seminal model (1981). A straightforward extension of this reasoning

indicates that the relative advantage to a child coming from having married parents will vary with

maternal circumstances in systematic ways. To be sure, the observed advantage for children is

also consistent with a positive selection story: conditional on observables, individuals who have

children within marriage might possess inherent, unobservable qualities that benefit child


6 There are a variety of mechanisms beyond income through which children might benefit from living in a
married-parent home. Many academic articles have reviewed potential mechanisms, including in an
overview piece by Ribar (2015). Studies that have attempted to investigate how much of the disadvantage
observed for children from single-parent homes is due specifically to lower household income generally
find that the direct effect of income is an important part of the story, but not the full explanation, though
this remains an open question. See, for example, McLanahan and Sandefur, 2004; Hill, Holzer, and Chen,
2009; DeLeire and Lopoo, 2014; Lehrman, Price, and Wilcox, 2016. Low levels of income and single-
parenthood are often associated with other stress factors that are directly harmful to children’s
development, such as residential instability, maternal stress, and less positive parenting practices (cf.,
Mayer, 1997; Kalil et al, 1998; Furstenberg et al, 1999).

development. While we do not discount the role of selection, we are interested in developing a

resource-based model that has predictions about when the benefits of a married household may be

particularly large from the perspective of the child.

       We propose that the gains to marriage from the perspective of a child will depend on (a)

the mother’s own level of resources, (b) the additional resources that her marriage would bring to

the household, and (c) the returns to those additional resources. The resource gain will depend on

the nature of marriage markets and the resources of the mother’s partner. The return to resources

will depend on the nature of the particular production function for outcomes, which will vary

across outcome type. This set of factors and interactions among them will generate heterogeneous

marriage premiums for children born to mothers with different characteristics and for different

types of outcomes. For example, for some women, a partner’s additional contributions are not

sufficient to alter children’s outcomes. While for other women, a partner’s contributions are not

necessary. For instance, even if a teen mother married the father of her child, their combined

resources might not be sufficient to equip their child to attain higher levels of education. In

contrast, a highly educated older mother might have sufficient resources as a single mother such

that her child suffers no relative disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment.

       We explore these relationships empirically, motivated by our proposed marriage premium

framework. We rely mainly on data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics. This data source

allows us to observe adult outcomes for children born in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. We

consider two types of long-term outcomes for children. First, we consider “primary” outcomes,

which are those that are commonly achieved, such as graduating from high school and having

income above the federal poverty threshold at age 25. Second, we consider “advanced” outcomes,

which are achieved by fewer people, such as graduating from college and having “high” income

(above 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold at age 25). We use these data to estimate
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                            Marriage Premium for Children, p. 5

descriptive relationships between these outcomes and mother’s age at time of child’s birth and

level of education, with the goal of documenting patterns of the marriage premium for children

across mother’s characteristics and outcomes. We do not attempt to identify empirically a causal

relationship between marriage as a family structure and children’s outcomes; rather, we explore

systematic patterns of marital gaps in children’s outcomes by baseline maternal characteristics.

       The patterns we observe for being out of poverty by age 25 and graduating from high

school suggest that the marriage premium takes an inverted U-shaped pattern along the

dimensions of maternal age and education. For the youngest and least educated mothers, as well

as for the oldest and most educated mothers, there does not appear to be a large marriage premium

for children. The greatest marriage premium occurs in the middle of the maternal age and

education distribution. This is consistent with the predictions of our model given assortative

mating and reasonable expectations about the return to resources for these primary outcomes. The

potential resource gain from marriage is not sufficient at the low end, and is unnecessary at the

high end, to increase substantially a child’s probability of avoiding poverty or completing high

school. For mothers in their early to mid-20s and those with a high school degree, marriage is

associated with the largest differences in these two outcomes.

       For the advanced outcomes of graduating from college and having a high level of income

at age 25, the observed marriage premium increases monotonically with maternal age and

education. This is also consistent with the predictions of our model given assortative mating and

reasonable expectations about the return to resources for an advanced outcome. In the case of

these harder-to-obtain outcomes, it appears that marriage is associated with an increasingly higher

likelihood for children up to the highest levels of observed maternal age and education. In a final

empirical consideration, we consider the extent to which differences in household income explain
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                            Marriage Premium for Children, p. 6

the observed premium for both types of outcomes. The data suggest that household income at

birth is only partially responsible for these gaps.

II. The “Marriage Premium for Children”: A Conceptual Framework

       In this section, we present a conceptual framework for thinking about a marriage premium

for children as a function of underlying resources and returns to resources. To define terms and

notation, let us denote α to be the difference in outcomes between children raised in a household

headed by married parents as compared to a single mother. Specifically, we propose that the

marriage premium for children (will depend crucially on three elements: (a) the mother’s own

level of resources, (b) the additional resources that marriage would bring to the household, and (c)

the returns to those additional resources.

       We denote a mother’s and father’s own level of resources as Rm and Rf and total household

resources as Rt: Rt = Rm + Rf. We use the term “resources” broadly to signify the range of positive

inputs that parents bring to a child’s experience. This includes financial resources and parental

time, but also includes additional elements such as social and professional networks, positive

parenting practices, physical and mental well-being, and home life stability, among others. For

unmarried mothers, we impose an expositional simplification such that total household resources

are fully captured by mother’s own resources (Rt = Rm), which is inclusive of any resources she

obtains on behalf of her child, whether through her own earnings or time, through government

support, through her network of family and friends, etc. If the mother were to marry the father of

the child and co-reside, household resources would increase by the net level of resources the
                                                                                 Kearney and Levine
                                                                  Marriage Premium for Children, p. 7

father brings to the household (beyond what he would contribute as a non-resident, unmarried

father), Rf.7

A. Assortative Mating

        The potential resource gain that marrying the father of a child would bring to the

household depends on the father’s level of resources. That gain will depend on the nature of the

market for sexual partners and marriage (which we take to be the same). In the United States,

there is a high degree of assortative mating, such that individuals tend to partner with and marry

individuals of a similar socioeconomic status (SES) (cf. Schwartz, 2010). We incorporate this into

our model by treating resource level as isomorphic to SES and assuming assortative mating based

on relative resource position.

        In a highly stylized version of assortative mating, women and men match based on their

percentile in some underlying resource distribution. If the underlying male and female resource

distributions were equal, then assortative mating of the type we have described would result in a

doubling of potential household resources if the parents were to marry. That is, Rm at the 25th

percentile of the distribution among mothers plus Rf at the 25th percentile of the distribution

among fathers would double Rt. These observations lead to the following proposition relevant for

thinking about how marriage would heterogeneously increase resources available to a child:




7
  We abstract from the situation of cohabitation among unmarried parents in the model. As a practical
matter, in the United States, the situation for children of cohabiting parents tends to fall somewhere in
between the more common situations of unmarried/non-cohabiting parents and married parents, but it is
generally understood to involve much higher rates of family instability as compared to married families.
Manning (2015) reviews the issue of cohabitation and child well-being. She notes that more children born
to cohabiting parents see their parents break up by age five, as compared to children born to married
parents. Only one out of three children born to cohabiting parents remains in a stable family through age
12, in contrast to nearly three out of four children born to married parents. She further reports that children
born to cohabiting parents experience nearly three times as many family transitions as those born to
married parents (1.4 versus 0.5).

                                                                 Marriage Premium for Children, p. 8

Proposition 1: Given assortative mating, the absolute resource gain from marriage (Rt - Rm = Rf)

is increasing in mother’s own resources (Rm): d(Rt-Rm)/dRm >0.



B. Production Functions for Children’s Outcomes

        The production function for child outcomes dictates how beneficial the additional

resources that a married father brings to the household are for a child’s development and

ultimately adult outcomes. Let us assume that the production of positive child outcomes (e.g.,

educational attainment) responds positively to parental resources such that higher levels of Rt (as

inputs) produce increased levels of child educational and socioeconomic achievement (as

outcomes, or output.)8 For simplicity, we introduce the notion of two types of outcomes: primary

and advanced outcomes. Primary outcomes consist of those that one might reasonably consider

first order markers of economic success. The majority of individuals would achieve these:

progressing at grade for age through school, avoiding a teen birth, completing high school, and

living above the poverty line as an adult. Advanced outcomes consist of outcomes achieved by a

smaller minority of individuals. Such outcomes would include gaining admittance to a selective

college, completing a college degree, and obtaining a high paying job.




8
  A number of authors have attempted to produce credible estimates of the causal relationship between
family income and child outcomes using exogenous variation in family income. See, for example,
Oreopoulos et al (2008); Dahl and Lochner (2011); Milligan and Stabile (2007), and Loken (2010). Loken,
Mogstad, and Wiswall (2012) estimate nonlinear IV and FE models relating family income to child
outcomes. Their analysis uses administrative registry data for the entire population of Norway, with
information on children’s educational attainment and IQ as adults as well as their family income during
childhood. They instrument for family income with regional and time variation in the initial discovery of
oil in Norway. They find an increasing, concave relationship between family income and children’s
outcomes. They observe that previous studies based on linear estimators understate the beneficial effect of
family income for children because they assign little weight to the large marginal effects at lower levels of
income. This econometric point is related to, albeit distinct from, the conceptual point we make below
about heterogeneity in the returns to additional parental resources.
                                                                            Kearney and Levine
                                                             Marriage Premium for Children, p. 9

       The return r to the resource gain that comes from marriage (through the addition of Rf to

the household) will lead to an improvement in child outcomes y as determined by the relationship

between the outcome and overall resource level. Let us call this production function q. Figure 1A

plots the relationship between total household resources Rt and a primary (p) and advanced (a)

outcome. Though we assume simple functional forms qp and qa for illustrative purposes, the main

feature of the figure is that the production function (expressed as a probability function) for the

advanced outcome falls to the right of the probability function for the primary outcome. As a

father’s additional resources are brought into a household headed by a mother with fewer

resources (a younger or less educated mother), the probability that the child achieves a primary

outcome is increased. The total resource level, however, is still too low for an appreciable change

in the likelihood of achieving the advanced outcome. The additional resources from that marriage

would have to be extensive to have an impact on an advanced outcome.

       In contrast, when a father’s additional resources are brought into a household headed by a

mother with more resources (for instance, an older or more educated mother), primary outcomes

are unlikely to be affected. The mother herself is likely to have sufficient resources to enable her

children to achieve that outcome. Her children would benefit by becoming more likely to achieve

an advanced outcome if marriage occurs. These observations lead to the following propositions:



Proposition 2: For primary outcomes, the children of lower resourced mothers will experience

the largest relative benefit from marriage, as long as fathers have non-negligible resources to

contribute to the household.

Proposition 3: For advanced outcomes, the children of higher resourced mothers will experience

the largest relative benefit from marriage.

                                                             Marriage Premium for Children, p. 10

C. Marriage Premium for Children

       Building on the notation introduced so far, and combining the insights from Propositions

1, 2, and 3, we can write an expression for the marriage premium to children as follows:

                                                                     .

This expression indicates that the marriage premium  is a function of the return to resources for

a given outcome (ry) interacted with the difference in total household resources that would result

from marriage (Rt-Rm), conditional on the baseline level of resources a mother brings to the

household in the non-marital situation.

       We have presented this model in terms of a generic “resource” that is essentially

isomorphic to income and increases in maternal age and education. An obvious extension of the

model would be to consider different types of resources. For example, one could model the

marriage premium as a function of separate resources such as income, parental time, and family

stability, and make assumptions about whether these resources operate as complements or

substitutes. Another straightforward adaptation would be to specify the marriage premium as

being net of certain resources, for example, a marriage premium net of income effects. We offer

this framework as a basic model that can be readily extended and adapted for more nuanced

considerations of the relationship between parents’ marital status and children’s outcomes.

III. Marriage Gaps in Maternal Characteristics and Baseline Resource Levels

       The above discussion emphasized the systematic ways we would expect the marriage

premium for children to vary with maternal characteristics and outcome type. Before exploring

the heterogeneity in outcomes directly, we provide a preliminary, descriptive look at the data. We

first confirm that maternal marital status at the time of a child’s birth is highly predictive of a

child’s family structure at age 14. We then document average marriage gaps in maternal
                                                                                    Kearney and Levine
                                                                    Marriage Premium for Children, p. 11

characteristics, household resources, and children’s outcomes and how they have changed over

time.

           In terms of maternal characteristics, we focus on mother’s age and education, with the

presumption that older, more-educated mothers offer higher levels of parental resources.9 As

supporting evidence, we calculate from the 2014 American Community Survey that among

women with children age 5 or under who work more than 1500 hours per year, those age 35 and

over have median annual earnings of $50,000 in 2013 compared to $18,000 for those under age

25. Similarly, college educated mothers in this group earn 2.4 times as much as those with a high

school degree, $55,000 relative to $23,000. In addition, research has documented that more

educated mothers spend more time with their children (Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney, 2008) and

are more likely to alter the composition of that time to suit children's developmental needs (Kalil,

Ryan, and Corey, 2012).

           We rely primarily on data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for this and

subsequent analyses. The PSID is a nationally representative, family-based dataset that first

sampled over 18,000 respondents in 1968. Since then, the survey has followed all of the original

participants and all of those who joined their families, including children. The most recent data

available at the time of this analysis is from 2013. In these data, we observe maternal

characteristics at the time of birth (marital status, age, education, and income) and subsequent

outcomes for the children (poverty status, high school completion, and college completion).

Because we are interested in observing children’s long-term outcomes, we examine the

experiences of children born during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. An on-line data appendix details

how we construct our analysis sample and variables from the PSID. We augment our PSID

analysis with additional data on births from the 1980 and 2014 Vital Statistics Natality files to

document characteristics of mothers for two cohorts, and observe how maternal characteristics

have changed over time. The issue of drawing lessons from earlier cohorts to the experience of

today’s children is something we return to in our final discussion section.

A. Transitions in Family Structure

           In our analysis, we focus on mother’s marital status at birth. This coincides with our

emphasis on the impact of non-marital childbearing, but it also is a strong predictor of subsequent

living arrangements for children. This can be seen in Table 1, where we examine children’s living

circumstances at age 14 with their mother’s marital status at birth. We separately examine

children born between 1960 and 1979 from those born between 1980 and 1999 (14 years old in

2013, the last year data availability) to gauge the extent of changes over time. Consistent with

trends documented elsewhere, the bottom row indicates that fewer children were born to married

mothers in the more recent period: 76 percent, down from 83 percent. It also shows that births to

cohabiting parents rose over that interval, from 2 percent in the earlier period to 7.7 percent of

births in the more recent cohort.10

           These data indicate that initial family structure at birth is strongly persistent to age 14.

Among children born between 1980 to 1999, 75 percent of those born to married mothers are still

living in a household comprised of married parents and 65 percent of those born to a single

mother are living in a mother only household at age 14. Only 12 percent of children born to

single mothers see their parents married at age 14. Being born to cohabiting parents is a less

persistent family structure, as has been well-documented elsewhere (see, for example, the review

by Manning, 2015). Among children born to cohabiting parents (7.7 percent of children in the


10
     Manning (2015) reports that nearly one-quarter of children born today are to cohabiting parents.

                                                           Marriage Premium for Children, p. 13

more recent cohort), 28 percent are living with married parents, 33 percent are living with mother

only, and 9 percent are living with mother and stepfather at age 14.

B. Mother’s Characteristics at the Time of Birth

       Our next set of analyses use Vital Statistics natality data to document age and education

distributions of marital and non-marital births. These analyses are motivated by the notion that

older, more educated mothers are likely to have higher level of resources as compared to younger,

less-educated mothers. We look separately at births occurring in 1980 and 2014. The Vital

Statistics data include virtually the universe of births in the United States. Figures 2A (1980) and

2B (2014) reveal clearly that the age distribution of married mothers skews to the right as

compared to the age distribution of unmarried mothers. In 2014, the modal age of a married

mother is 31, as compared to 22 for unmarried births. Mothers were younger in 1980, with the

modal age being 25 among married mothers and 19 among unmarried mothers. Looking over

time, the data also reveal a reduction in teen childbearing and an increase in childbearing during

ages 30 to 44 among all mothers.

       To the extent that older and more educated parents bring greater resources to a household,

the older ages of mothers in more recent years would imply improved outcomes for all children.

But, the gap in mother’s modal age between marital and non-marital births has actually jumped

from 6 years to 9 years. As much as the universal increase in mother’s age could improve

outcomes for all, it could also increase the marriage premium for children (if greater maternal age

implies higher levels of parenting resources).

       We observe a similar pattern in Figures 3A and 3B, which plot the education distribution

of mothers by marital status. Married mothers tend to be more highly educated than mothers who

give birth outside of marriage. In 2014, the modal married mother was a college graduate: 45.8

percent of married mothers have a college degree or higher. Only 7.2 percent of mothers who are
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                           Marriage Premium for Children, p. 14

unmarried at the time of birth have a college degree or higher. The modal unmarried mother at the

time of birth is a high school graduate (36 percent). Only 8.5 percent of married mothers have less

than a high school degree, as compared to 25 percent of unmarried mothers. As shown in Figure

3A, the 1980 education distributions of both sets of mothers are shifted to the left, with many

fewer mothers having a college degree at the time of giving birth and many more having less than

a high school degree. Interestingly, the gains in education have been greater among married

mothers than among unmarried mothers, so that even though all mothers are more educated now,

married mothers are relatively more educated in 2014 than in 1980.

       Table 2 reports similar statistics using PSID data, breaking up children into those born to

married and unmarried mothers in the 1968-1989 and 1990-2013 windows. Again, education and

maternal age are greater for married mothers, rising over time for both married and unmarried

mothers, but rising more for married mothers. The data also reveal that a married mother is

extremely unlikely to live with her own mother, but it is reasonably common for an unmarried

mother. This could reflect her greater need for support, but also greater resources available for her

children than if she lived alone.

C. The Resource Gap at the Time of Birth

       The remainder of Table 2 provides summary statistics of family income as a direct

measure of the resource gap at the time of birth. Here we see that household income at birth is

greater for children born to married mothers and the gap in absolute terms is growing over time.

For the cohort born between 1990 and 2013, median household income (in year 2013 dollars) is

$74,497 for married mothers and $36,575 for unmarried mothers, which is a difference of

$37,922. For the earlier cohort, the income advantage of married households was $23,973. The

data also show that many more children born to unmarried mothers lived in poverty at the time of

birth in both periods; roughly 30 percent of the later cohort and more than 40 percent of the
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine
                                                                     Marriage Premium for Children, p. 15

earlier cohort. In both periods, less than 10 percent of children born to married parents lived in

poverty at the time of birth.

         We also examine differences in the percentage of childhood (through age 16) spent in

poverty. We distinguish children by birth cohorts 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1997 and restrict the

sample to those births who have reached age 16 by the 2013 date of the last available survey.

Children born to married parents, on average, spend just over 90 percent of their childhood years

out of poverty, for both cohorts. Children born to an unmarried mother, on the other hand, spend

around 60 percent of their child above the poverty line, for both cohorts.

         Data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 through 2014 indicate a

resource gap between children born to married and unmarried parents in terms of parental hours

spent per week on childcare (not reported in a table).11 We look at parents’ reported time with

children and focus on children under age 5. Married mothers spend 18 hours per week caring for

their young children compared to 14.9 hours per week for unmarried mothers. Married fathers

also spend an additional 1.4 hours per week, on average, caring for their children (9.8 hours per

week compared to 8.4 hours per week). These gaps are not measured at the time of birth, as our

preceding measures of resources have been, but the correlations over time for pre-school age

children are likely to be very high. These average differences reveal that young children of

married parents generally spend more time with their parents as compared to children of

unmarried parents.12



11
  Time spent caring for children is defined as the sum of time spent by parents on basic, educational and
recreational childcare. The full sample includes all individuals between the ages of 18 and 55 who report at
least one child under the age of 5. The resulting sample includes 8,615 mothers and 6,093 fathers. Means
are calculated using fixed demographic weights adjusted to equally represent each day of the week within
subgroups.
12 This finding is consistent with the results of a study by Kalil, Ryan, and Shor (2014) that uses the 1997 PSID
Child Development Supplement to examine time investment in children across six family structures. The authors

                                                                    Marriage Premium for Children, p. 16

D. Outcome Gaps Associated with Maternal Marital Status

         Consistent with the documented fact of children being born to unmarried mothers having

fewer resources in their households, the data also indicate that they experience inferior

educational and labor market outcomes relative to those children born to married mothers. Table 3

displays these patterns, which relies on data from the PSID, and confirm those reported in

previous studies (as cited above). In our analysis, we examine four specific outcomes: being out

of poverty at age 25, completing high school by age 2013, having household income over 400

percent of the poverty level at age 25 (to indicate high income), and completing college by age

25. We separate children into cohorts by birth decade to examine trends over time. In all cases,

outcomes for children with parents who were married at birth are better in these dimensions than

children with unmarried parents at birth.

         One notable pattern in these data is that recent birth cohorts show a larger marriage

premium in the likelihood of college completion as compared to earlier cohorts. Children born to

unmarried mothers increased their likelihood of completing college from 5.9 to 11.3 percent

between the 1960s and 1980s birth cohorts. Children born to married mothers, however, increased

their likelihood from 21.8 to 40.7 percent, resulting in about a doubling of the gap between the

two groups (from 15.9 to percentage points 29.4). On the other hand, the marriage premium in

rates of high school graduation fell slightly. The gap likelihood of being above the poverty

threshold rose and then fell, ending up back at its original level.

         These patterns are consistent with the predictions of our conceptual model of a

heterogeneous marriage premium. Rising out of poverty and graduating from high school are


document that children receive more total care-giving time in married biological parent families than in single mother
homes, because households receive little time investment from their nonresident biological fathers.
13
   The PSID data does not allow us to consistently separate GED recipients from traditional high school graduates. As
such, this measure captures high school graduation or its equivalent.
                                                                                  Kearney and Levine
                                                                  Marriage Premium for Children, p. 17

primary outcomes within that framework while having a high income and graduating college are

advanced outcomes. Increases in parental resources over time are only going to have an impact if

a substantial share of some group is below that threshold and is lifted over the bar because of the

additional resources brought to the household through marriage. For a primary outcome, a young

single-mother might not have sufficient resources to clear that bar on her own, but marriage has

the potential to bring additional resources that would raise children over the poverty threshold (as

in Thomas and Sawhill, 2002). Older, more educated mothers are likely to have enough resources

to avoid poverty even without the additional resources of a spouse.

        For an advanced outcome, however, combined resources from marriage potentially

increase total household resources by a large amount for a highly educated mother, given she is

likely to have fathered a child with a high-resource man (through assortative mating). College

completion rates increase with family income.14 It therefore makes sense that marriages

associated with a greater base level of resources from the mother and relatively large resource

gains from the father will be associated with increasingly high rates of college attendance, and

children from lower-resourced households will fall further behind.

IV. EXPLORING HETEROGENEITY

        Our model also has predictions regarding the impact of marriage on mothers with different

levels of resources. For primary outcomes, we hypothesize that the marriage premium for children

has the shape of an inverted U, at first increasing and then decreasing, as mother’s resources

increase. For advanced outcomes, we anticipate that a marriage premium for children will exist at

higher maternal resource levels. In this section, we report the results of an analysis designed to


14
  Bjorklund-Young (2016) reports that data from the Education Longitudinal Survey – a nationally representative
sample of students who were high school sophomores in 2002 – indicate that among students from the lowest quartile
of family income, college completion rates are 14 percent, as compared to 60 percent among students from the top
quartile of family income.
                                                                             Kearney and Levine
                                                             Marriage Premium for Children, p. 18

explore whether descriptive data are consistent with those hypotheses. As we have done

throughout the paper, we focus on maternal age and education as indicative of maternal resource

level.

A. Descriptive Relationship between Maternal Marital Status and Children’s Outcomes

         In Tables 4 and 5, we report results of an analysis focusing on the same children’s

outcomes as reported in Table 3, except here we distinguish mothers by their age and educational

attainment at the time of childbearing. All statistics reported are relevant sample means computed

from the PSID; we are not attempting to isolate causal findings; rather we explore heterogeneity

in raw marriage premiums.

         The first thing to notice in Tables 4 and 5 is that for all four outcomes, there is a marriage

premium observed for all maternal age and education categories. This is noteworthy, given that

one might have suspected older and more educated mothers would have sufficient own resources

such that the children of married mothers would not experience an advantage in outcomes relative

to the children of unmarried women. The data indicate that is not the case. This result is consistent

with previous studies that report the results of regression analyses that control for maternal age

and education and still find disadvantages associated with single-motherhood.

         The patterns in the data are also consistent with the predictions of the model. For the

primary outcomes of being out of poverty and graduating from high school, we see the inverted

U-shaped pattern of the marriage premium for children. Table 4 shows that women between the

ages of 20 and 24 have children who receive the greatest observed marriage premium for these

outcomes. That premium is lower for children of younger and older mothers. Table 5 shows that

women with a high school degree or some college have the greatest observed marriage premium

in terms of avoiding adult poverty and graduating from high school. Children of high school

dropouts and college graduates have lower premiums, albeit still positive.
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                           Marriage Premium for Children, p. 19

       We see a different pattern when it comes to the advanced outcomes of college completion

and having income above 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold (our measure of high

income). In Table 4 we see that the marriage premium for advanced outcomes is increasing with

maternal age. The children of married mothers age 30 and over are 20.7 percentage points more

likely to graduate from college as compared to the children of unmarried mothers in that age

group (37.2 percent compared to 16.5 percent). There is a positive age gradient in children’s rates

of college graduation for married and unmarried mothers, but the gradient is steeper for the

children of married mothers. Among the children of unmarried mothers, the percent who

complete college by age 25 increases from 6.6 percent to 16.5 percent, moving from teen mothers

to mothers age 30 and over. Among the children of married mothers, the percent who complete

college by age 25 increases from 13.1 percent to 37.2 percent. A similar pattern holds for the

advanced outcome.

       Table 5 reveals a similar story: the marriage premium is also increasing with maternal

education. The children of married mothers with a college degree are 28.4 percentage points more

likely to graduate from college as compared to the children of unmarried mothers with a college

degree (57 percent versus 28.6 percent). This gap is consistent with the predictions of our model,

though we readily acknowledge the possibility that some of this might reflect unobserved

selection, meaning that unmarried, college-educated mothers might be more negatively selected

than less-educated unmarried mothers on other resource dimensions. As with maternal age, there

is a positive education gradient for both sets of mothers, such that higher levels of maternal

education are associated with higher rates of college graduation among children, but the gradient

is steeper for the children of married mothers. Among the children of unmarried mothers, the

percent who complete college by age 25 increases from 4.9 percent to 28.6 percent, a nearly six-

fold increase from the least to most educated mothers. Among the children of married mothers,
                                                                              Kearney and Levine
                                                              Marriage Premium for Children, p. 20

the percent who complete college by age 25 increases from 7.4 percent to 57 percent, a nearly

eight-fold increase.

B. Multivariate Relationship between Maternal Marital Status and Children’s Outcomes

         We extend this analysis by estimating regression models that parameterize these statistics

and control for the impact that other demographic factors might play in the relationship between

mother’s marital status and children’s outcomes. Specifically, we estimate models where the

dependent variables are the same poverty and educational outcomes we have been using

throughout this analysis. The key explanatory variables are interaction terms between maternal

marital status at birth of child and cubic indicators of either mother’s age or years of education at

birth. The demographic variables we control for include child’s gender, race, ethnicity, and year

of birth. We also estimate a separate set of models including average family income in early

childhood (through age five).15 Including this variable can provide an indication of the extent to

which this one measure of resources can “explain” any marriage premium for children that we

observe in the data.16 Another important reason to determine the role played by income is to

understand the extent to which government transfers could potentially play a role in alleviating

the outcome deficits faced by children in single-parent households (cf. Lerman, Price, Wilcox,

2016).

         We summarize the results of this analysis, focusing specifically on maternal age at birth of

child, in Figures 4A-4D and Figures 5A-5D. Both sets of figures consider each of our four

outcomes (poverty status, high school completion, high income status, and college completion;

the only difference is that the second set of figures adjust for average family income in early


15
  Appendix Tables 1A and 1B report the full set of regression results.
16
  We note that adding these variables does not satisfy any reasonable standard of identifying a causal
impact. We interpret the results from these analyses as regression-adjusted descriptive statistics.

                                                               Marriage Premium for Children, p. 21

childhood (ages 0-5). In these figures, we plot the simulated marriage premium for children (the

predicted difference in children’s outcomes between those born to married and unmarried parents)

as a function of their mother’s age when they were born. The patterns are non-linear because our

regression model includes cubic age interactions with maternal marital status.17 The dotted lines

represent 95 percent confidence intervals, constructed using the delta method. We repeat this

analysis for mother’s educational attainment; due to space constraints, those results are reported

in Appendix Figures 1A-1D and 2A-2D.18

        Figure 4A examines the marriage premium for children when the specific child outcome is

having family income above the poverty threshold at age 25. It is consistent with the inverted-U

shaped pattern that we hypothesized earlier for a primary outcome and that our earlier descriptive

analysis foreshadowed. In fact, for the very youngest mothers and the oldest mothers in this

sample, the confidence interval for the marriage premium for children extends to near zero in

terms of poverty status. The marriage premium is highest at age 24; children born to married

mothers at that age are 15 percentage points more likely to be above the poverty threshold at age

25 compared to children of unmarried mothers.

        Note that controlling for demographics has a large impact on the estimated marriage

premium for children. In Table 4, those children born to married mothers between the ages of 20

and 24 were 22.6 percentage points more likely to have incomes above the poverty line at age 25.

Controlling for demographics as in Figure 4A substantially reduces that gap. Doing so, though,

has little impact on the inverted U-shaped pattern of the marriage premium for children. In fact,

17
   We estimate these models using all available data for mothers between the ages of 14 and 45. In the
figures, though, we only report simulation results of the marriage premium for children for mothers
between the ages of 17 and 35. The reason for this is that there are very few marital births younger than
age 17 or non-marital births over age 35. This leads to very imprecise estimates at these ages with standard
error bands that are much wider than those between ages 17 and 35 and that always include zero.
18
   Appendix tables A1 and A2 present the regression results themselves that were used to generate these
figures.
                                                                                    Kearney and Levine
                                                                    Marriage Premium for Children, p. 22

for children born to mothers under age 18 or over age 32, the estimated marriage premium in

terms of children’s subsequent poverty outcomes are small and not statistically significant once

we control for demographics. These controls introduce something like a level shift down in the

profile without altering the general shape of the profile itself.

        Figure 4B displays similar patterns for high school completion. The peak age is 22 for the

marriage premium for children measured in this way. No statistically significant impact is

estimated for those under age 18 or over age 28. The similarity in patterns between Figures 4A

and 4B are what we would expect from our model since both represent primary outcomes.

        Figures 4C and 4D plot the marriage premium for the advanced outcomes of graduating

from college by age 25 or having income greater than 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold

at age 25. Consistent with the pattern reported in Table 4, we see that this manifestation of the

marriage premium is monotonically increasing in mother’s age until the late 20s and then

asymptotes to around a 15 to 20 percentage point differential. The magnitude of these estimates

varies little after including demographic controls. Children born to older women (presumably

with greater resources) continue to benefit in the form of this advanced outcome when their

mothers are married.19 We also explore heterogeneity in the marriage premium for boys and girls,

and find the estimates are slightly larger for boys, but we cannot statistically distinguish between

the two. For this reason we only examine the pooled impact in the remaining analysis.

        Figures 5A through 5D repeat this analysis, but control for family income at birth as well

as demographic characteristics.20 Interestingly, for the two primary outcomes (poverty status and

high school completion), the premium to children associated with marriage does not appear to be


19
   If we instead use a continuous measure of log income at age 25 as the outcome of interest, we also see a monotonic
increase in the observed marriage premium along the dimensions of maternal age and education.
20
   Following Lopoo and Deleire (2014) and Lerman, Price, and Wilcox (2016) we control for income by dividing our
measure of income by the square root of the household size, to account for economies of scale.

accounted for by a simple control for average family income in early childhood. The patterns and

levels displayed in Figures 5A and 5B are very similar to those reported in Figures 4A and 4B,

respectively. The finding that controlling for family income in early childhood does not

appreciably change the estimate marriage premium might indicate that other resources associated

with marriage are driving the observed premium. Such resources might include greater family

stability, more total parental time, lower levels of maternal stress, among others. It could also be

that average family income during early childhood is not a sufficient proxy for family income

over a child’s life, such that a more comprehensive measure of income would indicate that family

income is indeed an important factor in explaining the marriage premium.

       In terms of the advanced outcomes, average family income during early childhood seems

to be an important contributing factor in determining college completion, but it does not have

much of an impact on the estimated premium for having a high income at age 25. Although the

pattern in Figure 5C (for college completion) is very similar to Figure 4C, the marriage premium

to children asymptotes to a lower value, 15 percentage points rather than 20 percentage when

adjusted for family income.

V. DISCUSSION

       Numerous empirical studies written across social science disciplines indicate that children

raised in married biological parent households tend to do better on a host of outcomes, both

during childhood and into adulthood, as compared to children raised by an unmarried mother.

Given that marital status is not randomly assigned to an individual, a precise causal estimate of

marriage per se remains elusive. Nonetheless, as we noted at the outset, the strength of the

association and its robustness to a myriad of controls is at least strongly suggestive of a causal

relationship. In this paper, we label this observed difference as the “marriage premium for
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                           Marriage Premium for Children, p. 24

children.” When viewed through the lens of economics, it becomes clear that such a premium

could be both explained and anticipated by an economic consideration of potential resources.

        The academic literature and policy conversation about non-marital childbearing has

generally not distinguished across different categories of non-marital childbearing. We have

proposed a framework for evaluating non-marital childbearing and children’s outcomes that has

clear heterogeneous predictions. Specifically, we propose that the marriage premium in terms of

children’s outcomes will depend on a mother’s own level of resources, the nature of marriage

markets and the additional resources a spouse would bring to the household, and the relevant

production function for a specific outcome. Using data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID), we find that the predictions of our framework are consistent with the patterns

in the data.

        We distinguish children’s later-life outcomes into those that are primary (high school

graduation and not living in poverty) from those that are advanced (college graduation and having

a high income). For primary outcomes, the data indicate the largest marriage premiums for

children of women who give birth in their early- to mid-20s and for children of high school

graduates. The relative marriage advantage is lower for children of mothers who are in their teens

or in their 30s, as well as for children of high school dropouts or college graduates. We interpret

these patterns as being consistent with the prediction that the incremental resources associated

with marriage are too small to have much of an impact for young and less educated mothers, and

not necessary at the high end, to substantially increase the likelihood of obtaining a primary

outcome. Interestingly, for advanced outcomes, the marriage premium is monotonically

increasing with observed maternal age and education. This suggests that even for mothers with a

high level of own resources, the additional resources brought into a married household have a
                                                                           Kearney and Levine
                                                           Marriage Premium for Children, p. 25

sizeable impact on the likelihood that a child graduates from college and achieves a high level of

adult income.

       The conceptual framework and descriptive empirical evidence of this paper imply that it is

important to distinguish across maternal circumstances when evaluating the issue of non-marital

childbearing and children’s outcomes. They also have implications for thinking about recent

trends toward higher rates of non-marital fertility among older and more educated women. In

previous decades, non-marital childbearing was quite uncommon except among women in their

teens and among those without a high school degree. However, in recent decades we have

witnessed a dramatic rise in non-marital childbearing among women with a high school degree

and women in their 20s. Our results from PSID data on cohorts born during the 1960s, 1970s, and

1980s suggest that this is precisely where the marriage premium is largest for children.

       The extent to which these results hold lessons for predicting heterogeneity in the marriage

premium for children being born to unmarried mothers today will depend on how maternal

resources, marriage markets, father resources, and the production function of child outcomes have

changed. The key takeaway from our framework and empirical results is that the marriage

premium depends crucially on resource context. We have focused on the economic resources that

fathers would bring to marriage. This is related to a leading explanation for the high rates of non-

marital childbearing among less educated and minority women: the notion that there is a dearth of

“marriageable men” in certain segments of the population, generally understood to mean men

who would bring economic stability (Wilson 1987; Wilson and Neckerman, 1986). In recent

decades, the economic position of the median male in terms of education and earnings has

declined, relative to both earlier cohorts (Greenstone and Looney, 2011) and contemporaneous

women (Autor and Wasserman, 2013). The declines in employment and earnings have been

especially pronounced among men with high school degrees (Autor and Wasserman, 2013;
                                                                                 Kearney and Levine
                                                                 Marriage Premium for Children, p. 26

Kearney and Hershbein 2015). If part of the reason that rates of non-marital childbearing have

increased among women with high school degrees is that there has been an erosion in the

economic prospects of the men with whom they partner21, then the marriage premium their

children would enjoy is likely to be lower than the premiums we have found among earlier

cohorts.

        As this discussion highlights, the economic causes of non-marital childbearing are likely

related to the resulting economic consequences of non-marital childbearing. Empirically

separating out these causes and effects is a challenging task. Much more research is needed into

the complex issue of non-marital childbearing and what it implies for the economic well-being of

affected children. The framework and empirical results we have put forth in this paper

demonstrate the importance of focusing on heterogeneous effects related to potential household

resources.

       The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is composed of several panel and cross-

sectional datasets collected at either the household or individual level. We combine information

from several of these datasets to identify characteristics of individual’s mothers and family

setting and link these measures to individuals. Each individual in the PSID is uniquely identified

by two variables: the 1968 family interview number and the 1968 person number. Household

members and children who enter the household or are born after 1968 are retroactively assigned

to the family 1968 interview number and given a 1968 person number.

       Using the PSID Family History, Parent Identification, we construct a crosswalk linking

an individual to their mother’s and father’s 1968 interview number and person number. Next

using the PSID Family History, Marriage History, we identify the year and month all marriages

begin and end as well as the 1968 interview number and person number of the spouse. For our

analysis, we restrict this marriage history to all women in the sample, and merge this history onto

an individual’s record. Using the individual’s month and year of birth we are able to identify the

mother’s marital status at the child’s birth, and for any age thereafter by comparing their age to

the mother’s marriage history.

       Using the household level data, we construct a household level dataset that includes

various measures of household income and the head of household race for each year. This

household level information is then merged onto the individual level panel using the yearly

interview number and year. For most of our analysis, we collapse the data to one observation per

person to examine the individual’s outcome at a given age (20 or 25). When collapsing the data,

we preserve the individual sampling weights at each age for which we observe an outcome, and
                                                                         Kearney and Levine

in all of our analysis use the weights that correspond to the age at which the outcome is

measured. Below we provide a table describing the source variables and construction of our key

variables.
