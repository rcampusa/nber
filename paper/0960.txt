                     INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION:
                       SHORT--TERN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND GOLD


                                      ABSTRACT


     Using a continuous—time finance—theoretic framework, this paper presents the

optimal port±olio rule of an international investor who consumes N national composite

goods and who holds N domestic—currency—denominated assets with known nominal interest

rates in an environment where prices of goods, assets and exchange rates follow

geometric Brownian motion. It is shown that the currency portfolio rule described

in Macedo (l982a) is applicable to the case where there are N assets with a known

price and one asset, gold, with a random price in terms of the numeraire.

     Under these assumptions, it is found that the ontimal portfolio of an investor

consuming goods from all major industrialized countries (according to their weight

in total trade) would be dominated in March 1981 by long positions in U.S. dollars

(25%), yen (17%), D. marks (16%), French francs (15%), and pounds sterling (10%).

An investor consuming only U.S. goods, by contrast, would hold 96% of his optimal

portfolio in U.S. dollars. Because of the covariance of exchange rates and gold,

the exclusion of the latter generates substantial reshuffling.

     The analysis of the evolution of portfolios over time shows that shares changed

dramatically at the beginning of the period and did not begin to approach their

March 1981 values until the end of 1976. In the case of the yen and the pound there

were oscillations throughout the period. With respect to the dollar share in the

optimal portfolio of the U.S. and international investor, it is found that, in the

period between late 1974 and mid—1976, a period in which the dollar is considered

to have been "strong", a large decline in its optimal share took place.

                INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION:
                  SHORT—TERN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND GOLD


INTRODUCTION

     The last decade showed a significant increase in trading in international

financial markets, in face of increased uncertainty about prices, exchange

rates and interest rates. In this paper we discuss this phenomenon in the

context of international investment diversification, by individuals, firms

and government agencies. We investigate optimal portfolio diversification

by a class of risk—averse agents, who consume in fixed proportions goods pro-

duced in various countries. They are able to continuously reshuffle the com-

position of their wealth, made up of assets with known nominal returns denom-

inated in different currencies. When prices of goods, prices of assets, and

exchange rates are uncertain and consumption preferences are such that there

is no "safe asset" in real terms, the best combination of risk and real return

is provided by the portfolio rule presented here.

     The theory of international portfolio diversification is an extension of

the classic mean—variance framework of Markowitz (1959) and Tobin (1965). When

continuous trading is possible, Merton (1969, 1971) spelled out under which

conditions intertemporal maximization of expected utility would allow the se-

paration of the portfolio rule from the consumption rule. In particular, he

showed that, if asset prices are generated by stationary and lognormally dis-

tributed continuous—time stochastic processes (geometric Brownian motion) and

if the instantaneous utility function of the agent is homothetic with constant

relative risk aversion, a time—invariant portfolio rule could be derived. Fur—

thermore, this rule would be the same as the one obtained if the agent was max-

imizing period by period a linear function of mean real return and the variance

of return.
                                   —2—



     There have been several applications of the Tobin—Merton framework to

international finance. In addition to those surveyed by Adler and Dumas

(1982), one might refer here to the recent contributions of Stulz (1980),

Dornbusch (l980a), Krugman (1981), Nairay (1981), Bortz (1982) and Meerschwam

(1982) while bearing in mind the skeptical remarks of Tobin (1982). This

paper contains a version of the international portfolio diversification model

where the international investor is allowed to hold assets with uncertain

prices, such as gold. The paper shows in Section I how the currency diversi—

ficatiori rules derived by Kouri and Macedo (1978) and Macedo (1979 and 1982b)

emerge as special cases of the portfolio rule derived here. Section II is

devoted to the computation of optimal portfolios of gold and short—term finan—

cial assets over the period April 1973 to March 1981, using monthly data and

quarterly holding periods. Drawing on the work of Goldstein (1982), the

evolution of optimal portfolios over this period is also discussed. The

conclusion outlines the main results and also contains some topics for future

research in this area.


I OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO RULES

     In this section, we present the optimal diversification rule for an agent

who consumes fixed proportions of N composite goods produced in N countries

and who holds a portfolio (that can be continuously reshuff led) of M assets

with known nominal returns in domestic currency. The prices of the N goods,

the prices of the M assets and the N—l exchange rates are uncertain and are

specified as continuous stochastic processes. As a result, real wealth accu—

mulation, equal to the difference between the real rate of return on the port-

folio and the rate of real consumption, is described by a stochastic differential

equation. Given this flow budget constraint, at each moment in time the agent
                                                    —3—


chooses a portfolio of assets and a consumption bundle. The optimal portfolio

rule is thus one of the outcomes of the intertemporal constrained maximization

of the expected utility of consumption from time 0 to time T". Since we are

interested in the problem of an individual agent rather than in the determin-

ation of goods and assets prices and exchange rates in general equilibrium,

we can assume that prices are stationary and lognormally distributed.--' For

convenience, we specify prices in terms of the numeraire —                 arbitrarily   defined

as the currency of country N — and set M =                N.--'   Then, for 1=1, ..., N, we have

     It is convenient to measure (positive or negative) asset holdings as

a proportion of real wealth, W. The share of wealth held in asset i is

defined as:


              x. =     11
                      N.Q.
     (2)                                     i=l, ..., N;



     where N. are the holdings of asset i
            1

                         N a.
                  =                 is the purchasing power of asset i over the
                      Gi/JIP.
                         J



     N goods' a. being the share of X. in total expenditure and        X the
     amount of good j        consumed.


     Utility is a strictly concave function of the instantaneous rate of

consumption X. of the N goods with constant expenditure share a and constant

relative risk aversion l—y. Given the state of the system, described by real

wealth, we use the method of dynamic stochastic programming in order to find

the optimal paths of the control variables x. and X.. Hence, we define the

value function:


                                 T1N             a.y
                                  --
     (3)      J(W) = max
                              E f r      X.(r)         dt
                                 tyj
where Et denotes expectation conditional upon information available at time t.

From intertemporal utility maximization subject to the wealth accumulation con-

straint and the unity constraint on asset shares, we obtain first order condi-

tions from which the consumption and portfolio rules can be derived.-'1 Stacking

the M first order conditions on portfolio shares, we obtain:


     (4)      r + (l—y)ea — (l—y)Gx + (X/Jw)e = 0
                                        —5-.-




     where          = WaJ/W;

              l—y =   —(2J/W2)(WJ/W);
              A is the Lagrange multiplier;

              r is the vector of real returns;

              ci is the vector of expenditure shares;

              x is the vector of portfolio shares;

              e is a N column vector of ones;

              0 is a N column vector of zeros;

     G =    {a..}   is the N by N variance—covariance matrix of changes in

              asset prices expressed in terms of the numeraire;

and 0 =     {O..}   is the N by N covariance matrix of changes in asset prices

              and changes in goods prices both expressed in terms of the

             numeraire.


Note that the expected real return on each asset is obtained by adding the

expected proportional change in the purchasing power of the asset to its known

nominal return in domestic currency:


                r. = R. + dQ./Q.;      i =   1,   ..., N



     Using the unity constraint on the portfolio shares (multiplied by i—i),

we augment (4) by another row, to get:



                                                           ITaT     1   Tr
                                                           II   I+I
                                                           JLDJ 1-yLl-y
     Now we invert the augmented G matrix in (5):


              rG :e            =
     (5')
              L e'O
                                               —6—

                          —1
        where y =     C     e/e,—l
                                G e

        and     K =   I—ey',    I being the identity matrix of order N.

        Substituting (5') into (5) and ignoring the N+l row (which is the

definition of A) we obtain an expression for the vector of N optimal port—

folio shares:


        (6)        x y + G'KOa + —G1Kr

     The optimal portfolio decomposes into a capital position y, such that

e'y =   1,    and two zero—net—worth portfolios. The latter are constructed by

comparing the mean and variance of the real return on the particular asset

(respectively involving r and Oa) with the mean and variance of the real

return on the capital position. This is done through the "comparison matrix"

K, such that e'G1K =           0'.    We refer to y + C 1KOa as the minimum variance port—
        m          —l                                .

    To interpret (6) further, it is convenient to decompose the N by N variance—

covariance matrix of changes in numeraire prices of assets (G) and the N by N

covariance matrix of changes in numeraire prices of assets and goods (0), viz:


     (7)           G=Gd+__,
                   0=H+S—E-
    where Gd (= g..)           is the   N by N variance covariance matrix of changes
                               in the domestic currency price of assets;
               S               is the   N—l by N—i variance—covariance matrix of ex-
                               change rate changes, S(=&.) bordered by zeros;
                               is the N by N—i covariance matrix between changes in

                               domestic currency prices of assets and bilateral exchange

                               rates, E =            augmented by a column vector of zeros;
                                            (c1.),
                                           —7—


             H (           is the N by N covariance matrix of changes in domestic
                   n1)
                           currency prices of assets and goods;

     and                   is the N—i by N covariance matrix between changes in

                           bilateral exchange rates and domestic goods prices,

                           W(=      augmented by a row vector of zeros.


     Next consider the case where the Nth asset has a known domestic currency

price, so that it is essentially a short bond or deposit denominated in the

numeraire currency. Then the G and 0 matrix can be rewritten as:


                     IG Of
     (8)       G= J    ———-i———

                     LQ'O j
     and       0=J———
                     rQ
                  L0' -i

     where 0 is a N—i column vector of zeros.

     Substituting (8) into (4), the last row becomes:


     (9)
               rN+X/JWO
     Using (9) to eliminate XIJ from (5), we now solve for x, the N—i column

vector of portfolio shares:


     (10)      x             +
                                    G(r_erN)

     where     r =
                     (r1         rNl)
     and       e is a N—i column vector of ones.


     To obtain        we use the unity constraint:


     (10') XN1_&X
                                                —8—




     Denoting         the identity matrix of order N—i by I, the rule for the N

assets   is then written as:

      (ii)        x=ra+j-----r


     where        F
                         r    G       1
                                               is such that e'F   e';
                         Le'(I—G 0)
                         r        —Ge
                                          —
                                               is such that e' = 0'     and Ee = 0.
                        L—" e'cJ
     Comparing (6) to (ii), it is             clear that,when one asset has a known price
in terms of the numeraire, the minimum variance portfolio (Fe) cannot be decom-

posed into a capital position depending on asset price uncertainty and a zero—

net—worth hedge portfolio determined by the covariance of changes in assets

and goods prices in terms of the numeraire, weighted by preferences (GK0a).

Also, the zero—net—worth speculative portfolio is computed in terms of real

returns relative to the Nth asset (r/l—y), rather than relative to the capital
             —l              7/
position (G Kr/i—i).—

     When all asset prices are known, Gd, E and H in (7) vanish and the G and

e matrices can be written as:


     (7')      G=S

     where     S = [S        01


     The     matrix used to weight real returns in (11) now becomes the augmented

inverse of the variance—covariance matrix of exchange—rate changes. The F matrix

used to weight consumption preferences in (il) decomposes further, so that the

minimum variance portfolio for the N—i assets can be written as:
                                          —9—


               m =
     (12)            (I   —
                              SY)a

     where     I = S1S        is the (N—i by N) matrix obtained by augmenting

                              I by a N—i column vector of zeros.


     Using the unity constraint to obtain          we can express the minimum var-

     It   is clear from (13) that the capital position is given by the expend-

iture shares so that the minimum variance portfolio reduces to a when goods

prices are known.-" Also, we again have the two zero—net—worth portfolios

of (6), one hedging against the covariance of changes in domestic currency

prices of goods and in exchange rates (—a), the other, xS, based on real

returns relative to the Nth currency.

     Finally, consider the problem of the investor who holds currencies and

one asset with an uncertain price in terms        of   the numeraire. In this case a

rule in the form of (13) still applies, as shown in the Appendix. The reason

for this remarkable equivalence is that the asset with an uncertain price has

the same effect on the portfolio rule as the currency of a country whose good

is not consumed by the investor.

     Before we proceed to apply the rule in (13) to actual data on eight major

currencies and gold, mention should be made of the special case of purchasing

power parity. In that case there are no relative price changes, so that there

II OPTIMAL PORTFOLIOS OF SHORT—TERN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND     GOLD COMPUTED

1. Overview

     In this section, we apply the time—invariant portfolio rule derived in

Section I to investors holding financial assets with three—month maturities

denominated in eight major currencies; the U.S. dollar (abbreviated to $),

used as the numeraire currency, the Canadian dollar (C$), the French franc

(FF), the German mark (DM), the Italian lira (IL), the Japanese yen (v),      the
Swiss franc (SF) and the pound sterling () as well as gold (GO). The short—

term financial assets are such that their domestic currency price is assumed

to be kncwn. Gold, in turn, is an asset with a zero nominal return and an

uncertain price, C, in terms of the numeraire. Since there is only one un-

certain asset price and there are N—i bilateral exchange rates, S, defined

in (1) as units of domestic currency per dollar, it is more convenient to ex-

press the price of gold in ounces per dollar or as 1/G)" The investors are

assumed to have static expectations about the rate of change of exchange rates,

the price of gold and numeraire prices of the goods entering their consumption

basket. As defined above, real returns are equal to the (certain) nominal

return in domestic currency plus the proportional rate of change of the pur-

chasing power of the currency (or of gold) over the previous three months.

     In Section I we assumed that the investor consumed a basket composed of

goods produced in the various countries, whose prices in terms    of   U.S. dollars

are denoted by P. in (1), with weights given by the constant expenditure

shares. We refer to these goods by the country name: Canada (CA), France (FR),

Germany (GE), Italy (IT), Japan (JA), Switzerland (SZ), the United Kingdom (UK),

and the United States (US). For empirical purposes, however, we identify each

one of these national goods with the consumer price index of the country in

question. As a consequence of this simplification, we refer to an investor
                                    —12—



consuming the goods including the consumer price index of, say, Germany as

the "German investor" even though it imported goods.----" In terms of the

utility function in (5) above, the "national investor" of country j is defined

as having a. = 1 and a. = 0 for ij. This contrasts with the "international

consumer—investor" who weights national consumer price indices by the share

of each country in total trade and can thus be thought of as a weighted

average of national investors.-' Then, the role of preferences in optimal

portfolios is assessed by comparing different national investors to the inter-

national investor.

     We report in subsection 2 optimal portfolios over the entire sample per-

iod, April 1973 to March 1981. We emphasize the total portfolios of the U.S.

and the international investors but the total portfolios of other national

investors can immediately be computed, because the computed speculative port-

folios do not depend on consumption preferences and the minimum variance port-

folios of all national investors are reported. Subsection 3 investigates

the evolution of these portfolios since September 1974 as investors revise

their estimates of variances and covariances at the end of every quarter by

including the new observations on the risk and return characteristics of each

asset.


2. Optimal Portfolios, April 1973 — March 1981

     In Table 1 we present the pattern of correlations and covariances between

exchange rate (and gold price) changes which underlies the computation of the

speculative portfolio as well as the computation of the minimum variance port-

folios of the different investors. The elements of the upper triangular matrix

give estimates of the S matrix (including the price of gold). Since mean

changes in exchange rates are expressed in number per quarter, we multiply

their variances and covariances by 100 and refer to the units as percentages.

Since variances and covariances are not directly comparable (because the

variables have different means), correlation coefficients are reported in

the diagonal elements of the lower triangle. It is clear from the table

that the correlation coefficients between "Ecu area" currencies —     including
the Swiss franc but excluding the pound sterling —   are   uniformly higher

than all other correlation coefficients. The lowest of the Ecu area car—

relations, between the lira and the D.Mark, is 0.6. The table also shows

that the correlation coefficients between the Canadian dollar and the other

currencies are the lowest (and negative). Between these two extremes, we

find the correlation coefficients of gold, the yen, and the pound with the

other currencies. The highest variance is the variance of the price of gold.

The ranking of the variances of dollar exchange rate changes, on the other

hand, is lowest for the Canadian dollar. The two "hard currencies" of Europe

(DM and SF) exhibit a somewhat higher variance than the other currencies.

    As mentioned in Section I, the speculative portfolio is based on the in-

verse of S, each element of which shows the effect of an increase in the

return differential relative to the U.S. dollar on the speculative demand

of all investors for a particular currency or gold. The elements of S1,

therefore, provide estimates on the degree of substitutability (negative en-

tries) and complementarity (positive entries) between assets. To obtain the

own and cross effects of an increase in the real return of a given asset on

the speculative position of that asset for an investor with unitary risk aver-

sion (y=0), S' is augmented by arow (column) equal to minus the sum of the

elements of all other columns (rows). The resulting matrix, which we denoted

above by E, is reported in Table 2 using an ordering of the assets which em-

phasizes the strength of the substitutability (—) and complementarity (+) ef-

fects among assets showing what might be called "currency blocs."

     It is clear from Table 2 that, over and above the strong substitutability

between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar — and, to a lesser degree, between

the D.Mark and the Swiss franc —   there   are two, partly overlapping, "currency

blocs": the "Ecu bloc" and the "dollar bloc," where the criterion for a bloc

is a cross—effect of at least 1%. While the French franc and the lira belong

to both blocs, the pound does not belong to either one, all its cross effects be-

ing less than or equal to .5% in absolute value. Table 2 also shows that the

assumption of separability between gold and currencies mentioned in the Ap-

pendix is approximately correct and that the own effect on gold is quite

small.

     The Canadian and U.S. dollar own effects far exceed those of other cur-

rencies. In the Canadian dollar case, this is largely the result of the

fact that, as noted, it exhibits the lowest variance of exchange rate changes.

The high value of the U.S. own effect is observed here because it equals the

sum of all elements of the    matrix. The own effects are much greater than

the absolute value of the cross effects. The single exception is the cross—

effect between U.S. and Canadian dollar assets which exhibits, by far, the

highest degree of substitutability. A one per cent increase in the real rate

of return on one asset decreases the other's share in the speculative port-

folio by 7.4% of the initial share (when i=O). Contrary to the presumption

in two—country models, we find that the U.S. dollar and D.Mark as well as U.S.

dollar and Swiss franc are complements in the speculative portfolio)—' Also,

with the exception of the observed complementarity between lira and the pound

and the Swiss franc, the cross effects between all other European currencies

are negative.

     The estimates of the degree of substitutability and complementarity among

assets that are provided by the E matrix reported in Table 2, together with
                                    —17—


the covariances between changes in exchange rates and domestic currency prices

of national goods weighted by consumption preferences determine the inflation—

hedge portfolio.     In Table 3, we report the correlation coefficients between

changes in dollar exchange rates (and in the price of gold) and national in-

flation rates, which we denoted in (1) above by p..• It is evident that these

correlations are generally small. Note that the negative correlations in the

Canadian row imply that the Canadian dollar appreciates relative to the U.S.

dollar not only when foreign consumer prices rise but also when Canadian prices

increase. Similarly, a rise in U.S. prices is associated with a depreciation

vis—a—vis the dollar of the French franc, the D.Mark, the yen and the Swiss

franc.

     While the low values of the elements of Table 3 (particularly the under-

lined ones), indicate little correlation between domestic price and exchange

rate movements, they do not, by themselves, imply the rejection of the relative

purchasing power parity hypothesis. By equating the 0 matrix (7') and (7")

in Section I, however, we can derive the correlation coefficients which would

obtain if purchasing power parity prevailed. In all cases, they are vastly

different from those reported in Table 3.

     Note further that each vector S—l'I'. has a simple. interpretation:
                                                 .                 .
                                                                         it gives

the shares of the N—l currencies in the inflation hedge portfolio of the nation-

al investor of country i.!'The dollar share of the inflation hedge portfolio

is then obtained residually. Subtracting this portfolio from the expenditure

share of the national investor of country i (given by a vector with 1 in row i

and zeros elsewhere) we obtain the minimum variance portfolios of the national

investor of country i.    These portfolios are stacked together and reported

in Table 4. They form what we denoted in Section I as the I —     matrix (expressed

in percent). For example, the minimum variance portfolio of the German investor

(3rd column of Table 4) would include long positions in DM (98%), Canadian

dollars (8%), French francs (5%), pounds (2%) and gold (1%), and short posi-

tions in lire (3%), and yen (1%). We find that inflation risk is minimized

for most national investors by holding gold, pound, French franc, and Canadian

dollar assets, while borrowing in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, yen, and DM.

     The underlined elements in each one of the columns of Table 4 may also

be interpreted as the extent to which a long position in the domestic currency

of a given national investor is chosen in the construction of the inflation—

hedge portfolio. This is consistent with the domestic currency being a "pre—

ferred monetary habitat" and is thus supported for those currencies whose

"diagonal" element in Table 4 is greater than 100, i.e. Canada, France, and

Switzerland)' Hence, a "preferred local currency habitat" may be observed

as a result of the inflation—hedging portfolio provided by one's domestic

money, even in the absence of transaction or information costs.

     The last column of Table 4 is of particular interest because, as noted

at the end of Section I, if relative prices between national goods do not

change, consumption preferences do not enter the minimum variance portfolio.

In this context, relative purchasing power parity would imply that uncertainty

with respect to the N national goods prices collapses into uncertainty about

the price of a single national good, e.g. the good produced in the country of

the numeraire currency)21 With the U.S. dollar chosen as the numeraire, the

minimum variance portfolio of the U.S. investor would also be the "universal"

minimum variance portfolio under purchasing power parity. The portfolio is

dominated by a long position in U.S. dollars (90%). The U.S. (cum—universal—PPP)

investor holds less than his consumption share in home currency in order to

maintain an 8.9% long position in Canadian dollar assets while D.Mark, yen, and

Swiss franc denominated borrowing supports short—term investments in gold, French

franc, lire and pound assets.

     Contrasting the last column of Table 4 with the "diagonal" elements of

the other columns reveals that relative price changes were important, part-

icularly. in the cases of Italy and Japan. Specifically, we find that the

Japanese investor's minimum variance portfolio differs significantly from the

"universal—PPP" portfolio. Of particular note are the sign and magnitude

of positions in Canadian dollar, French franc, lira, Swiss franc, and pound

sterling assets. The last row of Table 4, which reports the residually

determined shares of the U.S. dollar, also reflects the significance of relative

price changes.   Note that the 89.7% dollar share in the "universal" minimum

variance portfolio stems from —10.3% dollar share in the "universal" inflation—

hedge portfolio. It is thus smaller than the dollar share in the minimum

variance/inflation—hedge portfolio of all national investors, especially those

of the Italian and Swiss investors. In sum, this analysis shows that, since

national inflation rates are not fully anticipated and relative prices change,

even investors who only consume domestic goods (and are infinitely risk averse)

will not hold a portfolio consisting only of home currency denominated claims.

Rather, national investors exploit inflation risk—minimizing gains to diver-

sification as provided by the variance—covariance structure of exchange rate

changes relative to the covariance of exchange rate and domestic price changes.

     Having presented and interpreted the E and I— matrices, we are now in a

position to report the components of the total portfolio, for given assumptions

about consumption preferences and risk aversion. This is done in Table 5 for

the U.S. investor (left panel) and an international investor (rightpanel).

The speculative portfolio in the center column, common to both investors, is

computed under the assumption that they are Bernouilli investors

     As expected, the U.S. investor's minimum variance portfolio differs sig-

nificantly from the same portfolio for the international investor (columns

(2a + 2b) vs. columns (4a + 4b)). With the exception of the lira, we find,

however, that the sign of the difference between expenditure shares and the

minimum variance portfolio shares is invariant to consumption preferences.

For example, both U.S. and international investors have greater holdings of

gold, Canadian dollars and French francs than implied by the capital position

(i.e. inflation—hedge portfolio shares greater than zero). On the other

hand, the zero—net—worth inflation—hedge portfolio decreases the share of

the D.Mark, yen, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar assets in the minimum variance

portfolio.

     The relationship between the minimum variance portfolio and consumption

preferences can be illustrated further by multiplying each element ij of the

I— matrix by the ratio of the expenditure share j (column) to the minimum

variance portfolio share i (row). We then obtain a matrix of elasticities

of the shares of the international investor's minimum variance portfolio

with respect to shares in expenditure. For example, the "own" elasticity

for the U.S. dollar is 1.16. A ten per cent increase in the international

investor's share of expenditure on U.S. goods would increase the dollar com-

ponent of the minimum variance portfolio from 19% to 21% (=19 x 1.116). Other

countries with "own" elasticity greater than one are Germany, Italy, Japan,

Switzerland, and the U.K. Sizable cross—elasticities with respect to an

increase in the U.S. expenditure share are on holdings of D.Marks (—.08) and

lire (.06).

     The speculative portfolio, dependent on own and cross effects between

assets and real return differentials with the U.S. dollar includes long po-

sitions in U.S. dollars (6%), yen (5%), and gold (3%) and short positions

in Canadian dollars (—8%) and lira (—5%). The relatively large positive share

for the U.S. dollar is attributable less to its mean real return (—1.9%) than

to its substitutability with Canadian dollar, French franc, and lira assets
                                   —24—



and to its complementarity with the Swiss franc. Return differentials

with the dollar largely explain the attractiveness of yen assets (4% return

differential) and gold (20% differential) and the short position in lira

(—1.5% differential). Note that while the return differential for the Swiss

franc was the same as for the yen, its share is zero rather than 5%. The

reason in found in Table 2, where it can be seen that the yen is a strong

substitute for the dollar compared with the weak compelementarity between

the dollar and the Swiss franc. The high degree of substitutability between

the CanadIan and U.S. dollars is reflected by the fact that a relatively small

difference in mean real returns results in a long position in U.S. dollar

assets financed by Canadian dollar liabilities.

     The total portfolios of the international and the U.S. investors (re-

ported in Table 5) are computed under the assumption of unitary risk aversion.

Of course, the higher the degree of risk aversion, the smaller the contri-

bution of the speculative to the total portfolio. At the limit, when risk

aversion is infinite, the speculative portfolio disappears so that the minimum

variance and total portfolios are the same and optimal shares are independent

of returns. It is clear from Table 5, column 5, that the total portfolio of

the international investor is dominated by the minimum variance portfolio.

The long positions of gold, D.Marks, yen, and U.S. dollars in the latter are

reinforced by the speculative portfolio.

     We now analyze the effect of excluding gold from the available menu of

assets, reported in parentheses in Tables 4 and 5. The elements of the

matrix are not sensitive to the exclusion of gold, as expected from the low

own effect in Table 2. We first note from Table 3 that the price of gold has

the largest correlation with the Italian and Japanese consumer price indices

(respectively —0.4 and —0.3). Accordingly, the exclusion of gold results in

significant changes in the minimum variance portfolio of the Italian and
                                   —25—


Japanese investors (columns 4 and 5 of Table 4). These differences do not

affect the international investor, however, as can be seen in column (4b)

of Table 5 while the last column of Table 4 suggested little change in the

U.S. (cum—universal-.ppp) investor minimum variance portfolio.

     In fact, larger effects can be seen in the speculative portfolio. Ex-

cluding gold, the asset with the highest mean return, leads to an increase

in the share of the D.Mark, the Swiss franc, the pound, the Canadian dollar,

and the French franc totalling 13% (to 49%) and a decline of the share of

the yen and the dollar totalling 8% (to 39%), the difference being the (5%)

share in gold. These shifts illustrate the interaction of the change in the

variance—covariance structure and of the change in return differentials on

the speculative portfolio, a topic to which we return at the end of the next

subsection.

3. The evolution of optimal portfolios over time

     Table 5 reported minimum variance, speculative, and total optimal port-

folios calculated with data from the whole sample period, April 1973 to March

1981. In this subsection, we study the evolution of these optimal portfolios

for interim periods and assess whether changes in optimal portfolios were a

response to changes in expected real return differentials or a response to

changes in the observed variance—covariance structure. If, as we have assumed,

the variance—covariance structure was stationary and investors had perfect

knowledge of this true underlying structure, the inflation—hedge portfolio

would not change over time and speculative portfolios would change only as a

consequence of changes in real returns.

     In Table 6, we report the U.S. dollar share in the inflation—hedge port-

folios of the different national investors as well as of the international

investor. The inflation—hedge portfolio share of the dollar is the minimum

variance portfolio share for all but the U.S. and the international investors.

In the case of the U.S. investor (international investor), the minimum var-

iance portfolio share of the dollar is obtained by adding the capital position

of 100 (25) to the inflation—hedge portfolio share. It should also be recalled

that movements in U.S. dollar shares are implied by changes in the sum of all

other inflation—hedge portfolio shares since dollar shares are determined

residually. It is clear from Table 6 that the dollar shares of all investors

change substantially from year to year. Some patterns, however, do emerge.

Since 1978, the short positions in U.S. dollars of both the international (col-

umn 9) and the German investor decline. The reduction in the Japanese investor's

short position in dollars begins in 1976. The decline in the long position in

dollars held by the Italian investor begins in 1977 but is reversed in 1981.

This strengthening in the inflation—hedge demand for the dollar (smaller short

positions and larger long positions) in 1981 is evidenced in all minimum

variance portfolios except those of the Swiss and the U.S. investors. Over

the entire period, we observe like movements in the minimum variance dollar

shares of the U.S. and international investors. Although it is only roughly

reflected in Table 6, we also found that the change over time in the share

of many of the assets in the minimum variance portfolio is similar regardless

of the choice of expenditure weights.

     Next, we turn to Table 7 which summarizes the evolution of the own and

cross effects of changes in the rate of return on the U.S. dollar. Specific-

ally, this table reports the last row of E.   It is determined residually so

that each element of this row is minus the sum of the column elements of the

inverse of the variance—covariance matrix of exchange rate (and gold price)

changes. The sum of all the elements of this matrix is equal to the element

in the U.S. column (own effect) of Table 7. In the last column of this table

we report the U.S. dollar share in the speculative portfolio.

      Except for a slight increase in 1978, there has been a steady and sub-

 stantial decline in the own effect of an Increase in the real return on the

U.S. dollar denominated asset on its speculative share. Similarly, the

magnitude of the cross effects of changes in dollar asset returns on the

speculative shares of other assets has generally declined over the sample

period. This pattern is most apparent in the Canadian and French columns.

In all cases, the reduction in the size of own and cross effects of changes

in U.S. real returns on speculative portfolios shares is associated with

the observed pattern of increased variances and covariances of exchange

rate and gold price changes. Between December 1975 and March 1981, the ob-

served variance of exchange rate changes increased for all currencies except

the German mark and French franc. We also found that the own and cross ef-

fects of changes in all other assets real returns have generally declined

over the sample period. The cross effects between the European currencies

have exhibited the greatest stability over time, both with respéct'to sign

and magnitude.

     As noted in the previous subsection, the elements of E indicate the degree

of substitutability and complementarity between assets. We thus interpret

the first eight columns of Table 7 as reporting the evolution of the substi—

tutability/complementarity relationships of all assets with the U.S. dollar.

The consistently strong substitution effects between the Canadian and U.S.

dollars, noted above, are evident in their negative sign and high absolute

values. For example, in the late 1970's, they were close to 10%, showing that

a 10% increase in the return on U.S. dollar assets decreases the speculative

demand for Canadian dollars by 1%. For the pound sterling, the strong comple—

mentarity before the dramatic mid—1976 depreciation is followed by a very weak

and erratic relationship. The degree of dollar—DM complementarity has signif i—

candy diminished over time. The increasing weakness in this relationship

became particularly pronounced following the decline in the value of the U.S.

dollar in late 1978.

        In Figure 1, we show the evolution of the optimal U.S. dollar share in

the total portfolio for the Bernouilli (y=0) U.S. and international investors.

These    shares correspond to the sum of the appropriate column of Table 6 plus
the    last column of Table 7, to   which we    add   the capital position (100 for the
U.S.    investor and 25 for the international investor). The similarity of the

evolution    in these shares is apparent. We noted above that the choice of ex-
penditure weights did not greatly affect inflation—hedge portfolio shares.
This is also evident when comparing movements in the U.S. and international
investor's minimum   variance portfolios. Further, as noted, there is no         signi-
ficant difference in the composition of the speculative portfolio when com-

puted with real rates of return relevant to the international investor compared

with real returns relevant to national investors. This is a consequence of

the fact that own and cross—effects in the E matrix are far greater in magni-

tude than differences in national versus international investor's real rates

of return. In fact, the composition of and changes in the speculative port-

folio are invariant to the choice of real returns versus nominal interest rates

adjusted for exchange rates changes.

       Figure 1 reveals that the sharp decline in the attractiveness of the

dollar between 1974 and mid—1976 was partly reversed in 1976 and that, since

1977, rather stable shares obtained. Over the late 1975 to early 1977 period,

both the precipitous decline and the subsequent increase in the total optimal

share of the U.S. dollar were the result of similar movements in the specula-

tive portfolios. In the period prior to September 1975, we found that the

U.S. dollar held the dominant share in the speculative portfolio. After that

time, no asset clearly dominated this portfolio. Finally, it should be

noted that the increase in the total dollar share for both the U.S. and

the international investor in the 1980—1981 period was caused by like move-

ments of the dollar share in both the inflation—hedge portfolio (becoming

less negative) and the speculative portfolio.

     Table 8 reports mean real returns on both U.S. dollar assets and optimal

portfolios computed with different degrees of relative risk aversion. It is

evident that the mean real return on the U.S. dollar is consistently negative

and less than the return on the minimum variance portfolio (and a fortiori

less than the return on the speculative and total portfolios). We also found

that the return on the speculative portfolio is always lower than the mean

real return on gold (the lowest return on gold between 1975 and March 1981

being 10.3%) and on the Swiss franc (the return on which ranged from 7.3% to

2.3% over this period). The yield on the speculative portfolio was also less

than the return on the DM asset in all reported periods except March 1976 and

March 1981. As a result, the return on the total portfolio for the Bernouilli

investor is relatively low. As expected the return on the total portfolio

is even lower when we increase the degree of relative risk aversion (e.g. y—l).

    As noted above, changes in speculative shares were, in many periods, the

dominant factor in the determination of movements in the total optimal portfo—

lb. Clearly, observed changes in the speculative portfolio were a consequence

of changes in both real returns and in the inverse of the augmented variance—

covariance matrix of gold price and exchange rate changes, .   In   Table 9, we

report real return differentials with U.S. dollar assets observed in March of

each year from 1975 to 1981. The importance of capital gains on gold, which

bears no interest, is evident. The consistently positive yield differentials

in favor of French francs, DM, yen, and Swiss franc dominated assets are also

 apparent. It is interesting to note that while the real return differential

between Canadian and U.S. dollar assets is low, we have observed large move-

ments in the speculative shares of these assets in response to small changes

 in a return differential as a consequence of their high degree of substituta-

bility.

      In Table 10, we record the percentage of the year over year change in

a given asset's speculative portfolio share attributable to changes in real

return differentials. That is, we decompose the relative effects of changes

in real returns and in the observed variance—covariance matrix of exchange

rate (and gold price) changes on movements over time in speculative portfolio

shares of all assets. It should be emphasized that under the assumption that

the variance—covarjance structure of exchange rate (and gold price) changes

is stationary and known with certainty by the investor, movements in specula-

tive portfolio shares would be entirely due to changes in real returns. This

would imply that investor's estimates of the true stationary E matrix are not

subject to sampling error. In this case, all of the elements in Table 10 would

be 100%, indicating that changes in speculative portfolios are fully attributable

to real returns. In those cases where the reported percentage is between 0 and

100%, changes in the observed variance—covariance structure were found to rein-

force the effect of changes in the real return differentials on (positive or

negative) moveements in speculative shares. Alternatively, elements greater

than 100% imply that changes in the observed variance—covariance structure were

a counterveiling influence. A negative element in the table indicates that the

movement in the speculative share was dominated by changes in the observed

matrix while the counterveiling influence became the change in the real return

vector.

     Only in 1976 and 1978 were year over year changes in the speculative

share of the U.S. dollar dominated by changes in real return differentials.

For example, between March 1977 and March 1978 the optimal dollar share

increased by 0.5%. If the observed I matrix had remained constant over this

period, however, the share of U.S. assets in the speculative portfolio would

have increased by 2.1%. Alternatively, the March 1979 dollar share increased

by 2.4% over the previous year. If the I matrix observed in March 1978 had

prevailed, the dollar speculative share would have fallen by 0.5% as a conse-

quence of increased gold, French franc, yen, and pound assets' return differ-

entials (see Table 9). Thus, the increase in the share of the dollar over

the year was entirely the consequence of favorable changes in its substituta—

bility—compleinentarity relationships with other assets. Similarly, between

March 1980 and March 1981, we observe a 2.7% increase in the optimal dollar

share. Changes in return differentials alone would have resulted in a 1%

decline in the optimal share. This effect, however, was overwhelmed by a 3.7%

Increase in the dollar share attributable to changes in the observed variance—

covariance structure (i.e. the optimal dollar share would have increased by

3.7% if real return differentials had remained constant at their March 1980

level).

     In contrast to the case of the U.S., changes in DM speculative portfolio

shares were, in most period, principally the iesult of movements in real return

differentials. In 1976, for example, the 14.1% drop in the optimal DM share

was entirely the consequence of changes in real return differentials (e.g.

between March 1975 and March 1976, the return differential in favor of DM

assets declined from 13.9% to 5.4%). In 1978, the 3.4% decline in the optimal

DM share was fully attributable to changes in the vector of real returns. In

this instance, however, changes in the observed variance—covariance structure

seved to reduce the magnitude of this effect.

     In Table 10, we also observed a similarity in the relative contribution

of changes in real return differntials across assets in a given year. That

is, in 1977 and 1978, changes in the observed E matrix played a significant

role in the determination of changes in most speculative shares. In comparison,

in March of 1976, 1980, and 1981, the importance of movements in real return

differentials were of relatively greater importance in the reshuffling of the

observed speculative portfolios.

 CONCLUS ION

     Using a continuous—time finance—theoretic framework, Section 1 of this

 paper presented the optimal portfolio rule of an international investor who

 consumes N national composite goods and who holds N domestic—currency—denomina

 ted assets with known nominal interest rates in an environment where prices of

 goods, assets and exchange rates follow geometric Brownian motion. It was

 shown that the optimal portfolio decomposes into a capital position and two

 zero—net worth portfolios. The capital position depends only on the relative

variances and covariances of changes in asset prices in terms of the    numeraire.
The first zero—net—worth portfolio depends on expenditure shares and on a

comparison of the covariance between the changes in prices of goods and assets.

The other zero—net—worth portfolio, scaled by risk aversion, depends on a

comparison of mean real return to the return on the capital position.     Also,

the currency portfolio rule described in Rouri and Macedo (1978) was shown to

be applicable to the case where one asset has a known price in terms of the

numeraire. In the Appendix, it is shown that the currency portfolio rule

described in Macedo (l982a) is applicable to the case where there are N

assets with a known price and one asset, gold,with a random price in terms of

the nuineraire. An extension of the framework which allows for a richer menu

of assets, along the lines of the equity and currency portfolios of Adler

and Dumas (1982), is in Meerschwam (1982).

    Under the assumptions of Section I, optimal portfolios were computed and

presented in Section II. These portfolios are based on the inflation hedging

portential provided by short—term financial assets denominated in different

currencies (and gold) as well as on the substitutability/compleinentarity

relationships among these assets.

    In general, optimal diversification involves departures from both the

"preferred monetary habitat" hypothesis, according to which portfolio shares

would match expenditure shares, and the "purchasing power parity" hypothesis,

according to which preferences would not affect the minimum variance portfolio.

Specifically we found that the optimal portfolio of an investor consuming goods

from all major industrialized countries (according to their weight in total

trade) would be dominated in March 1981 b.y long positions in U.S. dollars (25%),

yen (17%), D. marks (16%), French francs (15%), and pounds sterling (10%).

An investor consuming only U.S. goods, b.y contrast, would hold 96% of his

optimal portfolio in U.S. dollars. The inflation—hedge portion of this

portfolio reveals that inflation risk is minimized for both the international

and U.S. investor by holding Canadian dollars, French francs, and gold, and

by borrowing U.S. dollars, marks, Swiss francs, and yen.   In addition, the

U.S. investor would hold lire and pounds, while the international investor

would borrow lire.

    In March 1981, the optimal speculative portfolio, maximizing mean real

returns, would include long positions in U.S., German, and Japanese assets

and in gold, and short positions in Canadian dollars, French francs, lire,

and pounds. The analysis of the speculative portfolio reveals strong sub-

stitutability between U.S. and Canadian dollars. It likewise reveals sub-

stitutability of the U.S. dollar for French and Italian assets and weak

complementarity of the U.S. dollar with D. mark and Swiss franc assets.

    Because of the covariance of exchange rates and gold, the exclusion of

the latter generates substantial reshuffling; the international investor would

then have a long position in pounds (4%), Canadian dollars (3%), Swiss francs

and French francs (2% each) and a short position in lira (6%), U.S. dollars

and D. marks (2% each) and yen (1%).
                                      —41—

    The analysis of the evolution of portfolios over time showed, that shares

changed dramatically at the heginning of period and did not begin to approach

their March 1981 values until the end of 1976. In the case of the yen and

the pound there were oscillations throughout the period. With respect to the

dollar share in the optimal portfolio of the U.S. and international investor,

we found that, in the period between late 1974 and mid—1976, a period in which

the dollar is considered to have been "strong", a large decline in its optimal

share took place. This shows the importance of the variability (and the assoc-

iated uncertainty) of the changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, even when

the currency itself is "strong". After the lows reached in mid—1976, the share

increased again and stabilized in mid—1977 at levels well below those of before

the end of 1974.

    These oscillations over time are confirmed by the computation of optimal

portfolios with constant (2—year) sample length hut different base—periods,

as in Goldstein (1982). Also, the existence of a relatively unexploited set

of data on the foreign currency positions of U.S. commercial banks and non—

banks will allow for an explicit test of this framework, another topic being

currently researched by Goldstein. Depending on the data availability,

actual reserve diversification by central banks could also be contrasted

with the results of the optimizing framework developed here, pursuing the

line of research of 1-lealy (1981).

    In sum, work in this area should continue to be motivated by the need

to analyze the microfoundations that underly the questions of macroeconomic

policy in interdependent economies. Instead of constraining assets to be

substitutes, as is done in the usual two—country macro literature, we believe

that gains from portfolio diversification have to be analyzed in a multi—

currency finance—theoretic framework such as the one presented in this paper.

     * The
           research described in this paper was, partly financed by a NSF grant
       to the International Finance Section, Princeton University (NSF #PRA—
       8116473).   Earlier versions were presented at the NBER Conference on
      Exchange Rates, Bellagio (Italy), Penn, the New University of Lisbon
       (Portugal), Princeton and Yale. We are grateful to the participants
      for coimDents. Errors are our own.


 1. A constant—elasticity bequest function and a constant discount rate
      could easily be introduced.                      Nairay (1981) allows
      for a variable discount rate and an infinite horizon.


2.    For an endogenous determination of these processes see Nairay
       (1981). Applications to international finance are in Stulz
       (1982) and Bortz (1982). More general exogenous processes are
      used in Macedo (1982b), and Macedo, Goldstein and Meerschwam (1982),
      henceforth MGN.


3. More general cases, specifying prices in domestic currency are in
      Meerschwajn (1982).


4. The purchasing power of a currency is the optimal price index when the
      indirect utility functions is separable. See more on the concept in
      Kouri and Macedo (1978) and Macedo (l982a). Work with more general
      utility functions has been done by Stulz (1980).


5. The derivations are in MGM.


6.    Kouri (1975) referred to the "hedging demand for forward exchange which
      is proportional to the value of imported goods consumed" and to the
      "speculative demand" in a two—country model where national investors have
     different preferences. The decomposition between minimum variance and
     speculative portfolios for the international investor holding N currencies
     when prices and exchange rates are lognormally distributed is in Kouri and
     Macedo (1978).

 7. Note that, by Itô's lemma, mean real return differentials depend on the
      variance of the exchange rate as well as on the covariance of prices
      and exchange rates, weighted by .   This   implies that           >0 if
      '<0, that is to say the individual is. more risk—averse than the Rernouilli
      investor. See references. in Macedo (1982b.).


 8. This result is emphasized by Adler and Dumas (1981).


 9.   In the models of Solnik (1973) and Kouri (1977), the assumption of
      purchasing power parity and no inflation in the Nth country eliminates
      hedging so that the minimum variance portfolio is all in the Nth currency,
       m
      x=i.
10. If, as pointed out in Adler and Dumas (1981), exchange rate changes are
      typically not passed on to prices, (14) is the relevant rule, making
         =       where      captures the covariance between exchange rates
      and the components of the Nth country CPI and B are the CPI weights
      as in Macedo (l982a).


11. In the derivation of the Appendix, the price of gold is in units of
      currency N per ounce, which is why the covariance with goods prices and
      exchange rates enter with a negative sign.


12. See footnote (10) above


13. These weights are given as the simple average of the dollar value of
      imports and exports of the eight countries. The U.S. dollar share is
      25%, which makes the comparison of the U.S. investor (with a share of
      100% in the U.S. consumer price index) to the international investor
      particularly unsightful in attempts at bracketing the dollar share in
      optimal portfolios. See a discussion of weighing schemes in Macedo (1982a).


14. See for example, Dornbusch (1980b).


15. Notice that each element ij of the S1'Y      matrix   involves the ratio of the
      standarddev-iation of the change in the price of good j to the standard
      deviation of the change in the dollar exchange rate of currency i. These
                                               —47—

     ratios are in the 20—40% range for Italy, Japan, and the U.S. countries with
     a relatively high variance of inflation, and in the 10—20% range for the
     other countries. Thus, for example, when N = 3 the 1, 2 element of S 'P
     would be 12 =               where R12         p12 -   1/l-p1        Then gold is in-

     cluded , we have instead




                R12
                      =   (l-p) (12-p12) -            1212
                                  101 —        —          +
                                          02        012       2p12p1p2

     where p.(.) refers to the correlation of the price of gold with exchange
     rate i (price of good j).


16. Except for the U.S., this corresponds to a negative "diagonal" element in
     the S'P matrix.        Using the expression in the previous footnote we see that
     the   "own" inflation    hedge in Table 4 of —3.4% for Switzerland corresponds to
     (/) SZ =     14%     and R5 = — 0.24 (whilst the underlined element in Table 3
     was 3'sz= 0.3) and that the value of 13.2% for Italy corresponds to
           28% and RIT = 0.47     IT 0.3).

17. If price indices in different countries were constructed using

     identical goods and weights, the composition of the universal—PPP

    minimum variance portfolio would be independent of the choice of

     of the numeraire. However, when goods and weights and hence price

     indices vary by country, the universal minimum variance portfolio

     is determined according to the choice of the numeraire. See foot-

    note 10 above.
