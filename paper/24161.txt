How Do Individuals Repay Their Debt? The Balance-Matching Heuristic

                                         ABSTRACT

We study how individuals repay their debt using linked data on multiple credit cards. Repayments
are not allocated to the higher interest rate card, which would minimize the cost of borrowing.
Moreover, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the economic stakes, which is inconsistent
with optimization frictions. Instead, we show that repayments are consistent with a balance-
matching heuristic under which the share of repayments on each card is matched to the share of
balances on each card. Balance matching captures more than half of the predictable variation in
repayments and is highly persistent within individuals over time.

 1 Introduction

 Borrowing decisions underpin a broad set of economic behavior. Individuals borrow to smooth
 their consumption over the life-cycle, invest in human capital, and purchase durable goods,
 among other reasons. Thus, understanding how individuals borrow is an important input for
 many fields of economic research and is directly relevant for consumer financial policy.
        In this paper, we examine competing models of how individuals make debt payments –
 and thus implicitly how to borrow – across their portfolio of credit cards. We have a dataset
 with rich information on credit card contract terms, monthly statements, and repayments for
 1.4 million individuals in the United Kingdom over a two-year period. Unlike other leading
 credit card datasets, our data allows us to link together multiple credit card accounts held by
 the same individual.1 We study how individuals choose to allocate repayments across their
 credit cards, holding the total repayment in each month fixed.2
        The credit card repayment decision is an ideal laboratory for studying borrowing because
 behavior that minimizes interest charges – what we refer to as optimal behavior – can be clearly
 defined. Consider individuals with debt on exactly two cards: holding the total amount repaid
 fixed, it is optimal for these individuals to make the minimum payment on both cards, repay as
 much as possible on the high interest rate card, and only allocate further payments to the low
 interest rate card if they are able to pay off the high interest rate card in full. What sets the credit
 card repayment decision apart from many other financial decisions is that optimal behavior
 does not depend on preferences, such as risk preferences or time preferences.3 This allows us
 to evaluate models of behavior without having to jointly estimate preference parameters.
1 For  instance, neither the OCC’s Consumer Credit Panel nor the CFPB’s Credit Card Database are designed to
  permit linking of accounts held by the same individual. The credit bureau datasets that combine information from
  multiple accounts held by the same individual do not have information on interest rates or repayments. There are
  a number of opt-in panels such as the Mint.com data and Lightspeed Research’s “Ultimate Consumer Panel” that
  have information on multiple cards, but only for a self-selected sample of individuals.
2 This type of allocative decision is common. In the U.K. market that we study, 46.1% of credit card holders have two

  or more cards, and this group accounts for 72.2% of outstanding balances (FCA, 2016). In the U.S. market, 71.5% of
  credit card holders have two or more cards, and this group accounts for 91.8% of balances (authors’ calculations
  using a representative sample of 2015 TransUnion credit bureau data).
3 For example, optimal mortgage choices depend on risk preferences (in the decision to use an adjustable or fixed

  rate mortgage) and time preferences over the real option to refinance in the future (see, Campbell and Cocco,
  2003). There are very few institutional settings in which optimal mortgage choices can be clearly defined, such as
  in the Danish mortgage market (see, Andersen et al., 2017). The optimal credit card spending allocation depends on
  rewards programs, such as cash-back or airline points. Even when the terms of the rewards program are known,
  the optimal spending allocation depends on individuals’ (idiosyncratic) value of features.


                                                          2
        The first part of the paper documents that individuals do not optimally allocate their
 payments across cards. Our baseline analysis focuses on individuals who hold exactly two cards
 in our dataset. For these individuals, the average difference in Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
 between the high and low interest rate cards is 6.3 percentage points, approximately one-third
 of the average 19.7% APR in our sample. If these individuals were completely unresponsive
 to interest rates, it is natural to assume that they would allocate 50.0% of their payments
 to each card on average. To minimize interest charges, we calculate that individuals should
 allocate 97.1% of the payments in excess of the minimum to the high APR card.4 We show that
 individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is
 virtually indistinguishable from the completely non-responsive baseline. In other words, 85%
 of individuals should put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card but only
 10% do so.5
        This finding of non-optimal repayments closely matches prior research by Ponce et al.
 (2017) on credit card borrowing in Mexico. In particular, the most comparable result is that the
 share of payments in excess of the minimum misallocated to the high APR card is 50% among
 Mexican credit card holders and 46% among U.K. credit card holders. A possible explanation
 for the non-optimal repayments was that Mexican borrowers may not have had enough
 experience with credit cards, or enough financial sophistication, compared to borrowers in
 highly-developed countries. The results in our paper show, to the contrary, the same degree
 of non-optimal repayments even in the U.K., providing a striking example of uniformity of a
 behavioral bias across very different cultures and financial settings.6
        The second part of the paper examines whether optimization frictions can explain the
 observed repayment behavior. In optimal inattention models, individuals face a fixed cost of
 optimization – such as the time, psychological, or cognitive costs associated with determining
 the optimal repayment allocation (Sims, 2003). Because of this fixed cost, these models predict

4 The  number is not exactly 100% because sometimes individuals can pay off the full balance by allocating a smaller
  amount, in which case they should allocate the remaining amount to the low interest rate card.
5 In Section 3, we show that this result extends to the samples where we observe individuals allocating repayments

  across 3, 4, and 5 cards.
6 The U.K. has a long history and high rate of credit card use. Credit cards were introduced in the U.K. in 1966,

  making it the second country after the U.S. to adopt credit cards. The share of adults with a credit card is 60% in
  the UK (UK Cards Association, 2017) relative to 9.5% in Mexico (BBVA, 2015).


                                                          3
 that the degree of misallocation should be decreasing in the financial stakes of the repayment
 decision. We show, however, that the share of misallocated repayments is invariant to the
 difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size
 of the repayment amount (which can be as high as £800 in a month), as well as a combined
 measure of the “financial stakes” of the repayment decision. We also show that the degree of
 misallocation is invariant to the time since account opening, suggesting that a learning model
 cannot explain observed behavior.7
       The third part of the paper considers a number of different heuristics that might better
 explain repayment behavior. We consider a balance-matching heuristic under which the share
 of repayments on each card is matched to the share of balances on each card. Balance matching
 could arise from the salient placement of balances on credit card statements and the broad
 tendency for humans, and other species, to engage in “matching behavior” in related choice
 environments. Balance matching could also arise from individuals repaying a constant percent-
 age of the balance on each card in a given month, a rule-of-thumb that would lead to inefficient
 behavior on both the allocative and extensive margins. We also consider five alternative heuris-
 tics, including a “1/N” heuristic (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001), in which payments are split evenly
 across cards, and the “debt snowball method,” in which payments are concentrated on the card
 with the lowest balance, as recommended by some financial advisors.8
       We assess the explanatory power of these different repayment models using standard
 measures of goodness-of-fit (root mean square error, mean absolute error, Pearson’s ρ). To
 provide a lower benchmark, we calculate goodness-of-fit under the assumption that the per-
 centage of repayments on the high APR card is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution
 with support on the 0% to 100% interval. To provide an upper benchmark, we use machine
 learning techniques to find the repayment model that maximizes out-of-sample fit using a rich
 set of explanatory variables.
       We find that balance matching captures more than half of the “predictable variation” in


7 Misallocation is similarly invariant to the number of days between payment dates, suggesting that frictions in
  coordinating repayments across cards with different due dates cannot explain repayment behavior.

  Lahey (2015) for experimental studies that investigate this hypothesis.


                                                       4
 repayment behavior. That is, based on the range determined by the lower benchmark of random
 repayments and the upper benchmark of the machine learning models, we find that balance
 matching is closer to the upper benchmark on all of our measures. We also show that the
 optimal repayment rule and the other heuristic models do not come close to balance matching
 in their ability to match the data, capturing less than a quarter of the predictable variation for
 most measures.9 In sensitivity analysis, we show that our results are robust to two potential
 threats to validity. First, we show that our results are not explained by anchoring on minimum
 payments (Keys and Wang, 2018; Navarro-Martinez et al., 2011; Stewart, 2009). Second, we
 show that our results are not driven by individuals using automatic payments (“autopay”),
 which is rarely used in our baseline sample.
       We also evaluate each of our models in “horse race” type analysis where we determine the
 best fit model on an individual × month basis. In binary tests, balance matching has the best fit
 for twice as many observations as either the random, optimal, or other heuristics models. In
 specifications where we allow for multiple types, balance matching is the best fit model for
 roughly half of the observations in our sample. We also show that balance matching exhibits
 a high degree of persistence within individuals over time, suggesting that balance matching
 is more than a good statistical model but is actually capturing a stable feature of individual
 decision-making.
       In addition to providing us with an upper benchmark, the machine learning models allow
 us to assess the relative importance of interest rates versus balances in predicting repayment
 behavior. Consistent with the poor fit of the optimal repayment rule, we find that interest rates
 have low variable importance (i.e., proportional increase in R 2 ) in our machine learning models.
 Consistent with the balance matching results, we find that balances have the highest variable
 importance, with variable importance substantially larger than any of the other explanatory
 variables. Unlike some other machine learning applications (e.g., Mullianathan and Spiess,
 2017), these results are robust across partitions of the data.
       Our findings are related to a number of strands of research. The finding of non-optimal
 repayments is closely related to the aforementioned Ponce et al. (2017) study on credit card

9 The one exception is the 1/N
                            heuristic, which captures some behavior exactly, and has a comparable goodness-of-fit
 with the root mean square error metric.

  borrowing in Mexico, and more broadly related to a larger literature on non-optimal behavior
  in consumer financial markets (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2009; Keys et al., 2016; Jorring, 2018).10
         Our investigation of optimal inattention models contributes to active literature on the
  explanatory power of these frameworks. For instance, consistent with our findings, Chetty
  et al. (2014) show that individuals in Denmark are inattentive in their pension contributions
  regardless of the economic stakes, pushing against models of optimal inattention. In contrast,
  in online experiments, Taubinsky et al. (2018) find sharp evidence that attention to taxes is
  increasing in tax rates, supporting these models. While we do not believe there is a single
  correct model for behavior, our results suggest that in the credit card repayment domain,
  optimal inattention models have little explanatory power.
         The balance matching result relates to a well-established literature in psychology on
  matching behavior. In a seminal paper, Herrnstein (1961) showed that pigeons peck keys for
  food in proportion to the time it takes for the keys to rearm rather than concentrating their effort
  on the key that rearms most quickly. This behavior, which became known as the “matching law,”
  has since been documented across a number of species. More recently, a large experimental
  literature has shown evidence of “probability matching” in repeated choice experiments. For
  instance, when faced with repeated choices between a gamble with a 70% chance of winning
  and one with a 30% chance of winning, subjects choose gambles in proportion to the chances
  of winning, even though choosing the gamble with the higher payoff is a dominant strategy
  (see Vulkan, 2000 for a review). We discuss this literature, and our relation to it, in more depth
  in Section 5. To the best of our knowledge, our paper provides the first evidence of matching in
  the field.11
         The caveats to our analysis largely stem from the fact that we focus on the allocative
  decision of how individuals split repayments across their portfolio of credit cards. While this
  decision greatly simplifies the analysis, our estimates of the degree of non-optimal behavior
  should be interpreted as lower bounds relative to a counterfactual in which individuals could
  additionally reallocate payments across non-credit card loans (such as mortgages or automobile

10 Our  paper is more broadly related to a literature that examines how credit card utilization responds to changes
   in contract terms and shocks to income (e.g., Gross and Souleles, 2002; Olafsson and Pagel, 2018; Agarwal et al.,
   2018).

  loans) or make adjustments on the extensive margin (e.g., by adjusting the tradeoff between
  debt repayment and consumption). As we mention above, our focus on the allocative decision
  also naturally leads us to consider “allocative heuristics,” such as balance matching, rather than
  heuristics that determine behavior on the extensive margin (repaying a fixed percentage of the
  balances).
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data and presents
  summary statistics for our baseline sample. Section 3 presents our results on the optimality
  of repayment behavior. Section 4 tests whether optimal inattention and learning can fit the
  observed behavior. Section 5 lays out alternative heuristics for debt repayment, including
  the balance-matching heuristic. Section 6 tests between these repayment models. Section 7
  discusses the implications of these results for the industrial organization of credit card markets
  and public policy. Section 8 concludes.


  2 Data

  2.1 Argus Credit Card Data

  Our data source is the Argus Information and Advisory Services’ “Credit Card Payments Study”
 (CCPS). The CCPS has detailed information on contract terms and billing records from five
  major credit card issuers in the U.K. These issuers have a combined market share of over 40%
  and represent a broad range of credit card products and market segments. We have obtained
  monthly data covering January 2013 to December 2014 for a 10% representative sample of
  individuals in the CCPS who held a credit card with at least one of the five issuers. Unlike other
  leading credit card datasets, the CCPS provides us with anonymized individual-level identifiers
  that allow us to link together multiple accounts held by the same individual (see Footnote 1).12


  2.2 Sample Restrictions

  Our interest lies in understanding how individuals make repayment decisions across their
  portfolio of credit cards. Holding multiple cards is not uncommon. In the U.K. market, 46.1% of
12 While we do not have data that would allow us to comprehensively examine the representativeness of the CCPS
  data, the distribution of interest rates in the CCPS is very similar to the aggregate distribution reported in UK
  Cards (2013), suggesting that the CCPS is roughly representative of the entire market.

                                                         7
  credit card holders have two or more cards, and individuals with two or more cards account
  for 72.2% of outstanding balances (FCA, 2016).13
       Our unit of analysis is the individual × month. In the remainder of the paper, we refer
  to individual × months interchangeably as “observations.” All of the credit cards in our data
  require payments at a monthly frequency. We consider cards to be in the same “month” if their
  billing cycles conclude in the same calendar month. Since billing cycles often conclude near the
  end of the calendar month, payment dates are often quite near to each other.14 We construct
  separate samples based on the number of credit cards held by the individual in that month in
  our dataset (e.g., two cards, three cards, and so on). This is a weak lower bound on the number
  of cards held by the individual. In the analysis that follows, we typically start by presenting our
  methodology and results for the two-card sample, and then examine how our findings extend
  to individuals with three or more cards.
       We implement our sample restrictions at the individual × month level, excluding months
  that do not satisfy our restrictions, but otherwise keeping these individuals in our sample. To
  focus on repayment decisions, we drop observations where individuals are delinquent or have
  defaulted on at least one card in their portfolio, or where individuals pay less than the minimum
  due or more than the full balance on at least one card.15 Together, these restrictions drop 2.0%
  of individuals and 4.2% of aggregate revolving debt from the two-card sample. Second, we focus
  on observations in which individuals hold debt on all of their cards – i.e., they are carrying
 “revolving” balances. This ensures that allocating repayments towards the high APR card, in




13 These  numbers are even higher in the U.S. market. Using a representative sample of 2015 TransUnion data, we
   calculate that 71.5% of credit cards holders have two or more cards, and individuals with two or more cards
   account for 91.8% of balances and 91.7% of revolving balances.
14 In the two-card sample, two-thirds of observations have payment dates that are 10 days apart or fewer. See

   Figure A4 for a histogram of the difference in due dates between cards.
15 Paying less than the minimum or more than full balance sometimes results from “mistakes” that are difficult to

   interpret with an allocative model of behavior. For instance, zero payments sometimes result from “forgetting”
   to put a check in the mail. Similarly, overpayments sometimes result from refunds that are processed after the
   individual decides on their payment, which reduce the balance below the payment amount.


                                                        8
  the manner described in Section 3, minimizes interest charges.16,17 These restrictions remove a
  further 25% of individuals from the two-card sample. However, since most of these individuals
  do not have revolving debt – i.e., they are “transactors” who repay the balances in full each
  month – we only drop 12.7% of aggregate revolving debt.
        Third, we make a number of sample restrictions so that we focus on observations where
  individuals, holding fixed total monthly repayments, have scope to reallocate payments across
  cards and therefore face an economically meaningful allocative decision. In particular, we drop
  a small number of observations where the interest rate is identical across cards, since any
  reallocation of payments has no impact on the cost of borrowing. We then drop observations
  where the individual pays either the full balance or the minimum payment on all of their cards,
  since these individuals do not have any payments to reallocate. Taken together, this third set of
  restrictions drops an additional 35.4% of individuals and 24.9% of aggregate revolving debt in
  the two-card sample. Appendix Table A1 goes through the third set of restrictions one-by-one.
  Most of the reduction is due to dropping individuals who pay exactly the minimum on each
  card.
        Table 1 presents summary statistics on the baseline two-card sample. The average difference
  in APR (for purchases) between the high and low interest rate cards is 6.3 percentage points,
  or approximately one-third of the 19.7% average purchase APR in the sample.18 Yet despite
  this substantial difference in prices, utilization is remarkably similar. Purchases are £128 on
  the high APR card versus £117 on the low APR card; repayments are £260 on the high APR
  card versus £230 on the low APR card; and revolving balances are £2,200 on the high APR

16 A  (complicated) feature of credit cards is that if an individual carries no revolving balance at the beginning of
   the month, and repays the balance in full, they avoid any interest charges that month. If an individual carries a
   revolving balance at the beginning of the month, interest charges are incurred on average daily balance irrespective
   of whether the card is repaid in full. We focus on individuals who begin the month with revolving balances on all
   cards as it is unambiguously interest-cost-minimizing for these individuals to allocate repayments towards the
   high APR card. In other scenarios, it could be interest-cost-minimizing to allocate repayments towards the low
   APR (although our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest this is unlikely).
17 One consequence of this restriction is that we omit individuals who have two cards but hold revolving balances

   on only one card. In doing so, one potential concern is that we drop individuals who have “fully optimized” by
   completely paying off their high interest rate card. If this were the case, then our sample would be selected on
   individuals who failed to optimize, raising issues of external validity. However, among individuals who carry debt
   on only one card, the majority (61.8%) carry debt on only the high interest rate card, indicating that our sample is
   not selected in this manner.
18 This difference does reflect short-term 0% promotional interest rate offers, which account for less than 5% of

   account × month observations in the baseline sample.

  card versus £2,054 on the low APR card. This is particularly striking given that credit limits
  are almost three times larger than revolving balances on average, indicating that the typical
  individual would be able to shift all of their borrowing to the low APR card without exceeding
  their credit limit.


  3 Optimal Repayments

  In this section, we compare actual and interest-cost-minimizing allocation of repayments across
  cards. We refer to the interest-cost-minimizing allocation as the “optimal” allocation because
  it is hard to think of a (reasonable) scenario where minimizing interest costs would not be
  optimal. Holding the total repayment amount on all cards fixed, it is optimal for individuals to
  make the minimum required payment on all of their cards, repay as much as possible on the
  card with the highest interest rate, and only allocate further payments to the lower interest
  rate cards if they are able to pay off the highest interest rate card in full.19
        We focus on repayments, rather than other measures of credit card use like spending or
  revolving balances, because, for repayments, we can clearly define optimal behavior. In contrast,
  optimal spending may depend upon rewards programs, which we do not observe in our data.20
  We also do not focus on the optimality of revolving balance allocations because revolving
  balances are a “stock” that cannot typically be quickly adjusted.21 Thus, to determine whether
  revolving balances are “optimal,” we would need to take a stand on how individuals could
  reallocate revolving balances through counterfactual spending and repayment decisions over
  time, which would require us to know the individuals’ time preference and their expectations
  over future spending and repayment decisions.
        Panel A of Figure 1 plots the distribution of actual and optimal payments in the baseline
  two-card sample. The distribution of actual repayments appears close to symmetric, with a mass

19 We  explicitly rule out the possibility that choosing not to make the minimum payment on a lower interest rate
   card could be optimal. Failing to repay the minimum repayment would result in a penalty fee and a marker on the
   individual’s credit file.
20 While issuers typically incur only a small cost for the rewards they provide – approximately 1%, see Agarwal et al.

   (2015) – individuals might value rewards (such as airline points) at a high enough value to affect optimal spending
   decisions.
21 In particular, with the exception of balance transfer products in the prime credit card market, individuals can only

   reallocate their stock of revolving balances by adjusting the flow of spending and repayments on a month-by-month
   basis.

  point at 50%, and smaller mass points at 33% and 67%. In contrast, the distribution of optimal
  repayments is heavily weighted towards the high APR card. It is not optimal for individuals to
  place 100% of their payments on the high interest rate card because (ii) they need to pay the
  minimum on the low interest rate card and (ii) they are sometimes able to pay off more than
  the full balance on the high interest rate card.
         Summary data for actual and optimal repayments for the two-card sample is shown in
  Table 2. On average, individuals should allocate 70.7% of repayments to the high APR card. If
  individuals were completely unresponsive to interest rates, we might expect them to place 50%
  of payments on the high interest rate card. On average, individuals allocate 51.2% to the high
  interest rate card, which is very close to the completely non-responsive baseline. Individuals,
  thus, misallocate 19.5% of their total monthly payment on average.
         In Appendix Figure A1 we plot misallocated repayments in excess of the minimum payment.
  That is, we subtract out the amount required to make the minimum payment on each card and
  then calculate the share of the remaining amount that is allocated across cards. On average,
  individuals should allocate 97.1% of payments in excess of the minimum to the high APR card,
  whereas in practice they actually allocate 51.5% to that card.22 Alternatively put, over 90% of
  individuals should put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card but fewer
  than 10% do so. Summary data for payments in excess of minimum are shown in Appendix
  Table A2.
         Panels B to D of Figure 1 show radar plots of the average percentage of actual and optimal
  payments on each card for the samples with 3, 4, and 5 cards. In each of the plots, the cards are
  ordered clockwise from the highest to the lowest APR (starting at the first node clockwise from
 “noon”). The polygons for actual payments are symmetric, indicating that the actual percentage
  of payments is very similar across cards. The polygons for optimal payments show that it
  would be optimal to allocate a substantially higher percentage of payments to the highest APR
  card and a substantially lower percentage to the card with the lowest APR.
         As we mention in the introduction, these findings on misallocation are strikingly similar
  to those documented by Ponce et al. (2017) using a sample of Mexican credit card holders. In

22 The
     number is not exactly 100% because sometimes individuals can pay off the full balance by allocating a smaller
  amount, in which case they should allocate the remaining amount to the low interest rate card.


                                                        11
particular, the most comparable result is that the share of payments in excess of the minimum
misallocated to the high APR card is 50% among Mexican credit card holders and 46% among
UK credit card holders. This remarkable similarity shows that misallocation among Mexican
credit card holders is not due to their relatively limited experience with credit cards; in the UK
market penetration is 66% and cards have been available since 1966.


3.1 Costs of Misallocation

What are the costs of the failure to optimize? Our baseline approach is to consider the annualized
interest savings from a counterfactual “steady state” where individuals optimize balances across
the credit cards we observe in our data, subject to the constraint of not exceeding their credit
limits. For the two card sample, we construct the optimal allocation by transferring balances
from the high to the low interest rate card up to the point where the individual “maxes out” their
low interest rate card. With multiple cards, we construct the optimal allocation by allocating as
much of the aggregate balance as possible to the credit card with the lowest interest rate, then
allocating any remaining balance to the card with the next lowest rate, and so on. The interest
savings from this exercise can be thought of as the interest savings that could be achieved if
the individual was immediately and costlessly able to conduct the optimal “balance transfer” of
balances across cards.
     Panel B of Table 2 presents the annualized interest savings from this exercise. Average
interest savings are increasing across the number of cards, rising from £65 in the two-card
sample to £248 in the five-card sample. Because the degree of misallocation is not declining in
the economic stakes of the decision, individuals with larger balances and larger differences in
interest rates have a substantial cost of misallocation, with the 90th percentile rising from £167
in the two-card sample to £927 in the five-card sample.
     In Appendix B, we present two additional sets of results on the cost of misallocation,
focusing on the two card sample to keep the analysis trackable. First, we repeat the interest
savings calculations above for cards that were excluded by our sample restrictions. For some
excluded observations, such as those with no revolving balances, the interest savings are
zero. For others, such as observations where individuals pay the minimum on both cards,



                                               12
the counterfactual steady state yields interest savings. Total savings, which combine positive
savings for borrowers and zero savings for non-borrowers, are roughly one-third those in the
baseline sample.
     Second, we consider an alternative approach to calculating the cost of misallocation where
counterfactual interest costs are determined by simulating forward outcomes when individuals
optimally repay their credit cards over time. This simulation is supposed to measure the gains
from “learning” the optimal repayment rule, which the individual can then implement over
time and incrementally shift their balances across cards. While interest savings are small at
first, we show that over a 12 month time horizon, the interest savings from this incremental
approach is quite similar to the interest savings from our baseline steady state counterfactual.
     There are a number of caveats to these calculations. Since our sample covers approximately
40% of the market, we likely only observe a subset of an individuals’ credit card portfolio.
Allowing individuals to optimize over more cards would necessarily lead to a larger cost of
misallocation. And of course, allowing individuals to optimize across different types of debt or
across savings and borrowing products would lead to even larger values.


4 Optimization Frictions

In this section, we examine whether optimization frictions can explain repayment behavior. We
start by examining the evidence for optimal inattention models and then turn to the evidence
for models of learning.


4.1 Optimal Inattention

In optimal inattention models, individuals face a fixed cost of optimization and only “optimize”
if the benefits from doing so are greater than this fixed cost (Sims, 2003). Specifically, in our
context, individuals are already making positive credit card repayments on all of their cards and
therefore already paying the fixed cost of logging into their bank’s website or sending a check.
So by a fixed cost of optimization, we having in mind the time, psychological, or cognitive
costs associated with making the optimal repayment relative to making a non-optimal payment




                                               13
  amount.23 For some individuals, the reduction in interest payments from cost-minimizing may
  be too low to rationalize incurring this fixed cost.
          To investigate this potential explanation, we examine the correlation between the per-
  centage of misallocated repayments and the economic stakes of the repayment decision in
  the two-card sample. We define misallocated payments as the difference between optimal and
  actual payments on the high APR card. We examine three measures of the economic stakes:
  (i) the difference in APR across cards, (ii) the total repayment made that month, and (iii) the
 “financial stakes” of the repayment decision, which is defined as the product of the difference
  in APR across cards and the total repayment made that month – and thereby captures the
  annualized financial stakes from the repayment decision. Since the gains from optimizing
  are increasing in each of these measures, under the fixed cost explanation, the percentage of
  misallocated repayments should be declining in these three measures. Moreover, for individuals
  with large economics stakes, we would expect the degree of misallocation to be close to zero.24
          Panel A of Figure 2 shows a binned-scatter plot of the percentage of misallocated payments
  against the difference in APR between the high and low interest rate cards.25 The flat relationship
  indicates that individuals are not less likely to misallocate repayments even when there is a large
  APR difference (more than 15 percentage points). Panel B of Figure 2 shows a binned-scatter
  plot of the percentage of misallocated payments against total repayments on both cards. Again,
  there is no evidence of a decreasing relationship. Indeed, the relationship is increasing because
  individuals who make the largest payments can cover the minimum on the low APR card
  with a smaller percentage of their overall allocation and thus should allocate an even larger
  fraction of payments to the high APR card. Panel C shows there is no evidence of a decreasing
  relationship between the percentage of misallocated payments and the financial stakes. The

23 This  contrasts with optimal mortgage refinancing (e.g., Keys et al., 2016), a setting where optimization would
   require actively soliciting a new mortgage offer.
24 These measures of economics stakes are not randomly assigned. However, it is important to note that the lack of

   random assignment is only a threat to “external validity” and not to “identification”. Specifically, the fact that
   there are some individuals who do not optimize despite large incentives to do so implies that there are some
   individuals whose behavior cannot be rationalized by an inattention model. What requires a stronger assumption
   is to infer from this pattern that even individuals with small gains from optimization would still not optimize if
   they faced large incentives to do so.
25 The binned-scatter plot is constructed by partitioning the x-axis variable into 20 equal-sized groups and plotting

   the mean of the y-axis and x-axis variables for each group. See Chetty et al. (2014) for more details on the
   binned-scatter plot methodology.


                                                          14
  relationship is slightly increasing for the same reason as the relationship with total payments.
  Table 3 presents summary statistics on actual, optimal and misallocated payments by quintiles
  of these measures of economics stakes.26


  4.2 Learning

 An alternative explanation for the observed non-optimal behavior is that individuals learn over
  time (e.g., since opening a card) and that our analysis of the cross-sectional distribution of
  repayments masks this learning behavior. A model with time-varying adjustment costs (in the
  spirit of Calvo, 1983) would also generate a gradual reduction in the degree of misallocation
  over time.
       Panel A of Figure 3 examines this explanation by showing a binned-scatter plot of the
  percentage of misallocated payments against the age (in months) of the high APR card. For
  this analysis, we restrict the sample to individuals who open a high APR during our sample
  period and for whom we can observe economically meaningful allocation decisions for 10
  consecutive months. In the plot, the horizontal axis starts in the second month after opening,
  since this is the first month in which individuals could have a balance on the high APR card to
  repay. The plot shows no evidence of a reduction in the percentage of misallocated repayments
  over time.27 This finding suggests that neither learning nor time-varying adjustment costs can
  explain the observed non-optimizing behavior.
       A related explanation is that individuals have difficulty optimizing repayments across
  cards when the due dates are far apart in time. From a cognitive perspective, individuals may be
  less likely to process credit card repayments as a joint decision when the due dates are far apart.
  From a budgetary perspective, individuals may face within-month liquidity constraints that
  prevent them from optimally reallocating payments. For example, individuals might receive
  their paycheck between credit card due dates, and therefore have different amounts of cash-on-
  hand when making their payments. Panel B of Figure 3 examines this explanation by showing
  a binned-scatter plot of the percentage of misallocated payments against the difference in

26 Appendix  Figure A2 and Appendix Table A4 present the analogous results for misallocated payments in excess of
   the minimum payment.
27 Table 3 shows that summary statistics that correspond to this figure. Appendix Figure A3 and Appendix Table A4

   present the analogous results for misallocated payments in excess of the minimum payment.


                                                        15
  payment due dates.28 The flat relationship indicates that these type of within-month allocation
  frictions cannot explain our result.
           While it would be tempting to go beyond this simple analysis and try to quantify the fixed
  costs required to rationalize observed repayment behavior, doing so would require making
  strong, untestable assumptions. In particular, a key decision is whether to model optimization
  frictions as a fixed cost that needs to be paid every period (e.g., a transaction cost of adjusting
  repayments) or as a fixed cost that only needs to be paid once (e.g., a one-time cognitive cost of
  learning the optimal repayment rule). The estimated fixed costs would largely be determined
  by this modeling decision. If we assumed there was a period-by-period fixed cost, repayment
  behavior could be rationalized by modest optimization frictions. If, instead, we assumed there
  was a one-time fixed cost, the benefits of learning the optimal rule could be as large as the
  discounted sum of interest savings from optimal credit card payments over the life cycle, which
  would imply a very large fixed cost of adjustment. Since that data do not provide us with
  guidance on the appropriate modeling assumption, we are hesitant to undertake this exercise.


  5 Heuristics

  If individuals do not allocate their payments in an optimal – or constrained optimal – manner,
  what explains credit card repayments? In the remainder of this paper, we evaluate heuristics
  that might better explain the allocation of repayments. In this section, we introduce the set of
  heuristics that we consider. In Section 6, we evaluate the explanatory power of these heuristics.


  5.1 Balance Matching

  We first consider a balance-matching heuristic under which individuals match the share of
  repayments on each card to the share of balances on each card. Let k = 1 . . . K index cards, pk
  indicate payments, and qk indicate balances. Balance-matching payments are given by

                                   pk           qk
                                 ÍK         = ÍK             for k = 1 . . . K                            (1)
                                   κ=1 pκ      κ=1 qκ


28 Table
       3 shows the summary statistics that correspond to this figure. Appendix Figure A3 and Appendix Table A4
  present the analogous results for misallocated payments in excess of the minimum payment.


                                                        16
  subject to the constraint that the individual pays at least the minimum and no more than the
  full balance on any of their cards.29
        Repayments consistent with balance matching could arise from the salient placement of
  balances on credit card statements and the broad tendency for human (and other species) to
  engage in “matching behavior” in related choice environments. As shown in Appendix Figure A5,
  balances are perhaps the most prominently displayed element on credit card statements. The
  psychological theory of anchoring (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) suggests that individuals
  might make payments in relation to saliently displayed balances (instead of less saliently
  displayed interest rates).30,31
        The literature on matching behavior traces back to Herrnstein (1961), who showed that
  pigeons peck keys for food in proportion to the time it takes the keys to rearm rather than
  concentrating their effort on the key that rearms most quickly. Follow-up studies replicated
  Herrnstein’s “matching law” among pigeons (Miller, 1976; Baum, 1974) and documented similar
  behavior among rats (Jacquet, 1972), fish (Behrend and Bitterman, 1961), and humans when
  undertaking more complex tasks (e.g., Skinner et al., 1996). Writing at the time, Arrow (1958)
  noted that these results challenged conventional economic models of behavior.32
        Matching behavior has perhaps been most widely documented among humans in repeated
  lottery choice experiments. In a typical study, subjects are asked to make repeated choices
  between, say, a gamble with a 70% probability of winning and one with a 30% probability
  of winning. In behavior known as “probability matching,” subjects consistently place bets in
  proportion to the probabilities of winning, even though betting on the option with the highest
  probability first-order stochastically dominants any other decision. The most well-known

29 In the two-card sample, only 13.0% of observations are affected by these constraints. In nearly all of these cases,
   the balance-matching payment is less than 2 percentage points below the minimum payment amount. Treating
   these observations in other ways (e.g., dropping these observations) does not have a material impact on the results.
30 A second reason why balances may be more salient is that balances are denoted in the same units as repayments

   (£s), whereas APR take on different units (%).
31 Balances also enter the minimum payment formula. Therefore, at least in principle, repayments might depend on

   balances indirectly through the minimum payment amount. We discuss this issue in Appendix C and show that
   this channel does not explain our results.
32 “We have here an experimental situation which is essentially of an economic nature in the sense of seeking to

   achieve a maximum of expected reward, and yet the individual does not in fact, at any point, even in a limit, reach
   the optimal behavior. I suggest that this result points out strongly the importance of learning theory, not only in
   the greater understanding of the dynamics of economic behavior, but even in suggesting that equilibria maybe be
   different from those that we have predicted in our usual theory.” Arrow (1958) p.14.


                                                           17
  papers in the literature are Rubinstein (2002), Gal (1996) and Loomes (1998). See Vulkan (2000)
  for a review paper that documents probability matching, and its limitations, across 22 repeated
  lottery experiments.
        Of course, we do not propose balance matching as a precise description of individual
  repayment behavior. Pigeons do not measure the time it takes the keys to rearm with a stopwatch
  and we do not mean to suggest that individuals use long division to calculate the share of
  repayments that should be allocated to each card. Instead, we propose that individuals use
  balance matching as an “anchor” for their repayment behavior (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974).
  Indeed, since credit card balances are fairly stable over time, an individual could approximate a
  balance-matching rule without knowing the exact balance on each card that month.33
        Finally, as we mention in the introduction, repayments consistent with balance matching
  could arise from individuals repaying a constant percentage of the balance on each card in a
  given month. If this percentage changes within individuals over time (e.g., 10% in January, 15%
  in February, etc.) it would be difficult to distinguish a constant percentage model from a balance
  matching model. If this percentage is fixed within individuals over time, we could distinguish
  between these models using random time-series variation in balances. Unfortunately, we do
  not have random time-series variation in balances, and the observed variation is likely to be
  driven by factors that also affect repayment decisions.


  5.2 1/N Rule

  The spike in repayments at 50% (see Panel A of Figure 1) suggests that some individuals use a
  simple 1/N heuristic in which they make equal-sized repayments across cards, analogous to
  the 1/N heuristic documented in defined-contribution savings decisions (Benartzi and Thaler,
  2001). In particular, the excess mass of individuals who make payments at a one-to-one ratio is
  approximately 8.2%. If we add in the excess mass at one-to-two and two-to-one ratios, we can
  explain 11.7% of repayments.34

33 Ponce  et al. (2017) show that there is a positive correlation between the share of payments towards cards and
   the share of debt held on cards, suggesting an approximate balance-matching rule may be at work among their
   sample of Mexican cardholders.
34 By excess mass, we are using the terminology that Saez (2010) and Chetty et al. (2011) use to describe bunching in

   response to kinked tax schedules. In our context, the excess mass is the area in excess of what is predicted by a
   linear extrapolation between points on the histogram just to the left and the right of the 1/N values.


                                                          18
         While it would be nice to conclude that 11.7% of individuals repay according to a 1/N
  rule, there are a number of factors which suggest a more nuanced interpretation of the data.
  First, the 1/N rule could be interpreted as an anchor that individuals do not implement exactly.
  For example, an individual who pays £250 on card A and £225 on card B might be intending
  to split repayments. To account for this possibility, we will measure the performance of the
  1/N heuristic in our goodness of fit analysis below. This analysis will gauge how well the 1/N
  heuristic fits the data, even when it does not fit behavior exactly.
         A second nuance arises from the fact that 1/N behavior is disproportionally concentrated
  amount individuals who “round” their payments to £50, £100, £200, and so on. If an individual
  rounds up a payment on card A from £80 to £100 and rounds down a payment on card B from
  £120 to £100, then the individual would appear as if they intended to make equal-sized payments,
  even though, absent rounding, the share of payments on each card would be substantially
  different from 50%.
         Figure 4 investigates this competing explanation for the spike at 50%. Panel A plots the
  distribution of payments on the high APR card in pounds, and shows substantial evidence of
  rounding. We calculate that 19.2% of payments take on values that are multiples of £100, and
  33% of payments take on values that are multiples of £50 (which obviously includes payments
  that are multiples of £100). Panels B and C show the percentage of payments on the high APR
  card, splitting the sample by whether the individual makes round number payments (defined
  as multiples of £50) or “non-round” number payments on the high APR card.35
         The plots show that the peaks at 50% (as well as 33% and 66%) are heavily concentrated
  among individuals who make round number repayments. In the non-round sample, there is
  only a small spike at 50%, and no discernible spike at 33% or 66%. Thus, at the extreme, we
  cannot reject the view that nearly all of the spike at 50% is due to rounding. However, since
  we do not have random variation in whether individuals round, we cannot rule out the other
  extreme that all of these individuals would have allocated 50% on the high APR card if they

35 Thepropensity to make round number payments is highly correlated across cards within an individual × month.
  We calculate that 73% of individuals who make a round number payment on the high APR card also make a round
  number payment on the low APR card, and 78% of individuals who make a non-round number payment on the
  high APR card also make a non-round number payment on the low APR card. Dividing the sample into individuals
  who make round number repayments on both cards, non-round number repayments on both cards, and a mix of
  round and non-round repayments complicates the exposition without changing the results.


                                                      19
had counterfactually not rounded their payments.
    Thus, the quantitative importance of 1/N depends upon what assumptions we are willing
to make. If we think 1/N is something that individuals implement exactly, then the 1/N rule
captures at most 11.7% of repayments, and possibly a lower percentage if we believe that some
of this is due to rounding. If we view 1/N as an anchor that individuals approximate, then
it is best to judge the empirical relevance of this measure in the goodness of fit analysis that
follows.


5.3 Other Heuristic Models of Repayment

We also consider four alternative heuristics that capture intuitive economic and non-economic
approaches to the allocation of payments. Some of these heuristics are based on the capacity of
a credit card, which we define as the difference between the credit limit and current balance
in pounds. We describe these heuristics for the two-card sample, but they could be naturally
extended to settings with three or more cards.
    • Heuristic 1: Repay the card with the lowest capacity. Allocate payments to the lowest
      capacity card, subject to paying the minimum on both cards. Once capacity is equalized
      across cards, allocate additional payments to both cards equally. Intuitively, by focusing
      payments on the card with the lowest capacity, this heuristic reduces the risk that an
      accidental purchase will put an individual over their credit limit, which would incur an
      over-limit fee and marker on the individual’s credit file.
    • Heuristic 2: Repay the card with the highest capacity. Allocate payments to the highest
      capacity card, subject to paying the minimum on both cards. Once the highest capacity
      card is fully repaid, allocate remaining payments to the other card. Intuitively, by allo-
      cating payments to the card with the highest capacity, this heuristic creates maximum
     “space” for making a large purchase on a single card (e.g., buying a television).
    • Heuristic 3: Repay the card with the highest balance. Allocate payments to the highest
      balance card, subject to paying the minimum on the other card. Once balances are
      equalized across cards, allocate additional payments to both cards equally. If individuals
      dislike having a credit card with a large balance, this heuristic reduces the maximum



                                               20
           balance they are carrying, and thus might explain repayment behavior.
         • Heuristic 4: Repay the card with the lowest balance (“debt snowball method”). Allocate
           payments to the lowest balance card, subject to paying the minimum on the other card.
           Once the balance on the lowest balance card is paid down to zero, allocate any additional
           payments to the other card. This heuristic is sometimes referred to as the debt snowball
           method by financial advisors. Proponents argue that paying off a card with a low balance
           generates a “win” that motivates further repayment behavior.36 If an individual fully
           pays off a card, this heuristic has the additional benefit of “simplifying” the individual’s
           debt portfolio. See also Amar et al. (2011) and Brown and Lahey (2015) for laboratory
           evidence on this approach to debt repayment.


  5.4 Interest Payments Under Different Heuristics

  How costly would it be for consumers to follow these heuristics? We calculate annualized
  interest savings for the steady state balances that would arise from each of the different heuristic
  models. For example, if consumers follow a balance matching heuristic, then the process of
  making larger payments on the card with the larger balance would cause balances to asymptote
  to a steady state with equal balances on each card.37
         Appendix Table A5 shows the distribution of annualized interest savings (compared to
  actual interest payments) under each heuristic for the two-card sample. We show the interest
  saving from optimal payment on the first row as a benchmark and omit the 1/N heuristic
  because steady state balances are unchanged and interest savings are therefore zero. All the
  heuristics have median savings close to zero, but have wide dispersion in savings or losses

36 For   example, syndicated radio host Dave Ramsey argues: “But when you ditch the small debt first, you see
   progress. That one debt is out of your life forever. Soon the second debt will follow, and then the next. These
   little wins will give you a confidence boost, you’ll see that the plan is working, and you’ll stick to it” (see
   https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/top-5-debt-snowball-questions-answered).
37 The steady state outcomes of the other heuristics are as follows. Under the 1/N heuristic, payments are equal

   across cards, and the steady state balances are unchanged relative to the status quo. Under Heuristic 1 (repay
   the card with the lowest capacity), payments are prioritized to the card with the lowest capacity, and in steady
   state capacities on the two cards are equalized, subject to credit limits. Under Heuristic 2 (repay the card with
   the highest capacity), payments are prioritized to the card with the highest capacity, and in steady state balance
   are reduced as much as possible on that card, subject to credit limits. Under Heuristic 3 (repay the card with the
   highest balance), payments are prioritized to the card with the highest balance, and in steady state the balances
   on the two cards are equalized, subject to credit limits. Under Heuristic 4 (repay the card with the lowest balance),
   payments are prioritized to the card with the lowest balance, and in steady state balance are minimized on that
   card, subject to credit limits.


                                                           21
     across observations. This wide dispersion occurs because the heuristics prioritize payments
     to cards based on balances (and credit limits), which is not systematically correlated with the
     optimal behavior of prioritizing payments toward the high APR card.


     6 Testing Repayment Models

     We evaluate balance matching and the other heuristics using two statistical approaches. First,
     we measure the distance between observed and predicted behavior using standard measures of
     goodness-of-fit (root mean square error, mean absolute error, Pearson’s ρ). The goal of this
     analysis is to find the single model that best fits the data. Second, we evaluate the performance
     of our models in “horse race” type analysis where we determine the best fit model on an
     observation-by-observation basis. We conduct binary comparisons where we compare each
     model to a single alternative, and horse races with 3 or more models, which allows us to classify
     observations into heterogenous types. We also examine the persistence of the best fit model
     within individuals over time.


     6.1 Goodness-of-Fit

     We start by presenting visual evidence on the goodness-of-fit of the balance-matching heuristic.
     Figure 5 examines fit in the two-card sample. The left column shows the marginal distributions
     of actual and balance-matching payments on the high APR card. The right column displays the
     joint distribution using a contour plot. The top row shows these relationships for the baseline
     sample and the bottom row focuses on the sample with non-round number payment amounts.
     The sample with round number payment amounts is shown in Figure A6.
          The histograms (left column) show that the marginal distributions of actual and balance-
     matching payments are quite similar, except for the spikes at 33%, 50%, and 66%. The higher
     mass along the 45 degree line in the joint densities (right column) indicates that actual and
     balance-matching payments are strongly correlated. The correlation is stronger in the non-
     round payment sample (and weaker in the round number payment sample).38

38    The weaker correlation in the round payment sample is consistent with a two-stage model in which individuals
     first decide to make balance-matching payments and then add noise to the process by rounding their repayment
     amounts. While the heaping in Panel A of Figure 4 provides clear evidence of rounding, estimating a two-stage


                                                          22
        Figure 6 examines the fit of the balance-matching model in the samples with 3, 4, and 5
  cards. The left column shows marginal distributions of the share of payments on the highest
  APR card. The right column shows radar plots of the average share of actual and balance-
  matching payments. In each of the radar plots, the cards are ordered clockwise from the highest
  to the lowest balance (starting at the first node clockwise from noon). The distribution of
  payments on the high APR card (left column) is similar to predicted payments under balance
  matching. The radar plots (right column) show that the average share of payments is fairly close
  to those predicted by balance matching, especially compared to the radar plots that examine
  optimal repayment behavior (Figure 1).
        We formally measure the performance of the balance matching and alternative models
  using three standard measures of goodness-of-fit: the square root of the mean square error
  (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation between actual and predicted pay-
  ments (Pearson’s ρ).39 To help interpret the goodness-of-fit values, we also establish lower and
  upper benchmarks. For a lower benchmark, we calculate goodness-of-fit under the assumption
  that the percentage of repayments on the high APR card is randomly drawn from a uniform
  distribution with support on the 0% to 100% interval. To provide an upper benchmark, we
  use machine learning techniques to construct a set of purely statistical models of repayment
  behavior. Specifically, we estimate decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting
  models of the percentage of payments allocated to the high APR card. We use the same set
  of variables which enter into our heuristics (APRs, balances, spending and credit limits on
  both cards) as input variables and “tune” the models to maximize out-of-sample power using
  standard methods from machine learning.40 We use 80% of the data sample as the “training”
  sample and measure out-of-sample fit on a 20% “hold-out” sample. For consistency, in the
  analysis that follows, we compare all models using the hold-out sample. Technical details are
  provided in Appendix A.


   model where individuals round in the second stage is difficult because the second stage rounding function is not
  “invertible.” That is, it is hard to know whether an individual who is paying £100 would have counterfactually paid
   £95 or £105 if they had not rounded their payment.
39 Pearson’s ρ is also the square root of the R 2 from a univariate regression of actual payments on predicted payments.
40 We view these machine learning models as “prior-free” models of repayment behavior. If we additionally include

   our candidate models (optimal, balance matching, and the other heuristics) as input variables, we obtain only
   small improvements in model fit.


                                                           23
       Figure 7 shows these measures of goodness-of-fit under the different models. (Appendix
 Table A6 shows the underlying numerical amounts with bootstrapped standard errors, con-
 structed by drawing with replacement from the hold-out sample.) The optimal model yields
 only a very small improvement in the RMSE and MAE relative to the lower benchmark. The
 optimal model does generate a meaningful increase in the Pearson correlation, although this is
 partly because the lower benchmark (uniformly distributed random amount) is constructed
 to have a Pearson correlation of 0. The other heuristics perform similarly poorly, with the
 goodness-of-fit measures generally falling less than a quarter of the way between the lower
 and upper benchmarks.41
       The goodness-of-fit measures for the balance-matching model fall slightly more than
 halfway between the lower and upper benchmarks, indicating that balance matching captures
 more than half of the “predictable variation” in repayment behavior. Appendix Figure A7
 shows goodness-of-fit separately for the round and non-round samples (defined as multiples of
 £50). The balance-matching model captures a larger fraction of the predictable variation in the
 non-round number sample, which is consistent with a two-stage model of payments discussed
 in Footnote 38.
       There are two ways to view the performance of the balance-matching model relative to
 the upper benchmark provided by the machine learning models. The glass half full view is
 that being able to capture more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior
 with a simple balance matching model is useful. Balance matching is easy to understand, has a
 psychological underpinning based on existing theories of behavior (e.g., probability matching,
 Herrnstein’s matching law), and might provide intuition for individual behavior in yet-to-be-
 studied environments. The glass half empty perspective is that machine learning techniques
 provide higher predictive power. Thus, if the goal is prediction – rather than understanding
 human behavior – machine learning techniques may be preferable.

41 Appendix Figure A8 shows the marginal distributions of actual and predicted payments under each of the
 alternative heuristics. One common feature of these alternative heuristics is that they predict that individuals
 should often concentrate their excess payments on a single card. For instance, under Heuristic 1 (repay the card
 with the lowest capacity), individuals should fully allocate repayments, in excess of the minimum, to the card
 with the lowest capacity until the point where both cards have equal capacity remaining. Individuals, however,
 seem to avoid “corner solutions” in their repayment behavior. As a result, the alternative heuristics over-predicted
 the share of individuals who allocate a very small (less 10%) or very large (greater than 90%) share of payments to
 the high APR card.


                                                         24
  6.2 Horse Races Between Alternative Models

  We next evaluate these models using “horse races” where we determine the best fit model
  on an observation-by-observation basis. A model that fits a smaller number of observations
  very poorly, but a larger number quite well, might perform poorly under the goodness-of-fit
  analysis, but would perform well under this approach.
           Our ability to identify the best-fit model on an observation-by-observation basis is due to
  the unique nature of the credit card repayment decision. As discussed in Section 1, what sets
  credit card repayments apart from many other financial decisions is that optimal behavior does
  not depend on preferences (such as risk preferences or time preferences). If preferences were
  important for optimal behavior, then conducting this type of exercise would require recovering
  preferences at the individual level, which would constitute a significant empirical challenge.
           Table 4 shows results of this horse race analysis in the pooled sample of individual ×
  months. Panel A compares each of our models one-by-one against the lower benchmark
  where the percentage of repayments on the high APR card is randomly drawn from a uniform
  distribution with support on the 0% to 100% interval. In a binary comparison, balance matching
  is the best fit model for 67.2% of observations, or about twice the percentage of the uniform
  benchmark. The optimal model and the other heuristics are the closest for slightly more than
  half of the observations, and therefore perform only slightly better than the uniform benchmark.
  The machine learning models have the best fit for between 69.0% and 76.5% of observations,
  which is similar to balance matching.42
           Panel B of Table 4 compares each of the models one-by-one to the balance-matching
  model.43 In a horse race with the optimal model, balance matching has the best fit for slightly
  more than two-thirds of observations. When compared with the other heuristic models, balance
  matching is also the best fit for approximately two-thirds of observations. Balance matching
  performs comparably to, or only a little worse than, the machine learning models, with balance
  matching exhibiting the best fit for 40.9% to 50.0% of observations.44

42 Since  the machine learning models were tuned to minimize RMSE, it is natural for these models to perform
   relatively better when evaluated using RMSE (and other distance metrics) than when evaluated using this type of
   horse race analysis.
43 We exclude a comparison of the balance-matching and the uniform model, since it was shown in Panel A.
44 In unreported analysis, we examined whether there was correlation between the best fit model and postal



                                                        25
     The binary comparisons are useful for finding the single model that fits the largest per-
centage of observations. A complementary approach is to conduct horse races with 3 or more
models, which allows us to classify observations into heterogeneous types. One challenge with
this exercise is that – simply by chance – virtually any model will have the best fit for some
observations. To be able to interpret the results as reflecting heterogeneity in types, we need
to be disciplined in choosing which models to include and to also compare the percentage of
observations fit by a given model to the uniform benchmark.
     Appendix Table A8 shows the results of this exercise. In Column 1, we compare the
optimal, 1/N , and balance matching models. These are the models that seem plausible based
on economic theory (optimal) or evidence (1/N and balance matching). In column 2, we add
the uniform benchmark to the set of models. In both specifications, balance matching has the
best fit for half of the observations. Optimal and 1/N capture slightly more than one-fifth of
observations when we do not include the uniform benchmark, but perform only marginally
better than the uniform benchmark when it is included.
     To the extent that we think of the competing models as actually representing different
models of individual decision-making, we would naturally expect the best-fit model to be
persistent within individuals over time. Table 5 shows the within-person transition matrix for
the best-fit model. The sample is restricted to individual × months where we observe repayment
behavior for at least two months in a row. For this exercise, we allow the set J to encompass all
of the candidate models, and we fix the uniformly distributed repayment to be constant within
individuals over time.
     The table shows that balance matching exhibits a high degree of persistence – both in
absolute value and relative to the other models of repayment behavior. Among individuals
whose repayments are best fit by the uniform model in a given month, 23.2% make repayments
that are closest to the uniform model in the next month. This persistence likely reflects the
fact that balances and repayments are sticky over time: If the uniform model happens to be
accurate in a given month, and balances and payments are sticky, then the uniform model,

code characteristics (such as postal code income and education). We were unable to detect any economically
or statistically significant correlations. However, we caution against drawing too strong conclusions about
heterogeneity, because we do not know whether postal code characteristics are good proxies for the demographic
characteristics of our sample of individuals.


                                                     26
which is fixed to be constant within an individual over time, will mechanically be accurate in
the next month as well.
     The balance-matching model exhibits three-fold greater persistence than the uniform
model. Among individuals whose repayments are closest to balance matching in a particular
month, 83% make payments that are closest to balance matching in the next month. The high
degree of persistence suggests that balance matching is more than a good statistical model
but is actually capturing a stable feature of individual decision-making. The only other model
that exhibits strong persistence is the 1/N rule, which again likely reflects that fact that 1/N
repayments (or the tendency to round payments) is a stable feature of individual behavior.


6.3 Sensitivity Analysis

In Appendix C, we present two sets of sensitivity analysis. First, for some credit cards, minimum
payments are set as a proportion of balances. For these cards, balance matching behavior could
instead arise from individuals making payments that are proportional to minimum payments.
We rule out this explanation by showing that the balancing matching result holds among
cards where minimum payments are not proportional to balances. Second, we investigate the
sensitivity of our results to whether the individual uses automatic payment (“autopay”). We
show that autopay is rare in our baseline sample (11%). However, when individuals use autopay,
their propensity to misallocate and to follow a balance-matching rule is similar to that in the
non-autopay sample, suggesting that our results are robust across these somewhat different
choice environments.


6.4 Balances and APRs in Machine Learning Models

In addition to providing us with an upper benchmark, the machine learning models allow
us to assess the relative importance of balances and APRs in predicting repayment behavior.
Specifically we calculate the variable importance, which can be thought of as the incremental
increase in R 2 from adding a given variable to the model. Appendix Table A9 shows that
APRs and balances are not strongly correlated. In cases where the variables are collinear, the
interpretation of variable importance may be spurious (Mullianathan and Spiess, 2017).


                                               27
     Consistent with the balance matching results, the machine learning models confirm
that balances are hugely important for predicting behavior. Appendix Table A10 shows that
balances have the highest variable importance in all of the models, with importance factors
substantially larger than any of the other explanatory variables. Consistent with the poor
fit of the optimal repayment rule, we find that APRs have the lowest variable importance
across models. Appendix Table A11 shows minima and maxima of variable importance from
models estimated on 10 partitions of the training sample. Unlike some other machine learning
applications (e.g., Mullianathan and Spiess, 2017), the ranges are narrowly spread around the
baseline estimates from Appendix Table A10, indicating that our variable importance measures
are not particularly sensitive to random variation in the training dataset.

     Taken together, our goodness-of-fit analysis supports the view that balance matching is
a powerful predictor of credit card repayments, capturing more than half of the predictable
variation in repayment behavior and performing substantially better than alternative models.
In the horse race analysis, balance matching performs at a similar level to the machine learning
models, and is highly persistent over time, suggesting it is more than a good statistical model
but is actually capturing a stable feature of individual decision-making.


7 Discussion

The fact that individuals do not repay credit cards optimally, and instead repay in proportion
to balances, has implications for the industrial organization of credit card markets and public
policy. While it is beyond the scope of the paper to rigorously examine these implications, we
provide some initial thoughts below.
     To think through the implications for consumer and producer surplus, consider a two-stage
model of credit card market. In stage 1, individuals shop for and select credit cards. In stage
2, individuals spend on and repay their credit cards. The analysis in this paper implies that
conditional on reaching stage 2, individuals do not optimally concentrate their borrowing on
their cheapest card. From the perspective of the issuer, this implies that being the high cost card
in a consumers’ portfolio can generate large stage 2 profits. However, to understand the full



                                                28
  effect of non-optimal repayments on producer and consumer surplus, we need to understand
  how these stage 2 profits affect behavior in stage 1.
         One possibility is that firms dissipate their stage 2 profits via competition for an “install
  base” of consumers in stage 1. If stage 2 profits lead firms to set very low stage 1 prices (e.g.,
  teaser rates) to acquire an install base, then it is theoretically possible for firms to dissipate
  all of their stage 2 rents, and for consumer surplus to be similar to what it would be in a
  counterfactual scenario where consumers repay their balances optimally (although the timing
  of borrowing will still be distorted from the teaser rate). A second possibility is that firms
  dissipate some – perhaps most – of their stage 2 profits in acquisition behavior. The large
  number of mail solicitations, aggressive new card promotions, and heavy television advertising
  in the industry is consistent with this theory. To the extent that much of these acquisition
  costs are businesses stealing from rivals, and not category expansion, this expenditure can
  be thought of as a deadweight loss. A third possibility is that firms do not dissipate much
  of their stage 2 profits in stage 1. This could occur because there are decreasing returns to
  acquisition activity (conditional on sending a mail solicitation every week, the marginal return
  to an additional mailer might be quite small). Adjudicating between these different possibilities
  is important but beyond the scope of this paper.
         From a policy perspective, a natural response to the observed non-optimality of repayments
  is to make interest rates more salient. While Seira et al. (2017) found no effect of interest rate
  salience on indebtedness and defaults in their study of Mexican credit card holders, there may
  be alternative ways of presenting interest rate information that successfully shift behavior.
  A broader policy response is to make it easier for consumers to share credit card data with
  third parties, such as FinTech firms.45 In principle, these firms could use these data to help
  consumers optimize their repayments across their credit cards, although there is no guarantee
  that they will nudge consumers in an optimal direction.




45 Forinstance, recently implemented Open Banking regulation in the UK requires large banks, at their consumers’
  discretion, to give third parties access to account data through secure application programming interfaces (APIs).

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we used linked data on multiple cards from five major credit card issuers to
study how individuals repay their debt. First, we showed that the allocation of repayments is
highly non-optimal, with individuals allocating only 51.5% of their payments in excess of the
minimum to the high APR card, relative to optimal repayments of 97.1%. These findings are
almost identical to Ponce et al. (2017), and indicate that the behavior they documented did not
merely reflect limited consumer experience with credit cards in the Mexican market.
    Second, we showed repayment behavior was inconsistent with models of optimization
frictions. Specifically, we showed that degree of misallocation was invariant to the financial
stakes of the repayment decision, implying that models of optimal inattention with a fixed cost
of adjustment could not explain our findings. We also showed that the degree of misallocation
is invariant to the time since account opening, suggesting that a learning model cannot explain
observed behavior.
    The third part of the paper showed that repayment behavior is consistent with a balance-
matching heuristic under which the share of repayments on each card is matched to the share
of balances on each card. In particular, we showed that balance matching captures more than
half of the predictable variation in repayments, performs substantially better than other models,
and is highly persistent within individuals over time. Making repayments in proportion to
balances could arise from broad tendency for humans, and other species, to engage in “matching
behavior” in related choice environments, but could also arise from individuals repaying a
constant percentage of their balances across cards. Unpacking the underlying explanations for
repayment behavior is a fruitful area for future research.

              Note: Panel A shows the distribution of actual and optimal payments on the high interest rate card in the two-card
              sample. Panels B to D show radar plots of mean actual and optimal payments in the samples with 3 to 5 cards.
              In the radar plots, cards are ordered clockwise from the highest to the lowest APR (starting at the first node
              clockwise from noon). All samples are restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economically
              meaningful allocative decision. Sample sizes in Panel A: 394,111; Panel B: 264,420; Panel C: 83,880; Panel D:
              19,120. See Section 2.2 for details on the sample construction.

Note: Figure shows binned-scatter plots (with 20 equally sized bins) of misallocated payments against the
difference in APR across cards (Plot A), the total value of payments within the month in pounds (Plot B) and
the difference in APR multiplied by the total value of payments within the month (Plot C). Local polynomial
lines of best fit, based on the non-binned data, are also shown. The two-card sample is restricted to individual ×
months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. See Section 2.2 for details on
the sample construction.

     shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the right panel shows the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which can also be interpreted as the square root of the R-squared.
     Random has repayments on the high APR card randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with support on the 0% to 100% interval. Optimal is pay minimum required
     payment on all of their cards, repay as much as possible on the card with the highest interest rate, and only allocate further payments to the lower interest rate cards if they
     are able to pay off the highest interest rate card in full. Heuristic 1 is repay the card with the lowest capacity. Heuristic 2 is repay the card with the highest capacity. Heuristic 3
     is repay the card with the highest balance. Heuristic 4 is repay the card with the lowest balance (“debt snowball method”). Balance matching is match the share of repayments
     on each card to the share of balances on each card. Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost are machine learning models that predict the share of repayments on the
     high APR card using these methods. The two-card sample is restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision.
     Goodness of fit is calculated using the 20% hold-out sample. See Section 2.2 for details on the sample construction.

Note: Panel A shows summary statistics for actual and optimal payments on the high APR card. The top panel
shows values as a percentage of total payments on both cards in that month. The bottom panel shows values in £s.
N = = 394,111. Percentiles and other summary statistics are taken with respect to individual × month observations.
Panel B shows summary statistics for annualized interest savings from a counterfactual “steady state” where
individuals optimize balances across the credit cards we observe in our data, subject to the constraint of not
exceeding their credit limits. The two-card sample has N = 394,111, the three-card sample has N = 264,420, the
four card sample has N = 83,880, and the five-card sample has N =19,120. In both panels, the sample is restricted
to individual × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. See Section 2.2
for more details on the sample construction. The exchange rate was £1 = $1.32 at the midpoint of our sample
period.

       Note: Table shows percentage of individual × month observations that are best fit by different models of repayment
       behavior. The target variable is the share of repayments on the high APR card. Panel A compares each of our
       models one-by-one against the lower benchmark where the percentage of repayments on the high APR card is
       randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with support on the 0% to 100% interval. Panel B compares each
       of the models one-by-one to the balance-matching model. We exclude a comparison of balance matching and
       the uniform model, since it was shown in Panel A. Uniform has repayments on the high APR card randomly
       drawn from a uniform distribution with support on the 0% to 100% interval. Balance matching is match the
       share of repayments on each card to the share of balances on each card. Optimal is pay minimum required
       payment on all of their cards, repay as much as possible on the card with the highest interest rate, and only
       allocate further payments to the lower interest rate cards if they are able to pay off the highest interest rate
       card in full. Heuristic 1 is repay the card with the lowest capacity. Heuristic 2 is repay the card with highest
       capacity. Heuristic 3 is repay the card with the highest balance. Heuristic 4 is repay the card with the lowest
       balance (“debt snowball method”). Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGB are machine learning models that
       predict the share of repayments on the high APR card using these methods. Samples are restricted to individual
       × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. All results shown in the
       table are based on the 20% hold-out sample. See Section 2.2 for more details on the sample construction.

     Note: Table shows transition matrix for the best-fit payment model. The target variable is the share of repayments on the high APR card. In each period, we allow the set J to
     encompass all of the candidate models, and we fix the uniformly distributed repayment to be constant within an individual over time. Balance matching is match the share of
     repayments on each card to the share of balances on each card. Optimal is to pay minimum required payment on all of their cards, repay as much as possible on the card with
     the highest interest rate, and only allocate further payments to the lower interest rate cards if they are able to pay off the highest interest rate card in full. Heuristic 1 is repay

     with the lowest balance (“debt snowball method”). 1/N is exactly split repayments across cards. Samples are restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an
     economically meaningful allocative decision. All results shown in the table are based on the 20% hold-out sample. See Section 2.2 for more details on the sample construction.

  A Machine Learning Models

  This section provides details of machine learning models we use to fit repayment behavior. We
  estimate decision tree, random forest and extreme gradient boosting. For all of these models,
  our target variable is the percentage of payments allocated to the high APR card in the two-card
  sample. We use APRs, balances, and credit limits on both cards as explanatory variables, and
  tune the models with cross-validation to maximize the out-of-sample power.


  Decision Tree        Tree-based methods partition the sample space into a series of hyper-cubes,
  and then fit a simple model in each partition. The decision tree is grown through iteratively
  partitioning nodes into two sub-nodes according to a splitting rule. In our case, the splitting
  criterion is to find one explanatory variable and a cut-off value that minimize the sum of
  squared errors in the two sub-nodes combined. In theory, the tree can have one observation
  in each final node, but this tree will have poor performance out-of-sample. In practice, the
  decision tree is grown until the reduction in squared error falls under some threshold. Then, it
  calculates the average percentage of payments allocated to high APR cards in each final node.
       We use the r package “rpart” to fit the decision-tree model.46 To avoid overfitting the data,
  we “prune” the decision tree by tuning the complexity parameter through cross-validation.
  The complexity parameter requires each split to achieve a gain in R-squared greater than the
  parameter value. We pick the complexity parameter threshold that minimizes mean square
  error in 5-fold cross-validation. That is, we split the sample randomly into 5 disjoint subsets.
  For each of these 5 subsets, we use the remaining 80% of the data to train the tree, and calculate
  the error on each 20% subset.47 Appendix Figure A9 shows the estimated decision tree.


  Random Forest          The machine learning literature has proposed several variations on the tree
  model. One approach which has been found to work very well in practice is random forest

   plete description of the function.

 (Breiman, 2001). Random forest builds a large number of trees and averages their predictions.
  It introduces randomness into the set of explanatory variables considered when splitting each
  node. The algorithm first draws a number of bootstrapped samples, and grows a decision tree
 within each sample. At each node, it randomly selects a subset of “m” explanatory variables
  in the split search, and chooses the best split among those “m” variables. Lastly, it makes
  predictions by averaging the results from each tree.
       We use the r package “randomForest” to grow a forest of 100 trees.48 For each tree, we
  calculate the out-of-sample error using the rest of the data not included in the bootstrapped
  sample. The average prediction error over these 100 trees is minimized to fine tune “m,” the
  number of explanatory variables in the subset we consider in each split search. Increasing the
  number of trees does not significantly improve prediction accuracy.


  Extreme Gradient Boosting             Extreme gradient boosting and random forest are both based
  on a collection of tree predictors. They differ in their training algorithm. The motivation for
  boosting is a procedure that combines the outputs of many “weak” classifiers to produce a pow-
  erful “committee” (Friedman et al., 2001). Instead of growing a number of trees independently,
  boosting applies an additive training strategy, by adding one new tree at a time. At each step,
  the new decision tree puts greater weights on observations that are misclassified in the previous
  iteration. Finally, it averages predictions from trees at each step. This algorithm effectively
  gives greater influence to the more accurate tree models in the additive sequence. We use the r
  package “xgboost” and fine tune the number of iterations over a 5-fold cross-validation.49 The
  rest of the parameters such as the learning rate are kept at their default values. Perturbation of
  these values does not have material impact on out-of-sample errors.50

B Costs of Misallocation: Extensions

In the main text, we presented the annualized interest savings from a counterfactual “steady
state” where individuals optimize balances across the credit cards we observe in our data,
subject to the constraint of not exceeding their credit limits. In this section, we present two
extensions of these baseline calculations, focusing on the two card sample for tractability.
    First, in Table A3 we present interest savings calculated using the baseline steady state
approach for observations that were excluded from our baseline sample. The top row reproduces
the estimates for the baseline two-card sample, also show in Panel B of Table 2. The subsequent
rows show savings for observations excluded by different sample restrictions. The interest
savings are roughly one-third as large for individuals who are excluded for paying the minimum
on both cards and comparable for observations where individuals are revolving on one card
only. The interest savings are zero for observations that are excluded because the individual
pays both cards in full, has equal interest rates, or does not carry a revolving balance. These
individuals are not borrowing, so there is no borrowing to optimize. Total savings, which
combine positive savings for borrowers and zero savings for non-borrowers, are shown in the
final row. Average interest savings for this sample are roughly one-third those in the baseline
sample.
    Second, we show interest savings from exercise where counterfactual interest costs are
determined by simulating forward outcomes when individuals optimally repay their credit
cards over time. This simulation is supposed to measure the gains from “learning” the optimal
repayment rule, which the individual can then implement over time, and incrementally shift
their balances across cards.
    An important complication with applying this alternative model is that we have to take a
stand on counterfactual spending behavior. Assuming their spending “stays the same” is not
an option: With the updated repayments, some individuals will go over their credit limits on
the lower APR card. One option is to assume that individuals allocate their spending optimally.
The optimal allocation of spending is achieved by prioritizing spending to the low APR card,
allocating spending only to the high APR card once the credit limit of the low APR card is
reached. If you told someone how to repay optimally, a good guess is that they would also


                                              48
adjust their spending towards the optimal allocation (although we agree that they might not
get all the way to optimal). Another option is to assume that they hold their spending fixed,
unless they bump into a credit limit, in which case we can reallocate their spending to the other
card. We show counterfactual interest payments under both of these assumptions for spending
behavior.
     We implement these calculations on our two-card sample. To capture the counterfactual
where individuals learn about optimal spending and incrementally shift their balances over
time, we need to observe individuals without gaps for multiple months. To create a balanced
panel, we draw a sample of individuals who enter the individual × month sample restrictions
in at least one month of the data and then remain in the data for at least 11 subsequent months
(with those months either inside or out of the sample restrictions). This sample therefore differs
from the baseline pooled sample of observations.
     Table A12 shows summary statistics for interest savings. The top panel shows savings
when optimizing both payments and spending, the bottom panel shows savings from optimizing
payments only. Interest savings in both versions of the dynamic optimal model are weakly
positive. When individuals optimize both payments and spending (Panel A), mean annualized
interest savings at 12 months are close to those from the steady state calculation (£58 versus
£65) and the percentiles of the distribution are also similar. When individuals only optimize
payments, balances take longer to converge to the steady state optimal allocation, and at a 12
months time horizon savings are one-third lower than savings when individuals optimize on
both margins.


C Sensitivity Analysis

C.1 Minimum Payment Matching

An alternative explanation for the balance-matching result is that individuals anchor their
payments to minimum payment amounts. Like balances, minimum payments are prominently
displayed on credit card statements (see Figure A5). If repayments are determined by a minimum-
payment-matching heuristic, and minimum payments are proportional to balances, then mini-



                                               49
  mum payment matching could produce the observed repayment behavior.51
        We separately identify balance matching from minimum payment matching by “zooming
  in” on a subset of observations where predicted payments under balance matching and minimum
  payment matching are very different. This approach is better than including minimum payment
  matching as another heuristic in the goodness-of-fit analysis. If the balance-matching and
  minimum-payment-matching amounts were largely overlapping, both heuristics would have
  similar goodness-of-fit, even if repayments were driven by only one model of behavior.
        To understand how we separately identify these two explanations, we need to provide
  some background on minimum payment formulas. Most minimum payment amounts are
  calculated as the maxim of a fixed amount and a percentage of the balance. For instance, a
  typical minimum payment formula might be:


                              Minimum Payment = max{£25, 2% × Balance}.


  Consider the following scenarios for an individual with two cards:
     (i) If minimum payments are on the “fixed” part of the formula (balances greater than £1,250),
             and the percentages are identical (2% for both cards), then the balance-matching and
             minimum-payment-matching payments will be almost perfectly correlated.52
     (ii) If the percentages differ, then balance-matching and minimum-payment-matching pay-
             ments will be correlated, but to a lesser extent.
    (iii) If minimum payments are on the “percentage” part of the formula (balances less than
             £1,250), then the balance-matching allocation will not be correlated with the minimum-
             payment-matching allocation.
  Hence, focusing on observations that have different percentages in the minimum payment rule
  (scenario ii) and where the fixed payment binds (scenario iii) allows us to separately identify
  these mechanisms.
        Figure A10 shows binned-scatter plots of actual and predicted payments on the high

51 Settingpayments at multiples of the minimum amount (e.g., twice the minimum on each card) would also produce
   the observed repayment behavior.
52 The correlation is not perfect because minimum payment amounts may include fees incurred during the cycle,

   such as cash advance fees or foreign currency exchange fees.


                                                       50
interest rate card under the balance-matching heuristic (left column) and minimum-payment-
matching heuristic (right column). The top row shows this relationship where both cards have
the same percentage (scenario i), the middle row shows this relationship when the percentages
are different (scenario ii), and the bottom row shows this relationship when both cards are on
the fixed part of the formula (scenario iii). The correlations between these different measures
are shown in Table A13.
     In the same percentage sample, the balance-matching and the minimum-payment-matching
payments are near-perfectly correlated (ρ = 0.96). As a result, the correlation between actual
and balance-matching payments (ρ = 0.63) is nearly identical to the correlation between
actual and minimum-payment-matching payments (ρ = 0.61). In the different percentages
sample, the balance-matching and the minimum-payment-matching payments are more weakly
correlated (ρ = 0.86), and the correlation between actual and balance-matching payments
(ρ = 0.41) is stronger than the correlation between actual and minimum-payment-matching
payments (ρ = 0.28). In the fixed sample, there is a much weaker correlation between the
balance-matching payments and the minimum-payment-matching payments (ρ = 0.56), and
the correlation between actual and balance-matching payments (ρ = 0.50) is substantially
stronger than the correlation between actual and minimum-payment-matching payments
(ρ = 0.23).
     It follows that observed repayment behavior is driven by balance matching and not by
individuals setting payments in relationship to minimum payments. The correlation between
actual and balance-matching payments is not affected by whether minimum-payment-matching
payments are correlated with the balance-matching payment amount. On the other hand, the
correlation between actual and minimum-payment-matching payment seems highly sensitive to
whether the balance-matching payments are correlated with the minimum-payment-matching
amount. We note that while minimum payments do not seem to be driving our findings, our
analysis does not imply that minimum payments are irrelevant for repayment behavior. Indeed,
while not directly comparable, our finding of a modest correlation between actual and minimum
payments matching repayments is consistent with Keys and Wang (2018), who estimate that
9% to 20% of account-holders anchor their repayments to minimum payment amounts.



                                              51
  C.2 Autopay

  Another factor that might affect repayment behavior is whether the individual uses automatic
  payment (“autopay”). In the completely unrestricted two-card sample (including individuals
  with no revolving debt on either card), autopay is used on 23.9% of account × months. Although
  individuals are allowed to set automatic payments at a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of
  the balance, individuals typically set automatic payments at either the minimum due or the full
  balance. Conditional on using autopay, 30.3% pay the minimum and 42.2% pay the full amount.
  Since we drop individuals who make the minimum or full payment on both their cards (see
  Section 2), autopay is used on only 17.4% of account × months in the baseline sample. Thus,
  the main results predominately reflect behavior when individuals do not use autopay and make
  active repayment decisions.
         Appendix Figure A11 plots repayment behavior for observations where individuals use
  autopay on both cards (left column, 11% of observations) and do not use autopay on either card
  (right column, 77% of observations).53 The top row shows the distributions of actual and optimal
  payments, the middle row shows the distribution of actual and optimal payments in excess of
  the minimum, and the bottom row shows the joint distribution of actual and balance-matching
  payments. While average misallocated repayments are lower in the autopay sample than the
  non-autopay sample (7.3% versus 23.2%), misallocated repayments in excess of the minimum
  are similar in both samples (45.5% versus 45.7%). The reason that misallocated payments are
  smaller (and misallocated excess payments are the same) is that the autopay sample has lower
  monthly repayments and, therefore, the scope for misallocating payments is lower.54 Summary
  statistics for actual and excess payments by autopay status are shown in Appendix Table A14.
         Appendix Table A15 and Table A16 show our standard measures of model performance
  by whether individuals use autopay on both cards and do not use autopay on either card.55
  In particular, Appendix Table A15 shows our measures of goodness-of-fit (root mean square


53 The  propensity to use autopay is highly correlated within individuals across cards. In the two-card sample, 68.2%
   of individuals use autopay on the high APR card also use it on the low APR card, and 74.9% of individuals who do
   not use autopay on the high APR card do not use it on the low APR card.
54 Specifically, while balances are slightly higher in the autopay sample (£6,900 versus £5,800), repayments are

   substantially lower (£200 versus £510).
55 Results are shown using the 20% hold-out sample.



                                                          52
error, mean absolute error, Pearson’s correlation) for uniformly distributed repayments, optimal
repayments, and balance-matching repayments separately for the autopay and non-autopay
samples. Appendix Table A16 shows the results of horse-race analysis that compares uniformly
distributed versus balance-matching payments, and balance-matching versus optimal repay-
ments, separately for the autopay and non-autopay samples. While the exact results vary, the
optimal model performs poorly and the balance-matching model performs well across all of
these different measures of model performance in both the autopay and non-autopay sample.
Thus, we conclude that our results are not particularly sensitive to whether individuals use
autopay.

    In summary, autopay is rare in our baseline sample, and our main results predominately
reflect repayments by individuals who do not use autopay and necessarily make active re-
payment decisions each month. However, when individuals use autopay, their propensity to
misallocate and to follow a balance-matching rule is similar to that in the non-autopay sample,
suggesting that our results are robust across these somewhat different choice environments.

              Note: Panel A shows the distribution of actual and optimal excess payments on the high interest rate card in the
              two-card sample. Panels B to D show radar plots of mean actual and optimal excess payments in the samples of
              individuals with 3 to 5 cards. Excess payments are calculated as the percentage of payments on a given card
              after subtracting out repayments needed to pay the minimum amounts due. In the radar plots, cards are ordered
              clockwise from the highest to the lowest APR (starting at the first node clockwise from noon). All samples are
              restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. See
              Section 2.2 for more details on the sample construction.

Note: Left panels shows the distribution of actual and balance-matching payments on the high APR card. Sample
restricted to round number payments (multiples of £50) Round and non-round samples are defined by repayments
on the high APR card. See Footnote 35 for details. The two-card sample is restricted to individual × months in
which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. See Section 2.2 for details on the sample
construction.

     Note: Goodness-of-fit for different models of the percentage of payments on the high APR card. The left panel shows the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the middle panel
     shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and right panel shows the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which can also be interpreted as the square root of the R-squared. The
     round number sample restricts to observations where individuals make round number payments (multiples of £50), and the non-round number sample restricts to observations
     where individuals make non-round payment amounts (not multiples of £50). Random has repayments on the high APR card randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with
     support on the 0% to 100% interval. Optimal is pay minimum required payment on all of their cards, repay as much as possible on the card with the highest interest rate, and
     only allocate further payments to the lower interest rate cards if they are able to pay off the highest interest rate card in full. Heuristic 1 is repay the card with the lowest
     capacity. Heuristic 2 is repay the card with highest capacity. Heuristic 3 is repay the card with the highest balance. Heuristic 4 is repay the card with the lowest balance (“debt
     snowball method”). Balance matching is match the share of repayments on each card to the share of balances on each card. Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost
     are machine learning models that predict the share of repayments on the high APR card using these methods. Round and non-round samples are defined by repayments on the
     high APR card. See Footnote 35 for details. The two-card sample is restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision.
     Goodness of fit is calculated using the 20% hold-out sample. See Section 2.2 for more details on the sample construction.

Note: Panels show binned-scatter plots of the actual percentage of monthly payment allocated to the high APR
card (y-axis) and the percentage of total monthly payment allocated to the high APR card under the balance-
matching heuristic (x-axis, left column) and minimum-payment-matching heuristics (x-axis, right column). “Same
Percentage Sample” focuses on account × months where the balance-matching and minimum-payment-matching
payments are near-perfectly correlated (ρ = 0.96). “Different Percentage Sample” focuses on account × months
where the balance-matching and minimum-payment-matching payments are less strongly correlated (ρ = 0.86).
“Fixed Payment Sample” focuses of account × months where the balance-matching and minimum-payment-
matching payments have the weakest correlation (ρ = 0.56).

Note: Panel A shows the distribution of actual and optimal excess payments on the high APR card in the two-card
sample. Panel B shows the distribution of actual and optimal excess payments on the high APR card in the two-
card sample. Excess payments are calculated as the percentage of payments on a given card after subtracting out
repayments needed to pay the minimum amounts due. Panel C shows the joint distribution of actual and balance
matching payments on the high APR card. The autopay sample is defined as observations where individuals
make automatic payments on both cards. The non-autopay sample is defined as observations where individuals
do not make automatic payments on either card. All samples are restricted to individual × months in which
individuals face an economically meaningful allocative decision. See Section 2.2 for more details on the sample
construction.

Note: Table shows the effect of the sample restrictions on the number and per-
centage of unique individuals and aggregate debt in the two-card sample. Since
observations may be excluded by multiple criteria, the order in which the re-
strictions are applied matters, and the values in the table should be thought
about as the incremental effect of the different restrictions.

Note: Summary statistics for actual and optimal excess payments on the high APR card. Excess pay-
ments are calculated as the percentage of payments on a given card after subtracting out repayments
needed to pay the minimum amounts due. The top panel shows values as a percentage of total excess
payments on both cards in that month. The bottom panel shows values in £s. The two-card sample
is restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economically meaningful allocative
decision. See Section 2.2 for details.

can also be interpreted as the square root of the R-squared. Round and non-round samples are
defined by whether repayments on the high APR card are multiples £50. See Footnote 35 for
details. The two-card sample is restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an
economically meaningful allocative decision. Goodness of fit is calculated using the 20% hold-out
sample and standard errors are constructed by the bootstrap method. See Section 2.2 for details
on the sample construction.

autopay sample (77% of observations) is defined as observations where
individuals do not make automatic payments on either card. Samples are
restricted to individual × months in which individuals face an economi-
cally meaningful allocative decision. All results shown in the table are
based on the 20% hold-out sample. See Section 2.2 for more details on
the sample construction.
