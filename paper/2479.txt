                 The U.S. Japan Trade Imbalance
                  from the Japanese Perspective




                           ABSTRACT



   By 1981, Japan achieved both internal and external
equilibrium; exports and imports roughly balanced at
sixteen percent of the gross national product. However,
within the country, there was concern that the growth
in the government, accompanied by raising budget
deficits, would make it impossible for the economy to
core with a future crisis similar to the oil price
shocks of the seventies. The Chairman of Keidaren,
Mr. Doko, called for a 'philosophy of preservarice'
requiring government austerity and individual sacrifice.
   The expected crises never occurred but the policies
followed led to a balance of payment surplus. Scientific
studies toI.determine the exact sources of these imbalances
are few but indications are that forty percent of the
gap was due to differences in growth in demand at home
and abroad, thirty percent due to differences in the
elasticity of import and export functions and thirty percent
due to movement in the exchange rate.

   It is argued that political and economic frictions arise
when it it attempted to treat the symptom without reforming
the fundamental structure. Proper strategies can convert
the 'Zerosum game' to a 'pcsitive—sum' game.

    INTRODUCTIO?


    Japan'success in coping with two rounds of skyrocketing oil

prices   in the 19705 has changed both her economic structure and
her competitiveness in the world market more than anything else.
The oil shocks were regarded in Japan as a declaration of "war"
and a "national emergency" to a country poor in raw materials and

arable land.       By hard work and self—sacrifice the Japanese
reaction to the national emergency gave Japan the confidence to
be able to compete with any other country in the world.

                                  2
By 1981, Japan achieved virtual equilibrium, both internal and
external, and was ready to take on any challenge. By the end of

1970's, Japan invested almost          twice   as much as the United

States in R & D to reduce energy cost, and to create newer and
younger vintages of capital stock in Japan. Overall investment
in Japan has grown much faster than overall investment in other
advanced countries. For instance, capital per unit of employment
during the period 1973—1979 increased at the average annual rate
of 6.1% in Japan, while in the United States it grew at the rate

of only 0.9% (Sato and Suzawa [1973 p. 161]).          Japanese imports
and exports roughly balanced at the rate of 16% of CNP in 1981
and the excess of savings over domestic investment exactly
matched the    government's budget       deficit, leaving domestic
effective demand and supply in complete equilibrium.
  In the early 1980s there was a growing concern among government
officials and business groups, notably the Keidanren (the most
powerful federation of business organizations in Japan) that the
large   government   deficit   would      eventually      cripple   the

government's ability to cope with the next round of national
emergency, and that the size of the government was becoming too
large. This.was the period when Mr. Inayama's "Caman—no—Tetsugaku"
("Philosophy of Perseverance") became the national motto. As

                                3
Chairman     of the Keidanren, Mr. Inayama advocated Gaman—no—
Tetsugaku      and government austerity accompanied by further
individual sacrifice to prepare for future challenges to Japan.
  The anticipated challenging years never arrived. Instead, both
falling oil prices and extremely brisk foreign demand for
Japanese products, accompanied by Reaganomics' large deficits of
the U.S. government budget, and high U.S. interest rates, became

unexpected windfalls to Japan.           By the end of 1986, the
proportion of Japan's imports declined to 13% of ON? from the
high rate of 16% in 1981, while exports continued to grow at a
higher rate than the pre—Reagan era.       The result is that Japan
has achieved trade surplus to the extent that no other country
has ever experienced. This is a story of "too much of a pleasant
surprise" and a story of unfulfilled challenge.      Even though the

Japanese found that challenges anticipated around the beginning
of the 1980s did not come to past, Japan's export policy had
already driven them to "sell Japanese products by all means".
This is as though their accumulated internal power waiting for a
challenge had to be directed to something external.        The result

was the export drive that the rest of the world observed as "so

disturbing".
  The word      "Gaiteki Fukinko"       (external imbalance) started
appearing in several Japanese newspapers around the end of 1983.
There were fierce arguments on whether Japan's balance of
payments surplus was cyclical or structural.         But around 1985,

it was generally recognized that the "Yushutsu Shiko" (export—

                                    4
prone) nature of the Japanese economy was largely responsible to

the persistent external surplus.
  On October 31, 1985, the so—called Mayekawa Commission was
organized to study "economic structural adjustments for the
Promotion of international harmony", in short, to correct "tne
external imbalance of the Japanese economy". The commission
iSSsUed the report, the so—called "l4ayekawa Report" on April 7,

1986, which, for the first time in the post—1ar period, called
for transformation of the Japanese economy a saving—export
oriented to a consumption—import oriented economy.

    The U.S.—Japan trade conflict has approached a critical point

as the Reagan Administration imposed 100% tariffs on certain
Japanese products containing semiconductor chips in April, 1987.
This conflict has occurred by the fundamental structure of trade
relationship between the two nations and not by a mere flaw or
two in the policy or strategy of either side. It is assumed that

when a problem arises in the bilateral relationship which favors
one side against the other, correction of the disequilibrium will
result in   a so—called "zero—sum" by shifting benefits from the
plus side to the minus side, thereby causing pain          and/or

sacrifice on the favored side and also instigating resistance
against the move. This happens when an attempt is made to treat
the symptoms without reforming the fundamental structure. I
believe that this type of solution must be replaced with more
creative ones which results in a "positive—sum" of benefits for
both sides. In what follows we will examine Japan—U.S. economic

                                   D
imbalance from this point of view (i.e. how two countries can
cooporate the strategy and benefit from the action.)

2. Imoalance of Trade
   During the 1950s the United States continued to accumulate
huge trade surplus each year, supported by its superiority of'
technology and undamaged economic structure.    By the end of the

1960s, West Germany and Japan had completed their postwar
recovery process, and trade surpluses ensued.   The 1970s is the
period during which the crude oil prices increased ten—fold,

but the prices of industrial products increased only two—fold,
forcing the oil producing nations to accumulate large surpluses.
During the l980s, the United States, oil producing nations and
exporting countries of primary      industrial goods    have all
experienced trade deficits, while Japan, West Germany and some of

Newly Industrialized Countries ended up with huge surpluses.
Figure 1 depicts historical trends of trade (im)balances in the
U.S. and Japan.
  Trade among various countries is determined by several factors

which include domestic and foreign demands, changes in relative
prices and exchange rates, tariffs, non—tariff barriers and etc.
Between 1983 and 1985, Japan's overall trade surplus increased by
almost $O billion, while the U.S.         overall trade balance
deteriorated by more than $100 billion. Higher interest rates in
the U.S., resulting from a large Federal budget deficit, stronger

dollar (or weaker yen), and     higher growth rate of GNP in the
U.S. are said to be some of the factors responsible for the

                                6
increased trade surplus for Japan and for the deterioration of
the U.S. trade position.         Many also blame Japan for the
closedness of her domestic markets.
  Scientific studies to determine the exact causes of the trade

imbalance are hard to come by.        But a recent study by Japan's
Economic Planning Agency provides with the analysis of how the
causes of the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance may be broken down
(Economic Planning Agency [1986)).       Using regression and factor
analysis, it is demonstrated that: (1) '40% of the imbalance is
due to the gaps in the growth of domestic and foreign demands
($'417 billion deficit out of $l.0007 billion for the U.S. deficit

and $162 billion surplus out of $393 billion for the Japanese
surplus); (2) the elasticity differences in the export and import

functions are also responsible for the trade imbalance; and (3)
the relative prices and exchange rate variations are additional
factors responsible for the imbalance (See Appendix 1).

                                     8
(1) Growth arid Income Effects:
2a and 2b show how divergences in the growth rates of domestic
and foreign demands in both the United States and Japan were
responsible for the drastic increase of trade imbalance.        The

total domestic demand     in Japan has steadily grown at an annual

rate of' '% for the period 1982—1985, which is approximately the
same rate as the average expected rate of growth calculated from
the trend line for the 1978—1985 period (the shadowed portion).
On the other hand, the foreign demand for Japanese products grew
much faster than the trend anticipated (2.6%).
   A substantial increase in the foreign demand for the Japanese
goods came from the United States. Ihile the U.S. exports moved
along the trend line of 2.14%, the overall domestic demand   in trie

U.S. exceeded its trend line of 2.2% by a substantial margin.
Given the fixed nature of the propensity to import,            this

unprecedented rise in the domestic demand in the United States
provided the basis for a sharp increase in imports, especially
from Japan.       As was observed in the previous section, this
unexpected and abnormal windfall gain in the export industry in
Japan gave a strong incentive for the export drive which oecame
the critical point in subsequent discussions of the U.S. — Japan

trade conflict.     But the fact of' the matter is that the gaps in
the growth rates of domestic and foreign demands of the two

                                  9
the growth rates of domestic and foreign demands of the two
countries substantially contributed       to   the   current trade

friction.
  (2) Exchange Rates — Expensive Dollar and Cheap Yen:
        Another major factor responsible for the trade imbalance
between Japan and the U.S. in the first half of the 1980s is the
overvalued dollar. According to the factor analysis presented in
Table 1, 32% of the increase in Japan's surplus is due to this
factor and 23% of the U.S. deterioration of the trade balance
resulted from the overvaluation of its currency.          The high

evaluation of the U.S. dollar was sustained by high interest
rates reflecting the huge U.S. fiscal deficits.

  (3)   Price   Effects:

         The declining prices of crude oil and other primary
products contributed to improvements in the trade balances in
both Japan and the U.S.      But the overall effects of changes in
the prices of both export and import goods worked against both
Japan and the U.S. The export and import functions estimated for
this period seem to verify this assertion (See Economic Planning

Agency [1986],See Also Appendix 1).
 ('i)   Elasticity Differences:
        Table 2 compares the elasticities of imports and exports in

various countries.         Je find that the import elasticity with
respect to income is the lowest (0.725) in Japan and the highest
(1.687) in the U.S. However, the export elasticity with respect
to income is the highest ('L207) in S. Korea, not in Japan

                                  10
(2.210) and the lowest in W.       Germany (0.976), the U.S. case
(1.133) being slightly higher than W.Germany. In passing it is
noted that W. Germany is relatively balanced between exports and
imports as their elasticities have a smaller deviation.

  Among the four countries compared, the U.S. is the only country
whose imbalance factor is less than one (0.67), which implies
that the U.S. tends to import more than they can afford, while
 S. Korea and Japan depend too much on exports for income
generation.

There is a multiplicative power in the accumulation of trade

                                  11
imbalances in any country.           For example, other things being
equal, Japan can reduce its surplus if the domestic demand grows
at the rate of 14.5 times the growth rate of net world import
(1.14%) (i.e. Imbalance Factor x Growth Rate of World Import

3.05 x   1.147% =   14.148%).   This means that Japan must grow at the

annual rate of approximately 7%.         Conversely the U.S. can begin
to reduce it's trade deficit if the world imports is 2.5 times
the growth in its total domestic demand. These results
 snow that the problem of imbalance has reached a level where
mere policy coordination can do little in correcting trade
imbalances.

3.Impact of Strong Yen
   The value of the yen fell against the U.S. dollar between
Spring of 198'4 and Winter of'       1985.   After reaching a bottom of'

263.014 yen per dollar on February 13, 1985, the Japanese currency
has appreciated by 147% to the current level of 139 yen per
dollar (May 12, 1987).
  On the other hand, Japan's trade surplus has continued to rise
to a level close to $100 billion.               What is happening here?

Economists often attribute this to a phenomenon called the "J—
curve effect" where a surplus in the value—base balance increases
temporarily due to a quantitative adjustment for the steep
upsurge of the dollar value of the yen.
  The analysis contained in the 4hite Paper [1986) of the J—curve

effect, admittedly tentative, gives some insights into how the
huge surplus continues to exist for the Japanese economy.

                                    12
Following the final quarter of 1985, when the G—5 meeting took

place, the margin of surplus resulting            from the combined
quarterly effects expanded to approximately $3 billions in the
second quarter of 1986 and reached some $4.l billions in the
fiscal year 1985. Although this is only 8% of the Japanese trade
surplus in 1985, the continued appreciation (rather than a once—
for—all appreciation of the yen) reflects various lags at work.

(Figure 3)
  A certain period will be required before all the J—curve
effects or lags, are absorbed. How long it takes depends on the
speed of contract renewals and other factors such as: (i)
adjustment of transport    and        distribution;   (ii) inventory
liquidation; and (iii) change in production plans. One estimate
shows that (See Appendix 2) a lO yen rise will eventually reduce

export volume by 7.6%
  Shafigul Islam (New York Times, May 12,1987) at the Institute
for International Economics claims that the appreciation of the
yen vis—a—vis the dollar is already working to reduce the trade
imbalance between the U.S. and Japan. The trade gap was only $1
billion higher in the last quarter of 1986 than a year earlier.
The dollar depreciation in general has already brought about the

improvements.    The volume of American non—agricultural exports
rose 5% last year, and by the fourth quarter stood 9% above those
of the previous fourth quarter.         Exports of capital goods and
consumer goods also enjoyed hefty increases.
4hile these improvements in trade volume will continue over the

                                 13
next several years, rising import prices will prevent a major
decline in the dollar deficit — the J—curve effect. This does not
mean that the lower dollar has no effect on the trade imbalance.
 The speed of adjustment for Japan has been so fast that
industrial production last year remained flat; profits and
investment in manufacturing plunged and lay—offs and unemployment

reached post—war highs.   Japan's merchandise export volume fell

2% and import volume rose 13% last year.
  The high yen shock called "Yen Daka Shokku", has brought
everything undesirable to Japan except the reduction of' a huge
trade surplus. The Japan Institute for Social and Economic
Affairs, the Keidanren's public relations and communication
branch, published a pamphlet titled        "Tne Yen Shock" in March

1987, which describes how much Japan's economy has suffered from

the yen appreciation. It says that:
          While domestic demand has stayed firm,
          the strengthening of the yen has caused
          Japan's export sector to contract. Real
          gross national product in the second and
          third quarters of 1986 was up less than
          3% over 1985 levels.

          A real growth rate of only 2.3% is
          the average forecast of 20 major
          private research organizations for
          fiscal 1986 (April 1986 to 1arch 1987).
          This would be the lowest level
          since the 19714 slump induced by the
          first oil crises ——— Japan has lost
          the ability to be a locomotive of
          growth for the world economy as other
          countries had hoped.
  Indeed the statistics show that the index of growth in
industrial production has steadily declined from 6.5% in the

                                114
second quarter of 1985 to —             1.2% in the last quarter (Jan.—

March 1987) of 1986 (Figure 14).
The yen shock has had a devastating effect on employment. It is
estimated that in 1986 the number of "surplus" employees reached
about 100,000 just in the 1457            manufacturing and shipping
companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
and 900,000 for the manufacturing sector as a whole. If firms
were to lay off all of those excess workers, the unemployment
rate would jump from the present 3% level to 5%. The Keidanren's
survey shows that major steel and shipbuilding companies have
already closed some plants and factories, resulting in a 20 —       i40%

reduction in employment. (See Table 3.)
   This is exactly what is expected from the economic adjustment
resulting from the yen appreciation. Under the circumstan3es
what is needed is for Japan to close the gaps created by the high

yen by taking 'positive' action in stimulating her domestic
economy. The 'positive' action is for the benefit of Japan as
well as for the benefit of Japan's trade partners.
  14. Capital Movement

     Japan experienced net outflow of capital by $37 billion in
19814, $55 billion in 1985 and approximately $70 billion in 1986.
The expanded outflow of Japanese capital went mainly to the U.S.
in the form of the purchase of securities and other financial
instruments. The bond investment in 1985 constituted a more than
eight—fold increase over 19814. Financial investments in the U.S.

by Japanese institutions represented the 'positive' aspect of the

                                   15

trade imbalance in goods         and services,     because they are
complementary in supplying much needed funds for the U.S.
institutions and in preventing the U.S. interest rates from

rising.      They not only provided necessary stimulus to the bond
and stock markets in the U.S., but also helped manufacturing and
other non—financial institutions to invest in physical and real

investments.

  Figure L     depicts   international transactions of the banking
sector.      In interbank credit, the proportion of the Euromarket,
the U.S. and offshore centers have had high relative weight,
while Japan's weight has also risen noticibly in recent years.
Japan is increasing playing an important role in the World
finance as its trade surplus is channelled into the cycle of
world economic development. In this respect, Japan is not
Merchantilist!
  Investment in external and foreign assets by Japanese residents

was liberalized in 1980,         and   since     then   the Japanese,
particularly, institutional investors such as life and non—life
insurance companies participated in the foreign markets with a
wide range of investments. Figure 5 shows the outstanding
balances of foreign securities         held by      the institutional
investors.

  The external financial assets held by a country can be regarded
as an accumulated surplus of international balance of payments
(current account balance). Many believe that the present

 huge surplus       in Japan's current account is a transitory

                                  16
pnenomenon associated with the "development stage of an immature
creditor country". From the macroeconomic point of' view, Japan's
accumulation of external assets has meaning in terms of "saving
for a rainy day", because the present surplus is not the result
of incomes generated from the past investments abroad associated

with the stage of'       a "mature creditor nation." The financial
aspect of the U.S. — Japan     relations is more apparent than the

commodity trade aspect.       4e may simply observe how the Japanese

and also American investors acted rationally from the global
point of' view, selecting optimal combinations of' liquidity,
return ana risk.
  Statistics prepared from L4F's publication (Table     14 and Figure

6) can be used to illustrate the U.S. Japan differences in return
and risks. The table shows that investment return of' U.S. bonds
has been relatively high in recent years which induced the
Japanese investors to purchase U.S. securities.            The risk
measured in terms of standard deviation is associated with return

higher in U.S. bonds than Japanese bonds.           Risk on capital
gain/loss is associated with fluctuations of the exchange rate.
Japanese investors attempted to avoid such exchange rate risk.
Return and risk also depend on both domestic and foreign
inflation rates.

5.   Industrial   Structure and Technology
     It is clear that the present imbalance of' trade is due to both
the "export—prone" nature of the Japanese economy and the
"import—prone" nature of the U.S. economy. These "surplus—prone"

and tideficit_pronet?   cnaracteristics are closely related to the
corporate behavior   in each country.

  First we observe that the elasticity of imports of finished
industrial goods is much higher in the U.S. than in Japan and
that the relative weight of intermediate goods in the overall
import of industrial goods is high in Japan, while in the U.S.
the relative weight of capital goods and consumer durables is
high. (See Table 5).      These differences constitute the gaps in
the import behavior in the two countries.

  Corporate behavior in the two countries may be compared by
studying the management objectives in Japan and in the U.S.

Table 6 summarizes the comparison of management objectives in
Japan and the U.S. The figures are the average scores given in
rank order by the respondent (top being 3 points). The U.S.
companies emphasize the rate of return and the profit rate as
their primary objective, while Japanese managers emphasize the
market snare objective more than other objectives. "High stock
prices" rank as a top priority in the U.S. but it is the least
desirable objective for the Japanese companies.            American

perception of the typical Japanese corporation is that managers
take care of workerst welfare. As far as the working condition
are concerned, both American and Japanese managers pay very
little attention to this problem.
  Another revealing aspect of Table 6 shows that Japanese
managers emphasize introduction of new products more than their
counterparts in the U.S. (1.06 vs 0.21). Japan's export prices

went up 2.6 times between 1970 and l98, almost the same rate as
the export prices of' advanced countries of' 2.7 times.   The labor

cost in yen in the Japanese manufacturing industry went up only
0.2%, due to the high rate of' productivity growth compared with
32.5% in the U.S.     If we take the present depreciated dollar as

the index, the Japanese labor cost rose 31.2%, which implies
that, as far as the price competitiveness due to labor cost is
concerned, the U.S. and Japan are on par because of the recent
appreciation of the yen.
  Advantages in quality competition come from many factors—
including product design, delivery date, customer service and
etc., not to mention the quality of the product. Although it is
difficult to substantiate the claim that Japanese products are
always better in quality, the low break—down rate, high quality
of after—sale service of Japanese cars, and the high resolution
of video cassette recorders are the commonly accepted customer

perception.    These market and "technological" know—hows are
responsible for the success of Japanese products.
  Japan has already achieved a high state of technological
efficiency in the basic materials industry, a high flexibility in

small and medium-size subcontracting firms, and general "process"
innovations used to improve the existing products to newer and
more reliable products.       Total Quality Circles movement and
Flexible l1anufacturing Systems to respond to diversified demands
have all contributed to the superiority of Japanese products.
 The Office of Science and Technology (Figure 7) estimated the

                                 19
overall technology gap of Japan with respect to the U.S. and
other advanced countries. Although Japan is still behind in the
general technology of the other advanced countries, in some areas

it has already surpassed them.        The "technological power" of
Japan is certainly responsible for a high growth rate of Japan's
success in export markets.
  Japan's surge in the export industry is not by accident.    From

the historical point of view, Japan now enjoys the third stage of
the so—called "product cycle". The development of a given
industry is supposed to undergo a product cycle of importing,
import substitution, export growth, maturity and reverse import.
The Japanese export industry is now at the third stage or export
growth phase, where the growth of the domestic demand slows down

but production increases and export surges (Vernon and Akamatsu).
The product cycle is usually associated with changes in quality,

investment and technology cycles.
  OECD statistics are usually used to indicate a clearer picture

of the product cycle theory. (Though we will not reproduce them
here because of the limitation of space). It is known that large

export products such as steel, televisions, automobiles, and
machine tools are already approaching the mature stage in Japan,
while semiconductors and computers are still in the growth stage,

while aircraft is in the infant and importing stage, but apparel
and furniture are in the reverse importing stage.     In the U.S.,

the product cycle in these industries proceeded the Japanese
cycle, which explains why Japan tends to export more than the

                                 20
U.S.
  Perhaps South Korea may become the most fierce competitor to
Japan and therefore to the U.S.                South Korea has been steadily

narrowing the gap in technology vis—a—vis Japan, the United
States and Europe. For instance, direct foreign                investments in

South Korea increased sharply from $150 millions per year on the

average between 1970 and 1975 to $300 millions between 1981 and

1985.      Technology import from Japan was $16 million in 1915, but

reached $63 million in 19814.

  In adopting the strategy of global production and                  building

their production         bases outside            the U.S., the major U.S.
corporations caused the so—called "Hollowing—Out                  Effect" in

America.      Electric machinery, transportation machinery and other
traditional manufacturing industries moved their production and

distribution facilities overseas.
   The "Hollowing—Out" resulted in decline in the technological
capabilities of the industries that remained in the U.S., which
 is also responsible to the one—sided surge of imports. Changes

 in the      relative         position    in      the   overall technological

 competitiveness        are      partly     responsible for the long—term
 imbalances. Figure 8 depicts relative competitiveness measured in
 terms of export price index. After the end of 1980 the Japanese
 competitivness steadily improved over the U.S. competitivness,
 while S. Korea proves to be a strong competitor to Japan.
       The difference in the income elasticity of export among Japan,
 tne U.S. and S. Korea (see Table 2 i.e. Japan:2.21, U.S.1.13 and

                                          21
S. KorealI.2)      suggests that these three countries are at
different stages of the product cycle. Also trade (im)balance of
each country is strongly related with the competitiveness (price

index) and the export elasticity (See Figure 9)      That   is, the
U.S. current account has been deteriorating steadily since the

early 1960s, while the S. Korean current account has been
improving and Japan can .basically maintain surplus since the
beginning of 1970 except for the periods of energy crises.       If

Japan is unable to develop new growth in product innovation in
the future, it is very possible that it will move into the stage

of maturation like the U.S.
  The exchange rate and real wage rate anc competitiveness are
closely related. When we compare the wage rate at Y260=$l, which
is the exchange rate in February 1985, the wage rate in Japan
becomes 5L% of the U.S. wage rate, the exchange rate in May, 1987
is Y140=$1. If we use this base, the Japanese wage rate is
almost equal to the U.S. wage rate. Japan's wage rate vis-a—viS

S. Korea was approximately    Lt   times in l984.    Now it almost

doubled in 1987.
 The yen appreciation has also had the effect of shortening the
                     This may be seen from the comparison        of
product cycle.
productivity difference among the three countries, Japan, the
U.S. and S. Korea. (See Figure 10)  In steel and nonferrous

metals industries, the S.     Korean productivity growth is so high

that neither the U.S. nor Japan can ever       catch up to it.    S.


 Korea has achieved the position of superiority in a much shorter

                                   22
period than any other country.
  The main characteristic of Japanese technological development
has been first to import technology from abroad and then to add

process innovation for quality improvement and cost reduction.
Thus,Japan was able to catch up to Western technology by adopting
the imitation and latecomer strategy. The second advantage that
Japan had in developintg her own technology of process innovation
was-that products were mainly for the use of the private sector

and for non—defense related use.      In the United States, on the
other hand R & D as a whole has been directed mainly toward
defense research, and scientists and engineers have closely
worked for the defense—related industries.       Looking at   R & D

expenditures financed by the government in various countries,
Japan and the U.S. have almost identical figures of approximately
O.6 of national income, while European countries like W. Germany
and France spend much more. The tax burden in Japan and the U.S.

are also very similar.
  One advantage of Japan is obviously that Japan could almost
freely use the basic technology developed by other advanced
countries, notably the U.S. The basic technology usually results
from the non—commercial or defense—related R & D expenditures.
  Technology and productivity are closely related and so are
productivity and employment systems. The Japan         Productivity

Center's recent survey (Figure 11) compares how Japanese and
American management      views   individual   ability development.

Japanese   companies     show    a stronger tendency in actively

                                 23
encouraging their employees to develop new skills than American

companies.             Also Japanese corporations look at the effect of
educational training from the long—term point of view.             This is

understandable          in view of the fact that Japan has the custom of
"lifetime" employment system. Also "On the Job—Training" is much
more emphasized in Japan than in America. These management
practices may have the indirect effect on the strength of the
Japanese   corporation and thus on the trade imbalance ultimately.

6. Trade Barriers and Openness of the Japanese Market
   In an   effort to sidetrack the protectionist sentiments growing
in the   U.S. and to give the impression that progress was being
made in opening up the Japanese marketplace to American goods and
services, the akasone government announced "The Action Program
for Improved Market Access" in July 30, 1985. The Official
Government Bulletin of the Japanese government published in April
1987 assesses the results of the "action" taken by Japan. As
"the Action Program is hard to sum up briefly because it is so
comprehensive and it is even harder to evaluate the program's
impact quantitatively, hence the charge that it has had only a

cosmetic effect,"              the publication cites three examples where

progress      is        made     and   improvements    are    forthcoming:

t.elecomunnications equipment, automobiles, and wine.

  Example 1        :     The telecommunication market was liberalized in
April 1985 when Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) was made a

private corporation.           The Action Program removed all tariffs on

telecommunications equipment in January 1986.                The number of

                                       24
technical standards for terminal equipment was reduced from 53 to

21.   As a result, approvals for foreign terminal equipment jumped
from 25 cases in 19814 to 103 cases in 1985. Japan communications
satellite placed an order with Hughes Communications for two
satellites and related ground facilities. In December 1985, NTT
reached a contract with Northern Telecom Inc. for the purchase of

digital switching system —      the   first foreign purchase. Ford
Aerospace Communications succeeded in the sale of communication
satellites to Japan. These purchases amounted to the increase of

Japanese imports by $800 million.
  Example 2 : (Automobiles): Tariffs on finished automobiles were
completely eliminated in April 1978. Tariffs on automobile parts

were virtually abolished by January 1986.      The effect of the
Action Program is seen as the doubling of import value for one
year. Figure 12 shows a sharp increase of imported cars after
the Action Program was implemented. But it is noted that imports

of the U.S. made automobiles has virtually unchanged, while a
sharp increase of imports came from European cars. This         is

considered as a reflection of' preferences of Japanese consumers.
  Example 3 : (Wine): Under the Action program the tariffs on
imported wine was reduced to 20% in April 1986, and 30% in April
1987. Imports of' American wine have risen from 1,333 kiloliters
in 19814 to 2.5014 kiloliters in the first 11 months of 1986.

  Generally speaking, Japan's tariffs on imported goods have been
the lowest among advanced countries. On January 1, 1986, tariffs
on 1,8149 items were either completely eliminated or reduced by an

                                25
average of 20%. Non—tariff barriers such as import restrictions,
standard and certification systems have also been eliminated.
The so—called      Moss   negotiations      (Market      Oriented Sector
Selective) between the U.S. and Japan have also contributed to
the elimination of not only tariffs but also non—tariff barriers.

Standards and certification systems and import procedures are
established in any country to protect life and health, consumer
interests, the environment, and cultural and traditional values
to a certain extent.      To take account of the average physical
size   of the Japanese, a cold medicine, "Contac", made in Japan is
60% less in size and potency than in          the     U.S.A.    Japan now
accepts more foreign test data than ever before and recognizes
the results of foreign testing organizations.           Foreign companies
also have easier access to the JIS (Japan Industrial Standards)
marks on the manufactured goods.
     Representatives of foreign interests in Japan have taken part
in  meetings of 51 councils to express their views, and 617
foreign representatives have participated in the "standard—
setting   committees." In many cases when standards are        changed,it
is   not the U.S. but other advanced countries and some developing
countries that benefit the most, thereby resulting in a relative
decline of American imports.
     Government procurement has also increased by              nearly 80%
according to the Bulletin.             But like the case of the Kansai

Airport construction,      many    American     contractors      want to
participate in the market simply by subcontracting with Japanese

                                  26
and/or foreign (mostly Korean) subcontractors.    In other words,

American contractors do not directly or indirectly use their

comparative advantage.
  Financial and capital markets have also been liberalized.   The

government began public offerings of Japanese Treasury Bills for
the first time in 1986.    The Action Program has given foreign
financial institutions improved access to Japan's market. Nine
foreign banks have already received licenses to engage in trust
banking and the Tokyo Stock Exchange admitted 10 new members, six

of them foreign securities companies.
  Even a journalistic article from Tokyo correspondents of major
American newspapers concede that the Japanese are importing much

more, but that the U.S. lags compared with other countries.   The

May 16, 1987 issue of the Hew York Times reports that although
the Nakasone government's campaign to buy foreign goods has been
succeeding, imports from the United States have not increased
dramatically. Imports from Europe and such newly industrializing
countries as Taiwan and S. Korea have shown far larger gains.
The explanations for the relative lag in American imports vary
widely, but American goods face a distinct image problem       in

Japan. Where European goods have an image of          luxury and

craftmanship and Asian goods have compelling price advantages,
the Japanese suspect the quality of American goods with higher
prices —   American goods do not have a brand—name image. (This
point is also confirmed by Figure 12).
  Some Japanese blame American companies for not trying hard

                               27
enough to modify their products to Japanese taste. For example,
few foreign companies were willing to modify dress patterns in
order to make them fit better to Japanese bodies. But there are

many success stories in Japan.        Mister Donut, which has changed
its doughnut recipe to make them less sweet in Japan, is one of

the most successful companies in Japan.        Table 7 shows examples

of'   successful   American businesses in Japan.

7. Looking Ahead
      There are some encouraging signs on the horizon to reduce the

trade imbalance. Trade statistics released by the U.S. Commerce
Department in the beginning of May, 1987 shows that American
exports to Japan continued to increase in March 1987 rising to
$2.114 billion, from $2.03 billion in     February.   Japan bought 12.6
percent more goods from the U.S. in 1986 that in 1985.

      The strong     yen is    causing many    Japanese companies to
"reimport" their own products from the United States. For
example, the Honda i4otor Company is considering reimporting
passenger cars produced in the U.S.
 One important statistic shown in Table 8 is that although total
import value in 1986 decreased by 2.3%, it came largely from the
reduction of oil prices. The import value of fuels decreased by
33.6%, while practically all the other items in import have
increased ranging 97% increase in motor vehicles and 52.4%
increase in nonmetal mineral products.             The import value of
manufactured goods has a hefty increase of 31.3% in 1986, now
comprising il.7% of total imported value.

                                    28
 The Japanese government as well as the business community has
been obsessed with the idea that the government budget has to be
balanced, before measures for expansionary domestic demand are

adopted.   Mr. Inayama's "Gaman—no—Testsugaku" was the philosophy
often said to be responsible for this sentiment, as mentioned in

the beginning of this paper.        The consensus was, then, first

close the gap of the budget deficit by implementing indirect

taxes, specifically    European value—added tax system.        The

government proposal of this new tax submitted in the fall of 1986

was completely defeated by the objection of the opposition
parties and the so—called "people's power."     This is fortunate

from the long range point of view, because a bigger government is
usually associated with the value—added tax system as evidenced
by the European countries. The problem here is that the Japanese
government and the ruling LDP party have spent practically their
total political energy on the passage of the tax law, rather
than, the passage of import stimulating measures.      Here is the

case of a priority gap between the U.S. and Japan. The U.S.'s
priority was to see that Japan spends more effort on reducing the
trade imbalance, rather than on instituting a new tax system
which will in many cases reduce domestic effective demand. The
Japanese priority was, first, to institute a new tax system which

will enable the government to expand public expenditures at a
later stage.
  It is hard to project what the Japanese government will do to
stimulate domestic demand, other than saying "specific measures

                               29
have already taken...", because the fundamental philosophy and
mentality have not changed,_even with the strong appreciati'on of
the yen and Reagan's tariff on certain electronic products.

 Rice Deregulations:
 In September 1986 the U.S. Rice Miller's Association surprised
many Japanese by filing a complaint with the Office of Tiade
Representatives, charging that Japan's rice policy constituted an

unfair practice. Since rice, the    staple   of the Japanese diet and

the mainstay of the farm sector, has been granted a waiver under
the GATT agreement, this U.S. move had not been anticipated. The
nature of agriculture in any country is shaped by that country's
history, climate and topography and the people's dietary habits
and cultureal patterns. But Japan today is faced with the need
to build up a highly productive and competitive agricultural
sector. Even the Keidanren now recognizes this need for change.
Their projection suggests that it will take five to ten years
before the Japanese farms can be reorganized into considerably

larger units.   The current policy for preventing a rice surplus
has discouraged farmers from working to improve productivity and
reduce costs of operation. Together with the improvement of the
distribution system, the Japanese agricultural sector must be
developed to a viable industry. The basic difference we should
observe in dealing with less productive sectors of the Japanese
economy compared with the method of coping with such sectors in
the U.S. is that Japan tries to improve that sector rather than
conceding to the foreign pressure and importing rice from say,

                               30
the U.S. The traditional comparative cost theory suggests that
Japan abandon the agricultural sector, while    the U.S. abndons

some sector less efficient.   This approach is valid, provided
that the Japanese agriculture will never be more productive in

the long run.    American industries tend to abandon the sector

without even trying.    This is another reason why Japan tends to

win a competitive edge over the other country, even in the area
where there exists an obvious disavantage in Japan. This does
not suggest that Japan's agriculture will be more competitive
than the U.S. in the near future.
  This being the case, the U.S. should not expect that Japan will

open the agricultural market now, which will improve the trade
imbalance. In fact, the U.S. should expect that Japan will fight

to the tilt to preserve the traditonal sector, while paying much
attention to make the sector more productive and competitive.
The Keidanren'S proposal of the two stage approach (the first

stage =   partial   private production and the       second stage =

reduction of the government control of rice) is exactly the
Japanese method of solving the rice problem.

The Mayekawa Report and Restructuring
  The Mayekawa report also suggests the expansion of domestic
demand, but Mayekawa himself concedes that "a serious policy
concern relating to domestic demand expansion is how to do it..."
(Recent speech at the Center for Japan—U.S. Business and Economic

Studies at New York University on April 10, 1987).      This is due

to:


                               31
  (1) Budget deficit of the Japanese government;
       (ii) High and rising land prices which are the major
             impediment to the housing, and construction industry;

       (iii) Japan's existing "export—prone" structure itself;

       (iv) Regulations for domestic expansion          such as in
             housing and other construction industries.
 The Keidanren maintains that at the current rate the yen is
clearly overvalued and should be stabilized to a more appropriate
level and that the government should make some effort to realize
such an appropriate level. At the same time the U.S. should be
more concerned about its budget deficit. Unless some effective
measures are taken immediately, the "Hollowing—Out" of the
Japanese industries will be unavoidable like the case of many
U.S. industries.     Japan's total direct overseas investment
exceeded $10 billion in fiscal 1984 and reached $12.2 billion in
1985. What does this do to Japan and the rest of the world?
Certainly it will increase some form of "hollowing—out" effect to

Japan but it will bring more jobs to other countries.
  Japan still has a long way to go in terms of real improvement
in the standards of living.         Problems of social capital, and

housing being the number      one priority,      cannot be solved

overnight.    There is a group of economists who advocate the
efficient use of savings (i.e. investment in physical capital)
within the domestic territory of Japan, for improvement of social
capital and housing accomodation, while realizing that some
savings must certainly be invested abroad. However, it is easily

                               32
said but very difficult to be done.         Japan's future is as

difficult as eliminating the imbalance of trade with   the rest of

the world.
