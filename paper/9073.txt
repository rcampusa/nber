Price Uncertainty, Tax Policy, and Addiction: Evidence and Implications

JEL No. C8, D8, I1



                                              ABSTRACT

        Consumption of addictive goods is subject to habit formation. Forward-looking individuals must,
therefore, be concerned about future prices when making current consumption decisions. We study prices
for tobacco products based on a unique data set provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our empirical
findings suggest that prices have been highly volatile during the past decade. Price uncertainty has a
potentially large impact on the economic well-being of young individuals with relatively low levels of
disposable income. We develop a model to study consumption of addictive substances under price
uncertainty. Our results indicate that optimal decision rules of low income individuals can crucially
depend on subjective beliefs about future prices and the length of the planning horizon. These results
imply that tax policies are most effective in reducing teenage cigarette consumption if they credibly alter
individuals' beliefs about future prices.

1         Introduction

One of the main objectives of recent health policy has been to reduce cigarette con-

sumption of teenagers. Improving our understanding of the behavior of younger

individuals is essential for the effective design of public policies. Reducing cigarette

consumption of teenagers is challenging because teenagers are likely to experiment

with tobacco products despite the known harmful effects of these goods (Becker and

Murphy, 1988). Experimentation with cigarettes that begins with temptation (Or-

phanides and Zervos, 1995) and lack of self-control (Gul and Pessendorfer, 2001) leads

to addiction. Peer pressure and clever marketing campaigns may be hard to resist. In-

dividual consumption plans may not be time consistent (Gruber and Koeszegi, 2001)

or are subject to systematic mistakes (Bernheim and Rangel, 2002).

        Since cigarette consumption is subject to habit formation and addiction, forward-

looking individuals must be concerned about future prices when making current con-

sumption decisions. Thus current cigarette consumption of individuals depends not

only on preferences, but also on beliefs that individuals hold about the evolution of

future prices. Given this fundamental property of addiction models, it is surprising

that almost all previous research on smoking and addiction has made little effort to

model individual beliefs about future tax and price policies. Instead research has

typically relied on the assumption that individuals have perfect foresight.1 The lack

of incorporating realistic price expectations into the analysis of addictive goods would

be understandable if prices were stable and easy to predict. However, we show in this

paper that exactly the opposite is the case.

   To get a better understanding of price volatility in the market of tobacco products,

we follow a dual approach. First, we discuss the main changes in the market structure,

tax policies, and the regulatory environment. The upshot of this discussion is that

there have been a large number of policy and regime changes in the market for tobacco

products in the past decade. Changes in market structure, taxes, and regulatory

policy often lead to large changes in prices of tobacco products. It is hard to believe

that young adults perfectly anticipated most of these changes as typically assumed

in the literature.

   We then formalize the analysis and study the empirical properties of prices of

tobacco products. We use a unique data set to assess the importance of volatility in

prices of tobacco products. The data are provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The main advantages of this data set are twofold. First, we can analyze prices on the

metropolitan area level. Our analysis thus avoids aggregation bias inherent in data

at the state or federal level. Second, prices are sampled on a monthly basis, which

allows us to focus on price variation within short time periods.

of current consumption with lagged, current, and future prices implicitly assumes that individuals
have perfect foresight. See, for example, Chaloupka (1991), Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1991,
1994), and Chaloupka and Warner (2000).




                                                2
   To capture the main stochastic properties of the data, we estimate regime switch-

ing models proposed by Hamilton (1989, 1990).         Our empirical findings suggest

that there is a tremendous variation in prices of tobacco products among the set

of metropolitan areas analyzed in this study. Furthermore, estimates based on aggre-

gate time series often underestimate the amount of price volatility experienced on the

local level. For the majority of metropolitan areas studied in this paper, there seem

to be two distinctly different regimes of price changes. There are time periods which

are fairly stable and exhibit only small changes in tobacco prices. These periods are

often followed by short periods which are much more volatile and exhibit large swings

in prices. In these periods, predicted confidence intervals for future prices are quite

large.

   Given our estimates of price uncertainty, we then investigate how cigarette con-

sumption of forward-looking individuals depends on expectations about future prices.

We extend the basic addiction model to analyze the impact of individual beliefs about

future tax and price policies on consumption of addictive substances. We solve the

model under a variety of behavioral hypotheses ranging from myopic to forward look-

ing behavior with correct price expectations. Our computational experiments show

that consumption plans of forward-looking individuals can be quite sensitive to beliefs

about future taxes and prices.

   These results have important policy implications. Tax policies are only effective



                                          3
if they permanently change the beliefs that individuals hold about future prices. If

a tax increase is perceived to be temporary, it will have, at best, modest effects on

individual consumption. A tax policy which would allow the government to commit

to significant tax increases in the future would have strong immediate effects on

consumption. Empirical studies which fail to distinguish between transitory and

permanent tax and price changes and ignore uncertainty of future outcomes are likely

to yield biased estimates of the underlying parameters of the behavioral model.2

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview

of the industry and discusses the empirical evidence on price volatility of tobacco

products. This part of the analysis is based on a unique data set of monthly prices

collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Section 3 discusses estimation of

pricing models. Section 4 presents our estimation results. In section 5 we provide

a rigorous theoretical and computational analysis of the policy implication of price

uncertainty. Section 6 offers some conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis.




2         Empirical Evidence

Prices of tobacco products are largely determined by the underlying market structure.

The U.S. tobacco industry has been highly concentrated for several decades. At

    2
     This point, which is largely ignored in the addiction literature, is well documented in the em-
pirical literature of charitable donations. See, for example, Randolph (1995) and Auten, Sieg, and
Clotfelter (2002).


                                                 4
the beginning of 1988, six firms produced virtually all domestic cigarettes: Philip

Morris (PM), R.J. Reynolds (RJR), Brown & Williamson (B&W), American Tobacco,

Lorillard, and the Liggett Group. After B&W merged with American Tobacco in

1995, market shares were as follows: PM 46 percent, RJR 26 percent, B&W (including

American) 18 percent, Lorillard 8 percent, and Liggett 2 percent.3

      The best-selling American brand is Marlboro which has retained the largest mar-

ket share for a single brand (35 percent in 1997) throughout the past two decades,

although this has been challenged by the rise of generic, discount cigarettes. Cigarette

manufacturers sell a number of different brands at different prices. Products were not

significantly differentiated by price until the late 1970s, when the first discount and

generic brands were introduced. Such brands constituted just 1 percent of the market

in 1981, but as manufacturers ratcheted up prices at a steady 10 percent, individuals

eventually began to switch brands. Generics grew to 9 percent of the market in 1986

and exploded thereafter, peaking around 37 percent of the market.

      Manufacturers who had reaped huge profits from premium brands, such as Marl-

boro or Camel, quickly found that they were now competing both with themselves

and with one another. All manufacturers briskly sold discount brands while trying

to preserve their traditional brands. Philip Morris stopped the trend temporarily in

April 1993 by slashing the price of its flagship Marlboro brand and a price war fol-

lowed. Premium brands sold at a 40 percent discount through autumn, when prices

were finally raised by Philip Morris, a move immediately followed by the rest of the

oligopoly. At the time of the price cut, profit margins on premium brands were about

55 cents per pack; discount brands, on the other hand, provided only a five-cent profit.

    In this study, we provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the properties of

cigarette prices. Our data come from the Price Indexes for Tobacco and Smoking

Products collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Our data set consists

of monthly price series for a number of metropolitan areas in the U.S. covering the

time period from 1988 to 2000.4 The main advantages of this data set are two fold.

First, it allows us to analyze prices on a disaggregate level. Our analysis thus avoids

aggregation bias in the analysis. Second, prices are sampled on a monthly basis,

which allows us to focus on price variation within shorter periods. Empirical analysis

based on quarterly or yearly data is likely to underestimate the significant amount of

price variation in the underlying price processes.

    The BLS sample contains price indexes for a large number of metropolitan areas in

the U.S. We focus on the following five metropolitan areas: New York City, Cleveland,

Miami, Los Angeles, and Denver. This subsample is chosen to reflect the geographical

diversity within the United States. To avoid problems due to differences in state

   4
     Past research has primarily relied on either the Tobacco Institute’s weighted average price by
state or data collected by ACCRA. To our knowledge Sloan, Smith, and Taylor (2002) is the first
study which has used the BLS data in empirical analysis. A careful discussion of different price data
and the advantages of the BLS data is also given in Chapter 8 of Sloan et al. (2002).



                                                 6
taxes, we selected metropolitan areas which are primarily contained in one state. For

comparison purposes we also analyze an aggregate time series for the complete United

States.

   For our empirical analysis, we constructed two separate time series for each of

the six subsamples. The unadjusted prices are based on the the raw data. We also

compute an adjusted price series by removing two outliers. In our data set prices of

tobacco products increased approximately 16 percent on average between November

and December 1998 following the settlement between the tobacco industry and the

states which were suing to recover medical expenditures. While this price increase

may be a salient feature of the data, it is also desirable to analyze the data without

this outlier. We therefore construct an adjusted price series which eliminates this large

price increase. Another large price change occurred between August and September

1993, when prices dropped on average by 6 percent. This price change is largely

driven by the inclusion of discount cigarettes into the index. Since this is a technical

correction of the index, we also exclude it from our adjusted price series.

   Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of our six sub-samples. It reports means, stan-

dard deviations, minimums and maximums for price levels. The reported minimum

typically occurred during the beginning of the time period, the maximum towards

the end. We, therefore, find that price increased on average by approximately 100

percent during the observation period.

   To illustrate the basic properties of our data, we also provide plots of the six

different time series analyzed in this paper in Figure 1. Adjusted and unadjusted

price levels are given by solid lines and dots, respectively. Figure 1 suggests that

prices of tobacco products increased substantially throughout the time period in the

United States and in the five metropolitan areas analyzed in this paper. However,

there are also time periods in the sample in which prices of tobacco products de-

creased. A comparison of the five metropolitan areas shows that there is significant

heterogeneity in prices among geographic entities in the United States. As discussed

below, some of these price differences are due to differences in taxation among states.

Not surprisingly, we also find that prices in metropolitan areas are more volatile than

those in the US aggregate.

   Table 1 also reports two stationarity tests, denoted by T-I and T-II. Following

Hamilton (1994) we consider the following baseline model to test for stationarity:



                             pt = a + b pt−1 + c t + et                             (2.1)



where pt denotes price levels at time t and et is a white noise error term. Our first test

statistic, T-I, gives the p-values for the null c = 0 (assuming |b| < 1). Hence small

p-values are evidence in support of a nonstationary model because of the time trend.



                                            9
T-II is the test statistic – not the p-value – for the null b=1 and c = 0.5 Approximate

5 percent and 1 percent critical values for this test statistic are 6.48 and 8.72.

      The results of the stationarity tests suggest that prices in levels may not be sta-

tionary. The p-values for the first test statistic are very low, the second test statistic

is often above the critical levels at commonly used significance levels. We therefore

difference the data and run the same tests on the differenced data. Our results sug-

gest that first differencing the data yields stationary time series, especially once we

also account for the two outliers discussed above. We therefore conclude that it is

reasonable to model prices in first differences as a stationary time series. To illustrate

the main properties of the data in first differences, we plot these time series in Figure

2. We do not include unadjusted price differences because the only difference between

this and adjusted is at the two correction points.


                                   INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE


      Figure 2 suggests that there are time periods which are characterized by large

volatilities in prices. The last few years in our sample are very good examples for

these high volatility time periods. At the same time there appear to be periods which

have a fairly low variation in prices. For example, price changes are much smaller in

the middle of our observation period.

   Some of the price variation observed in our sample is a direct result of changes

in state and federal tax policies which were implemented during the past decade. In

1983, the federal excise tax was doubled from $0.08 per pack to $0.16 per pack. This

rate held for a decade, when the federal rate was increased another $0.08 to $0.24 per

pack. In 1997, legislation passed increasing the federal tax on cigarettes to $0.34 per

pack in 2000 and $0.39 per pack in 2002.

   A larger part of the cross-sectional variation of prices of tobacco products is due

to differences in state tax policies.6 Table 2 summarizes the main features of federal

and state tax policies during the last decade.7 We focus on the five states which

contain the metropolitan areas of our study. We find that state taxes ranged from

18 to 35 cents per pack in the beginning of the decade. At the end of the decade the

differences were even larger. Tax rates changed up to two times on the state level.

     Taxes on tobacco products have long been a source of significant revenue for state and local
governments. Cigarettes account for the bulk of tax revenue, due to consumption habits and the
structure of tobacco tax rates. Although aggregate cigarette consumption peaked in 1981, revenue
from cigarette taxes has increased substantially since then.
   7
     The statistics reported in Table 2 are based on Orzechowski and Walker (2001).




                                               11
   Cigarette prices have also been affected by various different lawsuits filed against

the major tobacco companies. Most important, individual states sued to recoup

tobacco-related Medicaid payments. In 1996, the Liggett Group broke ranks with

other manufacturers by reaching a settlement that assumed some liability for five

states’ medical expenses and settled a class-action lawsuit. Although Liggett’s penalty

was not particularly large, this lawsuit was symbolic because tobacco companies had

previously defended themselves at any costs against legal challenges and won. Dur-

ing the lawsuits, thousands of documents were subpoenaed, revealing that tobacco

companies had deliberately tailored cigarettes to make them more addictive. All man-

ufacturers eventually caved in. By 1998, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, and Minnesota

reached settlements totaling $40 billion, to be paid over 25 years.

   The most important settlement to date was reached in November 1998. The Mas-

ter Settlement Agreement (MSA) with 46 states totaled $206 billion for Medicaid

expense to be paid over 25 years. Also included were significant restrictions on ad-

vertising and promotions, and a portion of the settlement funds were earmarked for

prevention of tobacco consumption. The MSA was defeated in Congress. The de-

feated proposition would have put even stronger restrictions on cigarette marketing

and sales.

   We have thus seen that prices of cigarettes are largely influenced by changes in the

market structure, changes in tax policies and changes in the regulatory environment.



                                          12
The last decade experienced many changes which caused prices of tobacco products

to be especially volatile. To get additional insights into the properties of cigarette

prices, we provide a more rigorous empirical analysis.




3     Estimation

We estimate time series models to capture the main empirical regulations in the data.

The starting point of our analysis are regime switching models pioneered by Hamilton

(1989, 1990). We consider a first-order autoregressive regime switching model which

can be written as:



                           ∆pt = µst + ρst ∆pt−1 + st                              (3.1)



where st is the (unobserved) state of the time series process at time t. In a regime

switching model the parameters of the autoregressive process, µst and ρst , and the

distribution of the error terms depend on the state of the process. This feature of the

model allows us to capture the fact that prices are stable in some periods and and

highly volatile in other periods. We assume that st is i.i.d. N (0, σs2 ). For notational

simplicity, let us write the density of ∆pt conditional on st = j and ∆pt−1 as



                              f (∆pt |st = j, ∆pt−1 ; θ)                            (3.2)



                                           13
where θ is the parameter vector to be estimated.

   The evolution of the state of the process is modelled as the outcome of an un-

observed J-state Markov chain. For simplicity let us consider a two-regime model

(J = 2). The Markov transition matrix for a two-regime model is given by:

                                                          

Denote the history of price changes up to time t-1 as ∆~pt−1 . The probability that

the process is in state st = j conditional on ∆~pt−1 is written as P r{st = j |∆~pt−1 ; θ}.

Given that we observe a realization ∆pt , we draw inference about the state of process

by iterating the following two equations:


                                    f (∆pt |st = i, ∆pt−1 ; θ) P r{st = i |∆~pt−1 ; θ}

Equations (3.4) and (3.5) completely characterize the stochastic evolution of the state

of the process.

     Suppose we have a sample of price changes observed over a sequence of T periods.

The results above imply that the likelihood function of the data is given by the

following equation:


                       T X
                       Y J
               L =              P r{st = j |∆~pt−1 ; θ} f (∆pt |st = j, ∆pt−1 ; θ)   (3.6)
                      t=1 j=1




The likelihood function does not have a closed-form analytical solution, but needs to

be computed using an EM algorithm. In the EM algorithm, we start with an initial

guess for the probabilities of each state and then iterate forward using equations (3.4)

and (3.5) to compute the conditional probabilities characterizing each state at time

t.

     Before we report the estimation results, we offer two additional observations. First,

we can relax the AR(1) assumption and allow for more complicated lag-structures in

equation (3.1). Second, we can also allow for more than two states in the underlying

process of prices. However, the two-state first-order autoregressive regime switching

model is appealing in our application, as discussed in detail in the next section.




4      Estimation Results

We estimate the regime switching models using the adjusted and unadjusted data

from 5 different cities and an aggregate series for the U.S. Table 2 reports the point


                                                15
estimates of the parameters of the different regime switching models. Estimated

standard errors are reported in parenthesis.

    Table 2 reinforces our findings that there is substantial heterogeneity among the

metropolitan areas in our data set. The parameter estimates differ substantially

among the six samples, in particular when using the unadjusted price data. The

estimates for the means are typically positive in both regimes. They are often signifi-

cantly different from zero. This result reflects the earlier observation that prices were

mostly increasing during the observation period. Using the adjusted data, we find

that the point estimates for ρs are often negative in both regimes. This result suggests

that there is some mean reversion in the data. A period of positive price changes is

likely to be followed by a period with negative price changes. The point estimates of

the variances suggest that price series of metropolitan areas are more volatile than

the aggregate U.S. time series. This result is not surprising. Aggregate data are likely

to underestimate the amount of price volatility faced by most individuals.

    Table 2 also contains the p-value for the null-hypothesis that the two regimes are

the same. We have argued before that regime switching allows us to differentiate

between low and high volatility periods in the sample.8 Table 2 shows that two-

state regime switching models fit the data better than simple AR(1) specifications,

   8
     The p-values and standard errors were calculated by 1000 bootstrap replications. To ensure
that the estimates for each replication were obtained from a global optimum, we started the EM
from several different initial values, and found that this simple model was rather robust to different
starting values.

at least for the majority of the disaggregate time series. The point estimates suggest

that regime 1 is characterized by large changes in prices accompanied with large

volatility. These are the periods of price wars or those characterizing changes in tax

or regulatory policies. Regime 2, in contrast, is fairly stable and shows only modest

amounts of volatility and price changes. While most of the parameters are estimated

with relatively large standard errors, we find that the parameters are typically jointly

significantly different from zero.9


                                  INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE


    One of our main interests is to characterize the amount of price uncertainty faced

by individuals. To illustrate our main results, we perform a number of Monte Carlo

experiments. Using the estimates from the unadjusted data, we simulate 10,000 price

realizations for three of the six models for up to 5 years. The solid line (−) in Figure

3 shows the predicted mean prices for 60 months for Cleveland. The dashed lines

(− −) show the predicted means plus (minus) two estimated standard deviations.

Figure 3 illustrates that price forecasts are subject to large standard errors. Not

surprisingly, the estimated standard error increases with the length of the forecasting

    9
      We also estimated AR models with more than one lag and found that the AR(1) specification
is sufficient to capture the main regularities in the data. We have no a priori reasons to believe that
a two state regime switching model will fit the data the best. Determining the number of states in
the model is, however, complicated because standard regularity assumptions imposed in likelihood
ratio tests are not met (Hansen, 1992). We performed a number of sensitivity tests to investigate
whether adding an additional state to our model would change the main empirical results. All of
tests suggested that adding a third regime the model does not improve the fit of the model.

interval. But price forecasts for even short periods are not very accurate given the

variance estimates in the two regimes of the Markov switching model.

   Forward-looking individuals must be concerned about the potential of large price

increases. To illustrate these risks, we compute the probability that prices will increase

by 5 (10, 25 or 50) percent over a 1 (2, 3, 4 or 5) year period. Table 4 reiterates

our findings that forward-looking individuals must expect that prices are going up,

no matter where they live. The main differences are that prices in New York are

predicted to increase by smaller amounts than prices in Cleveland or Los Angeles.

We find that young individuals face significant price risks. Consider, for example, the

LA metropolitan area. The probability that prices will increase by at least 10 (25 or

50) percent in the first year alone is 0.31 (0.12 and 0.04). That probability increases

to 0.93 (0.74 and 0.42) if one considers a five year interval. While, the estimated

probabilities are of a smaller magnitude for Cleveland and New York, individuals

face substantial risks of large price increases in each metropolitan area.

   In summary, prices for tobacco products have increased during the observation

period. Moreover, prices are also highly volatile. Our findings imply that future

prices are extremely hard to predict accurately. Since their disposable income is low,

teenagers are most likely to be affected by large price increases. Consider, for example,

a 12 year old teenager that smokes 10 cigarettes (half a pack) per day. His or her

monthly consumption is approximately 15 packs of cigarettes. Using a conservative

price of $3, the individual’s monthly expenditure on cigarettes is $45 dollars in the

first year. If s/he lives in the LA area, the teenager would expect to pay an additional

11 percent on average, or $5.1, to purchase the same quantity one year later. However,

there is a probability of 0.04 that s/he would have to spend at least another $22.5

to purchase 15 packs a month. Disposable income for teenagers is likely to be small.

If most young individuals are severely cash constrained, we would expect that these

individuals would take, at least, some of these risks into consideration when making

their decisions. We consider these issues more rigorously in the next section.




5     Price Uncertainty, Tax Policy, and Addiction

The empirical evidence suggests that individuals face uncertainty about future prices

of cigarettes. The next step of our analysis is to extend the basic Becker and Murphy

(1988) model to account for beliefs that individuals hold about future prices. We

would like to know whether price uncertainty and subjective beliefs about future

prices and tax rates can have substantial effects on the consumption of addictive

goods such as cigarettes.

    Let us consider an individual who can consume two types of goods: a non-addictive

good denoted ct and an addictive good at . The stock of addictive consumption, St ,




                                          21
evolves according to the following law of motion:



                                     St+1 = δ St + at                                       (5.1)



where δ is the rate of depreciation of the addictive stock. Individuals rank alternatives

according to a utility function:



                                     Ut = u(ct , at , St )                                  (5.2)



which satisfies all the standard regularity assumptions imposed in the addiction

literature.10 Individuals may or may not be forward-looking. We assume that the

relevant planing horizon of an individual is T periods. Individuals maximize expected

intertemporal utility:


                                    T
                                                                   !
                                              t−1
                                    X
                               E          β         u(ct , at , St )                        (5.3)
                                    t=1




where β is the discount factor.11 Thus if T = 1, individuals are myopic. If T =

∞ individuals are perfectly forward looking. Individuals face a sequence of budget

  10
    These assumptions are smoothness, concavity, complementarity of a and S, and non-negativity.
  11
    Alternatively, one could assume that individuals engage in hyperbolic discounting as suggested
by Harris and Laibson (2001) and Gruber and Koeszegi (2001). Our main argument rests on the
notion that individuals are forward-looking to a certain degree. Whether individuals adopt time-
consistent or inconsistent plans is not important for our analysis.




                                                      22

                                                c t + p t at = y t                                   (5.4)



pt is the gross-of-tax price of the addictive good at time t. yt denotes income at time

t.12 Prices evolve according to a stochastic law of motion. Individuals have subjective

beliefs regarding the law of motion of prices. Price expectations are characterized by

the transition density, f (pt+1 |pt ).

       Since we abstract from the saving decision, we can simplify the decision problem of

the individuals and substitute the budget constraint into the utility function. Define



                             w(yt , pt , at , St ) = u(yt − pt at , at , St )                        (5.5)



Further, substituting the law of motion of the addictive stock into the value func-

tion, we can express the dynamic programming problem faced by a forward-looking

individual as follows:



              Vt (yt , St , pt ) =      max            w(yt , pt , at , St )                         (5.6)
                                     at ∈[0,yt /pt ]
                                            Z
                                     +β         Vt+1 (yt+1 , at + δSt , pt+1 ) f (pt+1 |pt ) dpt+1

  12
    For computational simplicity, we assume that there is no savings. This is a reasonable assump-
tion for young individuals.

Solving the model, optimal decisions of individuals can be characterized by a policy

function written as: at = at (yt , St , pt ). Since decision problems of this type do not have

analytical solutions in general, we need to solve the model numerically. We discretize

the state space and use value function iteration to compute optimal decision rules

and the corresponding value functions.13


                                INSERT FIGURE 4 HERE


       Our computational analysis draws on the example discussed in Orphanides and

Zervos (1995). Since our main focus is on studying the impact of beliefs on con-

sumption decisions, we abstract from learning and assume that everybody is of the

addictive type. The utility function proposed by Orphanides and Zervos is given by:



                    u(ct , at , St ) = ln(ct ) + ln(at ) + Stψ (−φ + γ at )               (5.7)



where ψ, γ and φ are parameters.14

       We solve the Orphanides-Zervos example under four different assumptions about

planing horizons and price expectations. First, we replicate the results reported in

Orphanides and Zervos (1995). This case corresponds to an individual who is forward-

looking, but assumes that prices will be fixed at one during his or her lifetime. The
  13
     Dicretization of the price process implies that we have to approximate the regime switching
models by a finite state Markov chain model. Appendix A describes the computational details.
  14
     Following Orphanides and Zervos (1995), we set φ = 6, γ = 5.6, ψ = 1.0, δ = 0.5, β = 0.9.
yt = 1.0 for all t.

policy function for that individual is denoted by the dashed line (− −) in Figure 4.

The second case considers an individual who is myopic, ignores the future and faces

a price equal to one. The policy function of that individual is denoted by a dotted

line (...).

    We also consider two additional cases in which individuals are forward-looking

and adjust their behavior to take into consideration the possibility of future price

increases. The third case models an individual who expects that prices are likely

to increase permanently during his or her lifetime. More specifically, the individual

believes that there is a twenty percent probability that price will increase from 1.0

to 1.5 in each period. Once prices are at 1.5, they will stay there forever. Thus the

Markov transition matrix for that person’s beliefs is given by:

                                               
                                   0.8 0.0 
                                                                                (5.8)
                                           
                                           
                                           
                                      0.2 1.0


The policy function which corresponds to this case is given by the solid line (−) in

Figure 4.

    The last case considers an individual who believes that price increases are tran-

sitory in nature. More specifically, we use the following Markov transition matrix to




                                          25
capture the beliefs of this individual:

                                                     
                                         0.9 0.9 
                                                                                               (5.9)
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                            0.1 0.1


Price increases are transitory in the sense that there is 90 percent probability that

prices will revert back to the lower level in the next period if they are high in the

current period. The policy function for these beliefs is given by the line denoted by

(.−) in Figure 4.15

       Figure 4 plots the four different policy functions assuming that individuals cur-

rently face the low price. Our findings suggest that the demand for cigarettes declines

as we impose more rationality on the individuals. Myopic models have the highest

level of demand, whereas forward-looking individuals who anticipate permanent fu-

ture price increases have the lowest demand. Moreover, we find that the decision

rules are sensitive to the assumption we impose on price expectations. If individuals

hold constant price expectations, they will consume larger amounts of the addictive

good than if they anticipate future price increases. Individuals who assume that

price increases are transitory consume more than individuals who anticipate perma-

nent increases. The largest differences in behavior occur for individuals with medium

levels of prior cigarette consumption (stock). This is especially relevant for teenagers,

  15
     These cases provide natural upper and lower bounds for other models. For example, if individuals
are forward looking, but engage in hyperbolic discounting, we would expect that their policy function
would lie somewhere between the myopic and the fully rational case.


                                                 26
who are more likely to have to low and medium levels of the addictive stock than

adults. We thus conclude that optimal choices in our example depend critically on

price expectations and planning horizons.

   These results have important policy implications. Another way of interpreting our

example is the following: Suppose the government announces that it will implement

a policy that will increase cigarette prices by 50 percent. However, the policy an-

nouncement is not perceived to be fully credible by all individuals. Some individuals

might believe that the policy is not credible at all. These individuals would behave

as shown in case 1 or case 2 above. Some individuals may believe that the new policy

reflects a permanent shift in policy, but assume that there is only a 20 percent chance

that the reform will be enacted in the following period. These individuals would be-

have as shown in case 3. Finally, some individuals may believe that the policy is not

likely to be enacted and only transitory in nature. These individuals would behave

as in case 4.

   We thus conclude that the behavioral responses of individuals to an announcement

or enactment of a new policy crucially depend on how individuals perceive the policies.

If policy changes are perceived to be permanent, they can have a large impact on

current behavior. If the policy change is perceived to be transitory, the effects are

much smaller. If the policy announcement is not credible at all, we would expect

almost no behavioral response. Tax policies thus not only affect prices in the period



                                          27
that they are announced or enacted, but they also affect beliefs about future prices.

Announced policy changes can have large immediate effects if they are perceived to

be credible.16




6       Conclusions

Our empirical findings suggest that prices of tobacco products are highly volatile.

Consumers face considerable uncertainty about future market conditions. Prices vary

significantly among the set of metropolitan areas analyzed in this study. Estimates

based on aggregate time series do not reflect the volatility that individuals experience

at the local level. Estimated regime switching models suggest that, for a subset of the

metropolitan areas considered in this paper, there are two distinctly different regimes

of price changes. In the first regime, prices are fairly stable. The second regime

is much more volatile and causes large swings in price levels. Young individuals, for

whom expenditures on cigarettes comprise a large fraction of their disposable income,

will experience large reductions in economic well-being if they do not anticipate future

tax and price increases.

      These empirical findings raise a number of serious questions regarding the common

practice of modelling the demand for cigarettes of teenagers in testing theories of

rational addiction. Almost all previous research implicitly assumes that individuals

 16
      Gruber and Koeszegi (2001) provide some empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis.


                                                 28
have perfect foresight. This assumption is not particularly realistic given the volatility

of prices. We have shown in this paper how to relax this assumption and extend

the basic addiction model to account for price uncertainty. We have provided some

examples, which document that behavior of forward-looking individuals can be quite

sensitive to beliefs that individuals hold about future prices. These results reinforce

the view that tax policies which credibly alter individuals’ beliefs about future prices

are most effective in reducing teenage cigarette consumption.




A      Computation

The policy functions in Figure 4 are approximated as follows. Let pL and pH denote

the prices in the corresponding states. Here, pL = 1.0 and pH = 1.5. We begin by

discretizing the stock variable, S, S(0), S(1), . . . , S(n), where S(0) = 0.0, S(j + 1) =

S(j) + ∆, j = 0, . . . , n − 1, δ > 0, and n ≥ {(y/pL )/[(1 − δ)∆]} + 1. Here, ∆

and n were set to 0.001 and 4001, respectively. Next, the addictive good, a, is

discretized, a(j, k, p), so that a(j, k, p) + δS(j) is equal to some S(j 0 ), 0 ≤ j 0 ≤ n,

for each k, 0 ≤ k ≤ mj,p , and p = pL , pH . The number mj,p is chosen so that

pa(j, mj,p , p) ≤ y and pa(j, mj,p + 1, p) > y. Note that by conditions placed on n,

a(n, mj,p , p) + δS(n) ≤ S(n). In general, a(j, k + 1, p) = a(j, k, p) + ∆, and for δ

rational, a(j + 1/(1 − δ), k, p) = a(j, k, p). Hence one only needs to keep track of

a(j, 0, p) = S(j) − δS(j) and mj,p , j = 0, . . . , 1/(1 − δ), which takes little memory

                                           29
and is computationally fast if 1/(1 − δ) is a reasonably small integer. The final step

requires the back-fitting algorithm:



         Vr+1 (S(j), pL ) =             max                 {w(pL , a(j, k, pL ), S(j)) +
                              {a(j,k,pL ):k=0,...,mj,pL }


             q11 Vr (a(j, k, pL ) + δS(j), pL ) + q12 Vr (a(j, k, pL ) + δS(j), pH )},



where



            V0 (S(j), pL ) =               max                {w(pL , a(j, k, pL ), S(j))}.
                                {a(j,k,pL ):k=0,...,mj,pL }




The r + 1st policy function approximation with regards to pL is the corresponding

a(j, k, pL )’s that maximize the above equation. The policy function approximation

with regards to pH is obtained similarly. For some  > 0, this process is stopped when


       n
    1 X
          |Vr+1 (S(j), pL ) − Vr (S(j), pL )| + |Vr+1 (S(j), pH ) − Vr (S(j), pH )| ≤ .
   2n j=1


Here,  = 0.001, although the approximation remains almost unchanged for a much

larger ∆ and . Finally, this algorithm can easily be extended to the case of more

than two states.
