               ON CONSUMPTION—INDEXED PUBLIC PENSION PLANS




                                ABSTRACT


     Using the known result that life—cycle investors will optimally hold
portfolios whose returns are perfectly correlated with aggregate consumption,
this paper uses a simple intertemporal general equilibrium model to explore
the merits and feasibility of pension plans where both accumulations and
benefits are linked to aggregate per capita consumption. Although the
analysis is made within the framework of a public pension plan, it applies
equally well to organized private pension plans where participation is
virtually mandatory and where individually designed programs are not prac-
tical. An additional feature of the plans examined is that they provide
for life annuities during both the accumulation and retirement phases of the
life cycle.

I. Introduction

     Most economists using a standard life cycle analysis would probably

agree that the primary objective of a pension system is to provide a

standard of living in retirement comparable to that enjoyed during the

working years. There is, nevertheless, considerable disagreement as to

how that objective can best be achieved. Broadly, the disagreements are

on the appropriate roles for private pension plans and a public pension

plan in the pension system and on whether or not the pension system

should also be used for redistribution or transfers. The most elegant

approach to the problem would undoubtedly be to solve for the optimal overall

pension system with a simultaneous determination of the optimal forms for

both the public and private parts. However, the analysis here ismore

limited in its scope because its focus is principally on the public part

of the system and because it examines only one of the many possible

functions that such a system might serve in any real—world implementation.

That is, the sole intent of the system is assumed to be the retirement

objective, and not, for example, to also provide for a redistribution

of wealth. The paper should thus be viewed as only a prologue to a more

complete functional analysis of the overall pension system including

the important issue of the degree of integration between private and

public pension plans.

     Analysis of the public part of the system is a natural starting

place because whatever form the overall pension system takes, it will
                                  —2—


surely include a significant public pension plan coniponent. As will be

discussed, there are a number of thecretical arguments to support such

a component as part of an optimal system. Moreover, as a practical

matter independent of any theoretical welfare arurnents that economists

might provide to the contrary, the public pension system in the United

States, after almost half a century of operating experience, is not

going to be eliminated, especially when a significant fraction of the

population is not covered by any private pension plan. The current

problems with Social Security do however, present the possibility for

major changes in the structure of the public pension system. It would

therefore seem to be somewhat difficult to analyze the optima]. design

of private pension plans and the associated issue of integration until

the structure of the public system is more firmly established.

     In theory, the characteristic differences between a public and a

private pension system are that participation in a public system is

mandatory and that the public system cannot be "custom tailored" to

meet the specific preferences of each individual participant. Such a

clear distinction is valid if the private system were solely laisse faire

individual saving. However, as the private system has in fact evolved,

the operational significance of this distinction, at least at the level

of analysis presented here, is less clear. Participation in most

existing private pension plans is virtually mandatory. In a typical

defined—contribution plan, individual choice is quite limited as to the

amounts contributed and where the funds are invested, and in defined—

benefit plans, there is typically no choice at all. The analysis
                                  —3.--




presented here in the context of a public system is therefore readily

adaptable to an "organized" private pension system.

     The arguments for a public pension system with mandatory

participation fall into two basic categories: externalities and

private market "failure" An important example of the former is the

utility externality that other people's welfare is one of the arguments

of individual utility functions. That is, people care about others and

among other things, will not let them starve in retirement. From this,

we get a classical example of the "free—rider" problem which cannot be

solved by the private markets, but can be solved by an appropriately

designed mandatory public pension system. A second example is the

possibility of economies of scale in information costs. Virtually

everyone faces the decision problem of how much to save for retirement

and what to invest those savings in during their working years. The

marginal cost of obtaining the education and gathering the necessary

data to make informed decisions as well as the time spent implementing

these decisions will, of course, vary substantially across individuals

as a function of their prior education and their wealth. Presumably,

a professor of finance by virtue of his training would have a lower

marginal cost than, a professor of physics. The cost of buying the

service of informed decisions will be lower (as a percentage of wealth)

for those who are wealthy than for those of modest means. While this

cost could be reduced by "pooling," this solution almost assumes away

the problem because such an undertaking requires adequate information

and opportunity to form a cohesive group.
                                 —4.-




     If therefore, a pension plan were designed which reasonably

approximates the plan which most individuals would choose if they were

informed, then by making participation in the plan mandatory, the

resources used in individual education and data gathering would be

saved and th maximuni benefits of pooling to reduce operating costs

could be achieved. The benefits of such mandatory participation must,

of course, he compared to the cost in terms of loss in individual

freedom of choice. As already noied, existing private pension plans

permit little choice. Although this data point favors the hypothesis

that the benefits outweigh the costs, it is hardly a sufficient basis

for a policy decision.

     The second basiccategory of arguments for a public pension plan

is that the efficiency of risk—bearing can e improved. That is, the

government can provide diversification possibilities which are not

available in the private markets, and thereby, issue finanical

instruments which the private sector cannot. One example would be

intergenerational risk sharing which cannot be covered by private

markets (cf. Fischer (1982)). Another would be to use either taxes

and transfers (cf. Nerton (1981)) or taxes and the issue of securities

within the pension system to provide diversification of some of the

risks of assets which are not tradeable (as is the case for much of

human capital).

     With these general reasons for a public pension plan as background,

the consumption—indexed plan to be studied is briefly summarized before

turning to a formal analysis in the context of a simple intertemporal
                                    —5—


 equilibrium model in Section II. This is then followed in Section III,

 by a discussion of the merits and feasibility of such plans.

       The plan is a mandatory fully—funded savings plan of the "defined

 contribution" type where required contributions by each member of the

plan are a fixed proportion of his consumption. As with current private

defined—contribution plans, each member has an individual account which

is credited with his contributions (less any deduction for operating

expenses of the plan).

      Contributions and earnings in each member's account are invested in

"aggregate per capita consumption—indexed life annuities" where these

are defined to be an instrument which pays a constant fraction of

aggregate per capita consumption to its holder (the member) each period

and    such payments begin at a prespecified commencement date (the

date at which the member begins to receive his benefits) and continue

until the member dies. If the member dies before the commencement date,

the annuity is worthless. Benefits, therefore, are in the form of a

life annuity indexed to aggregate per capita consumption.

      The commencement date for benefits is at a specified age (e.g., age

60), independent of whether or not the recipient has retired. This

provision is to avoid possibly undesirable distortions of the decision

to retire. However, provision could be made for delaying the receipt of

benefits to a later age. Contributions are mandatory from some

statuatory beginning age (e.g., age 21) until the commencement date.

      One way to administer such a plan would be to create a public

corporation which would be responsible for issuing the indexed
                                   —6—


life—annuities to plan members where these annuities would   constitute
its   senior liabilities. The US government iou]d he the residual

liability or equityholder of the corporation and would have unlimited

liability. The assets of the corpcrtion come from inmber contributions

and are invested in the broadest available portfolio of marketable

securities.

      The number of units of life annuities issued to an account is on

a "mark—to—market" basis at the time each contribution is received.

That is,   the value of a unit of a life annuity issued is determined by
current market prices and mortality tables. To make this possible, it

would be necessary for the government to issue aggregate per capita

consumption—indexed bonds of various maturities.

      To prevent attempts to circumvent mandatory participation in the

plan, retirement benefits are assumed to be neither assignable nor

attachable. For similar reasons, integration of private pension plans

with the public plan are permitted, but only to the extent that the combined

benefits received by the individual arc no less than he would have

received from the public plan alone.

II. A Simple Intertemporal Equilibrium Model


      In this section, a continuous—time consumption choice model of the

type presented in Merton (1971) and (1973) is used to analyze the

system of mandatory saving and consumption—linked retirement benefits.

      Consider an economy where all people have the same lifetime utility

of consumption which is given for a person born at time t0 by



                   0           r
(1)      Et
                    I          Jc(s;s — t0)j    —p(s—t0)
                                                           ds
                   J
                   to
                                               Y<1



where c(t;T) is consumption at time t of a person of age T and                 E
is the conditional expectation operator conditional on knowing all

relevant information available as of time t. Each person has an uncertain

lifetime where     denotes the random variable age of death, and the

probability that the person will die between I       and   i   + dT, conditional

on being alive at age I   is   given by X(T)dT where ACt) >        0.   Each

person acts so as to maximize (1) subject to his initial wealth w0

      If the event of death is independent of other economic variables,

then along the lines of the proof of Theorem VI in NertOn (1971, p. 400),

we can rewrite (1) as:
                                          -8—




                                 —r(s—t0)

                                                Ic(s;s -. t0)J
                 f(s —
(2)
      E f                t0;O)e
                                                                 ds




where f(-r;T')   is   the probability that the person will be alive at age T

conditional   on being alive at age T'.             By the definition of X(T),   f
satisfies
(3)               f(T;T')   = exp
                                      [   f     ?(s)ds]


      By assumption, each person has no bequest function. Hence, it will

be optimal for each person to enter into a life annuity contract where

his wealth goes to the issuer if he dies and he receives a payment if he

lives. One such arrangement would be a series of "short—term" contracts

where at age T, he agrees to bequeath his wealth, w(t;T), to the issuer

if he dies between T       and    T   + di and the issuer agrees to pay him a

"dividend" D dt if he lives. If there are a large enough number of

people in the economy to diversify away completely the risk of

individual deaths and if the contracts (like futures contracts) require

no side payments between issuer and purchaser, then the competitive

equilibrium "dividend" will be X(T)w(t;T)dt.

      In addition to the annuity contract, the person will choose an

optimal portfolio allocation of his wealth. As shown for example in

Nerton (1971), the fractions of his optimal portfolio allocated to the

available investments are independent of his wealth or age because his
                                        —9—



utility function is of the isoeltic form. Therefore, all investors in

 the economy will hold identical portfolios (except for scale). Heice,

without loss of generality, I assume that all people invest in a single

security, and the rate of return on this security, dM/M, is assumed to

follow an Ito Process given by


 (4)                           4=ct+z
where the instantaneous expected rate of return          cr., and the instantaneous

variance of the return o2, are constants over time. it follows from (4)

that the return on this security is lognormally distributed. Moreover,

as a necessary condition for equilibrium, this security must be a

"market portfolio," i.e., a portfolio which contains all available

investments and holds them in proportion to their market values.

       The accumulation equation for the wealth of a person of age T          at
time t can, therefore, be written as


       dw(t;T) =   [(X(T)-fcz)w(t;T)-c(t;T))dt-fcTw(t;T)dz
(5a)
if he does not die between t ond t + dt, and as
(5b)                       dw(t;T) = — w(t;T)

if he dies between t and t +          dt.

       Along th2 lines of the derivation in Merton (1971, p. 390), the optimal
consumption demand for a person of age t a time t can be written as

(6a)                     c(t;T) =   a(T)w(t;T)

where a(T) is a solution to the differential equation
                                            —i o—




(6b)                 =   â(r)     a(-t) + X(T)        +p
                         a (T)




with p      Ep— yctj/(l — y) + -yo212 y inspection, optimal consumption
is a function of both wealth and age, and the marginal propensity to

consume (out of wealth) will be an increasing function of age if 3(T)                     > 0.
Similarly, the distribution       of   a person's wealth who is alive at time

t + s given his wealth at time t, will not only depend upon his wcalth

at time t and the return experience on his portfolio between t and

t + s but also on his age at time t

       Using It&'s Lemma, we have from (6) that



(7)
                   dc(t;°T)      dw(t;T) + (T)            dt
                    c(t;T)        w(t;T)   a(T)



Conditional upon the person not dying between t and dt, we have by

substitution from (5) and (6) that (7) can be rewritten as



(8)
                          de(t; 'r)   =   (ci—   p)dt +   odz
                           c(t;-r)



and of course, if he dies then dc(t;T)/c(t;-r) =                -1.    By inspection of

(8), the dynamic path of a person's optimal lifetime consumption follows

a Narkov process, independent of either his wealth or his age (except

for the "stopping point"). That is, given his consumption at time t,

c(t;T), his concumption (if alive) at time t + s has a lognormal

distribution which can be represented by

        c(t + s;T + s) =      c(t;T)exp[(ct      —   p)s +        c}
(9)
                                           —ii—



 where c is a standard normal random variable. Thus, unlike the

 percentage change in wealth which is age dependent, the percentage

 change in consumption is the same for all people alive. It follows,

 therefore, that

                    c(t + s;T + s)     c(t + s;T'       s)
(10)
                        c(t;T)             c(t;T')


 for ell people alive at tine t + s and T,T' > 0.

       Armed with (8) and (10), we can now proceed to derive the dynamic

 properties of aggregate per capita consumption, C(t). If L(t;r)

denotes the number of people of age T in the economy at time t,

 then the total population size, L(t), equals
                                                             fL(t;T)dT. Therefore,

aggregate per capita consumption is equal to


(11)                C(t) =
                             f
                             0
                                 L(t;T)c(t;T)dT    /L(t)




If the birthrate at time t i given by b(t), then the change in

aggregate per capita consumption is given by



(12)      dc(t) =
                     f0
                          L(t;T)dc(t;T)dT     /L(t) -   H(t)C(t)dt



where• 11(t)   {b(t)[C(t) -      c(t;0)]          A(T)L(t;T)[C(t) -
                                                                      c(t;T))dT/L(t)}/C(t).

       The properties of 11(t) are, of course, dependent upon demographic

assumptions. However, they also depend upon the distribution of

consumption per capita. If, for example, the distribution of per capita
                                         —1 2-




consuaption were uniform [i.e., c(t;T)             C(t), for all T}, then

11(t) =   0,   independent of demcgraphics. In a stable population


               X(T)L(t;T)dT/L(t)1
[b(t)
           0


H(t) =          X(T)L(t;T)[c(t;0)   —   c(t;T)]dT/[L(t)C(t)],   and the   sign of H


will depend primarily on the distribution of per capita consumption

between the very young and the 'ery old (where the marginal death rate,

X(T), is largest). If that distribution is approximately equal

[c(t; 0)       c(t;T) for large T] and the population is growing, then the

sign of H(t) will equal the sign of [C(t) —            c(t;0)],   the difference

between the general population per capita consumption and per capita

consumption of the very young.

        Even without taking into account the interaction between population

growth and economic conditions, the analysis of stochastic demographic

models is formidable. And, while the death rate (at least in the

shortrun) may be exogeneous, the birth rate is surely affected by economic

conditions. Therefore, although explicit consideration of the process

for H(t) is important for many issues in this paper, no such analysis

will be undertaken here. Instead, I simply postulate that H(t) =              O.--'
        If H(t) = 0, then we have by substitution from (8) that (12) can

be rewritten as
                                              —13—




       dC(t)   =                                           -   )dt + odzj
                   { [J L(t;T)c(t;T)dT]/L(t)}[(a
(13)
               =   (a — ij)C(t)dt + 0C(t)dz


A comparison of (8) with (13) shows that (except for scale), each

person's optimal consumption follows a stochastic process identical to

the one for aggregate per capita consumption. That is, conditional on

being alive at time          t + dt, dc(t;T)/c(t;T) =           dC(t)/C(t),   independent

of the person's age T. Therefore, we have for person j                        that his

consumption (if he is alive) at time t can be written as


(14)                               c.(t) =
                                    3

        Consider now a mandatory saving and retirement plan where

beginning at age T0, each person must contribute at rate                        times his

consumption until at age T1, the person begins to receive his life

annuity retirement benefits. During the accumulation period of

length Ta           T1 — T0, each person's contribution is invested in a per

capita aggregate consumption—linked life annuity contract matched to his

age at the time of the contribution.

        Let A(t,T;T1) denote the equilibrium price at time t of a life

annuity contract which begins its payments at age T1 and the purchaser

is currently age T. The promised stream of payments is equal to C(s)

per unit time from time s =             t   + T1 — T     until the purchaser dies. Let

P(t;T) denote the equilibrium price at time                    t of a consumption—linked
                                         —1 "i —




pure discount bond of maturity T which pays $C(t                    i) at time t + T.

If, as has been assumed, indivda1 death risk can be diversified away,

then the competitive equilibrium price for A can be written as



(15)                              f(s + T1;T)P(t;s + T1 — T)ds
              A(t,T;T1)



where, as previously defined, f(T;T') is the probability of being

alive at age T conditional on being alive at age T'.

       For the economy of this section, an explicit fo-rrnula for the P(t;T)

can be derived by competitive arbitrage. From (13),

                                                    t+T
C(t + T) =   C(t)exp      —       + a2)T + a f                        Therefore, the
                              p
                                                          dz(s)]
realized return on the discount bond between t and                    + T is
                                                                        t+r
C(t + T)/p(t;T) =       C(t)eT/P(t;T)                     -     a) + of
                                               exp [(                         dz(s)]
However, from (   4),   the return per dollar from investing in the market

portfolio between t and t + T is                   exp [(ci —   - 04)T + 0f dz(s)]

Therefore, to avoid arbitrage, P(t;t) must satisfy


(16)                          P(t;t) =    C(t)eT

It follows from (.16), that the instantaneous rate of return on the bond,

dP/P dt + adz, is the same as on the market. Substituting for P

from (16), we can re'rite (15) as

 Moreover, it is straightforward to show that for T < T1

 if the owner dies between t and t                       dt.

       Let V(t;T) denote the value of the accumulated retirement account

 for a person of age T at. time t. Under this retirement plan

with accumulations in units of a consumption—linked life annuity, the

 value can be expressed as

(19)                   V(t;T) =       N(T)A(t,T;        T1)


where N(T) equals the number of units accumulated at age T. By

 Ito's Lemma, dV       N(t)dA + I(T)Adt if the person lives to time t + dt

and dV      —v if he dies between t and t + dt. Under the mandatory

saving plan, I(T)A(t,T;T1) = cSc(t;T)                    and N(T0) = 0.   From (14),

c(t;T)     C(t), and if the retirement plan is designed to provide

fraction r (0 <         <    1)   of the person's optimal retirement period

consumption, then       cS    should be chosen so that at retirement, the number

of units accumulated, N(T1), equals r.

       If the retirement plan is fully—funded and actuarially fair, then

at age T0, the present value of the future contributions by the person

should be equal to the present value of the annuity payments to be

received   ir retirement. Under the terms of the mandatory saving plan,
                                                —16—




 the person will contribute at the rate ,c(t;    3C(t) (as long as

                          = f             f(s   + T0;T0)P(t;s)ds




 If the plan is to provide N(T1) r units in retirement, then the

 present value of these retirement benefits at age T0 is

                    Therefore,             must be chosen such that
 nM(t;T0;T1)
                                      and from (15) and (20), we have that
 F(t; T0) =   A(t,T0;T1)         ,

 By inspection of (22), the required contribution fraction does not
                                    —17—


depend upon endowments or the individual contributor's age. It does,

of course, depend upon the statuatory retirement age T1 ,          the
accumulation period Ta, and the target fraction of retirement period

consumption provided by the plan, r .      Therefore,      can be kept

constant over time, and still meet the objectives of the plan. The

only changes required would be in response to large cumulative changes

in the mortality tables f or       1, and these would probably be infrequent.

Moreover, because the plan is fully—funded and accumulations earn a

fair market return, such changes in f or p that might occur will

cause no significant distortions even if         were not adjusted over time.

       To provide a crude estimate of the magnitude of ,       I   assume the

following: (i) the accumulation period Ta = 45 years;          (ii) during the

accumulation period, the mortality rate is a constant, I ,         equal   to

.0138 per year; (iii) during the retirement period, the mortality rate

is a constant, A ,   equal to .0666 per year and that, in no event, will
anyone live longer than thirty years after retirement. The average

rate of growth of aggregate per capita real consumption from 1947 to

1981 is approximately two percent per year. If the expected real rate

of return on all wealth in the economy, a ,      iS   taken to be four percent,

then from (13), we derive an estimate for       p of two percent.

Substituting these numbers into (22), we have that

(23)                           .10 ri



That is, to provide for all of retirement consumption (r = 1)            would

require about a ten percent contribution rate. While such a rate may

scam large (requiring contrIbutions of the order of $200 billion in 1981),
                                      —18—


ten   percent is a common contributioa rate (on income) in mn c::istiug
private defined—contribution plan3, and the current (iiaximum)
contribution   rate for Keogh Plans is fifteen percent. To provide

further perspective, I would also note that the combined omp1oye—

employer   contributions to   Social Security in   fourth   quarter 1981 as

at an annual rate of $245     billion. It is,   of course, unlikely that a

public pension plan would be expected to provide for all retirement

consumption and therefore, the necessary contribution rate would he

considerably less than ten percent.

III. On the Merits and Feasibility of a Consumption—
      Indexed Public Plan

     While the analysis in the previous section demonstrates a consumption—

indexed public retirement plan, it is presented within the context of a

model where such plans crc redundant. That is, with perfect markets for

both assets and annuities, no utility externalities, and rational and

informed people, there is, of course, no need for such public intervention.

From this base, however, imperfections can be introduced to provide at

least a qualitative analysis of the benefits of the plan for comparison

with alternative plans if, and when, such intervention were deemed appropriate.

     For example, a significant feature of this plan is that

contributions be invested in aggregate consumption—linked life annuities.

If important assets within the economy such as human capital and real

estate are either nontradeable or not available in divisible lots, then

even a broad—based portfolio of tradeable assets will not provide a

fully—efficient diversified portfolio. However, an individual's

consumption is likely to be strongly correlated with his wealth (or

permanent income) whether that wealth is tradeable or not, and

therefore, a security whose return is perfectly—correlated with

aggregate par capita consumption is likely to represent a better—

diversified holding than a portfolio containing only marketable

securities. Moreover, even when all securities are traded, Breeden

(1979) has shown that all efficient portfolios will be perfectly—

correlated with aggregate consumption.

     If there are systematic differences among large segments of the

population as to the types of nontradeable assets they hold, then it
                                —20-



is possible to improve diversification efficiency still further.   An

example would be that the young in the economy are forced to hold too

large a fraction of their wealth in human capital because ft is not

tradeable while the old huld tou small a fraction in human capital

because they cannot buy it. As I have shown elsewhere (1981), risk—

bearing can be improved by a system that taxes wages and pays wage—

linked retirement benefits. However, as that analysis amply demonstrates,

such further diversification gains are earned at the expense of having a

"pay-as—you-go" retirement system with a risk of significant distortions

from the associated taxes and transfers.

     Diamond (1977) has suggested that one reason for a Social Security

system is the absence in the private markets of "real" or "indexed"

investments by which people of normal means can accumulate savings for

retirement. However, "real" fixed—income bonds would only protect such

savers against the uncertainties of inflation. They would not protect

the saver against the risk of real increases in the standard of living.

As shown in Table 1, real per capita consumption in the United States

has increased at an average rate of 1.96 percent per year from 1947 to

1981. Moreover, the annual standard deviation of that growth rate is

1.68 percent. Hence, if a person's sense of "how well off he is"

depends not only on the absolute level of his consumption, but also on

its level relative to those around him, then the risk in utility—terms

of a price—level—linked investment can be considerable, especially over

a long accumulation period. A consumption—linked investment protects

against both inflation and real changes in the standard of living. It

has   the further practical advantage of avoiding the index problem

because it is not necessary to distinguish between nominal and   real
changes.

       In another context, Fischer (1982) argues that the government

should issue wage—income—linked bonds. hi1e it is likely that such

bonds would be a superior to price—level—linked bonds for most saving

plans, at least in theory, they may not be as efficicnt as consumption—

linked bonds. One reason is that changes in wage income capture the

returns to only one segment (albeit an important one) of national

wealth while consumption changes depend upon all segments. A second

reason is that wage income is more likely to have a significant transient

component than is consumption since by the Life Cycle Hypothesis,

consumption depends upon permanent income or wealth. How important

the difference would be between wage—income and consumption linked

bonds is, of course, an empirical matter, and one that warrants further

study.

       There are relatively limited opportunities in existing private

markets to accumulate savings in life annuities and none wrere those

savings are invested in consumption—linked investments. In the absence

of such instiuments, the individual may be forced to save too much

relative to his bequest motive. By investing contributions in life

annuities, the proposed plan permits a person to accumulate adequate

amounts for retirement with smaller contributions. The additional

available funds from this reduced contribution rate can be used either

for more current consumption or to purchase life insurance or other
                                      —23—


saving instruments to meet heuest motives. Thia       feature   is esuecially

important in a mandatory saving plan because, for the same      target   level

of retirement benefits, it reduces the welfare—loss of the plan to those

in   poor   health or those who have no bequest motive.

      A second significant feature of tite pl.an is that retiiement benefits

are linked to aggregate per capita consumption. The arguments in favor

of consumption—linked benefits are essentially the same as those given

for consumption—linked accumulations. So, for example, while a number of

people including Diamond (1977), have argued for real or price—indexed

fixed annuities for retirement benefits, per capita consumption—linked

benefits are likely to dominate such annuities because they protect the

retiree against both the uncertainties in the inflation rate and changes

in the standard of living.

       The success of a consumption—indexed plan (whether public or

private) depends critically on the existence of per capita aggregate

consumption—linked bonds. In their absence, administrators of the plan

'ould be required to estimate the "fair market value't of such bonds in

order to determine how many units to credit each account with during

the accumulation period and to determine how much to pay in benefits

during retirement.      I need hardly mention the extreme difficulties

associated with making these appraisals especially when such instruments

have never traded. Moreover, for a public plan, there would likely be

times when strong political pressure would be brought to bear on the

administrators to "adjusc" their appraisals. Even if such pressure were

in fact resisted, the mere prospect of a potential "conflict of interest"

could taint the entiie sysLem.

      In thcory, the private sector could create a market for per capita
aggregate consumption—linked   bonds and provide cocsumption—linked life

annuities through financial    intermediaries.   Some might indeed argue
that the fact that such instrune.nts have not been created is strong
evidence   in favor of the hvpothes that there is no need for them.
However, if this hypothesis is correct, then there must already exist
close surrogates for these instruments in the market since, as suggested
for   example by Breeden's (1979) analysis, there is a strong theoretical

foundation for the belief that an aggregate consumption—linked security

would he widely demanded. I know of no such combination of available

securities.

      There is, of course, the alternative hypothesis that the nonexistence

of such instruments is an example of private market "failure." That is,

even thcugh there would be a demand for these instruments, there is

insufficient incentive for investment bankers, for example, to undertake

the costs of educating both purchasers and issuers especially when the

latter have no assets which are naturally matched to this type of

liability. Similarly in the absence of a "thick" market for consumption—

linked bonds, financial intcrmediaries would likely be reluctant to

issue such annuity liabilities because there is no asset which can be

purchased to hedge these liabilities. Of course, some intermediaries

might be induced to take some limited amount of risk without being

hedged, but this limited amount would surely be inadequate for the

scale required for pension plans. On the other hand, it appears that

the government is a "natural" intermediary to issue consumptionlinked

bonds because it has available the power to tax expenditures. That is,
                                          —25—




the govcrnmenL could institute a cOflsuiptiOfl tax proportion to the
number of consumption—linked    'ooctds    outstanding ajid   the revenues from

the tax wo'ild exactly match the required liability payments. Moreover,

there appears to be no significant social cost to the government

issuing   consumption-i inked bonds mid there may be social benefits from
the government financing the deficit in this form. Vhile the principal

reason for discussing the creation of such bonds here is their essential

role in pension plans, I believe that, independent of pension plans,

consumption—linked bonds would be an ideal investment instrument f or

private saving generally.     If   this belief is correct and if the government

did   issue   such bonds, then it is likely that private financial inter-

mediaries would introduce consumption—linked annuities and corporations

would issue consumption—linked liabilities. The existence of such

private—sector financial instruInerts wbuld serve to make consumption—

indexed pension plans more efficient by providing better pricing

information for the plans' annuities and by providing a broader—base

of securities in which to invest the plans' assets.

      Even if the private sector could efficiently provide consumption—

linked bonds and life annuities, as noted in the Introduction, private

pension plans alone cannot handle either information cost or utility

externalities. While it is of course difficult to measure how other

people's welfare enter into an individual's utility function, I believe

that it is likely to do so in a relative fashion. That is, we are less

inclined to "worry about" or make transfers to those who have a

relatively high tandard of living, and among those with the same

current standard of living, we are more sympathetic towards those who
have fal3en on "hard times" and expericuced a decline from tieir
historical standard of living. If this 3sscssment is correct, then
a public plan along the lines discussed here appears to efficiently
hndlc this utility externality for people in rotl ement. By requlring
contributions proportional to individual consumption during his working
years   and investing these contributions in per   capita consumption—linked
life    annuities, such a plan ensures an accumulated amount sufficient to

support a retirement consumption path for the individual at a level

(relative to aggregate per capita consumption) similar to that which he

enjoyed during the working phase of his life. Linking benefits to per

capita aggregate consumption provides for a continuation of this standard

of living throughout the retirement years. Thus, a plan with these

features meets the objective of ensuring an appropriate relative standard

of living in retirement for everyone and it handles the "free—rider"

prob lenm.

        These features do not, of course, solve the redistribution problem

for those people whose relative standard of living is too low during

their work years. However, a reasonable argument can be made that it is

more efficient to make the necessary transfers by other more—direct

means at     the time (during the working years) when they are   needed instead

of attempting to do so indirectly by redistributing future benefits

within the retirement plan. There are other good economic arguments

for keeping the transfer system and the retirement system separate, but

that is not the focus of this paper. I would note however, that the

plan analyzed here would automatically handle much of the redistribution
                                   —27—



problem for people in their retircment years if a proper transfer
system ware devised for people during their working years. Transfers

received and consumed during the working years will   increase   future

retirement bonefits proportionately because the reuircd contributions

to the plan are proportional to consumption. Transfers in    the   form of

a   total or partial credit for the individual's required contribution
to his retirement account would work in a similar fashion, provided
that the cost of this transfer is not borne by the retirement plan itself.
      ilaving reviewed the merits of a consumption—indexed pension plan,

I now turn to the issue of its feasibility. Although the idea of

investing accumulations in consumption-linked life annuities is new,

the basic structure of the, plan is simple and is essentially the smne

as a standard defined—contribution pension plan. It is therefore a

relatively easy plan to explain and understand. Its format also has the

attraction of "stability" in the sense that neither its basic structure

nor the parameters of the structure such as the contribution rate or the

period of accumulation would require much change over time even in the

face of significant variations in economic conditions. It does however

require that an appropriate measure for aggregate per capita consumption

be ehosen.-" To select the proper measure would require further study to

determine how consumer durable purchases should be treated and whether

or not to include items such as leisure time which are not normally

included in measures of consumption. There is also the issue of what

population neasure to use. While investigation of these issues is

surely beyond the scope of this paper, their resolution is as surely not
                                     —2 —


on   insurmountable problem. With this nicasuremrnt problem solved, there
does   not appear   to be any major difficulty with the government issuLnc
consumption—linked bonds    and using their prices to determine the value

of consumption—linked life annuities.

       The. main feasibility problems with a public plan as described here

are likely to be associated with the method of collecting the required

contributions and the maintenailce of the individual accumulation

accounts. While 1 have not investigated in detail the amount of computation

and record keeping required in the current Social Security system, it

appears that the amount required for individual account maintenance would

not be significantly larger for a consumption—linked plan. However, the

mechod of collection in such a plan is likely to be more difficult than

for current Social Security because the base is consumption rather than

income. As outlined, the plan requires that the amount of each contribution

be identifiable in the same way that individual federal income tax

payments are identified. Therefore, the method of collection necessary

for its implementation would probably be like that of the income tax

with consumption determined as the residual from a cash flow analysis.

The feasibility of such a collection system is currently a topic of

considerable discussion among economists principally in the context of

the feasibility of an individual expenditure tax (cf. Aaron and Boskin

(eds.) (1980) and Pechman (ed.) (1980)). Although a serious analysis

of feasibility will not be undertaken here, I would note that there is

an important difference between an expenditure tax and the mandatory

contribution part of a fully—funded retirement plan. Because it is a
                                    — •) U_




defined—contribution    plan and accumulations earn a competitive rate,

cheating is less of •a problem to the extent that people treat contributions

as saving and not as a tax. Indeed, the rich, high—income, and well—

informed people who might be Lhought to have the greatest incentive and

opportunity to cheat on a tax are probably the most likely to view sucji

contributions   as saving, since these are the people who now voluntarily

enter into deferred compensation and Keogh plans. In general, those

who cheat on contributions are primarily cheating themselves. However,

one slight modification which might make the collection part of the plan

more effective would be to have withholding of the required contribution

based upon income as is currently the practice for Social Security, and

then to have refunds or additional contributions based upon the

computation of consumption made in conjunction with the filing of

federal income tax returns.

     A more—radical modification of the plan as described here was

suggested to be by Lester Thurow of NIT. The collections for the plan

would   be done at the aggregate level by a value—added tax. The aggregate
amount collected would then be distributed as contributions to individua)
accumulation    accounts in proportion to the amount of income reported on

•the individuals federal tax return. The administrative benefits of

this modification depend upon the relative costs of collection for a VAT

versus a residual cash flow computation on the income tax return. It

does have the attractive feature that those who cheat by underreporting

income on their federal tax will lose some of their retirement benefits

(which they presumably paid for through the VAT). The principal
                                        --30—



disadvantage    of this modification is    that   the aggregate contributions
will   now he   treated   as a consumotion tax which can distort the labor—

leisure decision. However, the credit to individual retirement accounts

based upon income will act as a subsidity to wage income which may

offset this distortion at least in part. This modification would

become considerably more attractive if the government chooses to use

a VAT to finance general government expenditures.

       In summary, although the method of collecting contributions roses

the principal feasibility problem for such a public plan, a number of

different methods would seem to serve as close substitutes provided that

it remains essentially a defined—contribution plan which earns a fair

rate of return on accumulations and pays benefits indexed 1:o consumption.

       If a policy decision were made to adopt a public pension plan with

a basic structure like the one analyzed here, there would still be the

further critical policy decision of what fraction of retirement period

consumption should be the target for the plan. Presumably, those who are

most concerned about the plan's success in dealing with information

cost and utility externalities would advocate a high fraction and those

who are most concerned about preserving individual choice would advocate

a low fraction. The correct policy decision will surely depend upon the

amount of other retirement saving that people are likely to make,

especially in housing andprivate pension plans. The resolution of this

policy issue, therefore, requires an ana].ysis of the overall pension

system. Since that was the note on which the paper began, it seems an

appropriate place for it to end.

1. On the matter of the assumed stability of H(t), I note that
because c(t;O) depends strongly upon the initial endowments of the
very young, c(t;O)/c(t) is likely to be larger when the value of
human capital relative to other factors of wealth is larger. It
also    seems reasonable that the birth rate will be higher when the relative
economic value of children is high. However, if c(t;O)IC(t) < 1,   then
comparative statistics reveal that these two effects work in opposite
directions       on H(t)
                     in a stabilizing fashion.

3.     Fischer
             (1982) discusses a number of social benefits from the
government issuing wage—income—linked bonds, including possible
intergenerational risk sharing that private markets cannot provide.
Many of the same benefits would come from consumption—linked bonds, and
indeed, if a consumption tax is less distorting than a wage tax, then
the consumption—linked bonds may be superior.

4.     It is, of course, not true that
                                    every model of lifetime consumption
choice will lead to an efficient allocation of retirement consumption
which depends only upon aggregate per capita consumption. For example,
Breedan's (1979) important theorems on this matter will not apply if
utility of consumption is state—dependent.

5. As I have shown elsewhere (1981), the distortion of the labor—
leisure decision of a consumption tax can be offset by linking future
retirement benefits to current wage income.
