Taxing Consumption and Other Sins

                                              ABSTRACT

Throughout American history, the U.S. federal and state governments have imposed excise taxes on
commodities such as alcohol and tobacco (and more recently, gasoline and firearms). Rates of such
"sin" taxation, and consumption taxation broadly (including sales taxes and value-added taxes), are
currently much lower in the United States than they are in Europe, Japan, and other affluent parts of
the world. In part, this reflects relative government sizes, but that is not the whole story, since even
controlling for total tax collections, levels of national income, government decentralization, and openness
to international trade, the United States imposes unusually low excise and consumption taxes. As
a result, the United States relies to a much greater degree than other countries on personal and corporate
income taxes, thereby affording fewer opportunities to use the tax system to protect individuals and
the environment by discouraging the consumption of "sinful" commodities, and instead simply discouraging
saving and investment.

                                        Introduction

          Federal and state governments in the United States use income and payroll taxes

as their primary tools to collect revenue. In the rest of the world, governments also use

income and payroll taxes, but rely much more heavily than does the United States on

taxing consumption. Consumption taxes take many forms, including general sales taxes,

value-added taxes, and excise taxes on the consumption of specific items including

gasoline, alcohol, tobacco products, firearms, air travel, telephone communication, and

others.

          The U.S. government does not use a value-added tax (VAT), making the United

States unique among high-income countries and a rarity in the larger world. As of 2004,

at least 134 countries rely on VATs as a substantial source of funding. VATs are

sophisticated forms of sales taxes in which taxes are withheld by businesses according to

value added at every stage of production. American states do impose sales taxes on

broad categories of consumer purchases, but state governments are considerably smaller

than national governments, and their sales tax rates are very low compared to the VAT

rates used in the rest of the world.


          The United States also imposes unusually low excise taxes even after controlling

for total tax collections, which are lower in the United States than they are in most high-

income countries. The deliberate social engineering that underlies the selection of certain

commodities for unusually high rates of taxation appeals less to Americans than to

residents of other countries. Moreover, the “sin” taxes on purchases of commodities such

as gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms are not primarily imposed by the U.S.
government for collecting substantial tax revenue for general spending purposes –

although excise taxes have been used that way in the past. Instead, excise taxes are

intended to discourage consumption of the specific taxed goods, thereby preventing some

potential customers from contributing to pollution, traffic congestion, injury, and poor

health. As one example, the U.S. tax on ozone-depleting chemicals is intended to provide

incentives to discourage use of these chemicals. In addition, these sin taxes raise revenue

that the government can use for targeted purposes like funding highway improvements,

medical care, and law enforcement efforts that combat some of the consequences of

gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. For example, the federal tax on sport fishing

equipment is intended to raise money to cover costs that the government incurs in

supporting the taxed activity.


       The absence of value-added taxation in the United States, together with the very

low rates of U.S. excise taxation, requires the U.S. government to rely heavily on income

taxes to finance its activities. There are three consequences of this reliance on income

taxes. First, U.S. excise tax policy does relatively little to discourage the consumption of

particular goods that damage the environment or the individuals concerned. Second, it is

difficult to tailor the income tax system to charge individuals even roughly appropriate

amounts for their use of specific government services such as roads and health care.

Third, and perhaps most important, is that reliance on income taxation imposes a higher

tax burden on capital income than would be the case if the government instead made

more extensive use of consumption taxes. Capital income taxes discourage saving and

investing, and, since the effects of capital income taxes compound over time, these taxes

are among the most distortionary of all taxes. Even a very low rate of capital income



                                             2
taxation significantly increases the cost of consuming in the future relative to consuming

today, and this relative price distortion grows as the saving horizon increases. While it is

perhaps unfair to place the “sin” of general consumption in quite the same category as the

sin of consuming alcohol or tobacco, or other potentially harmful substances, the very

low U.S. saving rate, and its consequences in reduced prosperity for the elderly and for

future generations, makes marginal consumption look relatively sinful when compared to

greater saving. The inefficiency associated with taxing capital income increases with an

economy’s exposure to international capital flows, since rising international mobility

makes a country’s capital stock more sensitive to taxation, suggesting that the cost of not

making more extensive use of consumption taxes has been rising over time.


                        Consumption Taxes in the United States


       The primary consumption taxes used by the U.S. federal government are excise

taxes. Consumption taxes used by U.S. states include a combination of excise and sales

taxes. State governments rely more heavily on consumption taxes than does the federal

government, but the much smaller sizes of state governments implies that the net

consumption tax burden in the United States remains rather modest.


Federal Excise Taxation


       There is no federal value-added tax, no federal sales tax, and only a rather modest

assortment of federal excise taxes. Table 1 displays tax collections from major federal

excise taxes in 2004. In the 2004 federal budget, all excise taxes together collected $71.8

billion, representing 4 percent of total revenues of $1,797 billion. The federal tax on

gasoline and related products accounts for $32.6 billion, or 45 percent of total excise tax


                                             3
collections, with the remainder consisting principally of federal taxes on tobacco (11

percent of total excise taxes), air travel (9 percent), telephone service (8 percent) and

various forms of alcohol (12 percent).


       Earlier American history includes periods in which federal excise taxes were

more important sources of revenue. In order to finance debts incurred in the

Revolutionary War and for which tariff revenues were insufficient, Congress in 1791 and

1794 introduced excise taxes on tobacco and snuff, refined sugar, distilled spirits,

carriages, and property sold at auction (Dewey, 1907, pp. 105-109). Some of these taxes,

including a subsequent 1797 stamp tax on the execution of various legal documents,

replicated the unpopular taxes that the British government had imposed on the American

colonies. Indeed, in a 1774 address attempting to enlist support from residents of

Quebec, the Continental Congress had argued that under British rule they were subject

“to the impositions of EXCISE, the horror of all free states” (Hu, 1950, p. 11), expressing

a view that apparently changes with perspective.


       The new federal excises were not warmly embraced by all taxpayers. The tax on

distilled spirits drew fierce opposition in North Carolina and particularly in western

Pennsylvania, where it prompted open defiance, riots, and mob violence that included

destroying the property of those complying with the tax and tarring and feathering of

federal tax collectors. By 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion required President George

Washington to send troops to Pennsylvania to suppress the insurrection and arrest its

participants (Hu, 1950, pp. 19-28). The government of Thomas Jefferson abolished all

federal excises in 1802, balancing its budget instead with tariffs, land sales, and military

spending cuts (Dewey, 1907, p. 120).


                                              4
       The War of 1812 required new revenue sources, including the older excise taxes

and new ones on gold, jewelry, silverware and watches, but when the war concluded,

Congress in 1817 repealed all federal excises (Dewey, 1907, pp. 139-140). From 1817

until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the federal government was funded

exclusively by land sales and tariffs. At the start of the Civil War, the federal

government reinstituted its old excise taxes, and by 1862 had added new excises on

playing cards, feathers, patent medicines, billiard tables, leather, telegrams, yachts, and a

host of other luxuries (Dewey, 1907, p. 301). The federal government also introduced a

personal income tax, despite the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against federal income

taxation, not to mention taxpayer outrage at its confiscatory top tax rate of 5 percent. The

income tax and many of the new excise taxes were repealed following the Civil War,

only to reappear briefly in the 1890s, when the need to finance the Spanish-American war

led at the end of the decade to the doubling of federal taxes on beer and tobacco, and

adoption of excise taxes on exotic new products, among them chewing gum and

telephone calls (Dewey, 1907, p. 466).


       Passage of the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1913 permitted the

federal government to levy a personal income tax, which quickly became the mainstay of

federal revenues, though it did not entirely supplant federal excise taxes. Prohibition

together with excise tax reductions dealt a serious blow to federal excise tax collections

between 1920 and 1933, but the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, along with an expansion of

other federal excises on Depression-era luxuries (including gasoline, refrigerators, radios,

phonograph records, candy and chewing gum, matches, furs, jewelry, cameras, and soft

drinks), helped to finance expanded federal spending. Indeed, federal excise taxes



                                              5
collected more than 15 percent of federal revenue in 1933 (Francis, 2000), and the repeal

of Prohibition alone made feasible federal alcohol tax collections in the range of $500

million to $600 million per year during the 1930s, enough to finance more than a quarter

of the roughly $2 billion a year that Gruber and Hungerman (2005, p. 10) estimate that

the federal government spent on all New Deal relief programs combined.


       The vastly broadened scope of the federal government during and following

World War II required substantially higher income taxes, but certain excise taxes

remained. The federal gasoline tax, introduced in 1933, discourages driving and thereby

reduces pollution and traffic congestion; furthermore, since 1956, federal gas tax

revenues have been parked in the Highway Trust Fund, which finances the construction

and maintenance of interstate highways and urban mass transit projects. Indeed, because

the federal gas tax serves in part as a fee for the use of federal highways, non-highway

business and farm use of gasoline and diesel fuel, and household non-highway use of

diesel fuel, are exempt from federal taxes. Buyers who commit not to drive on interstate

highways are entitled to purchase untaxed diesel fuel, to which the government adds a

strong dye that identifies any culprits caught on highways (by federal tax inspectors) with

untaxed fuel in their tanks. But of course even off-highway use of gasoline and diesel

fuel produces pollution.


       Environmental concerns prompted the federal government to introduce excise

taxes on ozone-depleting chemicals in 1989, following the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an

international agreement intended to protect the Earth’s ozone layer. The Montreal

Protocol committed the United States to reduce production of various ozone-depleting

chemicals by 50 percent; since this might be accomplished either by restricting


                                             6
production directly or by imposing high taxes, the U.S. government decided to do both.

Congress initially believed that the quantity limits would be the more restrictive of the

two policies, driving up the prices of ozone-depleting chemicals, and leaving the excise

tax to serve the role of a windfall profit tax on producers lucky enough to receive

production quotas (Merrill and Rousso, 1991). But subsequent tax increases, together

with changed market conditions, drove actual production of ozone-depleting chemicals

below the quota limits (Fullerton, 1996), making federal taxes, and not the quotas, the

determinants of national production levels. In practice, the rates at which different

chemicals and their uses are taxed bear little resemblance to a tax finely tailored to reduce

total ozone depletion, as a well-designed tax would impose much higher rates on

activities more likely to release ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere (Barthold,

1994), though the net result of federal taxation has certainly been in the desired direction.


       The federal government imposes many other environmental excise taxes,

including a tax on the sale of gas-guzzler cars (those with fuel economy averages below

22.5 miles per gallon), and taxes on other heavy road vehicles, highway-type tires, and all

forms of air transportation. In an interesting twist on “sin” taxation, the federal

government imposes a LUST tax of 0.1 cent per gallon on motor fuels to fund its Leaking

Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. The original idea of the LUST tax was to pay for

cleanups of, yes, leaking underground fuel storage tanks, but the LUST Trust Fund

collects much more revenue than it spends each year, its surplus seeping into the U.S.

Treasury. The same pattern of annual surpluses for many years characterized gas taxes

earmarked for interstate highways, though this pattern has reversed recently.




                                              7
       Many federal excise taxes, including the taxes on motor fuels, are designed to

raise revenue to finance government expenditures that promote the taxed activity. For

example, the 10 percent federal tax on fishing tackle, 3 percent tax on electric outboard

motors and fish-finding sonar devices, and a portion of motorboat fuel tax revenues are

cast into the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which finances programs for boat safety and

sport fish restoration. An 11 percent federal tax on rifles, shotguns, firearm ammunition,

and bows and arrows, together with a more favorable 10 percent tax on pistols and

revolvers, provides resources for the Wildlife Restoration Project Fund. The money in

this fund is distributed to states to help them maintain ample supplies of targets by

financing animal surveys and inventories, habitat research, hunter education programs,

and management of the remaining wildlife populations.


State Excise and Sales Taxation


       American states have used a wide variety of consumption-based taxes throughout

their histories, though their heavier reliance on consumption taxes is a relatively recent

phenomenon. Early taxes in American colonies were largely poll taxes, imposed on adult

males with obligations that might vary by occupation; there were also import duties, land

taxes, and taxes on other property, such as houses, animals and ships. Excise taxes were

used most heavily by the middle Atlantic and New England colonies, though almost all

colonies taxed liquor production (Ely, 1888, p. 114). New York, ever a leader in

taxation, had taxes on wine and beer as early as 1650 (Sumner, 1891, p. 19), taxes on

tobacco, grain, hemp, flax, butter and cheese by 1653 (Ely, 1888, p. 110), and introduced

a liquor sales tax in 1713. Pennsylvania likewise had longstanding taxes on wine, rum,




                                              8
and other spirits, but some colonies started much later, such as New Hampshire, which

introduced its excise taxes on wine, rum, cider and tea only in 1756.


       The colonies maintained multiple revenue sources upon graduating to statehood,

and over the subsequent 217 years the American states have relied on excise taxes to

varying degrees. Property taxes have always served as important revenue sources,

though in the twentieth century the use of income taxes expanded, and consumption taxes

came into their own. By 2004, property taxes accounted for 31.5 percent of total state

and local revenues, with individual income taxes raising 21.3 percent, corporate income

taxes 3.3 percent, excise taxes 11.5 percent, and general sales taxes 24.2 percent.


       Oregon adopted the first excise tax on gasoline in 1919, and within ten years

every state had one. Since each state chooses its own gasoline tax there is inevitably

variation between them, though in practice they display rough conformity. The second

column of Table 2 presents 2006 state gasoline sales tax rates (inclusive of additional fees

and charges) for states with the highest and lowest tax rates. The states vary from a high

tax rate of 32.9 cents per gallon in Wisconsin to lows of 8 cents per gallon in Alaska and

14 cents in Wyoming. States have taxed tobacco for much longer than they have

gasoline, and by 2006 managed to acquire considerable diversity in their rates, as

displayed in column 4 of Table 2. Rhode Island’s $2.46 per pack tax on cigarettes, and

New Jersey’s $2.40 tax, are breathtaking compared to the 7 cent tax per pack in South

Carolina, the 17 cent tax per pack in Missouri, and 18 cent tax per pack in Mississippi.


       The U.S. federal government never taxed general sales, and the U.S. state

governments adopted such taxes only within the last century. In this, the American states



                                             9
followed the rest of the world. As of 1918, only Germany among large countries

imposed a sales tax, and that at a paltry 0.1 percent rate; but the postwar financial

difficulties of European governments prompted several of them to introduce sales taxes

between 1918 and 1923. The idea had international appeal. West Virginia was the first

of the U.S. states to introduce a general sales tax, doing so in 1921; it was followed by

Georgia in 1929, and eleven more states in 1933, with additional states following shortly

thereafter. In the case of American states, the timing reflects the impact of the Great

Depression. Falling state tax revenues due to hard economic times, along with a desire to

reduce property tax burdens in order to prevent tax-driven foreclosures of property

owners, motivated states to look for new revenue sources that imposed burdens better tied

to contemporaneous ability to pay.1 By 2006 the Depression was a distant memory, but

nevertheless, all but five states -- Alaska, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, and New

Hampshire -- raise significant revenue with general sales taxes.


              U.S. Consumption and Excise Taxation in World Perspective


        The United States taxes consumption at very low rates compared to other

countries. Gasoline taxes are emblematic of this situation. As Table 2 indicates, U.S.

federal taxes on unleaded gasoline are currently 18.4 cents a gallon, and states average

21.57 cents per gallon. The combined federal and state rate of 39.97 cents per gallon

gives the United States the third lowest gasoline tax rate among the members of the

Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes the

30 highest per capita income countries. Column 2 of Table 3 displays excise taxes on

the forces behind the adoption of sales taxes in American states.


                                                   10
unleaded gasoline in OECD countries in 2003, rates that do not include VATs, general

sales taxes, or other charges that apply to general commodities. Gasoline taxes in the

United Kingdom are 6.7 times higher than in the United States, and there is not a single

country in Europe whose gasoline taxes are less than 2.75 times higher than those in the

United States. Japan’s tax rate is more than four times higher than the U.S. rate, and

Korea’s 5.5 times higher. Only Canada and Mexico among OECD countries have lower

gasoline taxes than the United States. While it does not necessarily follow that the rest of

the world is right in taxing gasoline heavily, while North America is wrong, these

comparisons do show that the United States and its North American neighbors differ

sharply from most other countries.


        Gasoline is not the only fuel that the United States taxes very lightly. The U.S.

average (federal plus state) tax rate of $9.20 per liter of distilled alcohol ranks 19th out of

the 26 OECD countries for which comprehensive data are available for 2003. Column 4

of Table 3 presents these average tax rates. The Scandinavian countries, Ireland, Turkey,

and the United Kingdom all tax hard alcohol at rates more than 3.4 times that of the

United States, whereas only the Czech Republic, Spain, Canada, Italy, the Slovak

Republic, and Hungary have lower tax rates. National tax rates on wine, beer, tobacco,

and other products can be more difficult to compare across countries, since the rates vary

with prices and product attributes, but any of these comparisons classifies the United

States as a low tax country.




                                              11
Composition of total tax revenues


        One of the reasons why U.S. excise tax rates are low is that the United States has

a smaller government sector than do most OECD countries, so all U.S. tax rates tend to

look low by comparison. One way to control for government size differences among

countries is to consider the relative contributions of different revenue sources. However,

such comparisons do little to change the impression produced by simple examination of

tax rates.


        It is instructive to compare ratios of revenues from specific taxes to total tax

collections for OECD countries in 2000. The numerator in this ratio includes revenues

from excise taxes and other charges that are product-specific, including customs duties

and taxes on insurance and certain financial operations. For the United States, federal

plus state and local revenues from specific taxes represent 6.3 percent of total tax

collections, the lowest of any OECD country (OECD, 2005, p. 25). Members of the

European Union collected an average of 10.2 percent of their government revenue from

specific taxes, and for the OECD as a whole (including the United States) the average

was 11.7 percent, close to double the corresponding U.S. figure.


        American exceptionalism is likewise evident in environmental taxation, the

intensity of which can be measured by ratios of revenues from environmental taxes to

total tax collections in 2000. The numerator of this ratio includes tax collections (defined

to exclude user fees) on energy products, motor vehicles and other transportation, waste

management, ozone-depleting substances, and what the OECD (2005) refers to as

“other.” In 2000 the United States collected only 3.4 percent of its total government



                                              12
revenues from environmental taxes, making its tax system the least environmentally

oriented of any OECD country. The next lowest ratios are Canada, at 3.8 percent, and

New Zealand, at 4.7 percent; the OECD average (including the United States) is 5.5

percent, and the European Union average is 6.7 percent, double that of the United States

(OECD, 2005, p. 111). Even these comparisons understate the extent to which the U.S.

tax system differs from other countries in effectively protecting the environment, since

the relatively small size of the U.S. public sector means that tax differences do

correspondingly little to change the relative prices of activities that harm the

environment.


Value-Added Taxes


       Value-added taxation, as practiced by most of the world, is simply a form of

general sales taxation. However, instead of being collected exclusively from the end-user,

as with U.S. state-level sales taxes, a VAT is collected from businesses as they sell their

output to intermediate and final buyers. Each firm first calculates the value-added tax on

its total revenues, and then takes a tax credit for taxes paid by firms from whom they

bought any intermediate inputs. Because each firm has an incentive to report fully what it

purchased from other firms, the VAT facilitates tax enforcement by requiring purchasers

to produce records of sales by other firms in order to claim VAT credits. Also, the

crediting aspect of value-added taxation ensures that sales taxes are not compounded on

goods that require multiple stages of production. As a result, VATs are efficient and

effective revenue collection devices, making them popular with governments, though

perhaps less so with some taxpayers. Metcalf (1995) and Ebrill et al. (2001) describe the

virtues and practice of value-added taxation.


                                             13
         The widespread adoption of value-added taxes is the major tax event of the

second half of the twentieth century. As late as 1966, only two countries (the Côte

d’Ivoire and Senegal) had introduced VATs; by 1985, 35 countries had done so; and in

2004, 134 countries collected significant tax revenue with VATs. Every OECD country

other than the United States uses VATs; the second column of Table 4 displays their

basic VAT rates during 2000. The average VAT rate in OECD countries other than the

United States is 17.7 percent, though there is considerable variation, with Denmark,

Hungary, and Sweden at the high end imposing 25 percent VAT rates, and Japan,

Canada, and Switzerland at the low end all using VAT rates in the 5.0 – 7.5 percent

range.


         The modest rates at which U.S. states tax general sales, together with the absence

of a VAT, implies that the United States taxes general consumption at lower rates than

any other OECD country. Column 4 of Table 4 presents ratios of revenues from general

consumption taxes to total tax collections for OECD countries in 2000. The general

consumption tax revenues in the numerator of this ratio include those raised by VATs,

the roughly equivalent goods and services taxes used by some countries, and general

sales taxes; this category excludes excise taxes and other specific taxes. In the United

States, 7.6 percent of all tax revenue comes from general consumption taxes, the lowest

fraction in the OECD; the next lowest fractions belong to Japan, at 8.9 percent, Australia,

at 12.1 percent, and Switzerland, at 13.1 percent. The average contribution of general

consumption taxes to total tax revenue in the European Union is 18.4 percent, and the

OECD average is 18.5 percent. While the difference between the 7.6 percent U.S. ratio

of general consumption taxes to total taxes and the OECD average of 18.5 percent may



                                             14
appear undramatic in the grand scheme of government finance, it is worth bearing in

mind that this constitutes a much larger percentage difference in fractions of government

revenue other than payroll taxes and other social insurance contributions.


How Anomalous is U.S. Consumption Tax Policy?


       U.S. consumption tax policy differs sharply from the policies adopted by other

countries. To what extent are these differences explainable across countries by factors

such as differences in per capita income, government centralization, and openness of the

economy?


       Table 5 presents univariate regressions in which the dependent variables are

measures of the extent to which countries rely on consumption taxes in raising

government revenue. The dependent variable in the regressions presented in columns 1-3

is the ratio of excise tax collections to total tax revenue, the sample consisting of the 26

OECD countries for which the relevant data are available for 2000. The –5.081

coefficient on log of per capita GDP in column one indicates that 10 percent higher per

capita national income is associated with a 0.51 percent lower ratio of excise to total

taxes. Since the mean ratio of excise to total taxes is 11.1 percent, 10 percent higher per

capita income is associated with a 4.6 percent decline in excise tax collections. Even

among wealthy countries, those with higher incomes rely somewhat less heavily than

others do on excise taxes – or, to put the same matter differently, rely rather more heavily

on income and other taxes.


       The regression reported in the second column of Table 5 explains the fraction of

excise taxes in total tax collections as a function of the extent to which the central


                                              15
government accounts for a country’s total – central plus subnational – expenditures. The

mean of this centralization measure is 72.3 percent in the sample of OECD countries.

The 0.168 coefficient in column two implies that centralized governments rely more

heavily on excise taxes than do other countries, such as the United States, that have

decentralized structures. The coefficient implies that a 10 percent greater share of central

government spending is associated with a 1.7 percent higher ratio of excise to total taxes,

roughly 15 percent of its mean value.


         The regression reported in the third column of Table 5 expresses the ratio of

excise taxes to total taxes as a function of economic openness, which is defined as the

ratio of the sum of imports and exports to GDP. The mean value of economic openness

among the 26 OECD countries is 92.6 percent, though the value for the U.S. economy

with its enormous internal market is only 26.2 percent. The 0.027 coefficient in the

regression indicates that greater economic openness is associated with stronger reliance

on excise taxes; its magnitude implies that increasing the openness of the U.S. economy

to the OECD average level would increase excise tax collections by 1.8 percent of total

taxes.


         The dependent variable in the regressions presented in columns 4-6 of Table 5 is

the ratio of the sum of VAT and general sales tax revenue to total tax collections. This

measure of reliance on general consumption taxation has a mean of 24.2 percent for the

sample of 25 OECD countries in 2000. The independent variables are the same as those

in columns 1-3. The –16.909 coefficient in column four implies that 10 percent higher

per capita national income is associated with a 1.69 percent lower ratio of general

consumption taxes to total taxes, a decline of 7 percent of its mean value. The 0.374


                                             16
coefficient in column five implies that a 10 percent greater share of central government

spending is associated with a 3.7 percent higher ratio of general consumption taxes to

total taxes, representing 15 percent of its mean value. The 0.030 coefficient in column

six, while not statistically significant, suggests that greater economic openness is

associated with stronger reliance on general consumption taxes.


       The regressions presented in columns one and two of Table 6 repeat the

regressions reported in Table 5, except that they use multivariate specifications that

include all three independent variables. The results are similar to those implied by Table

5, though the magnitude of the effect of government centralization is diminished by

roughly half in moving to the multivariate specifications. The dependent variable in the

regression reported in column three of Table 6 is the ratio of the sum of excise taxes and

general consumption taxes to total tax collections; this variable has a mean of 34.4

percent (though a U.S. value of only 13.9 percent). The estimated –9.183 coefficient in

column three implies that this measure of consumption taxation is negatively affected by

per capita income, though this is not statistically significant. The estimated 0.404

coefficient implies that a ten percent greater share of central government spending is

associated with a 4.0 percent higher ratio of consumption taxes to total taxes, and the

0.043 coefficient on economic openness suggests that greater openness likewise leads to

greater reliance on consumption taxes.


       The regressions presented in Tables 5 and 6 display patterns in which high-

income countries, those with decentralized political structures, and those with economies

that have relatively lower levels of international trade rely relatively little on consumption

taxes. However, the magnitudes of the coefficients are not enough to explain the U.S.


                                             17
avoidance of explicit consumption taxes. The regressions in Table 6 were re-run without

data for the United States, and the resulting coefficient estimates (which do not differ

much from those reported in Table 6) used to predict U.S. values of the dependent

variables. The differences between predicted and actual U.S. consumption taxes indicate

that, even after controlling for observable country differences, the United States has

unusually low rates of consumption taxation. The most sizable effect appears in the ratio

of excise taxes to total taxes, where the predicted value of 6.2 percent for the United

States greatly exceeds the actual U.S. ratio of 2.4 percent. This difference largely reflects

the very low gasoline tax rates in the United States. There is a more modest difference

between the predicted 12.2 percent ratio of U.S. VAT plus sales taxes to total taxes and

the actual ratio of 11.5 percent, but again a significant difference between the predicted

19.7 percent ratio of aggregate consumption taxes to total taxes and the actual U.S. ratio

of 13.9 percent. Controlling for economic conditions and the U.S. version of federalism

does not dispel the impression that the low rates of consumption taxation in the United

States involve some anomalous political choices.


                         Shifting Toward Consumption Taxes?


       The United States could shift toward collecting a greater share of its taxes in the

form of consumption taxes in several ways: by reforming its income tax to reduce the

taxation of capital income; by enacting a value-added tax and using the revenue to reduce

capital income taxation; or by expanding its current consumption taxes.


       The United States income tax has recently taken some mild steps in the direction

of consumption taxation by exempting from tax some portions of the return to saving.



                                             18
Since all income must be either consumed or saved, completely exempting saving (or,

what is equivalent, the return to saving) from taxation would mean that only consumption

is taxed. Permitting individuals to accumulate pension assets tax-free, and to use tax-

preferred savings accounts and other devices to shelter some portion of income derived

from saving, moves the system toward taxing consumption. While corporate income in

the United States continues to be taxed at high rates by international standards, the 2003

reductions in personal taxes on dividend income, together with favorable taxation of

long-term capital gains, attenuates some of the effect at the personal level.


       Despite these recent efforts to reduce the taxation of capital income, the U.S.

federal government refuses to embrace explicit consumption taxation as embodied in a

value-added tax. The President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (2005)

proposed a new “Growth and Investment Tax” with many consumption tax features,

including cash-flow business taxation and significantly reduced individual taxation of

capital income, but even this proposal retains some capital income taxation, and the Panel

report stopped short of recommending a new VAT alternative for the United States.

Broad-based consumption taxes such as value-added taxes clearly have enormous

international appeal, and they do not affect the return to saving and investing as long as

tax rates do not change over time. In contrast, income taxes, such as corporate income

taxes, and personal income taxes that include returns to saving and investing, are

extremely distortionary, since their effects compound over time. As a consequence,

efficient tax configurations typically entail zero capital income taxation over long time

horizons, since there exist much more efficient alternatives with the same distributional

properties as capital taxes.



                                             19
       The evidence surveyed in Auerbach and Hines (2002), along with the more recent

calculations of Feldstein (2006), suggests that the average efficiency cost associated with

raising one dollar of government revenue with commonly used U.S. tax instruments may

be as high as 75 cents or more, with the deadweight loss of capital income taxes

significantly higher than the average. Countries exposed to elastic international capital

flows have separate incentives not to attempt to tax capital income, as these countries

must offer international investors market rates of return, from which it follows that any

attempt to tax foreigners simply distorts the economy without extracting greater resources

from foreigners (Gordon and Hines, 2002). There is extensive evidence (surveyed in

Hines, 1999) that high source-based capital taxes, such as corporate income taxes,

significantly distort local economies by discouraging foreign investment. Since the costs

of taxing foreigners are borne by domestic factors in the form of lower wages and land

prices, and these costs include deadweight losses due to inefficient taxation, domestic

residents are made better off by removing any taxes on foreign investors and instead

directly taxing the returns to local factors of production. Hence it is perhaps not

surprising that governments around the world embrace VATs and other consumption

taxes that do not have these features.


       One of the political obstacles that a VAT or any other broad based consumption

tax must overcome in the United States is the concern, in some circles, that such taxes are

too efficient at raising revenue, that they too easily accommodate big government. While

there is little econometric support for the notion that the adoption of a VAT encourages

government growth (for example, Metcalf, 1995, p. 136), it is noteworthy that Michigan,

the only state in the country to use a VAT instead of a corporate income tax, taxed



                                            20
businesses more heavily with its VAT than did any other state with corporate income

taxes during in the years when Michigan’s VAT was in place (Hines, 2003, p. 607).


        A second important political obstacle facing any new U.S. VAT proposal is

distributional, grounded in the argument that a VAT would be significantly less

progressive than the current U.S. income tax system. The relevance of this concern

depends entirely on what other changes in the U.S. tax system would accompany the

adoption of a VAT. The U.S. government could adopt a VAT and simultaneously adjust

the personal income tax schedule to produce a tax system with the same, or even more

progressive, distributional features as the current tax system. For example, Michael

Graetz (2002) has proposed one version of such a comprehensive U.S. tax reform, that

includes a 15% VAT, elimination of personal taxes on the first $100,000 of income,

reduction of payroll taxes for low-income workers, and other features designed to

maintain progressivity.


        If dramatic changes to income taxes or implementation of a VAT encounter

political obstacles, another approach to swinging the U.S. tax system toward a greater

emphasis on consumption taxation would be to increase state sales taxes or state and

federal excise taxes. States already rely heavily on sales and excise taxes, and their

relatively small revenue requirements give states considerably less scope for

comprehensive consumption-oriented tax reform than is the case for the federal

government. But greater federal reliance on excise taxes would require addressing some

difficult theoretical, distributional, and practical concerns.




                                              21
       The received theoretical wisdom is that excise taxes can correct market failures

that accompany externalities, by having the tax rates set equal to marginal external

damages caused by consumption of the taxed good. This insight, commonly attributed to

Pigou (1920), suggests that excise taxes may be used in lieu of other regulatory

mechanisms to discourage activities that consumers would otherwise overdo. Strict

application of this logic requires sensitive tailoring of excise taxes to reflect differences

in marginal damages over time and between situations, but even in the absence of perfect

design, excise taxes can mitigate the problems that would otherwise accompany

congestion, pollution, and other externalities.


       There is considerable controversy over the level of excise taxation necessary to

correct externalities in practice. Assuming that the government is unable to distinguish

taxes on a customer’s first drink of alcohol, which has no external costs, from taxes on

the seventh drink just prior to driving a car, which has considerable external costs,

appropriate corrective policy entails a compromise between correcting externalities and

distorting ordinary consumer decisions. A similar logic applies to the costs of smoking,

air pollution, traffic congestion, and other externalities. Cnossen and Smart (2005)

conclude from their survey of the literature that a purely externality-correcting tobacco

tax would be much lower than existing tobacco taxes in Europe and the United States,

whereas Pogue and Sgontz (1989) maintain that externality-correcting alcohol taxes

would be twice the existing U.S. levels, and Kenkel (1996) argues that U.S. alcohol taxes

would need to be four to five times current levels properly to correct for externalities.

Gasoline taxes serve both to reduce traffic congestion and to improve air and climate




                                              22
quality, on the basis of which Parry and Small (2004) find that externality-correcting

gasoline tax rates for the United States are slightly more than double current tax levels.


         There is a separate question of the appropriate role, if any, of excise taxes in

discouraging the consumption of goods that may not have external effects, but are

nonetheless harmful to the individuals who consume them. Examples of such goods

include tobacco products, alcohol, and food with poor nutritional content (or any food in

excess of healthy levels).2 Irrational consumers may begin consuming these items

without fully appreciating the regret they will experience years later, and experience what

have been called “internalities.” In such settings, there could be a role for excise taxation

to help consumers by making it more expensive, and therefore less likely, to start early on

the path of overconsumption. O’Donoghue and Rabin (2003, 2006) analyze optimal

excise taxation in settings in which individuals have self-control problems (but

governments do not), and Gruber and Koszegi (2004) and Gruber and Mullainathan

(2005) offer applications to cigarette taxes.


         One concern frequently expressed about excise taxation is the potential

regressivity of the resulting tax burdens.3 The concern is that because the poor tend to

spend higher fractions of their income than do the wealthy, taxes based on expenditure

rather than income will put greater relative burdens on low-income individuals. There

are two important considerations to bear in mind in evaluating the distributional effects of

2
  These goods may also be responsible for externalities, through such mechanisms as second-hand smoke,
traffic accidents associated with alcohol, and government policies that provide benefits to individuals and
families harmed by overconsumption. Such externalities carry straightforward implications for corrective
taxation, but there remains the question of whether any additional tax is warranted due to the failure of
individual optimization.




                                                     23
excise taxation. The first is that the progressivity of excise taxes should be evaluated

from a lifetime perspective; for example, it would be a mistake to infer from the fact that

affluent retirees might have little current income but significant current expenditures that

excise taxes are regressive. Since lifetime (including intergenerational) consumption

tracks lifetime income very closely, flat-rate excise taxes look much like flat-rate income

taxes from a progressivity standpoint. Certain excise taxes might differentially impact

certain groups in the population, for example excise taxes designed to protect the

environment that might impose greater relative burdens on low-income individuals.

Poterba (1989, 1991) and Walls and Hanson (1999) analyze U.S. gasoline taxes from the

standpoint of lifetime incidence, finding that gasoline consumption rises more than

proportionally with affluence over much of the range of total spending, suggesting that

gasoline taxes are progressive, albeit less so than income taxes.


         The second, and more important, consideration is that, as with a value-added tax,

excise tax burdens must be understood in the context of the broader tax system. If, in the

course of pursuing environmental or other objectives, a country adopts excise taxes that

unduly burden one segment of the income distribution, the government can, if it wishes,

undo this distributional shift by adjusting its income tax schedule. As Kaplow (2006)

notes, selecting excise taxes can for this reason be done without connecting distributional

and other policy objectives.4 The same argument implies that excise taxes on luxury

items – such as the U.S. federal taxes on expensive furs and jewelry, luxury cars,


3
  Excise taxes also raise enforcement concerns, as do all taxes. In the United Kingdom, which boasts the
highest cigarette taxes in Europe, one in five cigarettes is purchased on the black market (Cnossen and
Smart, 2005, p. 45).
4
  This argument, which applies the findings of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), requires that preferences be
weakly separable between consumption and leisure, a restriction that, while unlikely to be strictly satisfied,
does little to reduce the power of the argument.


                                                     24
personal aircraft, and yachts, introduced in 1990 and since expired – are generally less

effective, and indeed never more effective, at redistributing income than are income tax

alternatives.


        Naturally, practical implementation of excise taxation differs from the ideal tax

systems analyzed in theory. For example, there is ample international evidence that

gasoline taxes and other taxes intended to protect the environment are not designed in

ways that achieve maximal environmental protection for any given level of total tax

burden (for example, Barde and Braathen, 2005). In part, this reflects that consumption

of the same good in different places or at different times may have quite divergent

environmental impact, while as a practical matter it is extremely difficult to design tax

rates that fit these differences. In addition, political processes offer no guarantees that

environmental taxes will be set with only environmental considerations in mind.

Widespread use of excise taxation focuses business interests in reducing tax rates on the

commodities that they sell, thereby encouraging extensive political lobbying and the

problems that accompany it. Moreover, the tax burdens that accompany excise taxes may

or may not be offset by compensating income tax changes. Political infighting need not

produce harmonious or efficient constellations of taxes.


                                         Conclusion


        Throughout most of American history, federal and state governments have relied

on excise taxes to collect significant revenues, with the modern era a notable exception.

The absence of value-added taxation in the United States, together with modest state sales

taxes and an unwillingness to intrude on individuals’ lives by imposing “sin” taxes at



                                              25
rates resembling those of other countries, leaves the United States taxing consumption

very lightly by international standards.


       Heavy American reliance on income rather than consumption taxation has not

served the United States well. The inefficiency associated with taxing the return to

capital means that the tax system reduces investment in the United States and distorts

intertemporal consumption by Americans, meanwhile discouraging U.S. labor supply no

less than would a consumption tax alternative. While the economic logic of consumption

taxation is compelling even for a closed economy, it is even more powerful for an open

economy exposed to the world capital market. Consumption taxes in the form of excises

can be designed to help protect the environment and control other externalities, whereas it

is much more difficult to pursue the same goals with income taxes. Excise taxes can also

serve the function of more closely aligning tax burdens with the benefits that taxpayers

receive from certain government services. There are understandable concerns about the

distributional consequences of consumption taxation, but a system that relies heavily on

consumption taxes, particularly if accompanied by an income tax, can be made as

progressive as any income tax the United States would realistically want to adopt.


       Will the United States, in time, come to resemble more closely the rest of the

world, perhaps by adopting higher gasoline taxes or a national value-added tax? The

opposition to higher gasoline taxes in the United States seems powerful and bipartisan.

As to the prospects for a value-added tax, the old line is that the United States does not

have a value-added tax because Democrats think it is regressive, and Republicans think it

is too easy to raise revenue with one. The country will get a value-added tax, the line

continues, once Republicans realize that it is regressive and Democrats realize that it is


                                             26
easy to raise revenue with one. Perhaps more likely is that the United States will

seriously entertain new consumption-oriented tax alternatives only when confronting a

financial crisis that admits no easy solution and cannot be ignored. After all, the need to

finance sudden wartime expenditures accounts for many of the past innovations in U.S.

taxation. But the political system may yet prove itself capable of creating periodic crises

even in the absence of external enemies, thereby furnishing opportunities to consider

adopting tax measures that have proved attractive in the rest of the world.

                 Per Capita GDP is measured in current U.S. dollars, and Openness of Economy is measured as the sum of imports and exports divided by
              GDP. Data are reported by the Penn World Tables edition 6.1. Degree of Govt. Centralization is measured as central government
              expenditure divided by the sum of central, state, and local government expenditure, with data obtained from the IMF Government Finance
              Statistics, January 2006 edition. The dependent variables measure specific tax revenues collected by the central (and where available state
              and local) government, divided by the sum of central, state, and local government tax collections. Data are obtained from the January 2006
              edition of the IMF Government Finance Statistics.
