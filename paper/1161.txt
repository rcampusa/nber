Housing Subsides: Effects on Housing Decisions, Efficiency, and Equity


                               ABSTRACT




      This paper surveys the effects of two of the most important

 federal policies toward housing: the "implicit subsidy" for owner—

 occupied housing in the income tax code, and the provision of housing

 for low income families at rents below cost. Emphasis is placed on

 the methodological problems that arise in attempts to assess the

 efficiency and distributive implications of these programs.

      Section 1 critically discusses the rationalization for a government

 housing policy. Section 2 investigates the econometric problems associated

 with estimating the effects of government policy upon housing decisions.

 The federal tax treatment of owner—occupation and how it affects the

 cost and demand for homeownership are discussed in Section 3. In

 Section 4, the positive and normative implications of U.S. policies for

 low income housing are evaluated.

      The conclusion notes that the policies under concern have led to a

 greater than efficient amount   of   housing consumption, and have on net


 probably   led to a more unequal distribution of income.

1. Introduction

1.1 The U. S. Housing Stock

     From virtually every point of view, housing is an important commodity.

In 1979, the value of the net stock of residential capital in the United

States was over a trillion dollars, measured in 1972 dollars.   (See Table

1.1.) Although it is difficult to summarize in a single measure the quality

of this stock, most experts agree that in general it is very high.1 In

1978, for example, only 3% of the housing units lacked some or all of their

plumbing facilities. Similarly, overcrowded housing which is characteristic

of many countries does not appear to be a widespread problem in the U.S.

In 1978, the median number of persons per owner—occupied unit was 2.7; for

renter occupied units the figure was 2.02. In 1970, only 7% of housing units

had more than 1.01 persons per room.3

     The flow of resources into housing continues to be large. In 1980,

out of $399.00 billion spent on fixed total investment, $104.0 billion went

into the residential capital stock. (See Table 1.2.) For the past two

decades, personal consumption expenditures on housing have been between
                                               4
nine and ten percent of gross national product. For purpose of compari.son,
Table 1.3 shows the ratio of residential investment to total fixed investment

in a number of countries. The U.S. does not appear to be an outlier.

    1.2     Government and Housing

            The Pmerican housing market is subject to a mind boggling array of

    government interventjorB by various levels of government.       These include;

 housing codes, which set quality standards that must be met by builders;

 licensure of real estate brokers and salespeople;
                                                            exclusionary zoning, which
 stipulates that land in a given area can       be   used only for certain purposes;

 open housing laws, which prohibit discrimination in the selling of housing;

 rent control; interest rate and other regulations on mortgage lending institu-

 tions; urban     renewal   programs, under which communities use their powers of

 eminent domain to acquire urban land, destroy "slums," and sell the land to

private developers; real estate taxation; and interventions in the credit

 market to incraase the flow of credit to housing (e.g., the Federal
 Home Loan Bank Board).6


           This essay focuses on what are probably the two most important federal

policies toward housing, at least in terms of costs to the government.7'             The
first is not even explicitly a housing program. It consists of certain provi—

sions of the federal income tax code which have the effect of lowering the costs
                           8
of owner—occupied housing.     The second is the provision of housing

for low income families at rents below cost. ,Both programs subsidize

the consumption of housing, the first mostly for middle and upper income groups,

the   second mostly for the poor. We will examine how each        affects economic

behavior, efficiency, and the distribution of real income.

         As will be seen below, a number of countries have similar policies.

Although most of our attention will be devoted to the American experience,

some international comparisons will also be made.



1.3       Rationalizations for Government Intervention
         Despite the fact that housing markets tend to be fairly
competitive (see Mills (undated) ),   it has been suggeted that government
action is required for reasons of efficiency as e11 as equity. Each of
these is discussed in 'turn.


1.3.1      Efficiency A±guments
           The most frequently encountered efficiency argument concerns extern-
alities in housing consumption. When an individual improves his property,

it increases the value of this investment. Simultaneously, the improvement

may increase neighbors' property va1ues.       However, an individual's calcula-

tion   of whether or not to undertake an improvement takes   into   account on].y
the effect on his investments,    not those of his   neighbors.. Thus, the
                                                                                       -
marginal   social benefits ofthe improvement exceed the private marginal          ..




costs,   and the 'rational' property. owner is   likely to invest less than a
socially
                                                                      .       .
           efficient amount.              .




           As a theoretical matter, it is hard to doubt that within a neighbor-

hood,    some kind of property value interdependence exists. But it is equally
                                      —4—


doubtful that all housing investments generate such externalities. Presunt—

ably, some such as painting outside walls create spillover effects. Others,

such as painting interior walls, do not. The usual Pigouvian analysis re-

quires that subsidies be targeted specifically at those activities that

produce the externalities. It is pretty certain that the federal subsidies

for owner-occupied housing, which in effect lower the cost of housing in

general, are inefficient.

     The empirical evidence for the existence of quantitatively significant

spillovers is weak. One would expect, for example, that       if externalities
were important anywhere, it would be in the slums, where housing density is

very high. Mills (undated, p. 15) notes that the presence of substantial

externalities     should provide a strong incentive for single ownership of neigh-

boring dwellings in such neihborhoods. No such tendency appears to exist.

Similarly, the literature reviewed by Muth (1973, p.. 35) indicates that the

removal of slums and     their   replacement by public housing does not have much

of an impact upon the values of surrounding properties. To the extent &uch

effects are present, they are probably due to the community facilities asso-

ciated with the public housing (e.g., playgrounds), rather than the removal

of   slum   dwellings r Se.

       Another externality sometimes mentioned is the "social cost of slums."

 The notion is that poor housing does more than merely lower neighborhood
 property values. It breeds crime delinquency, fires, disease, mental
                                        5



illness,    etc. (Weicher 1979, P. 491). It seems reasonable to believe, how-

ever, that it is the povery associated with poor housing, rather than the

housing per se, that causes these costly social problems. (See Mills (un-

dated)) or Aaron (1972, p. 22.)

     A quite different efficiency argument is that federal subsidies for

housing merely offset biases tqainst housing consumption which are induced

by local property taxes. The soundness of this view depends upon one's

view of the role of the property tax. To the extent that it is an excise

tax on housing,          the view has some merit. However, if the property

tax is just a fee for services provided by the community, then it is

really not a distortion.      Such a notion is consistent with the "Tiebout

model," in which househids shop around for the community whose bundle of

public services best suits their needs, and property taxes finance these

services.

   The Tiebout benefit-tax result holds exactly only under very restrictive

assumptions. Mills     (undated)   has argued that suburbs are more likely to

satisfy the conditions required for a Tiebout equilibrium than inner cities,

in part because suburbanites have more mobility than their urban counterparts.

Thus, the notion of a federal housing subsidy as an offset to a pre-existing

distortion   is probably more relevant to inner cities than suburbs. Again,
it is hard to justify subsidies for owner-occupied housing on this basis.



 1.3.2   Equity Arguments

         Housing   subsidies can also be rationalized in terms of redistributiOn

 al goals. B providing subsidized housing for the poor, a more egalitarian
                                       —6—



 income distribution can perhaps be achieved. It is hard to see the relevance

 of this point for subsidization of owner—occupied housing-, because the

 incidence    of owner—occupation incr3ases with income. (See Section 3 below.)

 Egalitarian    arguments cannot so easily be dismissed in the case of subsidized
 housing for low income individuals. But here a puzzle arises. It is well—
 known that if the government's sole objective is redistribution, and the
recipients' preferences are paramount, then using cash to redistribute
income is more efficient than a subsidy, in the sense that the same utility
level for the recipient can be reached with a smaller cash outlay.9

      If this is the case, how can one account for the prevalence of subsidies
and in—kind transfers? If the donor cares not only about the beneficiary's
utility     level, but the composition of the latter's consumption bundles   as
well,   then inducements for the beneficiary to consume certain commodities

may   be   efficient. Alternatively, attitudes toward housing may be influenced

by "commodity egalitarianism," the notion that "society"    cares not only
about the distribution of income per se, but also about the distribution
of certain "necessary" commodities (see Tobin (1970).) In 1949 the
U.S. Congress set as a national goal ". . . a decent home and a suitable
living environment for every ?nierican family." (Weicher (1979, p. 470.))
   Nichols and Zecl4thauser (1981) have suggested another possible rationaliza-
tion for in-kind transfers. Suppose that it is difficult for the welfare
authorities to determine who is qualified for a program and who is not. In

   mis argument is discussed more formally in SectiOn 4.2. As usual
it applies strictly only in the absence of other distortions of competitive
market price.
                                           —7—


other words, "welfare fraud" is a possibility. In the Nichols—Zeckhauser

model, in—kind transfers of inferior goods may discourage some impostors

from    applying for welfare. By forcing the "truly needy" to consume a
certain bundle, consumption efficiency is reduced. But program efficiency
increases, because the money is better targeted. The optimal design of
transfer    packages requires taking both kinds of efficiency into account.

   It is hard to know how important any of these considerations are in

determing policy. Perhaps it is the high visibility of housing that

leads   people to view it as a "problem" that must be dealt with publicly.

In any event, many economists find public policies based upon such pater-

nalistic principles to be quite unattractive from a philosophical view-

point, Indeed, Mills (undated) has suggested that in the U.S., official

paternalism toward low income groups may be tinged with racism ——        the   poor

are disproportionately black, and th.ere is an underlying expectation that

they cannot be expected to manage their lives without help.

   Another explanation for the existence of low income housing subsidies

is political. An in-kind subsidy tends to help not only the beneficiary,

but also the producers of the favored commodity. Thus, a transfer program

that increases the demand for housing will tend to benefit the building

industry,   which will then   lend its support to a coalition in favor of the

program. As indicated in Section 4.1 below, housing programs for the poor

have focused on the construction of new units, thus benefitting the housing

industry rather directly.

   It is also important   to   note that   unlike   cash transfers, the administra-

tion   of a public housing program requires substantial amounts of resources.
                                          -8—



 (Contracts must be arranged, standards set arid enforced, etc.)     According
 to most theories of bureaucratic behavior (see, e.g., Niskanen (1971)),

 one would therefore expect public employees to put their political support

 behind low income housing progrms. In 1977, when welfare reformers proposed

 that subsidized housing be phased out and replaced with cash grants, the

 Department of Housing and Urban Development (H.U.D.) was in vigorous opposi-

 tion (Weicher (1980, p. 51)).



1.3.3 Summary and Evaluation10

          The main efficiency argument for subsidizing housing is the exist-

ence of externalities. However, the mechanisms through which these exter-

nalities work are not well understood and there is little evidence that

they are quantitatively important. The redistributive rationalization is

equally weak. To the extent that society seeks to distribute income to the

poor, the subsidies to owner—occupation are perverse, because as will be seen

below, they benefit mainly the middle and upper income classes. The in—kind

subsidies involved in low income public housing are inefficient in the sense

that the poor could be made better off if the transfers were made directly in

cash.     Paternalism and political   considerations seem to be the sources of this

policy.




10        We have discussed housing   policies in terms of the traditional   goals
of equity and efficiency. It has been argued that public housing can be an
effective means of alleviating racial discrimination in housing. (See. e.g.,
Suxnka and Stegman (1978, pp. 409-410)). Even if it does have someefficacy,
however, the question is whether or not there are more efficient     ways of
achieving this end.

2.      Methodological Issues

      The theoretical considerations of the last section left unanswered

many important empirical questions that surround housing policy. It may

be, for example, that even if the policy is inefficient on a priori grounds,

the actual magnitude of the distortions is small. Similarly, without exam-

ination of the data, one cannot assess the distributional effects of the

policy.

      In order to investigate such issues, one must first understand how

the consumers and producers of housing make their decisions. Some special

aspects of housing as a commodity make it difficult to use the standard

theoretical and econometric tools. Because these difficulties crop up in

virtually every empirical study of housing, we discuss them now all

together, rather than later on a piecemeal basis.


2.1 Specifying a Model

      In general, the effect of a housing policy is to change the price of

housing services facing a household, and perhaps its disposable   income    as

well. (For example, a subsidy at rate s would change the effective price
                                                  0                  Therefore,
of   housing services from its initial value, say h' to (l—s)p).

given   price and income elasticities, one can predict individuals' responses
to   given policies. These considerations suggest the following strategy:

Employ   appropriate econometric techniques to estimate the demand   and   supply

for   housing services, using either cross—sectional or time series data.        This


yields   a set of the relevant elasticities. Then, assuming that people would
react to the price and income differences generated by the policy in the same
way as those generated "naturally," use the elasticities to estimate the
                                                —10—



 program's impact on behavior. We discuss problems in estimating demand

 and supply functions, and     then   turn to the influence of the market environ-

ment upon the results.


2.1.1 Demand11

         Empirical investigators typically begin by specifying a model that
relates    the quantity of housing services demanded for the th observation
.(QD)    , to some function f() of price          income (Y.) and a vector
of demographic variables          that theoretical considerations suggest might
be relevant:

(2.1)                                 =
                                          f(PhilYj;zj)
In some cases f ( •)   is specified in an ad hoc but convenient form. such
as   log linear (Polinsky and Eliwood (1979)), while other times itis derived

from maximization of an explicit utility function (bbot and Ashenfelter

(l976), which is also chosen on the basis of convenience.

         Equation (21) is deterministic, so the next step is to posit some

stochastic specification. Usually, an error term is appended additively.

                                                                  and Z.
                                                                          1
                                                                              and the

stochastic specification, the model's parameters             can be   estimated using a
variety of econometric techniques. The behavioral elasticities implied
by the parameter   estimates   can then be used to predict the effects of
policy   changes. Alternatively, one can obtain such predictions by sub-

stituting the new values for price and income directly into equation .                  1).

         There    are several problems with this standard approach:

          (1)    Economic theory puts very few constraints on the form of f (-),
 so   the investigator must make     an   essentially ad hoc choice with respect to
 the specification of either the demand or utility function.
          (2) It must be assumed that f(-) is identical across individuals.
  (When time    series data are used, the analogous assumption is that f(-) does
 not   change over time.)

          (3)    Demand functions   like (2.1) ignore the dynamic nature of housing
 decisions. Because these decisions are         made in a life   cycle context, expected
 future prices and     incomes   as well as those of the current period are relevant.
  (See Henderson arid    lonnides   (1981) or Weiss (1978).)
          (4) Observations on hi are never directly observed. Only p. x                ——



 the   value of the dwelling —- is observable.
          (5) For many      owner—occupiers,   housing is not only a consumption item,
 but   an investment as well. To the extent this is the case, the theory          of
 portfolio      behavior suggests that the demand for housing depends upon the

 joint distribution of the returns from housing and other assets. Even those

 econometric studies discussed below which explicitly recognize the invest-

 ment nature of housing decisions have failed to take into account         this
 consideration.




12     Note that     this
                      need not imply that the elasticities be identical across
individuals; such will be the case only for the very simple Cobb—Douglas speci-
fication. One can also specify a random coefficients model, which allows for
a distribution of elasticities across people. See King (1980).

       (6) It must be assumed that the fitted relationship will continue

to apply when a right hand side variable for a given observation changes.

For example, if an investigator using cross—sectional data finds that


3QD        hi    is   less than one, it does not imply that increasing a particular



family's income ten percent will increase its housing consumption by a smaller

percentage. Al]. that one really learns is that in the data, poorer             families
devote a larger fraction of their income to housing than richer families,

ceteris paribus. Only by assuming that poorer families would act like the

richer ones if their incomes were increased, and vice versa, can one give

any behavioral significance to elasticity estimates from regressions.

      Moreover, most of the studies using cross—sectional data to examine housing

demand implicitly or explicitly assume that all agents are in equilibrium)3

Were not this the case, then a regression of housing services on price, in-

come, and demographic variables could not be interpreted as a demand equa-

tion. On the other hand, analyses of longitudinal and time series data

often allow for the possibility that at a given point in time, households

may not be at    their long-run equilbrium positions,     because adjustment costs

make it prohibitively     expensive to respond   immediately   to   changes   in economic
environment.
      It is usually assumed that such a disequilibrium is eliminated over
time as households move gradually to their equilibrium positions (e.g., Rosen

 and   Rosen (1980)). Such models lack a strong choice theoretic foundation,
                                                                                     -

moving decisions. Their results confirm earlier conjectures that these costs
are large relative to income ($60 per month in a sample of low income house-

holds whose median monthly income was $320.)


 2.1.2 Supply
          A popular approach for studying the supply of housing is to assume

 some housing production function, estimate its parameters, and use them to

 infer the shape of the supply function.14 For example, Ingrain and Oron

 (1977) assume that housing services are a constant elasticity of substi-

tution     (C.E.S.) function of "quality capital" and "operation inputs" (p.284) -
Polinsky    and Ellwood (1979)    also posit a C.E.S.   production function, but

 assume that its arguments are land and capital. Follain (1979) and           Poterba
 (1980) eschew selection of a specific form for the        production   function,

 and   instead   start   by postulating supply functions that include the    price
of housing and input costs as arguments.           (Of course, duality considerations

 suggest   that one can work backward from the supply curve to the underlying
production function.)
      The specification of        the underlying technology can   sometimes pre-
determine    substantive results. For example, since Polinsky and Eliwood (.1979)




14     Given the production function and input prices, one can derive           the
marginal cost schedule which, under competition, is the supply cuXve.

 assume constant returns to scale (p. 210) the implied long run upp1y

 curve of housing services is perfectly elastic, regardless of parameter
              15
 estimates.        Postulating such a technology, then, guarantees the result

 that policies that affect housing demand will have no effect on the long

 run producer's price of housing services, at least as long as input prices

 remain unchanged. The interesting questions then become how high do prices

rise in the short run, and how much time is required to reach long run

equilibrium?

         Various approaches have been used to model the process of adjust-

ment to the new equilibrium. Ingram and Oron (1977, p. 292) assume that

the most a landlord can invest each period is limited to the amount of

cash generated by the existing investment, even if this is insufficient

to close the gap between the desired and actual housing stock. Poterba

(1980) argues that the -supply of housing may be affected by conditions in

the credit market, and summarizes these by the flog of savings deposits

received by savings and loan associations. Poterba also assumes a delayed

supply   response to changes in all right-hand side variables, which       are

entered   in polynomial distributed lags. (p. 10).

2.1.3 Market Environment
          In microeconomettic studies of demand or     supply,   the key question
is    how individual units react to exogenous changes in their budget con-

straints. No explicit consideration of the market environment is usually

taken. To understand      overall effects, however, the    question of market

structure   is crucial --   the   impact   of a given housing policy will depend

15    The assumption of a horizontal supply curve is quite common, e.g.,
see DeLeeuw and Stryuk (1975, p.15). Of course, to the extent that input
prices change with the size of the housing industry, the long run supply
curve will have a non—zero Slope.
                                      -15-


  upon its effect upon the market price of housing, which will in turn de-

 pend mutatis mutandis upon the degree of competiveness in the market, the

 amount of slack existing when the program is initiated, the extent of

 housing market segmentation, etc.

        The standard assumption is that competition prevails. As de Leeuw

 and Struyk (1975) and Poterba (1980) note., however, even given competi—

 tion, complications arise because two markets have to be equilibrated by

 the price of housing services: the market for existing houses and the

 market for new construction. The situation increases in complexity when

 one takes into account the multiplicity of tenure modes. Each type of

 housing is traded in its own submarket, and each of these (inter—related)

 markets has its own clearing price. If the housing market is non—competitive,

 the question of supply effects is even more difficult because of the
                                                               16
 absence of a generally accepted theory of price determination.


        In practice, most econometric investigations of the issues discussed

in this essay ignore such considerations. As will be seen below, attention

tends to be focused upon the estimation of demand curves. It is usually

assumed that the housing market is perfectly competitive, and that the

long supply curve of housing services is infinitely elastic.17




16     An example of the use of a non—competitive framework is Rydell
(1979), who attempts to explain the insensitivity of housing prices to
apparent variations in   market tightness by recourse to a theory of mono-
polistic competition.


17    An exception is Englund and Persson (forthcoming). In their simulation
model of the Swedish housing market, they assume that the supply of housing
services is perfectly inelastic.

2.2    Measuring Quantity and Price
       Our discussion of model specification suggests that accurate

measurement of the quantity and price of housing services is crucial. This

is a very difficult task, because housing is intrinsically a multi—dimension-

al commodity ——   a dwelling is characterized by its number of rooms, their
size, the quality of construction and plumbing, etc, It is therefore not

obvious how to summarize in a single number the quantity of housing

services generated by a given dwelling. Usually it is assumed that the

amount of housing services is proportional to the rent paid, or, in the

case of an owner-occupied dwelling, to the value of the house. (See, e.g.,

Polinsky and Eliwood (1979).) A problem here is that the rental value of

a dwelling at a given time may reflect characteristics of the market that

have nothing to do with the quantity of housing services actually generated.

As King (1980) points out, for example, the special income tax treatment of

rental income will generally influence market values.18

       An   alternative   tack would be to abandon the possibility of summar-

izing housing services in a single variable, and instead to estimate a

series of demand functions for various housing attributes. An immediate

problem is the bsence of observable market prices for attributes. Recent—

ly Witte, et.al (1979) have implemented the suggestion of Rosen (1974) that

attribute demand   equations   be estimated in a two step process: (1) esti-

mate the implicit attribute prices from an hedonic price equation19 for


18      Other problems with the concept of housing services are discussed
by Diamond and Smith [1981).

19     A regression of the price of a commodity R on its characteristics
 (a vector X ) is the basis ohan hedonic price index for the commodity.
The implicit price of the i      characteristic is        .  See Rosen
L1974).
                                         —17—



 housing; and (2) use these prices as explanatory variables in regressions

 with attribute quantities as the dependent variables.          However, Brown and

 Rosen (1.982) have shown that major statistical pitfalls are present in this

 procedure, and that the validity of Witte, et al's results is therefore in,

 question. Although some progress is being made in dealing with these

 problems    (see Quigley (1982 ), the   approach that continues to predominate

 is to measure the quantity of a dwelling's housing services by its market

 value (if it is owner—occupied) or otherwise by its rental value.

          Because the price of housing services is housing expenditures

divided by the quantity of housing services, the above noted difficulties

in measuring the latter are bound to create problems in
                                                                measuring price.
Several possible solutions are found in the literature. A popular ap-

proach is to estimate hedonic price equations for different cities, and

use them as the bases for a housing price index. However, Alexander (1975)

has pointed out several problems with this approach. One of the most

important is that the selection of a set of attributes to be included in

the hedonic price index must be decided on ad hoc grounds, but the sub—

stantive implications of the estimates often depend upon the choice made.

       Further   difficulties in measuring price are caused by the    fact that

even within a given housing market, the price per unit of housing servi:es
may not be a constant.. Struyk et.al., (1978) have argued that one of the
key characteristics of urban housing     markets is     the existence of sübmarkets,
each   of which has   different prices per unit   of   housing services. (Such
differences      might exist because of residential segregation.) Most empirical

studies, however, continue to assume that any given city is characterized by

a single (pre—tax) price of housing.

 2.3      Measuring "Shift" Variables

          In order to obtain unbiased estimates of demand and supply parameters,

one must also take into account variables other than price that might he

affecting decisions. On the demand side, probably the most obvious candi-

date is income. Standard theoretical considerations suggest that for in-

come    a permanent rather than annual measure should be used. It is not ob-
vious how to compute permanent income, and      investigators have dealt with
the    problem in various ways. Carliner (1972) and Rosen (1979), analyzing

longitudinal data, take an average of several year's worth of annual income.

Struyk (1976) uses the fitted value of a regression of income on a set of
                                                              20
personal characteristics as his permanent income measure.          In time series

analyses, a distributed lag on income is often used.        (See, e.g., Hendershott

and Shilling (1980).)

          With respect to the selection of other shift variables, investigators

have to make arbitrary decisions with respect to which ones to choose, their

measurement,    and how they interact with the other variables. Typical
candidates    for inclusion are race, sex of head of household, age, number
of    children, etc.
              supply side, theory suggests that input prices are important
          On the

variables. There are serious problems involved in obtaining operational
measures of housing input   costs. For     example, Poterba (1980) uses the
Boeckh index of the    price of   inputs for a new one family structure to


.20   Neither the necessity of using a permanent income measure
nor the types of solutions just mentioned are unique to the study of housing;

  measure construction costs. Although this is a commonly used index, it

  is well—known that it is deficient because fixed weights are used in its

  computation. Ingrain and Oron (1977) use the fuel component of the con-

  sumer' s price index to account for the price of all
                                                                  operating inputs, but
  as Rothenberg       (1977) points out, it is not clear that this index captures

  all the needed information.



  2.4

           The quandries facing students of housing are similar to those who

  seek to explain other kinds of complicated economic behavior (e.g., the

 determinants of business investment). Although it is easy to carp about

 the siznplifications made by econometric investigators, compromises are re-

 quired in    order   to obtain tractable models. On        the   other hand, in light

 of the serious methodological problems, one must regard substantive con—

 clusions regarding policy with a very critical eye.



 3.        Housing Behavior and the Federal Income Tax
           In this section we discuss:        (1) the key provisions of the income

 tax code that pertain to housing; (2) how the provisions change the             effec-
 tive cost of housing; (3) the impact of these cost changes upon iñdividuals

 housing decisions; (4) the implications of these changes for economic

 efficiency and equity; and (5) some proposals that have been made for

 reform.



3.1       Housing Related Tax    Provisions

          Exclusion   of   Net Imputed   Rental. The U.S.   federal   tax code does not

require   that   the net value of the services received by owner—occupants from
their homes be included as taxable income. If these same units were rented out,

the income obtained would be taxed, after deductions for taxes, interest,

maintenance, etc. In other words, because an investment in owner—occupied

housing produces in—kind income rather than cash, that income is untaxed.

income the full value of all interest payments, including the interest on

 from potentially heavy tax burdens when they decide to become renters or

move to less costly residences were first introduced.in 1964. The cut-off

age at that time was 65 years and the exemption was available only under

special    circumstances. In light of this provision and the one concerning

deferral just discussed, most investigators have found it safe to assume

that for all practical purposes, the tax rate on capital gains from owner—

occupied housing is zero.

          Exclusion of Income from Tax Exempt Mortgage Bonds. In 1978 states

and localities began to sell tax exempt bonds to provide mortgage funds

for owner-occupied and rental units at below market interest rates. However,

in   1980, significant limits were imposed on the issuance of new tax exempt
bonds, and issues to finance new single family housing are now banned be-
ginning   in 1983.

        Table 3.1 shows some estimates of the foregone tax revenues

associated with the various exclusions discussed above. Note that these

estimates are based on the assumption that even if the provisions were

eliminated, people would continue to make the same housing decisions. As

both common sense and the empirical evidence reported below indicate,

this is an unrealistic assumption. Nevertheless, the figures in the table

at least indicate the orders of magnitude involved. The Congressional Budget

Office estimated that if all the tax preferences associated with housing

(except exclusion of imputed rent) were eliminated, it would be possible to

lower all personal marginal tax rates by 10% without sustaining any revenue

loss. (Congressional Budget Office 0.981, p. 40)).

          The main federal tax item concerning rental housing is accelerated

 depreciation. Owners of rental property may claim accelerated depreciation

 on their buildings, and amortize construction period interest and real estate

 taxes over a ten year period, rather than the full economic life.23 The Con-

 gressional Budget Office (1981, p. 33) estimated that the foregone tax revenues

due to the tax treatxent of rental housing were about $1.9 billion. in'. 1981,

 considerably less than those associated with owner—occupation.

          With respect to tax concessions for housing interest payments, the

 United States is roughly comparable to Western Europe. Fainstein (1980) esti-

 mates that the revenue loss as a percentage of gross domestic product in the

 early 1970's was about 0.3% for Germany, 0.9% for the Netherlands, 1.1% for

 Sweden, 0.7% for the United Kingdom, and 0.6% for the United States. England,

like the United States, levies no tax on imputed rental income (since 1963).

On the   other hand, some form of imputed net rental is taxed in Belqiun, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and West'.Germany.

ownership would be t X N Under the current regime, the main ta
consequences of homeownership are to reduce taxable income by the sum of

MI and T ,      or   alternatively, to reduce tax liability by t X (MI+T). To

find the difference between tax liabilities under the status quo and

those which would occur if net imputed rent were taxed, we simply compute

of house value d. Then (3.2) can be written as .T(i+t)V,

 Suppose that          = .025, i = .06, d = .03, arid the individual's marginal tax

 rate is 0.2. The substitution into (3.4) indicates that the federal income

 tax   lowers   the cost of owning by about 15%. For an individual with the same

 circumstances but a marginal          income tax       rate   of 0.4, the difference would be

about 30%. The amounts involved are substantial, and increase with the

marginal   tax rate, ceteris pribus.

          Hendershott        and Shilling (1980, pp. 3-6). provide a more, detailed

analysis of the costs of owner—occupation which is based on the analogy

between    the cost of housing services arid            the    "user cost of capital" from

the literature on the neoclassical theory of investment.25 Their deriva-

tion makes clear exactly what assumptions are required to obtain a simple

expression like (3.3). It begins with the notion that in

equilibrium,.one expects that the present value of the net cash

flows from      a   house will equal the initial equity investment. The positive

cash flows consist of the net imputed rent from the house, and a lump sum
received at the selling date. The negative cash flows include the after—tax
costs of mortgage and property taxes, the selling costs at the date of sale,
and the   outstanding        mortgage debt due at the          time   of the sale. Hendershott
and Shilling        assume   that:

 at rate p , and in housing prices at rate q


          (ii) Physical depreciation of the house occurs at rate d -

 the stream of imputed rents, the after tax cost of property taxes,     the
 mortgage payments, the tax savings from interest reductions, arid the

 net "profit" from selling the house. Note that the income tax rate is

 not included in the last term. This reflects the realistic approximation

 that the rate on housing capital gains is zero.


            Hendershott and Shilling go on to show that if: (i) The mortgage i5

expected to remain at the constant value i through period N; (ii) The

        The crucial difference between (36) and       (3.3)   is the presence of

q ,   the   expected rate of increase in housing prices. When homeowners ex-

pect capital gains, it lowers their effective cost of housing.       This tact

is often ignored in popular discussions of housing markets. The expecta-

tion of rising prices is an incentive to buy a house provided that

households     are not constrained in their ability to borrow in the capital
markets.
        The fact that housing capital gains are untaxed is reflected by the

fact that q is not multiplied by U—t7) .         As a result, the decrease In

 the cost of housing as the inflation rises is greater for individuals with

 high values of            To see this, assume for simplicity that increases in

 the inflation rate are matched by increases in the nominal interest rate,

 i. e.,      =1   .   Then taking the derivative of (3.6) with respect to q

 yields

                                                 y

Clearly, even if nominal interest rates increase on less than a one—for—one

basis with inflation, the tax advantages associated with the deduction of

nominal interest payments will still be greater the higher the tax rate,

though the magnitude will be less.

          Hendershott and Shilling evaluate (3.5) on a quarterly basis       from

1955 through 1979. As usual, some arbitrary decisions have to be made         to
estimate expected inflation rates. They compute the general expected in-

flation rate as a 16 quarter distributed lag on current and past rates

of change in          prices.   In Table 3.2 we present annual averages of

Hendershott and Shillings' quarterly figures.         The first column is based

upon a marginal income tax rate of 0.30; the second of 0.45. The figures

make clear that the cost of owner     occupation     fell dramatically in the 1970's,

a phenomenon due largely to increases in the inflation rate.
                                                                    26     also

that the higher marginal tax rate is associated with a low user cost, as

expected.

          As Hendershott and Shilling note, even this relatively elaborate.

estimate of the user cost of capital suffers from inadequacies. For example,



26    Presumably, if Hendershott and Shilling had used each year's average
value of r , rather than keeping it constant over time, an even greater
decline wouYd have been evident, given that inflation was pushing people
into higher personal income tax brackets. See Hendershott and Slemrod (1981)
for a discussion of the problems involved in computing the marginal tax
rate relevant for hoineownership decisions.

it    does not take into account people's expectations on the future course
of tax policy. Neither does it allow for the holding period or deprecia-
tion rate to vary with the tax structure. Similar problems, of course,
                                                                                        S
have   been encountered in attempts to estimate the after tax costs      of

business capital.

         Hendershott and   Schilling use a - similar   framework to derive    -.-   -

the   user cost of   rental occupation. (The equilibrium condition takes into

account the federal tax    provisions   for rental housing.) Their    calculations
are   reported in the third column of Table 3.2.       Over time, renting has become
expensive relative to owning. The implications of this phenomenon are          dis-
cussed below.

          It is common to refer to the tax induced lowering of the relative

 cost of owner—occupation as an "implicit subsidy" of owner—occupied housing..

Alternatively, housing related deductions are viewed as "tax expenditures",

 items that are exempt from tax but which would be included under a compre-

 hensive tax base. Although we follow this practice, it should be noted

 that some object to it strenuously. First of all, in order to characterize

 an item as being "exempt", one must first have some kind of criterion for

 deciding what "ought" to be included. As is well known, there exists no

 rigorous set of principles for determining what belongs in income.

 (Musgrave (1959)).

          In addition, the tax   expenditure concept has been attacked on more
philosophical grounds:

                 "...The tax expenditure concept implies that all income
                 belongs of right to the government, and      that
                                                              what
                 government decides, by exemption on qualification, not
                 to collect in taxes constitutes a subsidy. This
                 violates a widely held conviction, basic to the American
                 polity...that the income earned by the people belongs to
                 them, not the government." (Jones, (1978, p. 53) ) -
                                                —29—




 Characterizing    the tax provision discussed herein as a "subsidy" is not

 meant to carry these ideological implications, but merely to describe their

 impact on the cost of owner-occupation.



 3.3      Effects on Behavior

 3.3.1 Housing Decisions

         Laid].er's (1969) early attempt to assess the impact of the federal tax

 treatment of housing upon housing decisions begins with an estimate of its

 effect upon the cost of housing for each of several income groups. This is

done by evaluating expression (3.4) with reasonable values of the appropriate

parameters. (All     parameters   except the marginal tax rate are constant across

income   groups.) To find the amount       of   housing demand generated by these tax
induced price changes, Laidler assjmes a price elasticity of demand of -1.5,
a figure consistent with much of the econometric literature completed at the
time of his study. He finds that in 1960, the housing stock of $355,369

million dollars would have been $60,699 million smaller had imputed rent been

taxed.27 This calculation assumes that the long run supply of housing services

is   perfectly elastic, an    assumption   that is in line with some econometric
evidence.
         One problem with the     Laidler estimates is that the price elasticity
used   is based   upon   econometric studies which ignore the impact of taxes

upon the relative price of housing. In addition, attention is focused
only upon the quantity of      housing consumed by owner-occupiers, with no
attempt made to incorporate the effect of taxes upon the tenure choice.
Subsequent work has attempted to remedy these problems.

                                           —30—


         Rosen L979) uses cross-sectional U.S. data from 1970 to estimate

jointly equations for the quantity of housing services demanded and the tenure

choice. He assumes that the demand for housing services by owners (conditional

upon owning) is a translog function in the relative prices of owner—occupied

housing and permanent income, with an intercept which depends upon    the
individual's personal characteristics.28 The price of owner—occupied housing

is based upon equation (3.3). A probit equation is used to model the choice

between renting and owning. The choice depends upon the relative prices of

both   owner and renter-occupied housing, permanent income, and the same set     of

demographic   variables as in   the demand function. The two equations axe. estimated

using a statistical procedure which corrects for possible biases associated
with the fact that the assortment of people into tenure modes in not random.

(Heckman (1979).)
        The results indicate    that the price elasticity of demand for owner—

occupied   housing services evaluated at the mean   is —1.0; the income elasticity,
about   0.76.29 The sign of the price-income interaction term is positive,

implying that the   price   elasticity of demand falls with income. The effective

price   of owner—occupied housing also enters the tenure choice equation with a
negative   sign, while income affects the probability of owning positively.

                                                                                 -


28     These include age of head of household, number of dependents under
age 17 in the family unit and age and sex of head of household. Permanent
income is a four year average of annual income.
 29 McRae and Turner (1981) argue that allowing for the impact of taxes upon
f actor input ratios in the production of owner-occupied housing would lead to a
lower estimates of the income elasticity of demand. Unfortunately, .
they study only purchasers of homes with mortgages from the Federal Housing
Aaniinistration (FHA), a rather unrepresentative sample.
                                            —31--



        The parameter estimates are used to predict how housing decisions

would change if net imputed rent were taxable. Such a change would gener-

ate a new value of the price of owning for each family. 30(Assuming that

the long run supply curve of housing services is perfectly elastic, the

possibility of changes in the pre-tax price of housing services can be

ignored.) By substituting these new values into the probit equation, the

expected proportion of homeowners under the new regime can be calculated.

Similarly, by substituting into the demand equation, the expected amount

of   housing demanded condithnal on owning can be predicted.
         The results are shown in Table 3 .3. Taxation of net imputed rent
produces substantial reductions in the expected amount of owner—occupied
housing demanded.      Although   families in the   highest income brackets face

greater   increases in the price    of housing, their demand is sufficiently

less price elastic that their demands actually fall by smaller amounts.

The third column shows how the expected percentage of homeowners decreases

due to the removal of the tax advantages. The average change in the inci-

dence of owner—occupied housing for the entire sample is 4.4%.          In another
simulation, Rosen assum        that the removal of the housing tax subsidy is

accompanied      by a proportional reduction in marginal tax rates so as to keep
tax   revenuesconstant. Despite the income effects so generated, ther are
still sizeable decreases in the quantity of housing demanded and in the
percentage of homeowners     in   each income bracket.


30 Specifically, the price of a unit of housing services would rise from
$1 —
       T(l+.r)      (see equation 3.4)   to $1.

          King   (1980)   studies   the impact of taxes on housing decision in the

United    Kingdom, where, as noted in Section 3.1, the tax treatment of housing

is similar to that of the United States. Like Rosen (1979), he examines

both the tenure choice and the quantity of services demanded conditional on

that choice. In Rosen's analysis the two decisions are modelled in an ad

hoc fashion, so that there is no guarantee that the estimates are consistent

with a single underlying utility function. In contrast, King derives both.

equations from the same structure of preferences.

          Another important feature of King's model is that it allows for the

possibility that there is rationing in the choice of tenure modes. In the

United Kingdom, essentially three types of dwellings are available; owner—

occupied, government subsidized rental, and unsubsidized furnished rental.

Mortgages are not freely available in the U.K., and are rationed among

applicants. In addition, admission to the subsidized rental sector is

also rationed. King assumes that the household chooses the unsubsidized —

rental    sector only if it is rationed out of the other two.

          In King's model, preferences are represented by a homothetic transiog

indirect utility function,

function parameters.         On the basis of a suitable stochastic specification,

King eomputes   the probability that         each individual will be observed in a

given    tenure' mode as a finction          of the utility

function parameters, and hence is able to deduce the likelihood function.

The     's are then estimated by maximum likelihood.

           An unusual aspect of King's model is that he does not
                                                                 include any
 controls    for the demographic situation of the family, as is common in

 most housing demand studies. Income and the relative price of housing

 are    the only explanatory variables. King does assume a "random coeffjcj"
 model, i.e., that        and2 are to be regarded as means of the relevant
 distributions.
          King estimates the model with cross sectional
 data   from..1973-74 for England and   Wales. -          He   finds
 (s.e.=.0008) and 2O.0238 (s.e.=.0009). Perhaps more useful are        the
implied price elasticities of demand for housing. Evaluated at the means,
the   price elasticity of demand for owner—occupied housing is —.523; for
subsidized rental, -0.498; and for furnished rental, —0.645. (p.156.)
This elasticity for owner-occupation is somewhat less than Rosen's (i979).
figure of about —1.0 for U.S. data. King's analysis does not provide an
estimate of the income elasticity, because a value of 1 is imposed by the
utility function (3.7).
       A disturbing aspect of King's results is that a statistical test
of the hypothesis that the utility functions for the discrete and continu-
ous choices are identical is rejected at conventional significance levels.
He suggest two explanations for this finding. One is that different
spouses are responsible for different parts of the decision, and the two
spouses may have different utility functions. The second is that the as-
sumption that rationing probabilities are exogenous results in a serious
model misspecification. Presumably, this latter deficiency could be
corrected by making the rationing probability a function of some observ-
able demographic chracteristics. But it is hard to imagine how to specify
                                         —35—




 a   set of characteristics that would affect the probability of
                                                                        rationing
 but not affect the decisions themselves.

          In another paper, King (198].) uses his   estimates   to predict the

 consequences of taxing the imputed income from owner-occupation.31 Under

 the assumption that   the   increased tax   revenues   are distributed as a flat

 rate   lump sum amount to each family, he finds that the taxation of net
imputed rent leads to an overall decline in the lOng—run consumption of
housing services of 13.7%. This is not too different frn Rosen's             re—

suits for the U.S.
          In the exercise just described, King makes the "standard" asstmtp—

tion of an infinitely elastic supply of housing services. He also does

the simulation assuming..a priäe elasticity of-supply of 2.0,

a value found by Poterba (1980) in U.S. data. In this case, the overall

average    percentage decrease in housing consumption is 12.2%. Thiá is
less       than the result obtained in the perfectly elastic case, because
part of the removal of the subsidy is offset by a lower pre—tax price. It

is interesting to note that departing from the assumption of perfectly
elastic supply does not have a dramatic impact on the substantive results.
         The studies discussed so far   have   ignored the impact of (non-taxable)
expected   capital gains upon housing decisions. This        omission   is probably

a consequence of the fact that cross—sectional data are not well suited for

dealing with, such a phenomenon. Rosen and Rosen (1980) use U.S. time series

data to study the determinants of the    choice between renting and       homeowner—




 31   I these calculations, the tenure choice is assumed          to be   ex0genoUS    to the
 model.

ship. In their model, it is assumed that the overall proportion of families

who desire to be owners in a given year depends upon relative price of home-

owning to renting, per capita permanent income, and a vector of shift vari-

ables. They posit a simple partial adjustment model to account for the fact

that   in a given year, the actual number of homeowners will not necssariiy
equal the number who desire to own.
        The expression    for the price of owner—occupied housing used by Rosen

and Rosen is essentially expression (3.6). The expected capital gains
component of the expression is calculated as the difference between the
one—year forward preduction of house value, ti-i , and the current value:

Vt =        - V.     An ARIMA model with one autoregressive and one moving

average parameter is used to generate            The price of renting is

simply the rental component of the consumer price index.

         The relative price of owning to renting is entered as a polynomial

distributed lag, and permanent income is "proxied" by consumption. To take

account of the possibility that credit rationing may affect people's abil-

ities to become homeowners, a variable measuriig        the   availability   of


deposits    at th±ift institutions is also included.
      The model is estimated using annual U •S. data fqr the period 194974.
The price term.is negative and significant..at. conventioziái levels.
The coefficient on income     is positive and also significant. There is       no

strong theoretical presumption for a positive effect of real par capita
permanent   income   on the incidence of homeownership, but it crops   up

virtually every study. The avaLiability of funds at credit institutions
exerts a positive effect on the proportion of homeowners, but this
                                                                    coeffi-

cient   is not estimated precisely.

          To assess the quantitate implications of their results, Rosen and
Rosen use them to predict the long—run consequences of changing the tax

treatment of housing. More specifically, the price of owner—occupied

housing that would prevail in the absence of tax       preferences
is substituted into the regression and the long-run proption ..of home

owners calculated. The model predicts a change in the incidence of owning

from 64% to 60% of all households in 1974. Because the income tax provi-

sions relating to homeownership only became important with the rise in

marginal tax rates associated with World War II, this implies that about

 one—fourth of the 16% increase in homeownership between 1945 arid 1974 carl

be attributed to these tax factors.

           In another time series analysis of the tenure choice in the U.S.,

Hendershott and Shilling (1980) study quarterly changes in an "adjusted

homeownership rate," i.e., an ownership rate adjusted for changes in the

demographic structure of the population. The relative cost of owning to

renting and real disposable income per capita are the       key explantoxy
variables. The costs of the two housing modes are computed as discussed in

Section    3.2 (see the text surrounding Table 3.2).   Both variables are entere

in third degree polynomial lags.


           Estimating the model   with quarterly data for the period 1960.2
to 1978.4,    Hendershott and Shilling   find a tatistica1ly significant
response to changes in the relative costs of owning and renting. Long
lags appear to be present; the peak response takes place after 12 to 15
quarters (p.26). Income has a positive and statistically significant
effect on homeownership only when the user cost is based upon a tax rate
of 0.30.
                                            —38—




         The regression coefficients are used to predict what the long—run

homeownership rate would have been in 1974 if property taxes and interest

payments had not been deductible. Hendershott and Shilling estimate that

the incidence of homeownership would have been 59% conditional on the

average marginal incothe tax rate being 15%, and 57.5% conditional on a -

Value      of 30%. It is striking to note the similarity to the result of

Rosen and Rosen, despite the differences n model specification and defin—.

ition of the price of housing services.




3.3.2 Investment Decisions

         The models discussed above view housing primarily as a consumption

good, albeit one whose analysis is particularly complicated because of its

durable nature. In addition, housing is a form of investment, and as

such., it competes with other assets for a place in people's portfolios.

(See, e.g., Henderson and loannides (1981).) Thi aspect of housing has re-

cently received considerable attention in discussions of whether invesment

jn housing4 has crowded out investment in business capital, and hence contrib-

                                                   -
uted to the "productivity crisis."

         tpirical resolution    of this issue would require joint specification and

estimation      of housing and physical plant   and equipment equations. tjnfortun—

ately, e.ven after     several decades   of careful research on   the determinants of
business investment, not much consensus with respect to how the process -
should be modelled has developed. (See, e.g., Sunley (1981). We discuss,
then, a few theoretical and: empirical       studies whose results are indicative of

what    might   be happening, but are certainly not demonstrative.
                                               —39—




           To begin, it is important to note the asymmetry          in the   tax treatment

 of    owner—occupied housing and business investments during inflationary

 periods. It is sometimes argued that the          key   to the difference is the fe.ct

 that   owner-occupiers are allowed to deduct nominal rather than real mortgage
 interest. However, as Summers (1380) points out, this is somewhat misleading
 reasoning, because nominal       interest payments are also deductible on loans

 taken    out   to finance other types of investment. Thus,       deductibility se
 does   not increase the attractiveness of owner-occupied housing vis a vis

 other forms of       investment.32   The important sources of asymmetry        are that:
  (1) In the presence of inflation, depreciation of business investment based
 on historical costs lowers the real value of depreciation allow'ances33 and.

  (2) Owners    of   physical capital pay tax on nominal rather than real capital

 gains.     Other things being    the same, then, increases in inflation increase

 the effective tax rate on business capital. Thus, inflation raises the

 relative cost of an investment in business capita]. to one in owner-occupied

 housing. When this fact is built into theoretical models which determine

 the amounts of      residential and   business   investment, the   result is predictable

 ——with   reasonable parameter values, when inflation increases, the amount            of

 owner—occupied housing relative to business investment goes up.                (See

 Hendershott and      Ku   (1981), Feldstein (1981 ., or Muth (1982).)
          Summers (1980) notes that an implication of such theories is that in
 the   short run, an increase in the permanent expected rate of inflation should

constraints that would otherwise be binding (Summers (1980, p. 2 ).
33     Note that the distorting effect of a given level of inflation can
be offset by a suitable rate of accelerated depreciation.

 increase the market price of housing and reduce the value of the stock market..

 He regresses the "excess returns" of both the stock market and
                                                                  owner—occupi
 housing on changes in the permanent expected rate of inflation. The excess

 return on the stock market during a given period is defined as the ratio of

 capital gains plus dividends to the beginning of period market valuation, all

 minus the beginning of period treasury bill rate. The analogous measure for
housing is the appreciation in the price deflator for one—family structures
less the beginning of period treasury bill rate. (Imputed rent is ignored.)
Finally, the expected inflation rate is estimated by assuming that expecta-
tions are formed on the basis of an autoregressive moving average process
applied to the preceding 10 years of data on inflation.
         Summers estimates the regressions with quarterly U.S.. data from 1958—
78. The results suggest a strong negative relationship of excess stock
returns to increases in the expected inflation rate. A 1% increase in the
expected inflation rate reduces the value of the stock market by 7.6%. Ift
contrast, a similar increase in inflation increases the value of a house by
1.68%. As Sunmiers emphasizes (p.11), these results do not prove that the
                 interaction has increased residential, capital at the
inflation—taxation

expense of business capital. First of all, inflation rates and housing prices
generally have moved, together over time, while the stock market has moved in
the opposite direction. It is therefore dangerous to ascribe a structural
interpretation to such regressions. More importantly, the regressions do not
even attempt to establish a link between the price changes induced by the
inflation—taxation interaction and individuals' investment decisions.

3.3.3    Summary and Evaluation
         The federal income tax treatment of owner—occupied housing lowers the

Cost of owner-occupation relative to renting. Studies of housing demand             and
tenure choice in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom (where the

relevant tax provisions are similar) suggest that these provisions have had

a substantial impact on housing decisions. They Induce people to become

homeowners, and to consume more housing conditional on owning. The interac-

tion of inflation with the tax system has exagerated these effects. Although

there   is speculation that the expansion of the housing stock has come at the

expense of business capital, not much in the way of econometric evidence is

available.

         Although considerable progress has been made in explaining housing

behavior, much remains to be done. Consider the figures in Table 3•434 Even

without any elaborate calculation of the user cost of      housing,    it is clear

from   columns 2 and   3   that owner—occupied housing was a good   deal   in the
middle   1970's. The nominal capital gains rates tended to exceed mortgage rates.

As   a very rough approximation, one could say that owner—occupiers were con-
suming "free housing" over this period. Yet column 4 indicates that there
,was hardly a rush into owner—occupation. The proportion of owner occupiers
moved from just under 0.65 to just above it.
      It is not hard to come up with explanations for this phenomenon. Trans-
actions costs may inhibit the switch from renting to owning. Rationing in
the credit market may prevent individuals from obtaining loans.35 Jaffee
and Rosen (.1979) have emphasized the fact that households with different


         mis discussion is based on Rosen (1981).
35       This possibility is discussed by Kearl (1979).

      Finally, the     price    figures in the table are ex post. Ex ante,

 individuals do not know for sure how much and in what direction prices will

 concerning     the future course of prices. The point is that such potentially
 important phenomena as these have either been ignored or treated periphera].jy

 in empirical studies of the impact of taxes on housing. As progress on

 the theoretical and econometric issues in dealing with these problems is

 made, one can expect more reliable estimates to be produced.

 3.4 Efficiency and Equity Implications

        For purposes of estimating efficiency effects, the basic problem is to

 model     the tax   law   in such a way that the usual techniques for measuring ex—
 cess burden can be used. Laidler (1969) recognizes that the tax provisions
 related    to housing introduce a wedge between the effective price of housing

 services and their marginal cost. Therefore, it can be analyzed like any

other    distortion.        In particular, assuming there are no   other imperfections
 in the system, and given estimates of: (a) individual i's mtr'inal tax
tax rate,       (b) the proportion of his housing costs which are not su1ject
to tax, , and Cc) the compensated price elasticity of demand T1., then the
size of the welfare loss 'triangle' is:36

value of t. for      each. of 10 income groups on the basis of Internal Revenue

Service statistics. Substituting into equation (3.8), he calculates the

excess burden     for   each group, and then        aggregates   to find a figure of $500

million dollars for the year l960. This is equivalent to about $50 per

household in 1980 dollars

         Rosen (1979) uses the same basic framework for calculating the excess

burden on the basis of his estimates, with. a few differences: The excess

burden is computed on a household basis, a different price elasticity of

demand38   is used for each household (the translog functional form does not
constrain the elasticity to be constant), and the                behavioral   response
includes tax induced changes in the tenure choice. The average annual
excess   burden for the entire sample for the year 1970 is $107. In terms of

1980 dollars, this is about l92

        It is difficult to decide whether or not excess burden of this magnitude

should be characterized as 'large.' Ultimately, the decision to el{m(nte

the   excess   burden   depends upon the      social and political costs of doing so.

        To assess the distributional effects of taxing              imputed rent,   Rosen

estimates bow the disposable income of each household in his sample

                                                       g.    Column 2 shows
disposable income if net imputed rent is taxed, and the government makes no

other adjustments in the tax schedule. Column 3 is based on the assumption

that marginal tax rates are adjusted proportionately so as to keep tax revenues

the same as they were under the status quo. As is well-known, it is impossible

to summarize the degree of inequality in any "objective" distributional

measure. (Atkinson (1970)).     In any case, it appeazs that the taxation of

net imputed rent would tend to distribute income away from high income

groups, although at the very bottom end of the scale disposable incomes

would fall by small amounts.

         King t1981) uses his estimates of housing demand parameters in the

United Kingdom to assess the efficiency and distributional consequences of

the tax treatment of housing in that country. Instead of relying upon the

usual second order approximation, he estimates the welfare effects directly

using the utility function (3.7). Specifically, King computes each house-

hold's "equivalent gain" (EG), the sum of money which it would have accepted

under the status quo as equivalent to the impact of taxing the imputed
                                                                      .th
rental   from owner-occupation (pp.8-9). The equivalent gain for the i.

individual can be defined algebraically in temns of the indirect utility
function:

      observes    that for a tax reform that holds tax revenues constant, the   sum. of
      the cjuiv2.lait giin 2rovides a measure of the efficienc-r gain to the
      econoiiy. Given c:ntant revenues, a positive average EG "...is equivalent
      to a Pareto—improvement combined with. a set of lump-sum redistribut_jan
     among households." (p.9.)
          For    the sake of contrast, King also computes for each household a "cash

     gain" (CG), which is just the effect of the reform on the     household's cash
     flow on the assumption that its behavior is
                                                     exogenous (p.7). A comparison
     of EG and CG   indicates whether or not allowing for endogenous housing
     decisions   has important Substantive consequences.


            Table 3.6 shows the distribution of gains and losses       by income decile
     for both measuxes. The reduction in excess burden, which is given by the

-   overall-,   mean value of the equivalent gain, is O.l7 per week, about

    0.4 of one percent of mean income. The overall' value of the cash gain has

    to be zero given that it is computed under the assumptions of exogenous

    behavior and constant tax revenues. The figures indicate that just as mT

    the U.S., non-taxation of net imputed rent has substantial distributional
    intplications.9Those with higher     incomes would tend   to be made worse off
    by the taxation of net imputed rent, and vice versa.                             -

           Of course, the estimates of efficiency and equity effects described
    in this section can   be   only as good as the underlying behavioral estimates,
    so all the caveats of Section 2 should be recalled. In addition, several.
    other qualifications deserve attention:
    39 Patric Hendershott   has pointed out to me that comparison of Icing's-
results with those of Rosen for the U.S. (Table 3.5) must take into
account the fact that Rosen assumes tax revenues are held constant via
proportional changes in marginal tax rates, while King assumes a lump
sum rebate.

         1. The results all involve comparison of long—run equilibria. The

short—run capital gains and losses in housing which might occur between

equilibrium positions could have important distributional consequences.

         2. The studies focus on housing as a use of income. Presumably,

if there were major decreases in the demand for housing, it would have a

large effect on the seurces side of the account as well.   The owners of those

factors used intensively in the production of housing services would suffer

reductions in income. As of yet, such effects have not been integrated into

studies of the distributive aspects of the tax treatment of housing.


3.5      Proposals for Reform

         In the absence of clearly articulated goals for U.S. housing policy,

it is   bound to be difficult to determine how the tax treatment of housing
should be   changed. If we discount the externality arguments of Section 2,

then it would appear that subsidizing owner-occupation is inefficient. More-

over, if we take the evidence on the distributional implications from Section 3.4

seriously, this inefficiency cannot be viewed as "buying" society more equality.

Such considerations have lead a number of investigators to suggest that net

imputed income should be taxed at the same rate as other sources of income.

Thus, for example, Hughes (1980) argues that "...the inclusion of imputed

housing income in taxable income would be justified under almost any consistent

income tax system." (p.74) From this point of view, the only valid reason for

not taxing imputed rent would be administrative difficulties involved in

computing it.
                                            —47--



          This argument is in line with the famous Haig-Simons principle of tax

design,   which states that an individual should pay tax on his total income

regardless of the source. It is often suggested that departures from the

Haig—Simons criterion necessarily induce inefficiencies. Clearly, the excess

burdens reported in the last section are non-trivial. But      the   excess burden

computation is implicitly based upon a comparison with a lump sum tax. In
practice, such taxes are infeasible. The theory of optimal taxation shows
that if lump sum taxes are excluded, the efficiency maximizing set of tax
rates is in general a complicated function of the elasticities of demand and
supply for all commodities. (See Sandmo      (1976)).   It is only in very special

cases   that one would expect efficiency to require equal rates for all sources

of income. On the other hand, it is also highly improbably that the efficient

tax rate on imputed rental income is zero. Determination of the appropate

rate has received some attention (e.g., Atkinson (1977)), but remains an

important topic for future research.

         A number of reform suggestions have been made which maintain the

basic structure of the status ,      but   seek to ameliorate its inegalitarian

income distributional consequences. Such a view might be consistent with

the   notion that there is some merit to the externality argument, but that
the subsidy goes too far in helping high income groups. Alternatively,
one might believe that there i5 no valid externality argument, but that it

is politically and administratively impossible to include imputed rent in

the tax   base.   In any case, these reforms focus upon reducing the valne of

mortgage interest and property tax deductions to upper income individuals.

One possibility would be to put ceilings on the amounts of mortgage inter-

est and property tax deductions, and/or capital gains exclusions. Other
                                             —48—




proposals would convert the deductions into credi——every homeowner would

be allowed to subtract some proportion of interest and property tax pay-

ments from his tax liability. In this way, those with higher marginal tax

rates would not enjoy an advantage, ceteris paribus.

         Questions of administrative feasibility lessen the attractiveness of

deduction limitations. Unless limitations in the deductibility of mortgage

interest were accompanied by a ceiling on all interest deductions, taxpayers

could simply secure mortgage loans to other assets. More generally, it is

difficult to evaluate such. proposals because it is not clear what their

objectives are, and what other policy instruments are assumed to be available.

If increased efficiency is the goal, why not tax imputed rent at the appropri-

ate rate? If more income distribution is sought, why not increase marginal

tax rates at upper income levels?

          So far, our discussion of the equity implications of the tax treatment

of housing has focused on distribution of income between upper and lower income

groups. A number of observers have urged reform because the status

violates horizontal equity, the injunction that equals be treated equally for

purposes of tax policy. If there are two identical people, but one owns and.

one rents, the renter does not obtain the tax advantages of owning.40 A

possible solution to this disparity would be to allow renters either a tax

credit   or a deduction for part or all of their rent payments.
          Evaluation   of this suggestion is complicated by the considerable con-
troversy over the question of what horizontal equity really means. (See
Fe].dstein CL976) or I(ing (forthcoming .)) Feldstein, for example, has

40     Indeed, if increases in tne demand for tkousirlg generated by the sub-
sidy to owner—occupiers increases the price of rental housing, renters will
be worse off. See White and White (1977).
                                              —49—



     argued that given a fairly reasonable definition of horizontal equity,

     under certain   conditions the tax   treatment of owner—occupation is equitable.

     Specifically,   define a horizontally equitable tax system as one that
     preserves the utility ordering: If two individuals would have the same
     utility   level in the absence of taxation, they should also have the same

     utility level if there is a tax.      (Feldstein, (1976, p. 94)). Suppo3e that

     individualst tastes are the same, and they are free to choose between rent-

     ing and owning. Despite the fact that homeowners are not taxed on the net

 imputed income from their housing capital, there is no horizontal inequity

 in Feldstein's sense. As long as tastes are identical, everyone would

 choose ownership unless the price of houses adjusted to capitalize the tax

 advantage. Some individual might choose to rent because (for example) the

 nature of their employment required a variety of temporary locations. In

 this case, however, one would expect their earnings to adjust enough to com-

 pensate them. Indeed, the surprising conclusion is that any attempts to

 change    the status quo would probably induce horizontal inequities.
          The fact that the opportunity to be a homeowner may be more avail-v
 able    to those with high inconsis not          se   a violation of horizontal
 equity. "If the       opportunity is open to everyone with the nign               .s.t..




is in effect a reduction in rate progressivity but not a source of hori-

zontal inequity." (Feldstein (1976, p. 95)1k

         This analysis relies heavily upon the assumption that tastes are

identical. If this is not the case, then any tax treatment of housing

will create horizontal inequities. It is therefore not clear a priori

that moving to a system of credits for renters would result in less hori-

zontal inequity.4'

      The difficult problems involved in quantifying the amounts of horizontal
equity associated with various tax reforms are discussed by King (forthcoming)..

4.    Housing Assistance

     As we have seen, housing subsidies for the middle and upper income

groups are implicit in the federal income tax. In contrast, housing sub—

sidies for the poor have tended to be more explicit, often taking the

form of public housing provided at below market rents. In this section,

we begin by describing briefly the structure of U.S. housing assistance

programs, with most of the emphasis on public housing. This is followed

by discussions of the prograin'sequity and efficiency implications, and

some possibilities for reform:


4.1 Provisions

     In the United States, subsidies for the provision of housing to the

poor began in 1937. Until very recently, the largest was public housing.

Public housing units are developed, owned, and run by local authorities

which operate within a municipality, county, or several counties as a

group. Up to 1969, the federal government covered the capital cost of

the housing, but did not subsidize operating costs, which were paid by the

tenants. Since that time, a portion of the operating costs has been sub-

sidized. To obtain finance, the authority sells its own tax exempt and

federally guaranteed bonds; the interest and principal are paid by the

federal government. By the end of fiscal year 1978, there were 1,173,000
                                                 42
public housing units (Straszheim (1980, p. 170)).

     The low income housing program has been extended and modified many
                                                                     43
times. We discuss just a few of the key developments in its history.


42 As Murray undated) has noted, it should not be assumed that this
figure represents net additions to the housing stock. It may be the case
that to some extent, subsidized housing displaces unsubsidized.
43 More details can be found in Aaron (1982) or Congressional Budget Office
(1982).
                                        —51—


         Section 235,   authorized   in 1968, provides subsidies for the annual

 mortgage     payments made   by low— and moderate—income persons who live in

 newly built or substantially rehabilitated homes. No new funds have been
 provided since fiscal year 1981 to finance additional Section 235 coxmnitxnents..
         In   1969, Congress mandated an important change in the administration
 of public housing. The rent that could be paid by an eligible family in
 public housing was limited to 25% of its income, if this was less than the
 operating cost of the dwelling. This represented a fundamental change in
 the nature of the federal subsidy, making it income conditioned as well as
 cost conditioned. By 1976, 40% of operating costs were met by subsidies
 (Weicher (1979,    p. 474)).

         The turnkey program, also introduced in the 1960's, permitted the

local authorities to purchase new, privately built projects. The idea

was that by permitting the participation of more developers, construction

costs could be     reduced.    Another attempt to reduce the authorities'

participation in building itself was Section 23,       the leased   housing program

 (1968), under which local authorities could sign leases with private land-

lords for existing apartments r with the federal government
                                                         making available

the same subsidy it would for new units.
         Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1974 included an important "existing.
housing and moderate rehabilitation prograztt.'4 Under this progam, which
will involve federal expenditures of $1.9 billion in l982, eligible
households search on the_private market for housing units. If the dwelling
44     Section 8 also includes a "new construction and substantial
rehabilitation" section, which gives financial incentives for developers
to house low income families. From the point of view of the inhabitants,
this is the same as traditional low income housing programs.

 meets certain quality standards and          the   rent is deemed to be "fair" by

 the government, then it     subsidizes    the rent with payments directly to

 the   landlord.     (The tenant's rent payment is a fixed proportion of his
 income, currently set at 25%, but due to rise to 30 percent by fiscal
 year 1986.) By the end of fiscal year 1978, there were 666,603 housing
 units   covered under Section 8.      (See    Straszheim (1980, p. 170)).
        European   programs for low income housing are qualitatively similar

to those of the U.S.        Great Britain, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands

also have rent subsidies, management of public housing by special author-

ities, etc.        (Fainstein (1980, p. 216)?. The major difference between the

United States and Western Europe concerns the extent of the subsidies.

Table    4.1 shows estimates of direct public expenditure on housing and
community development as a percentage of gross national product for a
group of selected countries in the mid-1970's. Table 4.2 shows the per-

centage of dwellings completed by private persons. Both tables indicate

that the U.S. has relied more heavily on the private market than its

European counterparts.

        On the other hand, while the amounts spent in the U.S. are relatively

small, they are certainly not trivial. The Congressional Budget Office

(1982, p.17)   estimated   that   in 1982 the federal government would spend nearly
$10 billion on a variety of housing assistance programs for low and moderate
income households. The various programs, and particularly public housing,

have generated considerable political and academic controversy. The

economic literature has focused on three allegations: Public housing is

produced inefficiently; it is an inefficient method for distributing income

to the poor; and it has anomalous distributional implications. Each of these

is discussed in turn.


4.1 Production Inefficiency

     As noted above, for a considerable portion of its history, the federal

government paid for the capital costs of public housing, but did not subsidize

operating costs. To assess the efficiency implications of this practice,

Muth (1973) assumes that housing services are produced with two inputs, "real

estate inputs," which are used to build a structure, and "current inputs,"

which are used to maintain it. Presumably, there is some scope for sub-
stitution between them. For example, one can use relatively expensive

aluniinwn siding which requires little maintenance, or wood siding, which

is cheaper but needs more maintenance.    The necessary condition

for cost minimization is that the marginal rate of substitution between

the inputs be equal to theratio of their marginal social costs.

Because capital Costs are paid ky the federal government, local authorities

in effect face a price of capital below its social marginal cost. This

gives them an incentive to produce housing which uses too much capital and

too little maintenance.
                                                  —54—


         Nuth's     formal analysis focuses on the costs of this distortion in

 input ratios.46 He postulates a constant elasticity of substitution unit

 cost function for housing services:


 (4.1)                    h =   (1—) +
where         =   price   per unit      of   housing services, r =   price   per unit of real

estate inputs, c =         price     per unit of current inputs,        =    elasticity of
substitution between real estate inputs and current inputs, and ,                    is a
parameter of the production function.

       On the basis of earlier studies on production in housing, Muth assumes

that      =   0.2   and 4.i =   .243.    He normalizes prices such that in the private

sector r = 1 and c =            1.   To the extent the public housing authority pays for

its operating expenses, it also faces a price of c equal to one. On the

other hand, due to the federal subsidy, the authority's effective value of

r is only about .05.

       Substituting these figures into equations for input ratios derived from

(4.1), l4uth shows how the subsidy lowers the per unit price of housing

produced by the housing authority, and induces it to use relatively less

in the way of current inputs than the private sector. But the key question

is what the resource cost of public housing is. This is found by pricing

the inputs used by the local housing authorities at their market prices.

Muth finds that the ratio of the market value of public housing to its

resource cost is 0.82. Other studies using, methodologies somewhat


46 Muth (1973, p. 7) notes two other reasons why public housing tends to be
more expensive than comparable private housing: (1) The Davis—Bacon Act forces
contractors to use wage scales set by the Department of Labor. These tend to be
higher than those prevailing in the labor market. (2) Cleared slum land is
often used, and such land tends to be expensive due to proximity to downtown
areas. Demolishing existing structures is also expensive.

  different than Muth's have found estimates of production inefficiencies

  similar in magnitude.47 (See Weicher (1979, p. 497)).

          In 1970, it was decided to reimburse
                                                 local housing authorities for the
  excess of operating costs over revenues. As Olsen (forthcoming,
                                                                       p.9) notes,
  in effect this reduces the
                             price of marginal maintenance and rehabilitation
  facing the authorities to zero.
                                   Operating costs increased dramatically,
  and by 1976 federal operating subsidies mounted to 40 percent of
                                                                   the operating
  costs of public housing units. However, in many programs today, there are

  still mortgage subsidies which gerteratea bias toward capital intensive

  production techniques. There is also a persistent belief that publicly

 constructed housing is excessively expensive because public sector
                                                                    managers,
 unlike   their counterparts in the private sector, have no incentive to give

 much weight to efficiency.
                               Unfortunately, no systematic estimates of the
 importance of this effect are available.
                                               Similarly, despite the widespread
 publicity given to occurrences of outright corruption in the administration
                  48
 of public housing ,   it
                        is not clear what the impact of this has been on its
 cost.



4.2 Consumption Inefficiency

     An important motivation behind public housing appears to be income

redistribution. Given the theoretical presumption that redistributing

income via a price subsidy is inefficient relative to cash, the key

empirical question is whether the inefficiency is large in dollar terms.



47 Of course, the validity of such estimates must be viewed in light
of the methodological difficulties in studying housing supply discussed
in Section 2.


48. In 1982, one member of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) opined
that "The CHA is a political slop bucket, and
                                              everybody's drinking from
it." (Newsweek Magazine, April 19, 1982.)
                                                    —56-




           An early examination of this issue is due to Aaron and Von Furstenberq

(1971).          They assume that a representative individual's utility (U)

depends only upon his consumption of housing services, h (which are

defined so that the price of a unit equals one dollar) and all other goods

G:


                                           U =
                                                 U(Q,G)


Facing private market prices, the individual chooses some bundle


(Q,G°)            ,   with   associated utility level U0 .            Now suppose the government


makes available to the individual the opportunity to purchase housing

services at a price of (l-s) , where                  s is the subsidy rate.         Geometric-

ally this is equivalent to pivoting out the budget line.                       In general, the

individual will change his consumption bundle to (Q,G1) ,                        which   -




gives       utility        U1 > U0 •49 The   cost to the government of the program is
     :1.




            The       problem is to find the amount of income that would be reqtaired
for the recipient to             attain,   at market prices, the level of utility Ut
reached       under       the subsidy   program. This is found simply         by holding the

price       of   housing at its original value, and giving the individual lump

sum income until his             utility reaches U         .   (The   geometrical analogue   is


a    parallel shift outward of the budget line until it is just tangent to

the indifference curve             associated with UCall the amount of              lump sum




49   If the individual is not allowed to choose freely the quantity
of subsidized housing he consumes, his utility may be less than U1.
In the extreme case where the housing authority offers a specific
quantity-price bundle, the budget line does not pivot. The program
simply adds one point to the family's budget set.
                                          —57—




 income so required N . Then Aaron    and Furstenberg define   the relative
 consumption inefficiency of the subsidy as

                                   sQ-N
                                    sQh

       To implement this theoretical framework, one needs to choose a

utility function and specific values for its parameters. Aaron      and von
Furstenberg assume a constant elasticity of substitution utility function.

Parameters are selected so that they are consistent with a price elasti-

city of demand for housing of -l.0 and an income elasticity of 1.0.

Assuming that the public housing subsidy rate is 50% (i.e., s—OS),

they find that the relative consumption inefficiency is about 10%.

       The price and income elasticities used by Aaron and von Furstenberg

to compute the utility function parameters are from studies of the housing

behavior of the general population. It might very well be the case, how—

ever, that the behavioral responses of the poor differ from those of the

population at large. Moreover focusing on a representative individual

does not allow one to address the important question of how benefits vary

across   individuals. Subsequent to the Aaron-von Furstenberg study, a number
of   others have been done which estimate utility function parameters with• -
cross sectional data on public housing recipients. This allows a more ac-
curate depiction of the behavioral and distributional effects of the subsidy.

We discuss here the analysis by Murray (1980), which is one of the most

recent and careful.


50    See also Kraft and Kraft (1979), Kraft and Olsen (1977) , Suzuka   and,
Stegman (1978) , and Olsen and Barton (1982)
                                          —58-




         Murray assumes that preferences can be represented by the genera1izei

 constant elasticity of substitution form


 (4.2)                      U lh C2+ G )
where the C's are parameters to be estimated, and the other variables
 are as defined above.51 The first order conditions for utility maximization

 imply that


                   ____ =     C1C +
 (4.3)                                      -) £n      + (2-c3) 2,n G
                   gh         .c3

Murray partitions his sample into groups based      on family size, and for
each group estimates (4.3) using aninstrumejital variables technique.

         The' variable p is based upon the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

estimate of the price of a "standard" unit in each city. The quantity of

housing services provided by a given dwelling i Ito rent divided by the

rental on the BLS standard unit.      (Inter-city price indices are formed by'

taking the ratio of the prices of the BLS units in the different cities.)

         Because market rents are unavailable for public housing units, it

is not clear how to measure the quantity of housing services they provide.

 (Recall the discussion of Section 2.concerning the difficirlties of measuring

.housing services. in general.) To estimate the market value of each pubUc

houág unit, Murray uses an hedonic price equation produced by another study

By substituting into the hedonic equation the characteristics of a given




 51.   The version of this equation appearing in Murray's paper has a typo-
 graphical error (equation 1, p. 27).
                                          —59—




 public housing dwelling, he can obtain an estimate of what its rent would

 be in the private market.52

       Equation (4.3) is estimated with 19.71 data on nearly 1400 successful

 public housing applicants across evèn cities. The parametersp1y. tha

dn aVerage, the.subsidy increased housl.ng consumption by about 95% oér what it

would have been otherwise. (p.33). If.aoh household would have received

 instead axv equivalent cash grant, housing consumption would have increased

only 0% above the unsubsidized level.

      To assess the efficiency of the program, Murray computes the subsidy

cost associated with each public housing unit, defined as the resource cost

of the unit53 plus administrative costs minus the rent paid. He finds that

in his sample, the average subsidy cost is $1530, while the average nominal

benefit is $94954 Thus, a shift to an equivalent cash grant would lower

costs by 34%. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. (See Weicher

 (1979, p. 497)).

      Although the results of such analyses have contributed considerably

to our understanding of public housing, they suffer from several potentially

important problems. The fact that the utility function parameters are esti-

mated using only public housing inhabitants means that the estimates may be

inconsistent due to selectivity bias.55       The use of hedonic indices to value

public housing units is also problematic because, as Aaron (1977, p. 69) has

noted, public housing tenants may not value housing characteristics the sarna

way that the market would.

 52 The hedonic     price equation is based   on data from New York City.

 53 Building on research similar      to that described in Section 4.1, Murray
 assumes that   the resource cost exceeds the market value of the unit by 17
 percent.
 54    There is considerable variation in these figures across families.

 5 For a discussion of this statistical problem, see Heckman (1979)
                                           —60—




     Even if the parameter estimates were perfect, errors in measuring con—

suxnption inefficiency might arise due to the implicit assumption that the
only distortion in the system is the subsidy on housing. For example, it is

well-known that the welfare system tends to place high implicit marginal tax

rates on the labor income of the poor. Analyses of public housing subsidies

shou'd therefore also take work decisions into account. However, it is dif-

ficult to say a priori in what direction current estimates are biased by the

failure to do so.




4.3 Distributional Implications

     The studies by Murray and others have shown that public housing

confers a relatively large benefit upon the recipients. However, this

benefit is available only to a small number of poor people. As noted

above, there are a few million public housing units, but in 1979, there

were about 25 million persons whose income fell below the U.S. govern—
                     56
ment poverty line.        Hence, many more people desire entry into publ.ic

housing than it is possible to acconodate. It turns out that although -

the incomes of the recipients are concentrated at the bottom of the in-
come distribution, many people gain entry who are better off than      those
who do not. (See Aaron (1972, p. 115)1

     A related issue is the distribution of benefits within the group

of families who actually gain admittance. Murray (1980, p. 31) regressed

his estimates of the actual benefit on annual income, holding constant

various demographic characteristics of the families. He found that there

is indeed a negative relation between income and benefits. But the R2 of



56 Statistical Abstract of the United States, (1980, p. 465.)
                                       —61—




the equation is only O.7O, suggesting that there is quite a bit of ranciomness

in the way the benefits are distributed across tenants.

     Aaron (1972, p. 12) has pointed out that public housing may have gen-

eral equilibrium effects with important distributional implications. Pre—

sumably, the availability of public housing decreases the demand for low-cost

non—subsidized housing, lowering the rents in that sector. This would tend

to increase the real incomes of the tenants and lower the real incomes of

the landlords. These issues do not yet appear to have received econometric

attention.




4.4 Possibilities for Reform

     The consensus from the literature is that public housing is ineffi-

ciently produced, distorts consumption patterns on the part of the bene-

ficiaries, and redistributes income capriciously.57 Most economists have

been against the program for years. Muth's (1973) sentiment is probably

typical: "The only possible justification for housing programs I can see

is that they are politically feasible whereas increased income maintenance

is not.". (p. 43)

     It has been suggested that if subsidies have to be maintained, then

their link to public provision of housing should be broken. If the subsidy

could be applied to private sector housing, then it would no longer be nec—



57     We have not touched upon the administrative coxnple:ity of the
program and the associated costs. Mills (undated) p. 26 notes, "...
a cadre of specialized talent has sprung up to advise building landlords
and tenants on procedures to find their way through r around the
bureaucratic maze...".
                                                  —62—




     essary   for   the public sector to get involved in apartment construction and

     management. In addition, recipients of aid would rio longer be geographic-

     ally concentrated and marked publicly.


         As noted above, under the Section 8 program, there are indeed subsidies

  for low income individua who rent on the private market.               However, as of

 19Th, only about 1.3% of publicly subsidized dwellings for the poor were

 associated with demand side programs (Quigley (1980, p. 162)). And even                 under
 Section 8, recipients are limited in their choice of dwellings, cannot

 spend more than 25% of their incomon rent, and can only choose front land-

 lords who participate in the program.
                                                                               -




          demand oriented subsidy       program   that has received a good deal     of
 attention     is "housing allowances.'58Each qualified individual would receive

from the government a payment equal to the difference between the cost of
standard housing established by the program and some fraction
                                                                          of his income.
The allowance could be spent on any housing on the private market, providing

that    it met certain quality standards.         Recently, a large social experiment
(the    Experimental Housing Allowance        Program) was conducted in   several cities
to    determine how housing allowances would affect people's behavior.5 Analyses

of    the data by Hanushek and Quigley (1981, p. 204) and Venti and Wise (1982)

suggest a moderate effect upon housing consumption; the income elasticity of

demand for housing services in         the   experiment was below 0.5.    Interestingly,
the   increased demand generated by the housing allowances does not seem to




58 A number         of   alternative policy approaches are discussed in    Congressional
Budqet OUice (1982).
59      For details on the design of the experiment and        its   results, see
Bradb.iry     and Downs (1981).
                                        —63-


have had much effect upon housing prices in the communities where the expe—

irnent was conducted. This is probably because the supply of housing services

is fairly elastic and the response to the increased allowance takes place

gradually over time.

        The main problem with the housing allowances system examined in the

experiment is the stipulation that the dwellings meet various quality

standards. The purpose of this provision is presumably to protect the poor

from unscrupulous landlords who would take their money and provide no

services in return.     The evidence from the experiment indicates that it

would be very hard to set sensible standards and that enforcement would entail

substantial administrative costs. In    addition,   the imposition of standards

reduced   participation in the program significantly (Allen et al. (1981,     26)) -

    Nuth    (1973) has proposed the introduction of "rent certificates,"
which   could be used by the poor to pay for their rents in any public or

private housing that they deemed reasonable. Such a program comes very

close to being an unrestricted cash transfer. Clearly, there are power—•

ful interest groups which, for one reason or another, wish to see income

support for the poor closely linked to their consumption of housing.

Whether or not a scheme like Muth's is perceived to be tied closely enough

to housing to be politically acceptable is an open question.



5. Conclusions

    Empirical investigation of the effects of government policies upon

housing behavior presents researchers with difficult methodological

problems. Given that there is no "best" way for dealing with these

problems, investigators are bound to produce different answers. Never—
                                       —64—




theless, there appears to be widespread agreement that in the United

States, the income tax treatment of owner-occupied housing and the pui1jc

provision of low—income housing have substantially increased the consumption
of housing services. In the process, economic efficiency has decreased.
      Moreover, the housing related provisions in the federal income tax

have lead to a more unequal distribution of income. It is unlikely that the

disequalizing effects of these provisions have been mitigated by the equalizing

effects of the expenditure programs. Thus, judged by the standards of con—

ventiona]. welfare economics, reform seems appropriate, and we have discussed

a number of possibilities. Of course, it might be that current programs are

moving us toward important social and political goals that lie outside the

scope of welfare economics. But given that these goals have never been care-

fully articulated, it is impossible to tell whether or not such is the case..
