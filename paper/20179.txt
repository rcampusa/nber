Defense Government Spending Is Contractionary, Civilian Government Spending Is Expansionary

JEL No. E62,H30,H60

                                              ABSTRACT

Impulse responses to government spending shocks in Standard Vector Autoregressions (SVARs) typically
display "expansionary" features. However, SVARs can be subject to a "non-fundamentalness" problem.
"Expectations - Augmented" VARs (EVARs), which use direct measures of forecasts of defense spending,
typically display "contractionary" responses to a defense news shock. I show that, when properly specified,
SVARs and EVARs give virtually identical results. The reason for the widespread, opposite view is
that defense shocks have "contractionary" effects while civilian government spending shocks have
"expansionary" effects. Existing EVARs and SVARs, however, include only total government spending.
In addition, the former are typically estimated on samples that include WWII and the Korean war,
when defense shocks prevailed, while the latter are estimated mostly on post-1953 samples, when
civilian shocks prevailed.

1       Introduction

Policymakers would like to know what happens if they increase government spend-
ing by, say, 1 percent of GDP. In a strict sense, we know that this question cannot
be addressed with data: the answer depends, among other things, on the type and
timing of current and expected future government spending and taxation, hence
it requires controlled experiments that the econometrician does not have access
to. But suppose one still wanted to elicit an approximate answer from the data:
what would be a reasonable methodology?
    A widespread approach consists of regressing a government spending variable
on past information, and tracing the dynamic e¤ects of the residual of this regres-
sion on the variables of interest. This is the methodology embedded in the stand-
ard Vector Autoregression (SVAR) approach1 . Contributions based on this meth-
odology, like Blanchard and Perotti (2002), Caldara and Kamps (2008), Fatas and
Mihov (2001), Galí, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007), Perotti (2007), and Auerbach
and Gorodnichenko (2012), typically …nd that GDP increases by more than gov-
ernment spending, so that the private components of GDP, in particular private
consumption, also increase; Ravn and Simonelli (2008) and Monacelli, Perotti
and Trigari (2010) …nd a positive response of the real consumption and product
wage, respectively. These results are consistent with some "neo-keynesian" mod-
els, where consumption and, in some versions, the real wage increase in response
to a rise in government spending, and the output multiplier can be larger than
1 (see e.g. Ravn, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2006, Galí, López-Salido, and Vallés
2007, Monacelli and Perotti 2008, Bilbiie 2011, and Woodford 2011). However,
the distinction between "neo-keynesian" and "neo-classical" models, and the as-
sociated terminology, has become increasingly blurred. Because the contribution
of the present paper is empirical, I will use the more neutral term "expansionary"
to denote this type of results.
    1
     The acronym "SVAR" usually stands for "Structural VAR". But as described below, in the
present context this approach has nothing structural as it is usually meant by this adjective in
the VAR literature: it relies on a simple Choleski decomposition. When this approach is used
to study the e¤ects of tax shocks instead of spending shocks, identi…cation is not obtained by a
simple triangularization of the variance - covariance matrix of the residuals, hence the adjective
"structural".



                                                1
    An important criticism of the SVAR approach is that the government spending
shocks estimated by the econometrician are likely to have been anticipated by the
public. In these circumstances, the econometrician’s information set is smaller
than that of the private agents, so that the true …scal policy shocks cannot be
recovered from the estimated shocks.2 Ramey (2011) argues that this can lead to
an expansionary bias in the impulse responses from a SVAR.
    When measures of the private sector forecasts of …scal variables are available,
the obvious solution is to use them directly in the VAR. For brevity, I will refer
to this approach as the "expectations - augmented" VAR, or EVAR. Romer and
Romer (2010) and Mertens and Ravn (2012), among others, do this with forecasts
of tax changes. Ramey (2011) uses a measure of changes in the expectations of
the present value of defense spending, or "defense news" for short, constructed
from narrative sources. She shows that in this EVAR the response of GDP
to defense news shocks in samples that include WWII and/or the Korean war
is smaller than the increase in government spending, so that private GDP and
in particular private consumption fall; the real wage also falls (although not in
all samples). These results are largely consistent with a standard neoclassical
model with lump-sum taxation like Baxter and King (1993), where "throw - in -
the - ocean" government spending, that does not enter the production or utility
functions, a¤ects the economy via a pure wealth e¤ect and raises GDP but reduces
private consumption and the real wage. I will refer to this set of results as the
"contractionary" e¤ects of government spending shocks.
    In this paper, I show that, contrary to a widespread perception, there is
no contradiction between EVAR and SVAR studies of the e¤ects of government
spending shocks. The reason for the widespread, opposite view is that defense
and civilian government spending have di¤erent e¤ects. Existing SVARs and
EVARs, however, only include total government spending in their speci…cations.
In addition, defense news EVARs are estimated on samples that include WWII
and/or the Korean War, when shocks to defense spending predominate. On the
other hand, most existing SVARs are estimated on samples that start in 1954 or
later, when shocks to civilian government spending predominate. I show that if
   2
    Under certain assumptions, such as perfect foresight by the private sector, the MA repres-
entation is non-invertible, or non-fundamental for the variables used in the VAR.

one allows explicitly for di¤erent e¤ects of the two types of government spending,
defense spending shocks in a SVAR generate "contractionary" responses that are
virtually identical to those of a defense news EVAR estimated on the same sample.
In contrast, civilian government spending shocks generate large "expansionary"
responses, that are highly statistically signi…cant and signi…cantly di¤erent from
the responses to both EVAR defense news shocks and SVAR defense spending
shocks. The fact that, when properly speci…ed and when comparison is made
between the appropriate shocks and on the same sample, EVARs and SVARs give
the same answer also casts doubt on the empirical relevance of the anticipation
(or non-fundamentalness) problem of SVARs.
    I also show that EVARs su¤er from signi…cant robustness problems. If one
excludes WWII - which involved a number of factors whose e¤ects are virtually
impossible to assess, like price controls, production controls, rationing, the draft,
and patriotism - the evidence from the defense news EVAR depends heavily on
one observation during the Korean War when, unrelated to the war, new Fed
regulation discouraging the purchase of durables was introduced.
    The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the SVAR and EVAR
approaches using a simple model as a guide. Section 3 presents the evidence from
a defense news EVAR estimated over the WWII sample 1939:1-2008:4 and the
Korean War sample 1947:1 - 2008, that does not allow for di¤erent e¤ects of de-
fense and civilian government spending, and shows that it displays very similar
contractionary responses to a SVAR with the same variables and over the same
samples. Section 4 shows that these seeming contradictions with standard inter-
pretations of the literature can be reconciled by allowing for di¤erent e¤ects of
defense and civilian government spending. Section 5 shows that this is indeed the
case empirically: the former has contractionary e¤ects, the latter large expansion-
ary e¤ects. Section 6 studies the predictability of the SVAR residuals. Section
7 discusses an alternative decomposition of total government spending on goods
and services, into government spending on purchases of goods and on employ-
ment. Section 8 discusses the instrumental variable interpretation of SVARs and
EVARs. Section 9 concludes.

2     A simple model and its VARs

2.1    A simple neoclassical growth model
Because it is important to use a model that can be solved analytically, I will
study a very simple neoclassical growth model with inelastic labor supply, similar
to that used by Leeper, Walker and Yang (2008) and Mertens and Ravn (2010)
to study non-fundamental tax shocks. I show that the model generates a simple
bivariate VAR; thus, commonly used alternative identi…cation strategies in …scal
policy VARs can be mapped into alternative assumptions about variables and
parameters of the model. This is only a toy model, which I will use to understand
the main econometric issues involved.
    Most of the empirical VAR literature does not distinguish between di¤erent
types of government spending on goods and services, and uses total government
spending on goods and services as its government spending variable. This is
the case for instance of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Ramey (2011), and
numerous other papers. Initially, I will follow the same approach. A representative
agent maximizes
                                 X1
                                     Ct 1
                        U = E0               ;        > 0;                      (1)
                                 t=0
                                      1

                             s.t. Ct + Gt + Kt = Zt Kt      1


where Ct is private consumption, Gt is government spending on goods and ser-
vices, Kt is capital and Zt is an exogenous technological shock, whose logarithm
is white noise. For simplicity capital depreciates entirely each period.
    The representative agent takes the path of Gt as given. Let a small letter
denote a log deviation from the steady state. I assume a process for gt of the form

                 gt =   gt   1   + at=t   1   + at=t + zt       0   <1         (2)

where at=t j is the change in government spending announced at time t j
for time t, as a share of government spending. Thus, this speci…cation allows
for anticipated changes in government spending (at=t 1 ) as well as unanticipated


                                                 4
changes (at=t ): at=t and at+1=t are exogenous. I will use the term "…scal foresight"
to refer to the case of a strictly positive variance of at+1=t :
     Appendix A shows that the solution of the model can be characterized by two
dynamic equations, one for gt and the other for any of the endogenous variables
yt ; kt ; ct ; or private GDP qt :3 For presentation purposes, I will focus on private
consumption. The reason is that in this simple model total GDP is predeter-
mined, hence unanticipated changes to di¤erent types of government spending
cannot have di¤erent e¤ects on private GDP. In contrast, private consumption
can decline or increase on impact; the latter case occurs if private consumption
and government spending are strong complements (see below).
     Let k be the root inside the unit circle of the characteristic equation for kt ,
and let x denote the steady state share of variable X to GDP. The bivariate VAR
consists of equation (2) and

             ct =   c ct 1   +     g gt 1   +     g1 at=t 1   +    g2 at=t   +   g3 at+1=t   +   z zt   (3)


                             c   > 0;       g   < 0;        gi   < 0;    i = 1; 2; 3

(the precise expressions for all these coe¢ cients are given in Appendix A).
   Thus, the impact e¤ect on private consumption (as a share of GDP) of an
unanticipated change in government spending equal to one percentage point of
GDP, i.e. of a unit realization of gat=t ; is

                                                 @(cct )    c
                                                          =        g2                                   (4)
                                                @(gat=t )   g

and similarly for at=t 1 and at+1=t . All these e¤ects are negative, from the wealth
e¤ect of a change in government spending.
   3
    Private GDP is de…ned as the di¤erence between GDP and government spending. Private
GDP is often considered a compact measure of the "expansionary" or "contractionary" e¤ects
of a government spending shock: in the former case, private GDP increases, in the latter it falls.

2.2     G-SVARs
The "standard" VAR approach to identi…cation, or "SVAR", is based on two
assumptions (see e.g. Blanchard and Perotti 2002):
(i) because of decision and implementation lags, there is no contemporaneous
feedback from output or its components to gt : = 0;
(ii) there are no anticipated changes to future government spending: at+1=t = 0.
    Under these assumptions the estimated reduced form model is

                                         gt = gt          1   + uGS
                                                                 g;t                                         (5)

                                  ct =      c ct 1   +    g gt 1   + uGS
                                                                      c;t                                    (6)

where
                            uGS
                             g;t = at=t ;            uGS
                                                      c;t =        g2 at=t   +    z zt                       (7)

When, like here, the government spending variable is total government spending
on goods and services, I call this speci…cation a "G-SVAR", hence the superscript
"GS".
     It is easy to see that under the joint assumptions above, a Choleski decomposi-
tion where gt comes …rst delivers a consistent estimate of the impulse responses to
at=t : In fact, a Choleski decomposition is equivalent to estimating g2 by regressing
bGS
u c;t on u bGS
            g;t (where a "hat" denotes an estimate).
     Obviously if SVAR assumption (i) fails, i.e. if uGS
                                                      g;t includes zt ; such a regression
gives a biased estimate of g2 : The same occurs if assumption (ii) fails, i.e. if there
is …scal foresight. In this case the G-SVAR reduced form residuals are not those
given in expression (7), but

    uGS
     g;t = at=t   1   + at=t ;     uGS
                                    c;t =       g1 at=t 1      +    g2 at=t   +     g3 at+1=t   +   z zt ;   (8)

As a consequence, the estimate of g2 has a positive, or "expansionary", bias, for
                    bGS
two reasons. First, ug;t now includes at=t 1 ; which has a less negative coe¢ cient
than at=t in the c equation ( g1 > g2 ): Second, the coe¢ cient of at+1=t in the c
equation, g3 ; is negative. Hence, if there is …scal foresight, in a G-SVAR the


                                                      6
coe¢ cient of ct 1 in the c equation,               c;   picks up the e¤ect of at=t 1 ; which is
included in the residual uGS
                          c;t .
                               4




2.3      G-EVARs
Suppose the two SVAR assumptions fail, and the econometrician has data on
the anticipated change at+1=t : She can estimate consistently the following reduced
form
                             gt = gt 1 + at=t 1 + uGE
                                                    g;t                         (9)

             ct =    c ct 1   +   g gt 1   +   g1 at=t 1   +   g3 at+1=t   + uGE
                                                                              c;t             (10)

where
                       uGE
                        g;t = at=t + zt ;                uGE
                                                          c;t =    g2 at=t   +   z zt         (11)

I call this speci…cation the "Expectations-Augmented" VAR, or EVAR. When the
government spending variable is total government spending on goods and services,
I call this speci…cation a "G-EVAR", hence the superscript "GE".
    Without need for further identifying assumptions (in particular, one does not
need SVAR assumption (i), = 0), one can then estimate consistently the impulse
response to at+1=t directly from the reduced form equations (9) and (10).
    However, in practice we do not have measures of the entire anticipated gov-
ernment spending change at+1=t ; but only of one component of it. This causes
a bias in the estimate of a G-EVAR too. Let Dt and Vt be defense and civilian
government spending on goods and services, with Dt + Vt = Gt : The "defense
news" variable of Ramey (2011) is de…ned as the the revision in the expectation of
the present value of future changes in discretionary defense spending as a share of
output. Applying this de…nition to the model used here, the defense news variable
     4
     Because at=t 1 has a negative e¤ect on both ct and ct 1 ; from the omitted variable formula
 c  is biased upward. As a consequence, u   bGS
                                              c;t contains ct 1 with a negative coe¢ cient. Thus, in
                   GS       GS
                  bc;t on u
the regression of u       bg;t ; there is an extra positive term which is a function of the negative
covariance between ct 1 and at=t 1 ; multiplied by the negative coe¢ cient of ct 1 in the estimate
   bGS
of uc;t : Note that the upward bias in the estimation of the coe¢ cient of ct 1 will also cause a
downward bias, ceteris paribus, in the dynamic response of c to at=t .

news variable" to refer to ad;t+1=t . Given ggt = ddt + vvt , the estimated reduced
form G-EVAR becomes

                                       gt = gt             1   + ad;t=t        1   + uEG

                  ct =       c ct 1    +    g gt 1        +      d1 ad;t=t 1        +        d3 ad;t+1=t   + uEG

Thus, the e¤ect on private consumption (as a share of GDP) of unanticipated
   5
     The inessential di¤erence is that Ramey (2011) divides each quarter’s revision of the nominal
value of future expected defense spending by the previous period’s nominal GDP, while here it
is divided by steady-state GDP.


                                                                      8
changes in dt and vt equal to one percentage point of steady - state GDP are:

                                    c             c                c

                                    d             v                g

and similarly for aj;t=t 1 and aj;t+1=t , j = 1; 2: These obviously are the same e¤ects
that were found in section 2.1 (see expression 4).
    However, because v3 is negative, here too the omission of av;t=t 1 and av;t+1=t
will cause a positive bias in the estimation of c . Importantly, however, and
unlike in a G-SVAR, even in this case the impact coe¢ cient d3 of ad;t+1=t will
be estimated without bias, because ad;t+1=t is uncorrelated with all the other
variables in the system.
    In practice, one can estimate the trivariate VAR

                       ad;t+1=t =   c ct 1    +   g gt 1       +       1 ad;t=t 1    eGE
                                                                                    +ua;t    (20)

                             gt = gt     1   + qt     1   + ad;t=t       1     eGE
                                                                              +ug;t          (21)

                         ct =   c ct 1   +    g gt 1      +    d1 ad;t=t 1       eGE
                                                                                +u c;t       (22)

and do a Choleski decomposition where ad;t+1=t comes …rst. This approach is
equivalent to estimating the GVAR (15) - (16) because, if ad;t+1=t is indeed un-
predictable, all the coe¢ cients of (20) are 0, and the residual of this equation is
ad;t+1=t itself.6
    To summarize: First, the responses to both unanticipated and anticipated
changes to government spending are negative. Second, if there is …scal foresight
the estimated G-SVAR response to at=t has an "expansionary" bias. Third, the
G-EVAR dynamics will also be estimated with a bias, but the impact response to
an unanticipated shock will be estimated without bias.
   6
     Of course, in pratice this is not the case. As Swanson (2006) points out, it is not clear how
to interpret the shock to ad;t+1=t in this speci…cation, and it is even more di¢ cult to interpret
the impulse response to such a shock.

3       G-EVARs and G-SVARs in practice

3.1     WWII
I start from the same data,7 the same sample 1939:1 - 2008:4, and the same spe-
ci…cation of the G-SVAR and the G-EVAR as Ramey (2011). Initially, the vector
of endogenous variables Xt includes ad;t+1=t ; the log of real per capita government
spending on goods and services gt , the log of real per capita GDP yt ; the three-
month T-bill rate it ; the Barro-Redlick average marginal income tax rate t , and
the log of total hours ht : The speci…cation is the six-variables version of the G-
EVAR (20) - (22) which, as we have seen, under the null is exactly equivalent
to (15) - (16). Each equation includes four lags of the endogenous variables, a
constant, and linear and quadratic time trends.
    Column 1 of Figure 1 displays the median responses of government spending,
GDP, private GDP, the tax rate and the interest rate to a shock to the defense
news variable in a G-EVAR. This column replicates Figure X of Ramey (2011),
except that here and in what follows the responses of national income account
variables (like government spending, private consumption, private GDP etc.) are
expressed as percentage points of GDP by multiplying the log response by the
average ratio of that variable to GDP.8 The response of interest rate is expressed
in basis points (a change by 50 is a change in the interst rate by .5 percentage
points) and the response of the tax rate is expressed in percentage points.
    Column 2 displays the responses of the same variables to a shock to total gov-
ernment spending on goods and services in a G-SVAR, from a Choleski decom-
position in which total government spending is ordered …rst. In both columns, the
initial shock (to defense news in the G-EVAR and to total government spending
in the G-SVAR) is normalized so that the maximum response of total government
spending is one percentage point of GDP. 95 percent con…dence bands are also
displayed.9
    7
     See the data Appendix. Unless otherwise noted, all variables were donwloaded from Valerie
Ramey’s website.
   8
     In this sample these ratios vary very little over time, hence this transformation is entirely
innocuous. In any case, when computing an impulse response from a di¤erent sample, the
average shares are recomputed over that sample.
   9
     Standard errors are computed by bootstrapping, sampling with replacement the errors of


                                               10
    In the G-EVAR, total government spending peaks after 6 quarters; at about
the same time, GDP increases by slightly less than 1 percent; the response of
private GDP is positive but insigni…cantly di¤erent from 0. In the G-SVAR,
government spending jumps on impact instead of increasing gradually. GDP
increases gradually, and its peak is about half the G-EVAR peak; consequently,
private GDP now falls, and signi…cantly so. This di¤erence cannot be explained
by di¤erent behaviors of taxes or the interest rate (rows 4 and 5).
    Column 3 displays the median di¤erence, with 95 percent con…dence bands,
between the G-EVAR and the G-SVAR responses. These di¤erences are always
statistically insigni…cant, except for the private GDP response in the …rst quarter,
which is signi…cantly smaller in the G-SVAR.
    Figure 2 displays the responses of the various components of private con-
sumption, of total investment, of total hours, and of the real product wage in
manufacturing.10 All GDP components, except the consumption of services, fall,
both in the G-EVAR and in the G-SVAR; in fact, the two sets of responses are
very similar, both numerically and statistically (see column 3).11 Hours increase
in the G-EVAR, and fall in the G-SVAR;12 the real wage increases in both.
    Thus, both G-EVARs and G-SVARs responses display "contractionary" fea-
tures. When the two di¤er, G-SVAR responses are more "contractionary" than
G-EVAR responses.
    Instead of treating ad;t+1=t as an endogenous variable, one could estimate dir-
ectly the …ve-variables version of the G-EVAR speci…cation (15) and (16). One
could also estimate a G-SVAR by applying a Choleski decomposition to the re-
the reduced form. Given a new set of reduced form errors, I estimate the G-EVAR and the
G-SVAR, and then compute the response, at each horizon, of the two speci…cations and of their
di¤erence. At each horizon, the responses and their di¤erences are lined up from the smallest
to the largest. The …gure displays the 500th, the 25th, and the 975th of these responses, and of
their di¤erences, at each horizon.
  10
     Each response in this …gure is obtained from a speci…cation where the variable in question
replaces the variable "hours" in the G-EVAR or G-SVAR. Here too all responses of components
of GDP are expressed as percentage points of GDP by multiplying the log response by the
average ratio of the variable to GDP.
  11
     Note an initial positive blip (although not statistically signi…cant) in durables consumption
in the G-EVAR. As noted by Ramey (2011), this is likely due to the panic purchase of durables
at the beginning of the war.
  12
     Here and in all the rest of the paper the responses of civilian employment are very similar
to those of total hours, hence they will not be shown.

siduals of the G-EVAR speci…cation (15) and (16). If there is …scal foresight, this
reduces the bias in estimating g2 , because it leaves only the anticipated civilian
change in the residual. In both cases, the resulting impulse responses (not shown)
are virtually identical to those of Figures 1 and 2.


3.2    Was WWII exceptional?
WWII involved by far the largest change in defense spending of the sample, and
as such it is potentially highly informative: the expectation of the present value of
defense spending rose by 74.5 percent of GDP in 1941:1, by 42.5 percent of GDP
in 1942:3, and by similarly large numbers in numerous other quarters of the war.
But many researchers would be wary of using WWII to make inferences about
the e¤ects of government spending shocks in "normal" times. WWII involved
factors like price controls, production controls, rationing, the draft, and patriot-
ism: to disentangle their role on variables like labor supply, the real wage, private
consumption, and private investment is virtually impossible. To cite two recent
examples, Hall (2009) argues that the combined e¤ect of these factors on GDP
and labor supply is likely to be negative; in contrast, Barro and Redlick (2011)
argue that it is likely to be positive. However, these authors also openly recognize
that these are just conjectures based purely on intuition.
    On private consumption and investment we do have a few hints on the possible
e¤ects of these factors. Durables and non-durables consumption were subject to
rationing and production controls; we have seen in Figure 2 that both variables
decline in both the G-EVAR and the G-SVAR; in contrast, services, which were
not rationed, increase in both speci…cations (see row 3 of Figure 2). In addition, as
Gordon and Krenn (2010, p. 11) argue, the war and its preparation mechanically
reduced private consumption of non durables, as recorded in the national income
accounts, "since it excludes the food and clothing provided to the 10 percent of
the population that served in the military, as these were counted as government
rather than consumption expenditures."
    Similar accounting issues arise with private investment, another variable that
falls in both the G-EVAR and the G-SVAR responses (see row 4 of Figure 2):
"Yet much of this new investment in plant and equipment was not counted as


                                         12
investment in the national accounts.[....] [T]he ongoing attempt to double plant
capacity was being …nanced by the government, not by the company’s own funds
[...] Since investment in war-related plant expansion was counted as government
spending rather than private investment in the national accounts, the surge of
war-related investment during 1941 occurred simultaneously with a decline in
measured private investment in the last half of 1941" (Gordon and Krenn 2010,
p. 11).13


3.3     Korea
Those who are skeptical about the information contained in WWII may want
to use a post-WWII sample. An additional advantage of starting the sample in
1947:1 is that o¢ cial quarterly national income data were …rst collected on this
date; earlier data have to be interpolated from annual …gures.
   The …rst two columns of Figure 3 replicate the …rst two columns and the …rst
three rows of Figure 1, but on the Korean war sample starting in 1947:1. The
results are qualitatively similar to those of the longer sample, although they are
weaker and with larger standard errors. In fact, very few responses are signi…c-
ant (this holds also for the other variables, not shown); this was not apparent in
Ramey (2011) because, for this sample, she does not display standard errors. If
one abstracts from the large standard errors, there is still evidence of contraction-
ary e¤ects, and again more so in the case of G-SVAR responses (again with the
exception of the real wage).
  13
    Importantly, as Gordon and Krenn emphasize, these e¤ects started well before Pearl Har-
bour. And they are not just the manifestation of the classical crowding out e¤ect of government
spending on private spending, as in the wealth e¤ect of the neoclassical model. Although formal
rationing of durable goods started in January 1942, by mid-1941 exceptional non-market con-
straints on production for civilian consumption and investment had been put in place for the
war preparation e¤ort. As the Director of the O¢ ce of Price Administration wrote: “Civilian
supplies of all kinds are being requisitioned for military needs so as to force the cutting down of
production for civilian use . . . When [aluminum supply] is cut o¤ suddenly, as has happened
recently, businessmen face bankruptcy and whole communities lose the payroll lifeblood of their
existence . . . Auto production is being limited and faces almost complete extinction. Can
anyone estimate, at this time, the far-reaching dislocations of stoppage?”(Leon Henderson, “We
Only Have Months,” Fortune, July 1941, p. 68, cited in Gordon and Krenn 2010, p. 19).




                                                13
3.4       Robustness
We have just seen that if one excludes WWII, the e¤ects of shocks to the defense
news variable can be estimated only imprecisely. In 1950:3 and 1950:4 the expect-
ation of the present value of future defense spending rose by 63 and 41 percent
of GDP, respectively; the next largest revision in the post-WWII sample is 6.4
percent of GDP, in 1980:1; the next largest revisions during the Korean war were
even smaller: -2.02 percent of GDP in 1953:1 and -3.06 percent in 1953:3.
    1950:3 turns out to be indeed crucial in the post-WWII sample. The last two
columns of Figure 3 replicate the …rst two columns but exclude 1950:314 : this is
enough for the defense news G-EVAR to lose any statistical informativeness. The
standard error bands are now extremely wide, so that nothing is even remotely
signi…cant. The G-SVAR appears to be more robust: when 1950:3 is excluded,
the standard errors increase slightly, but the response of private GDP remains
signi…cant at the trough.
    As always in these cases, one could argue that there is no reason to discard
any useful information. At the same time, it is important to be aware of the key
role played by a single quarter. And there are speci…c reasons why one might
want to check the robustness of the results when 1950:3 is excluded. In 1950:3
and in 1950:4 there were two well-identi…ed, exceptional factors that were en-
tirely unrelated to the war but that substantially a¤ected the response of durable
consumption and of investment.
    Although there was no formal rationing, in the …rst two quarters of the Korean
War important restrictions on the purchase of durables were introduced; both
were motivated by developments preceding the war. On September 18, 1950,
the Federal Reserve introduced Regulation W, setting higher downpayments than
those prevailing in the market for the purchase of durable goods, and reducing the
maturities of the loans; the rules were further tightened on October 16 1950. The
Survey of Current Business, November 1950, calculates that Regulation W might
have decreased the purchase of durables by about $2.5 to $3 billion annually, or
about 10 percent of total durable purchases and about 1 percent of 1950 GDP. In
addition, Regulation X, also introduced in the fall of 1950, restricted the terms
 14
      This is done by adding a dummy variable for each quarter from 1950:3 to 1951:3.



                                              14
of mortgages; by mid-1951, it had caused a decline in homebuilding, which in
turn was re‡ected in a decline in the purchases of durables and semi-durables like
furniture and household equipment.15



4      The composition of government spending shocks

4.1     Reconciling two contradictions
A large G-SVAR literature, including among others Blanchard and Perotti (2002),
Caldara and Kamps (2008), Fatas and Mihov (2001), Galí, López-Salido, and
Vallés (2007), …nds economically and statistically signi…cant expansionary e¤ects
of at=t . Ramey (2011) …nds contractionary responses to ad;t+1=t in a G-EVAR, and
attributes the expansionary e¤ects estimated in the G-SVAR literature to the
expansionary bias from the presence of …scal foresight. In contrast to both sets
of results, I …nd that G-SVARs display contractionary e¤ects, and indeed more
contractionary than G-EVARs.
    How does one reconcile these two seeming contradictions of my results with
the existing literature? The expansionary G-SVAR studies cited above start in
1954 or later.16 Defense spending shocks were much larger in the sample up to
the Korean War than afterwards. This suggests that the composition of total
government spending shocks - civilian vs. defense spending shocks - might be
important.
    Consider a slight modi…cation of the model used so far. Now the representative
agent maximizes
  15
     Regulation W should be seen against a steady increase in installment credit at the end of
the forties: by 1950, less than half of the durables purchased were paid cash; and in 1949 one
every four new cars was purchased by households with less than $3,000 of income, against one
in eight the year before. See the Survey of Current Business, November 1950, pp. 11 and 12.
See the Survey of Current Business, November 1951, p. 7, for a description of Regulation X.
  16
     Another di¤erence is that most SVAR studies - including Blanchard and Perotti (2002) - use
68 percent con…dence bands, thus often giving a misleading impression of statistical signi…cance.

where Dt and Vt are defense and civilian government spending respectively. The
processes for dt and vt are as in (13). Appendix B solves this model with the
method of undetermined coe¢ cients. The solution for ct is

         ct =     c ct 1   +   d dt 1   +    d1 ad;t=t 1       +    d2 ad;t=t   +      d3 ad;t+1=t   +   (24)

where the expressions for the coe¢ cients are given in Appendix B.
    When > 0 the e¤ects of civilian spending and of defense spending are dif-
ferent. Defense spending shocks have exactly the same contractionary e¤ects as
in the previous model. If < 1 private consumption and civilian government
spending are Edgeworth complements, and shocks to civilian spending are less
contractionary than shocks to defense spending ( v2 > v2 ; v3 > v3 ): If in addi-
tion is su¢ ciently large, shocks to civilian spending can even be expansionary
( v2 > 0; v3 > 0). Thus, this is a simple way of rationalizing a positive e¤ect of
government spending on private consumption without having to resort to a much
more complicated model with price rigidities. From now on, I will assume < 1
and > 0:


4.2    DC-SVAR
Under the two SVAR assumptions that there is no …scal foresight and                                      = 0;
the reduced form SVAR is:

To indicate that the government spending variables include both defense and ci-
vilian government spending, I call this speci…cation a "DC-SVAR", hence the
superscript "DCS". Under the usual SVAR assumptions, this approach estim-
ates separate impulse responses to unanticipated changes in civilian and defense
spending, av;t=t and ad;t=t : 17
    What happens if the SVAR assumptions are satis…ed but the econometrician
incorrectly assumes that = 0; hence she estimates a G-SVAR like (5) and (6),
with gt as the only government spending variable? Intuitively, the estimated im-
pulse response to a unit shock to ggt will be in between the responses to dad;t=t
and to vav;t=t :


4.3      DC-EVAR
Now suppose that the …rst SVAR assumption fails, and there is …scal foresight.
The reduced form EVAR is:

                                 dt = dt       1   + ad;t=t     1   + uDCS
                                                                       d;t                                  (29)

                                 v t = vt      1   + vv;t=t     1   + uDCS
                                                                       v;t                                  (30)

          ct =   c ct 1   +   d dt 1   +   v vt 1    +      d1 ad;t=t 1      +   d3 ad;t+1=t   + uDCE
                                                                                                  c;t       (31)
  17
    In the model, av;t=t and ad;t=t are uncorrelated, hence it makes no di¤erence which of
the two variables comes …rst in the Choleski decomposition. In practice, they might not be
uncorrelated; but as shown below, their correlation is low enough that their order makes no
appreciable di¤erence.

I will call this speci…cation a "DC-EVAR", hence the superscript "DCE".
    What happens if the econometrician incorrectly assumes that = 0; thus
estimating a G-EVAR like (9) and (10)? Once again, there will be a bias in the
estimate of the c equation. But there is a fundamental reason why one should
expect a smaller di¤erence between a G-EVAR and a DC-EVAR than between
a G-SVAR and a DC-SVAR: unlike in a DC-SVAR, in a DC-EVAR the impact
e¤ect of a defense news shock, d3 ; is still estimated correctly even if > 0; since
ad;t+1=t is independent of all other variables in the reduced form equation (as in a
G-EVAR).
    I show below that indeed the di¤erence between the G-EVAR and DC-EVAR
responses to defense shocks is minimal; in contrast the two DC-SVAR impulse
responses, to civilian and defense spending shocks, are very di¤erent from each
other - one positive and one negative -, with the G-SVAR impulse response lying
in between them. As explained above, this is precisely what one would expect if
  < 1 and is su¢ ciently large.



5      DC-EVARs and DC-SVARs in practice
I will now compare the responses to a defense news shock in a DC-EVAR and
the two responses - to a civilian and defense spending shocks - in a DC-SVAR.18
The speci…cations of the DC-EVAR and of the DC-SVAR are the same as the
speci…cations of the G-EVAR and G-SVAR, respectively, except that the vector
of endogenous variables includes dt and vt instead of gt :
    In the DC-EVAR the defense news variable is still …rst in the Choleski de-
composition. In the DC-SVAR, dt and vt still precede all other variables in the
  18
    I construct the civilian government spending series using chain-linked series on total gov-
ernment spending on goods and services and on defense spending on goods and services, and
applying Whelan (2002)’s method to subtract two chain-linked series.


                                                 18
Choleski decomposition. There is no theoretical guidance on the order of these
two variables; however, because the residuals of the two reduced form equations
for dt and vt have a correlation of only -.09, the order turns out to be immater-
ial to the results. As a convention, I will show results when defense spending is
ordered …rst and civilian spending second, but, as mentioned, the reverse ordering
produces exactly the same impulse responses.
    The sample starts in 1947:1, so as to include the Korean War while avoid-
ing the problems discussed regarding WWII. Figures 4 and 5 display DC-EVAR
responses to a defense news shock (column 1), DC-SVAR responses to a defense
spending shock (column 2) and DC-SVAR responses to a civilian spending shock
(column 3). The responses in the …rst two columns are very close to each other
and similar to the G-EVAR and G-SVAR responses in columns 1 and 2 of Figure
3, but now the standard error bands are much tighter. These responses display
clear contractionary features:GDP falls (DC-EVAR) or is ‡at (DC-SVAR); private
GDP declines (Figure 4); consumption of durables and private investment decline
signi…cantly, while nondurables and services are ‡at (Figure 5). The only case in
which the DC-EVAR and the DC-SVAR responses to a defense spending shock
di¤er is that of the real wage, which falls in the DC-EVAR and increases in the
DC-SVAR.
    In contrast, DC-SVAR responses to a civilian spending shock, in column 3 of
the same Figures 4 to 5, display all the typical expansionary features: peak GDP
and private GDP responses of about 2 percent after about two years, signi…cant
at the 95 percent level; positive responses of durables (.5 percentage points of
GDP at peak), non durables (.2 percentage points), and of private investment
(1 percent of GDP), all signi…cant except for non-durables; hours and the real
wage increase signi…cantly. Except for the real wage, all these responses have the
opposite signs to the responses in columns 1 and 2 of the same …gures.
    Rows 5 and 6 in Figure 4 suggest that these expansionary features of civilian
spending shocks cannot be explained by di¤erences in the accompanying monetary
or tax policies: both the federal funds rate and the Barro-Redlick tax rate increase
in the medium to long run in response to a civilian spending shocks (column 3)
while they decline (after a small initial increase in the case of taxes) in response
to a defense news shock or a defense spending shock (columns 1 and 2).


                                        19
    To save space, I do not display the di¤erences between these responses. But
the results can be easily summarized. The di¤erence between the DC-EVAR
responses and DC-SVAR responses to a defense spending shock are always very
small and insigni…cant. The DC-SVAR responses to a civilian spending shock are
always larger than the other two, and nearly always signi…cantly di¤erent from
them at the 5 percent level.
    Figure 6 displays the DC-SVAR responses to a civilian and a defense spending
shock, respectively, from the three samples. Defense spending shocks are contrac-
tionary in all three samples. Civilian spending shocks are expansionary in all
three samples.
    Another indicator of the e¤ects of government spending shocks is the cumu-
lative total government spending output multiplier, de…ned as the ratio of the
cumulated response of GDP at the numerator and the cumulated response of
government spending at the denominator, each using a discount factor of .99 per
quarter. Table 1 displays median cumulative multipliers at 8 quarters, from the
Korean war and the post-1953 samples.

                     Table 1: Multipliers at 8 quarters.
                                           1947-2008        1954-2008

               3   DC-SVAR, civ. shock       1.09             1.12

               The multiplier is computed as the ratio of the cumulated
               response of GDP at 8 quarters to the cumulated response
               of total government spending at 8 quarters (calculated by
               multiplying the cumulated log response by the average
               share of government spending in GDP in each sample, using
               a discount factor of .99 per quarter.



    The DC-EVAR multipliers and the defense spending DC-SVAR multipliers are
always close to 0 or negative. The civilian spending DC-SVAR multiplier is above
1 in both samples.




                                          20
6    Interpreting the SVAR residuals
As Ramey (2011) notes in the context of a G-SVAR, the DC-SVAR residuals
of the defense spending equation are predictable by the Ramey-Shapiro military
buildup variable (see row 1 of Table 2).

           Table 2: Granger causality, defense spending shocks.
                         Sample           F-stat           p-value

                2   excluding 1950:3       1.34             .257
                3     1954:1-2008:4        1.24             .296

                Regression of the residual of the defense government
                spending equation from the DC-SVAR on 4 lags of the
                Ramey - Shapiro dummy variable. The F-statistics refers
                to the exclusion of 4 lags of the Ramey - Shapiro dummy
                variable.



    However, once again all of the predictive power of the Ramey-Shapiro dummy
variable comes from Korea, and from 1950:3 in particular. In fact, if one excludes
1950:3 (row 2), or if the sample starts in 1954:1 (row 3), then the military buildup
dummy no longer Granger causes the DC-SVAR residual of the defense spending
equation. Yet, as mentioned above, even in the post-1953 sample DC-SVAR
defense spending shocks still lead to responses that are statistically signi…cant.
    What about the civilian government spending shocks from a DC-SVAR? Not
surprisingly, they cannot be predicted by the Ramey-Shapiro military dummy (see
row 1 of Table 3). It could be argued that civilian government spending on goods
and services is easily predictable because it is determined by long-run factors like
population dynamics, that a¤ect the need for several types of civilian spending,
like transportation infrastructure and schools. These dynamics should largely be
captured by the linear and quadratic trends of the DC-SVAR. Still, row 2 of Table
3 shows that, when the civilian spending shock is regressed on lags 1 to 12 of the
log of population, the latter are jointly insigni…cant.

              from the DC-SVAR on 4 lags of the Ramey - Shapiro dummy
              variable (row 1) and 4 lags of the Ramey - Shapiro dummy variable
              and 12 lags of the log of total population (row 2). The F-statistics
              refers to the exclusion of all lags of the right-hand side variables.



7      An alternative decomposition
What explains the di¤erence in the e¤ects of civilian and defense spending shocks?
A complete explanation is beyond the scope of this paper. But one plausible hypo-
thesis is that spending on government employment and the remaining component
of government spending (mostly purchases of goods) have di¤erent e¤ects, and
that defense and civilian spending shocks simply di¤er in the intensities of these
two components.
    This hypothesis is unfortunately di¢ cult to test in the existing sample. The
problem is illustrated in Figure 7, which displays responses from a SVAR with
four government spending variables: civilian government employment, civilian pur-
chases of goods, defense employment, and defense purchases of goods. Each
column displays the response to shocks of each of these variables. When dis-
playing the responses to the two defense spending shocks, defense purchases of
goods and the defense employment come …rst, in this order; when displaying the
responses to the two civilian spending shocks, civilian purchases of goods and ci-
vilian government employment come …rst, in this order.19 As usual, all responses
are normalized so that the response of total government spending (the sum of the
four government spending variables) is one percent of GDP at peak.
  19
    As usual, the responses of the four government spending variables are expressed as shares
of GDP by multiplying the original response by the average share of that variable in GDP.
This implicitly assumes that government wages do not change when a shock to government
employment occurs. Results using the defense and civilian government wage bills instead of
employment are very similar.



                                               22
    Only a shock to civilian purchases of goods (column 1) generates a clean exper-
iment, in the sense that the responses of the other government spending variables
are very small. In response to this shock, private GDP increases. A shock to
civilian government employment generates a less clean experiment; the maximum
increase in civilian government employment itself is worth just .4 percent of GDP;
the remaining .6 percent of GDP at peak is made up from the other three com-
ponents of government spending. Still, in this experiment private GDP increases
substantially, by 2 percent of GDP at peak.
    The two defense spending shocks are di¢ cult to distinguish from each other
because they generate similar responses of the government spending variables:
in both cases defense employment spending increases by .5 percent of GDP, and
civilian purchases of goods fall considerably. The di¤erence between the two
experiments is that defense purchases of goods increase more in response to a
shock to defense purchases of goods. In this case, private GDP initially increases,
then falls below 0 for a prolonged period of time; it is ‡at when defense employment
spending is shocked.
    Overall, a pairwise comparison of shocks to civilian and defense goods pur-
chases, and of shocks to civilian and defense government employment, shows that
in each pair the …rst component has expansionary e¤ects, and the second has
weaker, or even negative, e¤ects.



8       An instrumental variable interpretation
One could interpret a G-SVAR and a G-EVAR as two approaches that estimate
the same object using two di¤erent instruments for gt : the residual of the reduced
form gt equation in the former case, and the defense news variable in the latter.
The latter instrument has the advantage that it does not require the two SVAR
hypotheses to hold. To best understand this instrumental variable interpretation,
it is useful to start from the equation for ct , which, assuming initially = 0; can
be written as (see equation A. 28 in Appendix A):

 ct =   c ct 1 + g2 gt +( g   g2 )gt 1 +( g1    g2 )at=t 1 + g3 at+1=t +( z   g2   )zt (34)


                                           23
With a slight abuse of terminology, I will call this equation "the structural equa-
tion for ct ": If the two SVAR assumptions hold, the above equation becomes

         ct =   c ct 1   +   g2 gt   +(     g        g2 )gt 1   + uGS
                                                                   c;t ;                  uGS
                                                                                           c;t =   z zt   (35)

The Choleski decomposition in a G-SVAR can be interpreted as an instrumental
variable estimation, in which the residual uGS g;t of (5), which is nothing but at=t ;
is used to instrument for gt in (35). In the language of Stock and Watson (2012),
uGS
  g;t is an "internal" instrument. Now suppose the two SVAR assumptions fail.
Instead of (34), one can write the ct equation as (see again equation A. 28 in
Appendix A):

                                                                                  d d
          ct =      c ct 1   +    g 1 gt   +(   g         g1 )gt 1   +       g3    a      + uGE
                                                                                             c;t ;        (36)
                                                                                  g t+1=t
                                                     v
        uGE
         c;t = (     g2          g1 )at=t   +   g3     av;t+1=t + (      z          g2   )zt              (37)
                                                     g

Because 6= 0, uGS    g;t is no longer a legitimate instrument for gt . The G-EVAR
approach can be interpreted as estimating the equation using ad;t=t 1 as an in-
strument for gt . In the language of Stock and Watson (2012) this is an "external
instrument": a component of the structural shock of the gt equation that is not
correlated with the structural shock of (36).
     All this is indeed correct when = 0: But when > 0; both the G-EVAR and
the G-SVAR are misspeci…ed, regardless of whether the two SVAR assumptions
hold or not. The coe¢ cients of dt and its lags are di¤erent from those of vt and
its lags. As a consequence, in a G-SVAR, the estimated e¤ect of total government
spending will be a mixture of the e¤ects of civilian and defense spending. In a
G-EVAR total government spending instrumented with the defense news variable
re‡ects mostly variation in defense spending; hence the G-EVAR response will be
very similar to the DC-EVAR response to defense spending shocks. This is indeed
what we have seen in the previous section.




                                                     24
9    Conclusions
In this paper, I have shown that defense spending shocks in SVARs and defense
news shocks in EVARs have contractionary e¤ects; civilian spending shocks in
SVARs have expansionary e¤ects. Hence, generalizing from results on defense
spending shocks to often-heard statements like "government spending has zero or
negative e¤ects on private economic activity" is unwarranted.
    In addition, defense spending shocks in a DC-SVAR and defense news shocks
in a DC-EVAR have virtually identical e¤ects. This suggests that anticipation
e¤ects are not important, and that the key distinction is in the type of shock
- defense vs. civilian. Of course, ideally one would also have data on civilian
spending "news". But the fact that responses to SVAR defense shocks and EVAR
defense news shocks are virtually identical suggests (without demonstrating) that
SVARs, if properly speci…ed, are a good enough tool to investigate the e¤ects of
government spending shocks. These results are consistent with those of Chahrour,
Schmitt-Groh·  e and Uribe (2010), who generate the data from a DSGE model in
which part of the shocks (to taxation) are anticipated, and show that a SVAR
displays minimal bias.
    The conclusions of this paper appear to contradict the widespread notion that
EVARs and SVARs deliver sharply di¤erent answers. The reason for this mistaken
notion is that the literature does not allow for di¤erent e¤ects of defense and
civilian government spending, and defense news EVARs are estimated on samples
including WWII and Korea, when defense spending shocks prevailed, while SVARs
are typically estimated on samples starting in 1954 or later, when civilian spending
shocks prevailed. Hence, the two methodologies essentially capture two di¤erent
types of shocks - defense spending shocks the former, and civilian spending shocks
the latter.
    One might argue that studying the e¤ects of civilian spending shocks is not
interesting because, if they are not purely of the "throw-in-the-ocean" type, they
cannot discriminate between neoclassical and neokeynesian models. However,
from an empirical and policy viewpoint estimating the e¤ects of civilian spending
shocks is as interesting as estimating the e¤ects of defense spending shocks; in
fact, one could argue that in peacetime it is more interesting.

Appendix A
Let c = C=Y be the steady state value of consumption, as a share of steady-state
GDP, and similarly for g and k: Loglinearization of the resource constraint of the
economy gives
                         cct = kt 1 ggt kkt + zt                           (A. 1)

The two loglinearized …rst order conditions are:

                                          rt = (         1)kt     1   + zt                                  (A. 2)

                                         ct = Et ct+1 + (1               )kt                                (A. 3)

where rt is the di¤erence between the interest rate and the rate of time preference
1=    1: Assume a process for gt of the form

                                  gt = gt       1   + at=t   1   + at=t + zt                                (A. 4)

where at=t and at=t 1 are expressed as shares of steady state government spending
and zt is white noise. To apply the method of undetermined coe¢ cients, I assume
the following process for kt

            kt =   k kt 1   +   g gt 1   +   g1 at=t 1   +   g2 at=t    +    g3 at+1=t   +   z zt           (A. 5)

Appendix B
This appendix solves the model when                             > 0: The problem of the representative
agent is now
                         X 1
                              (Ct Vt )1
                  U = E0                                        ;                 > 0;            >0                        (B. 1)
                          t=0
                                1

s.t.
                                    Ct + Dt + Vt + Kt = Zt Kt                             1                                 (B. 2)

Note that, given > 0; the second cross derivative of the utility function is positive
is < 1. Loglinearization of the resource constraint of the economy gives

                                  cct =      kt   1     ddt           vvt         kkt + zt                                  (B. 3)

The log-linearized Euler equation now is:

                ct         (1       )vt = Et ct+1                   (1            )Et vt+1 + (1               )kt           (B. 4)

The second …rst order condition is as before:

                                            rt = (          1)kt         1   + zt                                           (B. 5)

Assume processes for dt and vt of the form20

          vt = vt      1   + av;t=t   1   + av;t=t ;        dt = dt           1   + ad;t=t        1   + ad;t=t              (B. 6)

To apply the method of undetermined coe¢ cients, I assume the following processes
for kt

                     0
        kt =         k kt 1   +    d dt 1   +     v vt 1    +       d1 ad;t=t 1       +       d2 ad;t=t   +   d3 ad;t+1=t   (B. 7)
                                                                                      0
                 +     v1 av;t=t 1    +     v2 av;t=t   +    v3 av;t+1=t          +   z zt

  20
    For simplicity, I assume that vt and dt do not depend on zt ; i.e.                                    = 0: The case of    6= 0
was illustrated in Appendix A.

To …nd the coe¢ cients                       s, lag (B. 22) by one period and subtract ggt and                                                     k ggt 1

from both sides:

Because yt is predetermined, equal increases in ddt or vvt have the same e¤ects on
qt : they reduce it one to one. If private and public consumption are complements
( < 1); ct falls less on impact in response to vvt ; or it can even increase. In this
case, however, capital next period will be lower, hence private GDP will be lower
( v is a decreasing function if ):
