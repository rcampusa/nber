The Impact of Credit Protection on Stock Prices in the Presence of Credit Crunches

                                             ABSTRACT

Data show that better creditor protection is correlated across countries with lower average stock market
volatility. Moreover, countries with better creditor protection seem to have suffered lower decline
in their stock market indexes during the current financial crisis. To explain this regularity, we use a
Tobin q model of investment and show that stronger creditor protection increases the expected level
and lowers the variance of stock prices in the presence of credit crunches. There are two main channels
through which creditor protection enhances the performance of the stock market: (1) The credit-constrained
stock price increases with better protection of creditors; (2) The probability of a credit crunch leading
to a binding credit constraint falls with strong protection of creditors. These mechanisms are consistent
with the patterns observed in the cross-country data. We find that except for OECD countries with
low creditor protection, stock market return is negative in the crisis years and positive in non-crisis
years.

1    Introduction

A central problem in the credit market is that lenders are reluctant to make loans because they

cannot easily determine whether a prospective borrower has resources to repay the loan. If the

loan is made, the lender is concerned whether the borrower will engage in risky behavior that could

lower the probability that the loan will be repaid. Collateral reduces this information asymmetry

problem because good collateral (that is, assets that are easily valued and easy to take control of)

significantly decreases the losses to the lender if the borrower defaults on the loan. Good collateral

also reduces the moral hazard problem because the borrower is reluctant to engage in excessively

risky behavior since now he or she has something to lose. Creditor protection enhances the ability of

the lender to take control of the collateral in case of default and thereby alleviate credit constraints.

Thus, creditor rights regulation helps mitigate the problems of information asymmetry and moral

hazard between creditors and borrowers. This mechanism is the focus of our paper.

    Recent literature on law and finance has emphasized the role of strong institutions, such as those

that enhance creditor protection, in fostering the development of financial markets. Accordingly,

creditor rights’ protection affects the credit cycle, and credit market breadth. For example, La

Porta et al. (1997) find that countries with poor creditor protection have smaller debt markets.

Their findings are confirmed by Levine (2004) as well as Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2006),

with broader country coverage. Burger and Warnock (2006) also find that countries with stronger

creditor rights have more developed local bond markets, and their economies rely less on foreign–

currency bonds. Furthermore, Galindo and Micco (2005) find that strong creditor rights can reduce

the volatility of the credit market. Creditor protection also lowers a firm’s borrowing costs and

increases the firm’s value (e.g., La Porta et al. (2000) and Bae and Goyal (2003)); and it also reduces

cash–flow risk, operating income variability, and operating leverage (e.g., Claessens, Djankov, and

Nenova (2001)). This literature focuses mainly on the credit market itself, but not on the effect of

creditor protection on the stock market.



                                                   2
        In this paper, we attempt to fill a gap in the literature by addressing the issue of how the

protection of creditor rights affect the level and volatility of stock prices.1 We develop a Tobin

q model of stock prices, and show the mechanism through which creditor protection may affect

the level and the volatility of stock prices. Our analysis is motivated by the empirical regularity

that better creditor protection is associated with lower stock price volatility and that countries

with better creditor protection suffered lower declines in their stock market indexes during current

financial crisis. We also find broad empirical support for the mechanisms suggested by our model.

        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 contains a discussion of an empirical

regularity. Section 3 develops the benchmark model of investment and stock prices in friction–free

and in credit–constrained regimes. Section 4 analyzes the model in the presence of liquidity shocks

and presents the main findings of the analysis. Section 5 demonstrates that these findings are

consistent with the data. Section 6 concludes.



2        Empirical Regularity

In this section we present an empirical regularity which serves to motivate the analysis in the

following sections.

        As a proxy for creditor protection we use the creditor rights index (CRI) compiled by Djankov

et al. (2007). This is a panel that covers 129 countries for 1978-2007. The creditor rights index

is constructed in the same was as in La Porta, et al. (1998). It ranges from 0 to 4 with a higher

number associated with better protection for creditors. The index is formed by adding one for

each of the following four institutions: when the country imposes restrictions, such as requiring a

firm to obtain creditor consent or pay minimum dividends to file for reorganization; when secured
    1
     Some studies have examined how corporate control affects the dispersion of stock prices within a market. For
example, Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000) look at the stock price co-movement within a country. They find that co-
movement is more pronounced in poor economies than in rich economies, which they contribute to cross-country
differences in property rights. Our work is not concerned with the idiosyncratic dispersion of stock prices, but rather
with the instability in the aggregate.

creditors are able to gain possession of their security as soon as the reorganization petition has been

approved (with no automatic stay); when secured creditors are ranked first in the distribution of

the proceeds that result from the disposition of the assets of a bankrupt firm; and when the debtor

does not retain the administration of its property pending the resolution of the reorganization.

Appendix Table 1 shows 49 countries in our sample that fall into different categories of the creditor

rights index in 2007.

   Our first piece of motivating evidence comes from the current financial crisis. As Table 1 shows,

with the exception of the four countries with credit rights index of 0, countries with better creditor

protection experienced on average a lower decline in their stock price index in 2008. In particular,

high levels of creditor protection, 3 or 4, are associated with lower decline in the stock market

during the current crisis.

   Looking further back in history, we can see that better creditor protection is associated with

lower stock index volatility. Table 2 presents such evidence for the full sample as well as for the

subsamples of OECD and non–OECD countries. We combine levels of creditor rights index of 0, 1

and 2 into an indicator of low level of creditor rights protection and level of creditor rights index

of 3 and 4 into an indicator of high level of creditor rights protection. We then test for statistical

significance of the difference in stock market volatility depending on the level of creditor protection.


                                                      4
      To measure stock price volatility, we use stock market indexes from Global Financial Data.

We use monthly data calculated by central banks, national statistical agencies, or stock exchanges

themselves as of the end–of–month closes. We scale down all stock market indexes by the local CPI

at the end of the month. To measure the stock return volatility (σ), we compute non–overlapping

standard deviations for the monthly stock returns for each calendar year.

      Top panel of Table 2 is based on the panel evidence for our 49 countries for years 1980-2007.2

It shows strong evidence that in countries and years with high index of creditor rights stock market

volatility is lower than in countries and years with low index of creditor rights. One possible

concern with this evidence is that creditor rights index, while available for a panel of countries,

does not change much over time, thus exaggerating significance levels of the t-tests. Thus, the

bottom panel of Table 2 presents cross–country evidence with stock market volatility computed

over the sample period as long as the data are available between 1980 and 2007. Here we define

an indicator of high level of creditor protection as average CRI for a given country being higher

than 2.5. We classify countries that joined OECD half–way through our sample period as non-

OECD. We still find that stock market volatility is substantially higher in countries with low level

of creditor protection, although for the OECD subsample the significance level of the difference is

only 14.7%, not surprising, given small sample size.

      Thus, we find that stock market volatility, historically, is higher in the countries with lower

level of creditor protection. Moreover, we find that countries with higher creditor protection level

suffered lower declines in their stock market indexes during current financial crisis. We now turn

to the model that provides an explanation for this empirical regularity.

      We exclude 2008 in order not to capture the effect of the current crisis.

3        A Tobin q Model of Stock Prices

This section derives the analytical expression for the stock price by using the standard Tobin q

model. We consider two regimes: a frictionless credit regime, and a credit constrained regime.


3.1        The Friction-Free Regime

Consider a small open economy facing a fixed world interest rate r. The production function of a

single tradable goods is Cobb-Douglas:3


                                                    Yt = At Kt1−ρ ,                                          (1)


where At , 1−ρ, and Kt denote respectively the productivity shock parameter, the distributive share

of capital, and the stock of capital. The productivity shock follows a first-order auto-regressive

stochastic process:

                                             ln(At+1 ) = γ ln(At ) + εt+1 ,                                  (2)


where εt+1 has a uniform distribution over [−1, 1].

        The cost-of-adjustment investment technology for gross investment (Zt ) is quadratic:

                                                      µ           ¶

                                               Zt = It 1 +          ,                                        (3)
                                                           2 v Kt

                                                                        1
where It = Kt+1 − Kt denotes net capital formation and                  v   is the cost-of-adjustment coefficient

(depreciation rate is assumed to be equal to zero). As usual, gross investment exceeds net capi-

tal formation because of some additional reorganization and retraining costs associated with the

installation of new capital.

        Producers maximize the expected value of the discounted sum of profits subject to the avail-

able production technology and cost-of-adjustment investment technology. The Lagrangian of the

The Lagrangian multiplier, Qt , is interpreted as the marginal Tobin Q.

is given by:

where Rt+1 denotes period t + 1 capital rental rate.

   Competitive factor markets imply that

   The investment rule in equation (6) states that the cost of investing an additional unit of

capital in the current period must equal to the expected present value of the next period marginal

productivity of capital, plus the next period decline in adjustment costs (resulting from the next

period enlargement of the stock of capital due to present period investment), plus the continuation

marginal value of units of capital which will remain in the future.

With a quadratic cost-of-adjustment function, the stock price, Pt , is equal to the marginal Tobin

      Log-linearizing the set of equations (5) and (7) around the deterministic steady state yields an

approximated expression for Qt , as follows5 .

      The equilibrium level of Pt is a linear combination of the state variables, at and kt , as follows:

for at and kt :

Based on equations (5) and (12), the non credit-constrained equilibrium investment level is given

by:



                                      It0 = vKt (B0 + B1 at + B2 kt − 1) .                           (13)


Equation (13) implies that the non-credit-constrained investment increases if productivity rises

as expected.


3.2     The Credit-Constrained Regime

We assume that the collateral required by the creditors in the credit market is a fraction, ω, of the

existing capital stock, Kt , minus liquidation expenses induced by the liquidity shock, Wt .6 That is,

the credit constraint is given by:



                                                   It ≤ ωKt − Wt ,                                                 (14)


The fraction ω is the creditor protection parameter (that is, better credit protection is associated

with a larger ω).7 The collateral insures the lender from any default on the firm’s debt.

    For simplicity, we assume that the aggregate liquidity shock, Wt , is permanent. We also assume

that after the realization of Wt , no future shocks are anticipated. That is, upon the realization in

period t of the liquidity shock, Wt , the investment constraint is a binding constraint in all present

and future periods: t, t + 1, ..., ∞. Thus, we assume that



                                         Is = ωKs − Ws for all s ≥ t.                                              (15)


3.2.1    Derivation of the credit-constrained stock price

The maximum value of the firm at the end of period t, Lt , is given by:

                                             ·                   ³                ´¸

and Mendoza (2006a,b).
    7
      In the literature on credit constraint and financial accelerator, the constraint tends to be based on a firm’s
market value ωqt Kt . However, if both qt and Kt are endogenous as in Mendoza (2006b), then no tractable solution
is available for qt . By using ωKt rather than ωqt Kt , we are able to provide tractable closed-form solutions for qt and
its volatility.


                                                            10
The ex-dividend stock price Pt , at the end of period t, is:


                                  L̂t
                       Pt =                                                                                    (17)

                            =         Et At+1 Kt+1 −      +            Pt+1 .
                                 1+r                 Kt+1 (1 + r) Kt+1



    Because the credit constraint is binding, we also have


                            Kt+s+1 = (1 + ω) Kt+s − Wt , for all s = 0, 1, 2, ...                              (18)


Using equations (16), (17) and (18), we write the stock price equation (expressed as a difference

equation) as follows:8

                                     µ             ³                  ¶

                         P̂t =     Et At+1 Kt+1 − ω 1 +    +     P̂t+1 .                                       (19)
                               1+r                      2v   1+r

Log-linearizing equation (19) around the deterministic steady state (see equation (9)), we get:

                          µ                                 ³                  ¶
                     1       ¡        ¡ ¢               ¢        ω ´ 1+ω
            P̂t =       Et K̄ 1 + ρ ln K̄ + at+1 − ρkt+1 − ω 1 +    +     P̂t+1 .                              (20)
                    1+r                                          2v   1+r



    We can now solve for the stock price P̂t , by “guessing” the linear equilibrium relationship

between P̂t and the state variables, at and kt :


                                            P̂t = C0 + C1 at + C2 kt .                                         (21)


The ”guess” is verified by the substitution of equation (21) into (20), to get:
   8
     To simplify the exposition, we assume that the realized value of Wt (which triggers the credit constraint to be
binding) is equal to zero.

4     Effects of the Liquidity Crises and Creditor Protection

We can now use the above results to derive the relationship between creditor protection and stock

price level and volatility in the presence of credit constraints and liquidity crises.


4.1   The Effect of Liquidity Crises on the Stock Price


We are now in a position to derive the expression for the expected returns in the stock market as

a function of the probability of the credit crunch. Let Ut be a dummy indicator for the credit-

constrained binding regime. That is, Ut = 1 when the credit constraint binds and Ut = 0 when the

credit constraint does not bind. The expected value of the stock price is:



                E [Pt ; at , kt , ω] = Pr (Ut = 0) Pt,unconstrained + Pr (Ut = 1) Pt,constrained       (23)


The probability of a credit crunch, Pr (Ut = 1), is given by



                                      Pr (Ut = 1) = Pr (It0 > ωKt − Wt ) .                             (24)


    Note that


                  ∂E [Pt ; at , kt , ω]       ∂ Pr (Ut = 0)
                                          =                  [Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained ]
                        ∂ω                         ∂ω
                                                ∂(Pt,constrained )
                                              +                    (1 − Pr (Ut = 0)).                  (25)
                                                       ∂ω


We can now state the following proposition:

                                                         12
   Proposition 1: If the creditor protection becomes stronger, the expected stock price rises

through two channels: (1) The probability of credit crunches diminishes; (2) The market value of

the firm rises in the credit-constrained regime.


   The proposition is proved by noting that:

   i)
                                             ∂ Pr (Ut = 0)
                                                           > 0,
                                                  ∂ω

because the expression Pr (It0 > ωKt − Wt ) depends negatively on ω.

   ii) Lifting the constraint must raise the value function if the credit constraint binds. Therefore,


                                           ∂(Pt,constrained )
                                                              > 0.
                                                  ∂ω


   iii) In general, the value function in the constrained regime cannot exceed the value function in

the unconstrained regime. This implies that



                                  Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained > 0.


4.2     The Effect of Liquidity Crises on Variance of the Stock Returns

By the variance decomposition rule, we have:



                             V ar [Pt ] = E [V ar [Pt |Ut ]] + V ar [E [Pt |Ut ]] ,              (26)


where V ar [Pt ] is variance of Pt .

   The first term on the right hand side of equation (26) is given by:




                                                      13
              E [V ar [Pt |Ut ]]                                                                        (27)

         = Pr (Ut = 0) V ar [Pt,unconstrained |Ut = 0] + Pr (Ut = 1) V ar [Pt,constrained |Ut = 1] .


Combining equations (11) and (21), we get:


                                           ¡                                 ¢
                       E [V ar [Pt |Ut ]] = Pr (Ut = 0) B12 + Pr (Ut = 1) C12 V ar [εt ] .              (28)


and

          V ar [E [Pt |Ut ]] = Pr (Ut = 1) (1 − Pr (Ut = 1)) (Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained )2 ,    (29)


where V ar [εt ] denotes the variance of the productivity shock.

    The effect of ω on V ar [Pt ] is, however, not easily tractable in the presence of productivity

shocks. To focus on the effect of liquidity shocks, it is useful to shut off the productivity shock(i.e.,

V ar [εt ] = 0). In this case,


            V ar [Pt ] = V ar [E [Pt |Ut ]]

                         = Pr (Ut = 1) (1 − Pr (Ut = 1)) (Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained )2 .        (30)


The effect of ω on the variance is:


         ∂V ar [Pt ]                                                              ∂ Pr (Ut = 1)
                        = (1 − 2 Pr (Ut = 1)) (Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained )2
            ∂ω                                                                          ∂ω
                                                            ∂ (Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained )2
                            + Pr (Ut = 1) (1 − Pr (Ut = 1))                                         .   (31)
                                                                             ∂ω




                                                       14
        From the preceding subsection, we recall that


                                                  ∂ Pr (Ut = 1)
                                                                < 0.                                                 (32)
                                                       ∂ω


Also, as shown above, we have:


                                     ∂ (Pt,unconstrained − Pt,constrained )2
                                                                             <0                                      (33)
                                                      ∂ω

Therefore,9
                                                    ∂V ar [qt ]
                                                                < 0.                                                 (34)
                                                       ∂ω

        This result is stated as a proposition.

        Proposition 2: If the creditor protection becomes stronger, the variance of stock returns

declines through two channels: (1) The difference between the stock prices in the constrained

regime and the unconstrained regime decreases with better protection of creditors; and (2) The

probability of credit crunches declines with stronger protection.

        We turn now to confront the main predictions of the model, in Propositions 1 and 2, with cross–

country data. Specifically, we look for the presence of the mechanism we uncovered theoretically

in the data.



5        Empirical support

Our model explains the empirical regularity presented in Section 2, higher stock market volatility

in countries with lower level of creditor protection. Our explanation relies on a specific mechanism

which we will now confront with the data. In particular, the model predicts that the volatility is
    9
    If V ar [εt ] is not equal to 0, then we can see that as ω rises, C1 will increase, and hence the volatility of Pt will
also increase in reaction to a shock to the technology, at . That is, when the constraint always binds, weak creditor
protection will reduce the stock price volatility. The intuition is that a binding credit constraint would reduce the
upside potential of good productivity shocks by constraining the firm growth.




                                                            15
generated by the crises and that creditor rights protection lowers volatility by lowering the frequency

of the crises and by lowering the magnitude of stock market decline during crises.

       First piece of evidence presented in Section 2, the fact that countries with higher level of creditor

protection experienced less of a decline in the stock market index during the current financial crisis

is indeed consistent with the predictions of our model. We want to make sure, however, that there

is also historical evidence to support mechanisms described in our model. In particular, our model

predicts that (1) the incidence of financial crises should be lower in countries with better creditor

protection and that (2) the decline in the stock market index during crises should be lower in

countries with better creditor protection.

       We define a liquidity crisis as a sharp decline in bank credit to the private sector. We define

observations in the top 10 percent tail of annual changes in the underlying variable as crises, listed

in Appendix Table 2. This corresponds to the annual decline of credit to the private sector by

10 percent.10 Thus, our liquidity crisis variable measures domestic liquidity crises and proxies for

periods when credit constraints are likely to be binding.11 By construction, the frequency of crises

in the full sample is 10 percent.

       Table 3 shows the relationship between the frequency of liquidity crises, as defined above and

the level of creditor rights protection. The top panel shows average incidence of crisis years in a

panel data, while bottom panel shows average share of years spent in crisis in the cross–country

data set. First note that, as we would expect, the frequency of crisis is higher in non–OECD

countries. More importantly, consistent with our model predictions, we find that countries with

higher level of creditor rights protection are less likely to experience liquidity crises, even within

the subsamples of OECD and non–OECD countries. These differences in the frequency of liquidity

crises are statistically significant, with the exception of the cross–country OECD sample. Thus,
  10
     We obtain the data on interest rates from IMF International Financial Statistics. We use line 22d for the bank
credit to private sector and divide it by the CPI index. We then calculate annual percentage changes in this variable
to identify liquidity crisis episodes.
  11
     Note that because we are interested not only in the on–set of the crisis, but in the crisis situation, we keep our
indicator to be equal to 1 in all the years that our procedure determines as crises, and not only in the first crisis year.

the data support first of the two main predictions of the model.

       Tables 4 and 5 show the relationship between the decline in stock market return during crisis

years compared to the stock market return in non–crisis years. Table 4 simply presents average

stock market return in crisis and non–crisis years, and the difference between these returns for

countries with high and low levels of creditor protection.12 We can see that in all subsamples,

except for OECD countries with low creditor protection, stock market return is negative in the

crisis years and positive in non–crisis years. For the full sample and for the non–OECD countries

with low level of creditor protection, the difference between stock return in crisis and non–crisis

years is statistically significant. However, only for the subsample of non–OECD countries do we

observe a larger decline in the stock market index for countries with low level of creditor rights

protection. Thus, the evidence in support of the second mechanism predicted by the model is

limited.

       Table 5 shows the “excess return” during crisis years, which is defined as a difference between

median, or average, returns in crisis and non–crisis years for each country. We can see that in all
  12
     Because our crisis indicator is a lagging variable and the stock market return is a leading variable, we lag our
crisis indicator by one year. We do not test the significance of a difference in decline between countries with high and
low creditor rights protection.

cases but one (OECD subsample with average returns difference), the decline in stock market return

is larger during crisis for countries with lower creditor rights protection, which is exactly what our

model would predict. Due to small samples, the difference are not statistically significant, although

in some cases P-values are rather low. Thus, once again, we find that the data are consistent with

the second mechanism predicted by our model, but that the evidence is not very strong.

    Overall then, we definitely cannot reject the possibility that the relationship between historic

stock market volatility or decline in stock market indexes during current crises and the level of

creditor rights protection works in the way described by our model. Moreover, of the two main

testable implications of the model, we find strong support for one (the frequency of crises) and

weak support for another (change in stock market returns during crises). Thus, we are confident

that our theory has empirical relevance.




6    Conclusion

In this paper we examine the connection between creditor protection, response to stock prices to

liquidity crises, and the volatility of stock returns. Tobin q model of stock prices predicts that the

strengthening of the creditor protection results in higher expected returns and reduced volatility.

We find broad empirical support for both the prediction of the model and the mechanism through

which creditor protection affects stock market returns.

    Our paper thus demonstrates the importance of creditor protection for the development of a

well–functioning stock market: strong creditor rights not only enhances stock market values, it also

reduces the volatility of the stock returns.

    Finally, there are other mechanisms through which creditor protection may affect the level and

volatility of stock market prices. For instance, Hale, Razin, and Tong (2006) analyze the moral

hazard channel.

    Around the steady state, (Qt+1 − 1)2 is an order of magnitude smaller than the term (Qt+1 − 1).
