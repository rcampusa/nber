Mergers and Marginal Costs: New Evidence on Hospital Buyer Power

NBER Working Paper No. 24926
August 2018
JEL No. I11,L40

                                         ABSTRACT

We estimate the effects of horizontal mergers on marginal cost efficiencies – an ubiquitous
merger justification – using data containing supply purchase orders from a large sample of US
hospitals 2009-2015. The data provide a level of detail that has been difficult to observe
previously, and a variety of product categories that allows us to examine economic mechanisms
underlying “buyer power.” We find that merger target hospitals save on average $176 thousand
(or 1.5 percent) annually, driven by geographically local efficiencies in price negotiations for
high-tech “physician preference items.” We find only mixed evidence on savings by acquirers.

1      Introduction
In the last several decades, hospital systems have consolidated substantially through hori-
zontal mergers (Cutler and Scott Morton 2013; Gaynor and Town 2012). Researchers and
regulators have raised concerns about these mergers’ potential negative welfare effects due to
increased concentration, and hospital mergers are heavily represented in Federal Trade Com-
mission investigations (Dafny 2014; Coate 2018). A typical justification for these (and many
other) horizontal mergers is their potential to generate efficiencies, leading to lower prices,
improved quality, enhanced service, and/or new product introductions, with a particular
emphasis on price (U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission 2010). A
necessary, though not sufficient, condition for mergers to lower prices is that they first lower
marginal costs. In this paper, we estimate the effects of hospital mergers on marginal costs,
and investigate underlying “buyer power” mechanisms (e.g., buyer size and its interaction
with buyer preferences as in Chipty and Snyder (1999)), using rich new data containing
hospital supply purchase orders issued by a large sample of US hospitals 2009-2015.
    Hospital supplies and devices accounted for a quarter of the growth in inpatient hospital
spending between 2001 and 2006 (Maeda et al. 2012). The product markets in our data
account for 23 percent of hospital operating costs (34 percent, excluding labor). Thus,
savings on supply input costs represent perhaps the largest potential merger efficiency that
is unambiguously marginal.1 In calculating these efficiencies, merging parties typically cite
the wide variation in prices paid across hospitals and argue that the merged entity will be
able to obtain discounts. This variation is indeed large, with a Gini coefficient of 0.08 (or a
coefficient of variation of 0.26) for the average category, across hospitals for the same exact
brand-month.2
    Our approach builds on recent work that estimates the effects of mergers on overall
hospital costs (Dranove and Lindrooth 2003; Harrison 2010; Schmitt 2017). Combining the
purchase order data with a database of hospital mergers, we estimate difference-in-differences
models that compare cost trends at target and acquirer hospitals to control hospitals.
    We find that the average merger target in our sample can expect to save 1.5 percent
or $176 thousand dollars per year (95 percent confidence interval [$43,201, $309,325]) on
    1
      When labor costs are cited as merger efficiencies, they are often either administrative in nature or due
to the shifting of services across facilities; the former is arguably less “marginal”, while the latter may involve
a quality tradeoff (Noether and May 2017).
    2
      This price variation has been found to be driven by heterogeneity in hospital preferences and bargaining
ability (Grennan 2013, 2014), and by variation in information and contracting frictions (Grennan and Swan-
son 2018a,b). The Gini coefficient is one half of the mean absolute difference between any randomly selected
pair of hospitals, which is precisely the expected savings calculation merging hospitals might perform, as
input prices are not typically shared during pre-merger due diligence.



                                                        2
costs for 47 top supply categories, while the average acquirer can expect to pay $302 dollars
more (confidence interval [$-73,459, $73,515]). Taking the Gini coefficients as one measure
of potential savings, these translate into targets saving 10 percent ([2.6,18.6]) of the amount
that might be claimed in a merger justification, and acquirers saving 0 percent ([-4.5,4.5]).
    In addition to being interesting in their own right, mergers also provide useful variation
to examine economic mechanisms underlying “buyer power” at a scale beyond individual
case studies, as they represent a shock to hospital system size that is plausibly uncorrelated
with trends in any particular supply market.3 Much like in markets for hospital services,
prices in hospital input markets are typically determined via bilateral negotiations. In such
an environment, the effects of mergers can be complex, depending on how they impact
market structure and bargaining abilities (Grennan 2013; Gowrisankaran et al. 2015; Lewis
and Pflum 2015; Dafny et al. 2017). Further, market power in upstream supply markets
may decrease prices, but market power in downstream services markets may lead to higher
downstream prices, and that greater overall pie may be “shared” with suppliers (Ho and Lee
2017).
    In all of our analyses, we consider whether cost reductions (if any) are achieved through
lower negotiated prices, cost-reducing shifts in utilization, or both. In our analysis of utiliza-
tion patterns, we pay particular attention to the role of “standardization”.4 While standard
Nash-in-Nash models of bargaining would predict lower prices for hospitals with larger con-
sideration sets, recent research has found that restrictive networks of health care providers
(Ho and Lee 2018, Gruber and McKnight 2016), restrictive drug formularies (Duggan and
Scott Morton 2010), and restrictive pharmacy networks (Starc and Swanson 2018) can lead
to lower costs for insurers. Similarly, hospitals argue that standardization of medical supply
purchasing results in large savings (Noether and May 2017). We also explore heterogeneity
in our reduced form merger treatment effects in order to speak to underlying mechanisms
via which marginal costs might be impacted (see Section 3.1).
    We find that target hospital savings are driven by a 2.6 percent decrease in costs for
physician preference items (PPIs): expensive implantable devices over which physicians typ-
ically have strong brand preferences. This effect is entirely explained by targets negotiating
lower prices within-brand, rather than changes in usage patterns, and is largest for small,
local mergers (5.3-6.3 percent). In contrast, acquirers’ 6.4 percent savings on inexpensive
    3
      The product markets we consider vary in several dimensions that are likely to affect bargaining or to
mediate the effects of mergers: these include supplier concentration, the strength of brand preferences based
on perceived heterogeneity in quality, and the relative importance of contracting intermediaries.
    4
      Throughout this paper, we follow industry terminology and use the term “standardization” to refer
to hospitals’ use of restrictive supply sets; e.g., use of one brand of implant for most joint replacement
procedures.



                                                     3
commodities (which are largest for cross-market mergers) are more than counterbalanced by
a small 1.1 percent increase in PPI costs post-merger. We find no significant evidence that
savings are mediated by supplier concentration, downstream market power, or standardiza-
tion. This set of patterns is nuanced, but consistent with: (1) buyer power driven by returns
to scale that are more local in PPIs and national in commodities; and (2) fixed adjustment
or renegotiation costs (Grennan and Swanson 2018b) making cost savings in commodities
more beneficial for large acquirer systems.


2       Data and Setting
2.1     Hospital Purchasing Data
The primary data used in this study come from a unique database of all supply purchases
made by over 1,200 US hospitals during the period 2009-2015. The data are from the
            TM
PriceGuide      benchmarking service (hereafter, “PriceGuide data”) offered by the ECRI
Institute, a non-profit health care research organization. For each transaction, we observe
price, quantity, transaction month, and supplier.
    Our analyses consider price negotiations between hospitals and suppliers for a large num-
ber of important product categories. Included products are among the top 50 product cate-
gories by either total spending or transactions. There are 71 such “top” categories total, but
once we omit product categories that are too broad or with missing or inconsistent data, 47
remain.5


2.2     Hospital and Merger Data
To perform the analysis in the current study, we obtained permission to contract a trusted
third-party to match facilities in the PriceGuide data to outside data from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the American Hospital Association, and a merger
roster. The third-party then provided us with access to the merged data for analysis, with
hospital-identifiable information removed.
    We obtained merger data from Cooper et al. (2015), which contain nearly all hospital
    5
     See Grennan and Swanson (2018b) and Appendix B for details. Note that we use the term “brand” to
refer to the “product” level at which prices are negotiated; e.g., Medtronic Resolute Integrity drug-eluting
coronary stent. We use “product category” to refer to the “Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System
(UMDNS) code” grouping included in the transaction files. The UMDNS system classifies devices by intended
purpose and mechanism of action (e.g. drug-eluting coronary stents have UMDNS code 20383). Finally, we
use “product class” to refer to each product’s FDA risk class I-III, which closely align with commodities
(class I), physician preference items (class III), and other medical/surgical products (class II).



                                                     4
mergers from 2000-2014. The data were generated by correcting known problems in the
AHA: errors in timing of mergers due to lagged survey response; and erroneous combination
of multiple facilities into single observations post-merger. These data were cross-checked
against data from Schmitt (2017) and several business intelligence databases: Irving Levin
Associates, Factset, and SDC Platinum. For more details on the merger data, see Appendix
D of Cooper et al. (2015).
   Each analytic sample includes facilities in the PriceGuide data that merged uniquely
by name and location to general acute care hospitals in the AHA data. The PriceGuide
data contain a large number (1,228) of hospitals; and the merger panel contains a large
number of mergers over the same period (445 transactions impacting 661 targets and 1,753
acquirers). However, our data only include a given target/acquirer if the merged PriceGuide
data contain at least one calendar year of pre-merger and post-merger data. Because the
PriceGuide members join the database in a staggered fashion over time, this requirement
reduces our sample to 33 targets and 98 acquirers taking part in 81 unique transactions,
and 436 non-merging controls. This restriction is costly; however, our sample contains many
merger case studies – whereas many analyses have considered single mergers in isolation
(Kwoka 2015) – and the rich transaction-level cost information across 47 different product
categories compensates in detail for this sample limitation.
   Appendix B describes the effects of each merge on representativeness of our sample. Our
sample covers larger hospitals, treating sicker patients, and more often in urban areas, than
the population of AHA member hospitals. The PriceGuide mergers are also more likely to
be non-profits and teaching hospitals, and tend to purchase in more categories.


2.3     Price Variation, by Product Class
For each of the products in our data, prices are determined in negotiation. The contracting
environment is described further in Grennan and Swanson (2018b) and Appendix C. Nego-
tiation can take place directly between a hospital administrator and a representative of the
product’s manufacturer, or hospitals may rely on group purchasing organizations (GPOs)
to negotiate their contracts for many products.6 Each product category is summarized in
Table 1.
    The bottom panel of Table 1 contains physician preference items. For PPIs, usage is
driven by brand preferences of physicians, often surgeons, choosing which brand to use to
treat a given patient. PPIs tend to be expensive cardiac and orthopedic surgical implants
used in relatively advanced procedures and are not purchased by all hospitals: only 386
   6
     GPO prices are typically used as a starting point for direct hospital-manufacturer negotiations for
physician preference items and capital equipment (Schneller 2009).

sample hospitals purchased the average PPI, and only 254 purchased “Cardiac Valve Pros-
theses.” Purchasing hospitals spent $28,767 per month on the average PPI, due to PPIs’
high prices.
    The top panel of Table 1 contains commodities. Commodity products can be used in
a hospital setting by hospital staff members with a variety of roles and scopes of practice.
Conditional on a few characteristics, such as material, we do not expect particular manu-
facturers to be strongly preferred. Commodities tend to be the most commonly-purchased
products in our data, purchased by 528 sample hospitals on average. They are markedly
less expensive than PPIs: the average hospital spends only $9,021 per month on the average
commodity.
    The final product class considered is other medical and surgical items, shown in the
middle panel of Table 1, which may have characteristics of both PPIs and commodities.
They are used in moderately invasive procedures, but may or may not be associated with
strong brand preferences. These products vary in popularity, and the unit price varies from
$8 to $6,000. On average, hospitals spend $13,286 per month on product categories in this
class.
    The competitive landscape varies dramatically across these classes. There are many
more brands to choose from in commodities (481) vs. PPIs (144). For PPIs, each brand is
typically purchased directly from its manufacturer (there are 19 in the average category), and
hospitals/systems tend to negotiate their own prices. In contrast, the average commodity
is available from 77 vendors, brands produced by a particular manufacturer may be sold
by multiple vendors, and hospitals are more likely to rely on GPO pricing (Schneller 2009).
Despite these differences, all three classes are highly concentrated according to Horizontal
Merger Guidelines, and there is a great deal of price dispersion: the average coefficient
of variation is 0.37 in commodities and 0.18 in PPIs; and the Gini coefficient is 0.10 in
commodities and 0.06 in PPIs.


3     Cost Implications of Mergers
3.1    Potential Mechanisms
Hospital leaders contend that mergers reduce costs through scale economies, reduced costs
of capital, and clinical standardization (Noether and May 2017). Our rich cost data allow
us to estimate the effects of mergers on “buyer power” in the form of scale economies in
supplier negotiations, clinical standardization, and the interaction between the two.
    The welfare effects of any merger efficiencies driven by input cost reductions will depend


                                              7
on the underlying mechanisms. In evaluating proposed mergers, the FTC and DOJ con-
sider whether cost efficiencies are likely to be large, whether they are likely to pass through
to consumers, and whether they are “likely to be accomplished with the proposed merger
and unlikely to be accomplished in the absence of either the proposed merger or another
means having comparable anticompetitive effects” (whether they are “merger-specific” (U.S.
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission 2010)). Thus, the agencies’ consid-
eration of efficiencies focuses for the most part on potential welfare gains in the downstream
market.
    Input cost efficiencies could also be welfare-neutral – a transfer between upstream and
downstream firms – or themselves welfare-reducing. Hemphill and Rose (2018) distinguish
cases where mergers increase monopsony power or bargaining leverage from cases where there
are real resource savings, such as reduced waste. They conclude that the former cases reduce
competition and should not be viewed by regulators as cognizable efficiencies.7
    Hospital costs include substantial fixed and variable components. The variable portion
of hospital costs scales with the number and severity of patients treated, the quantity of
labor and “capital” inputs used per patient, and the prices of those inputs. The prices
of inputs are, in turn, determined by brand choice and the price negotiated within each
brand. Mergers may in theory impact any part of the hospital’s cost function. However,
fixed costs are unlikely to pass through to patients in the short run, changes in patient mix
raise a battery of questions regarding agency and quality of care, and potential negative
effects of monopsony power on labor costs are not rated kindly by antitrust authorities.8
Thus, in this study, we focus on variable costs that are truly marginal in the sense that they
are incurred along with performance of additional patient care – those costs most likely to
impact downstream prices. Specifically, we examine whether mergers lead to economies of
scale in variable supply costs due to changes in input choices and/or pricing.
    An effect of mergers on efficient input choice might occur if, for example, a merger
entails the hospitals adopting the management practices of the most efficient merging entity.
Indeed, Bloom et al. (2014) find that larger hospitals have better management practices.
The converse could also be true: mergers and acquisitions may spread practices that are
detrimental to firms (Minemyer 2017) or consumers (Eliason et al. 2018).
    Analyzing input pricing requires close attention to the details of hospital procurement.
In hospital input markets, prices are determined via bilateral negotiations between suppliers
and hospitals, perhaps with GPOs acting as proxy for groups of hospitals. For products
   7
      One potential harm cited is dynamic inefficiency, in which upstream firms reduce investment and inno-
vation due to increased downstream monopsony power.
    8
      See discussion in Gaynor and Town (2012), regarding the DOJ’s allegation of competitive harm in the
purchase of physician services and temporary nursing services.


                                                    8
purchased through a GPO, we would predict a merger to impact purchasing if it moved the
combined entity to a more favorable GPO membership tier, or if it induced a change in GPO
and there is variation in purchasing across GPOs. For products whose prices are determined
separately for each hospital/system, a larger merged entity might negotiate lower prices than
either the target or acquirer would alone.
    The effect of mergers on bilateral bargaining is ambiguous in the economics literature.
When there is a monopoly supplier, larger firms may obtain better prices if the bargaining-
surplus function is concave, in which case the supplier’s surplus in bargaining with two
independent firms is smaller at the margin than the average surplus in bargaining jointly
with an integrated firm (Horn and Wolinsky 1988; Stole and Zwiebel 1996; Chipty and
Snyder 1999; Inderst and Wey 2007). Further, larger buyer firms may spur competition
among multiple suppliers (Snyder 1996, 1998; Dana 2012; Gans and King 2002; Marvel and
Yang 2008). This improvement in integrated buyers’ bargaining position may be reinforced
by an increase in bargaining power (an improvement in the merged entity’s disagreement
point). In work on insurer-hospital bargaining, Lewis and Pflum (2015) find that bargaining
power is a greater determinant of post-merger markups than bargaining position. Post-
merger changes in bargaining power (the share of gains from trade obtained, conditional
on bargaining positions) may be driven by various factors, including firm organizational
structure, information, incentives, management, and leadership.
    Finally, input choice and input pricing may interact. Dana (2012) posits that buyer
groups’ primary advantage results from their commitment to purchase from a single supplier
in differentiated product markets. We see evidence of this in the hospital-insurer bargaining
world: Sorensen (2003) shows that insurers’ steering ability impacts pricing more than in-
surers’ size; Gowrisankaran et al. (2015) model how insurers steer patients towards cheaper
hospitals; and Ho and Lee (2018) note that restrictive hospital networks could reduce insur-
ers’ prices by up to 30 percent.
    The evidence on these mechanisms suggests that mergers may impact input costs by re-
ducing prices within brand, by encouraging efficient utilization of inputs, or both. We proceed
by investigating the effects of mergers on brand-level prices, product category-level prices,
and standardization. We estimate separate treatment effects for each product category and
pooled treatment effects for PPIs, commodities, and other medical/surgical products. We
then go further to investigate mechanisms.




                                              9
3.2     Empirical Specifications
We estimate two reduced form price specifications. First, using a dataset containing unit
prices for each product category (UMDNS code) u, hospital h, brand j, month m, year y,
we estimate:

                 lnPuhjmy = αu ∗ 1[y = τh ] + βu ∗ 1[y > τh ] + θh + θjmy + εuhjmy                           (1)

where τh is the year of hospital h’s merger (if any), θh is a hospital fixed effect, and θjmy
denotes brand-month-year fixed effects.9 To avoid overweighting products purchased in small
quantities, we weight each hospital-brand-year using the brand’s expenditure share within
the hospital-year. The month of merger is unknown, so we estimate separate treatment
effects for the merger year (αu ) and the post-merger period (βu ).10 We estimate separate
regressions for acquirers and targets; the acquirers regression excludes targets, and vice versa.
Intuitively, this regression examines the effect of mergers on negotiated prices per unit across
all brands in a given category.
    Next, using the same dataset, we estimate:

                 lnPuhjmy = αu ∗ 1[y = τh ] + βu ∗ 1[y > τh ] + θhj + θjmy + εuhjmy                          (2)

where θhj denotes a set of hospital-brand fixed effects. This regression examines the average
within-brand effect of mergers on negotiated prices, for brands purchased both before and
after the merger. Comparing the results from specifications (1) and (2) tells us whether
lower prices are achieved due to renegotiation vs. switching. In all regressions where the
dependent variable is price, standard errors are clustered by hospital-brand.
    In addition to the product category-specific regressions, we also estimate pooled regres-
sions across all categories within each class. We stack all category-specific data within each
class and estimate specifications (1) and (2), weighting by the expenditure share for each
category within hospital-year, and allowing for hospital fixed effects θuh to vary by category
u.11
    In the left panel of Figure 1, we show the estimated coefficients βu and corresponding 95
percent confidence intervals for specifications (1) and (2), for targets only. We observe sev-
eral patterns of interest. First, each class has product categories with negative coefficients,
    9
      Brand-specific time trends are necessary to control for the presence of brands both early and late in
their life cycles in these data.
   10
      In our baseline results, we report specifications where the post-merger period is a single year. We further
restrict to mergers for which we have at least one year of pre- and post-merger data.
   11
      We also estimate regressions using a clustered wild bootstrap for inference; the results in Table A8 are
nearly identical to the main results in Table 2.


                                                       10
and product categories with positive coefficients, so that no clear visual pattern suggestive
of cost efficiencies for target hospitals emerges. Second, the within-brand (hollow) coeffi-
cients are not consistently scaled up or down relative to the across-brand (solid) coefficients.
Third, within commodities (circles) and other medical/surgical products (triangles), very
few product categories have significant price effects: exceptions include negative effects for
bone nails and trauma bone plates, and positive effects for monofilament sutures and spinal
bone plates. Finally, there are a number of negative and significant price effects for impor-
tant PPIs (squares) – defibrillators, pacemakers, and prostheses – but only one significant
positive coefficient, for spinal spacers.
     The left columns in the top panel of Table 2 show pooled coefficient estimates for each
specification and class. These results indicate that, on balance, targets exhibit insignificant
price increases in commodities or other medical/surgical products post-merger. However,
they save a significant 2.6 percent on PPIs – the negative price effects documented above
were in high-dollar categories (cardiac devices and prostheses) and more than offset the
few positive effects in categories like spinal spacers and embolization coils. Finally, the
within-brand coefficients are, if anything, slightly larger than the across-brand coefficients,
indicating that all savings can be accounted for by renegotiations, rather than brand switch-
ing.
     We observe a dramatically different pattern for acquirers in the right panel of Figure 1.
Price effects for commodities and other medical/surgical products are more often negative,
particularly for needles, IV administration, and in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) kits, which exhibit
negative and significant price effects on the order of 10-15 percent. Second, in stark contrast
to the target results, the coefficient estimates for PPIs are often positive, but clustered close
to zero. Third, the across-brand results for commodities are larger than the within-brand
results, though the differences are not significant within category.
     The pooled results are summarized in the right columns of the top panel of Table 2.
The commodity coefficients indicate savings of 6.4 percent for acquirers, only 1.4 percentage
points of which can be accounted for by renegotiation. There are no significant results for
other medical/surgical products, and prices go up slightly (1.1 percent) post-merger for PPIs.
     In order to better understand these patterns, we also performed several alternative spec-
ifications. First, we estimated the effects of mergers on hospitals’ tendency to standardize
purchasing within categories, hypothesizing that mergers incentivize systems to consolidate
purchasing across vendors in order to achieve better discounts (Noether and May 2017).
We estimate a version of specification (1) where the dependent variable is an indicator for
whether a hospital had “standardized” purchasing; we categorize a hospital as standardized
if it purchased at least 75 percent of units in a product category from a single vendor in

  fixed effects. Standardization specification includes hospital and year fixed effects.



Table 2; to fix ideas, the baseline rates of standardization are 70 percent for commodities,
50 percent for other medical/surgical, and 44 percent for PPIs. They are quite noisy –
the only marginally significant effect is that acquirers are more likely to standardize other
medical/surgical products post merger, and that result is sensitive to measure definition and
standard errors.13
    Second, we examine the concern that merging hospitals exhibit different latent trends in
prices: we estimate matched versions of specifications (1) and (2), using a weighted regression
after propensity score matching merging hospitals based on beds, Medicare and Medicaid
  13
     In Appendix Table A10, we change the standardization threshold from 75 percent to 90 percent; in
Appendix Table A8, we estimate standard errors using the wild bootstrap method. Neither alternative
specification finds significant standardization effects.

shares of discharges, HMO penetration, teaching and non-profit status, log(admissions),
log(technologies), and log(FTEs) (following Dranove and Lindrooth (2003)). The results in
Appendix Table A9 are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with our main results.
The main difference is that the matched version finds small, significant within-brand price
decreases for other medical/surgical products for both targets and acquirers.
    We next examine, as well as possible given the short pre- and post-merger periods avail-
able in our data, whether the results above are (1) driven by preexisting differential trends in
prices among merging facilities; or (2) biased due to merger effects that develop slowly over
time (e.g., due to fixed contracts that take time to renegotiate as in Grennan and Swanson
(2018b)). The pooled event study versions of our specifications are shown in Figure 2 below
for targets (left panels) and acquirers (right panels), and for commodities (top panels) and
PPIs (bottom panels). In each panel, we show one full calendar year pre- and post-merger;
the year of merger is highlighted in gray.
    While individual relative month point estimates are often noisy, several features stand
out. First, there is little evidence of differential pre-trends. Second, there is a clear difference
in price levels in the pre- vs. post-merger periods for acquirers’ purchase of commodities and
targets’ purchase of PPIs.14 Finally, there is no strong evidence that, where merger effects
exist, they are continuing to evolve at the end of the time horizon observed.15 Appendix
Figure A2 focuses on several categories with particularly large treatment effects: IV admin-
istration kits and needles (for acquirers) and resynchronization defibrillators and pacemakers
(for targets); the general patterns documented here are similar within individual case stud-
ies. These results are also robust to longer pre- and post-merger periods: Appendix Figure
A1 demonstrates that our short pre-/post-merger window does not miss delayed realizations
of price effects, nor does it miss a substantial pre-trend.
    Given the relatively high spend on PPIs vs. commodities and other medical/surgical
products, these results indicate that targets achieve higher savings post-merger than ac-
quirers. Across our 47 product categories, targets save an estimated $14,669 per month on
average, whereas acquirers experience an average net increase in spending of $27 (calculation
details in Appendix D).

3.2.1    Exploring mechanisms using treatment effect heterogeneity

As noted above, much of the literature regarding mergers and cost efficiencies focuses on
advantages associated with firm size, perhaps interacted with greater channeling ability.
   14
      Interestingly, savings to acquirers on commodities are achieved only in the calendar year after the merger
year, whereas savings to targets on PPIs begin to manifest within the merger year.
   15
      Table A11 shows the estimates if we include τh as a post-merger year. The results are smaller and more
precise, as expected.

Within our sample, we observe variation in both pre-merger size and the firm size change
induced by the merger. Though almost all of our transactions involve 1-2 target hospitals,
our acquirer systems range from very small (1 or 2 hospitals) to large (over 70 hospitals). The
effect of target and acquirer size on purchasing is ex ante ambiguous. The “concavity” theory
of Chipty and Snyder (1999) and others predicts largest effects for small targets joining large
systems, with small or zero effects for large acquirers. On the other hand, efficiencies may
be due to improved management practices, and there may be economies or diseconomies of
scale in sharing good management between merging hospitals.
    The top two rows in Table 3 show separate results for mergers involving small (1-3

hospitals) vs. large (4+ hospitals) acquirers. For the sake of brevity, we focus on PPI prices
for targets, and commodity prices for acquirers (full results available in Table A12). Within
targets, savings on PPIs are much larger among targets acquired by independent hospitals
or small systems (5.2 percent) than among targets acquired by large systems (0.9 percent).
In contrast, within acquirer hospitals, savings are larger among acquirers that are in large
systems prior to the merger (6.7 percent) than among small acquirers (an insignificant 3.7
percent).

Notes: Authors’ calculations from PriceGuide data. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, † p < 0.01. Standard errors clustered at the
hospital-brand level in parentheses. Coefficients estimated from pooled specifications (1) and (2). The dependent variable is
the logged transaction price measured at the hospital-brand-month-year. Small acquirers are hospital systems consisting of
1-3 hospitals pre-merger, and large acquirers are hospital systems with more than 3 hospitals. A target is categorized as “In
HRR” if there is at least one hospital in the acquiring system in the same HRR, and vice versa. Product categories are
classified as “High” concentration if its vendor HHI is above the median within its product class. ln(Output Price) is
estimated using the HCRIS as in Dafny et al. (2017). Standardization is an indicator for whether the hospital purchased at
least 75% of all units in a product category from a single vendor in a given calendar year.



    In making sense of these results, it is important to note that relative size of acquirers and
targets is closely related to whether the merger involves market overlap. As noted in Schmitt
(2017), many of the mergers in the recent “great reconsolidation” involve large hospital
systems acquiring hospitals in distant geographic markets. We next split the treatment
effects according to whether any of the merging hospitals share a hospital referral region
(HRR). Heterogeneity in merger effects by market overlap may be due to local economies
of scale in management/distribution of inputs, to local diffusion of management practices,
or to the relative roles of bargaining power vs. bargaining position in mediating merger
efficiencies.

                                                             16
     We compare treatment effects for in- vs. out-of-market mergers in the second pair of
rows in Table 3. The merger effects previously documented for targets’ purchase of PPIs
are concentrated in in-market mergers. In contrast, for acquirers the large savings on com-
modities are concentrated in out-of-market mergers. These results go hand-in-hand with the
size results above, as out-of-market mergers within our sample typically involve large acquir-
ers and in-market mergers typically involve small acquirers. Our results regarding target
hospitals and PPIs echo Dranove and Lindrooth (2003), in which cost savings are greatest
when previously independent hospitals integrate under a single license and consolidate fa-
cilities. Our results regarding acquirer hospitals and commodities are more consistent with
the large out-of-market merger effects documented in Schmitt (2017), though those effects
were strongest for the targets in out-of-market acquisitions.
     Finally, we examine whether merger effects are mediated by supply-side market structure.
To this end, we separate UMDNS codes within each product class into those above or below
the median HHI for the class. As noted in Table 1, the product categories analyzed in
this paper are almost all moderate-high concentration according to typical FTC and DOJ
standards. That said, the mean “High HHI” commodity has an HHI of 0.478, vs. 0.236
among the “Low HHI” commodities; the same measures among PPIs are 0.497 and 0.227,
respectively. The third pair of rows in Table 3 show that there is no meaningful or statistically
significant difference in price effects as a function of supplier competition.

3.2.2   Supply-side and demand-side market power

The fourth pair of rows in Table 3 examine whether the cost effects documented above
are muted due to mergers causing hospitals’ supply side and demand side market power
to increase concurrently. For example, if merger-enabled supply side market power allowed
hospitals to increase procedure prices, some of that pie could be shared with suppliers and
mitigate cost decreases due to increased demand side market power. To that end, we estimate
our same input price regression specifications, controlling for output prices. We employ the
method described in Dafny et al. (2017) to infer hospital prices from HCRIS reports.
    For targets and PPIs, controlling for hospitals’ downstream prices does not change the
estimated merger treatment effect – merger effects on targets’ PPI prices are not understated
due to price increases. If anything, adding this simple control reduces the estimated effect
of merging on acquirers’ commodity prices; this may be driven in part by some contempo-
raneous effect among the large, expanding hospital systems.




                                               17
3.2.3    Standardization and renegotiation

The final set of rows in Table 3 examines the interaction between merger effects and stan-
dardization. We estimate a simple modification of the above specifications, in which the
year-of and post-merger dummies are interacted with a dummy for hospital-category-year-
level standardization.
    The results confirm that targets receive savings on PPIs from merging, but the merger
price effect is not significantly amplified for hospital-categories that standardize. In con-
trast, the results are very noisy for acquirers’ commodity costs: we estimate a large negative
coefficient on the post-merger dummy interacted with standardization in the across-brand
specification; this interaction is (marginally) significantly positive in the within-brand spec-
ification. In sum, we find no consistent evidence that post-merger standardization is a
substantial source of savings for any merging party.


4       Discussion
The US hospital industry has experienced a large amount of contentious consolidation via
mergers over the last several decades. Marginal cost efficiencies have been perhaps the
most common justification offered for these mergers, often appealing to notions that “buyer
power” is increasing in hospital system size. Prior research examining aggregated accounting
measures of hospital costs that have been available previously has found mixed results.
    In this study, we use data on all purchase orders issued by a large set of US hospitals
2009-15 in order to conduct a detailed examination of the effects of mergers on the prices
paid for medical/surgical supplies, an important component of hospital marginal costs. The
most robust finding of efficiencies is target savings of 2.6 percent on targets’ purchase of
physician preference items.
    The variety of product categories in the data allows us to examine mechanisms under-
lying “buyer power” (which has previously been studied in theory and in case studies of
specific product markets). We examine heterogeneity in merger treatment effects across dif-
ferent product categories, and by acquirer size, local vs. out-of-market, and vendor market
concentration. We find that the observed savings on PPIs is driven by small, local mergers.
To the extent that such results are driven by concavity in the surplus function as in Chipty
and Snyder (1999), such efficiencies must only apply locally. Alternatively, these savings
may be consistent with integration and transfer of managerial practices. For less-expensive
commodity products, savings are strongest for large acquirers, suggesting limited focus on
or success in managing commodity costs among smaller systems.


                                              18
    The largest estimated savings, by targets on PPIs, can entirely be attributed to renego-
tiation, rather than brand switching. This transfer of surplus from device manufacturers to
hospitals is suggestive of increased monopsony power and may not increase efficiency; e.g.,
they may negatively impact dynamic incentives of suppliers to innovate or maintain product
quality or manufacturing reliability (see discussion in Hemphill and Rose (2018)).
    We offer these and all results with the caveat that our sample size of mergers is smaller
than we would like due to the relative newness of purchasing order data availability. However,
we believe the detail and breadth of the purchasing data brings new light to the study of
hospitals broadly, and mergers specifically.
    For hospital mergers in particular, another important phenomenon to consider is the
simultaneity of input market negotiation and output market negotiation. We control for
this using a proxy for hospital output prices, and it does not have a material effect on
estimates. However, a more detailed study would require matching hospital purchasing data
with private insurer claims, and modeling demand and negotiated prices explicitly in both
upstream and downstream markets. We see this as an important area for future research.

A     Merger Literature
As noted in Section 1, hospitals have consolidated substantially through horizontal mergers.
Much of this consolidation took place during the merger wave of the 1990s; more recently, the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) spurred another merger wave, with 105 deals reported in 2012
alone, up from 50 to 60 annually in the pre-recession years of 2005-2007 (Dafny 2014). The
purported reasons for this consolidation and “great reconsolidation” are varied. The merger
wave of the 1990s was coincident with the rise of managed care and it became conventional
wisdom that this relationship was causal – Town et al. (2007) dispute this, noting that
panel data analyses do not suggest that managed care penetration is significantly related to
hospital consolidation. The merger wave during the ACA years has been associated with
hospitals anticipating the need for large, coordinated organizations to manage population
health under payment reforms such as bundled payment and Accountable Care Organizations
(Dafny 2014).
    Efficiencies represent a key justification used by hospitals in defending their ability to
merge, as they present opportunities to lower price and improve quality. In survey data,
hospital executives commonly cite the following reasons for merging: 1) strengthening their
financial position, 2) achieving operating efficiencies, and 3) consolidating services (Vogt and
Town 2006). The general literature to date on the effects of hospital concentration has not
suggested that consolidation improves efficiency. The research on the quality, price, and cost
effects of mergers is summarized in Appendix Table A1. While an exhaustive review of the
evidence is outside the scope of this paper, the dominant narrative appears to be one of
mergers decreasing quality, increasing price, and having a mixed effect on costs.

B      Data Appendix
The primary data used in this study come from a unique database of all supply purchases
made by over 1,200 US hospitals during the period 2009-2015. The data are from the
            TM
PriceGuide      benchmarking service (hereafter, “PriceGuide data”) offered by the ECRI
Institute, a non-profit health care research organization. For each transaction, we observe
price, quantity, transaction month, and supplier for a wide range of product categories.
    The reported data are of high quality because they are typically transmitted as a direct
extract from a hospital’s materials management database. Hospitals have strong incentives
to report accurately because the analytics the benchmarking service’s web portal provides
are based on comparing the hospital’s submitted data to that of others in the database.16
    The raw transactions data contain 116 million observations for 2,876 members across
3,394 product categories and 2.7 million SKUs. Our analyses include 47 important product
categories, defined by their UMDNS codes. We restricted to the top 50 categories by spending
or number of transactions, yielding 71 categories total. From these, we excluded categories
that were too broad (e.g., “food item”) or where data quality seemed to be an issue.17
Next, creating the final analysis file required two key steps for each product category: (1)
rationalizing the multiple units of measure in which different transactions’ quantities were
reported, in order to analyze price for a common quantity across transactions;18 and (2)
generating brand IDs, in order to appropriately control for brand-specific price trends.
    Regarding the first step, although many medical and surgical product categories are sold
by the unit (a single coronary stent, e.g.), others are sold in pairs, boxes, cases, etc. The
transactions data indicates this distinction in the “unit of measure” field, and further notes
how many subunits are in each unit of measure using a “conversion factor” field. In order
to perform our analyses on the cleanest and most internally-consistent transactions data
possible, we transformed all transactions into price per single unit and quantity of single
units purchased. We also excluded UMDNS codes with inconsistent or missing quantity
data.19 The next Section details the second step, in which we categorize SKUs into brand
  16
       Nonetheless, there is some evidence that the data are incomplete. For example, we find it unrealistic
that some broadly used categories (e.g. examination gloves) do not include data from all hospitals.
    17
       We did this based on “reasonableness” of the observed price variation – categories for which the co-
efficient of variation in price exceeded 10 were excluded – and selected categories by hand that seemed
excessively broad based on their UMDNS names (e.g., “office supplies”). The list of product categories
excluded by hand is 88889, 99936, 88885, 88884, 88883, 88695, 88539, 88311, 88073, and 16101.
    18
       We also excluded product categories where the modal unit of measure accounted for less than one-half
of the data or where the quantity conversion factor was missing for at least one-third of the data.
    19
       Specifically, we excluded UMDNS codes for which the conversion factor (e.g., ten units per box) was
missing more than 1/3 of the time, or for which the modal unit of measure (e.g., “box” vs. “case”) accounted
for less than 50 percent of the data.

B.1     Identifying Brands in the Transaction Data
The absence of a brand identifier in the database creates a problem of sparsity, in which
many SKUs are purchased by only a small number of hospitals, or in only a small number of
months. The most thorough method we employed to identify brands, for a subset of products,
involved examining manufacturer catalogs, finding likely brand names, searching for similar
strings within the item description field, and validating SKUs for those brands against the
catalog numbers. This was infeasible for all product categories due to the large number
of manufacturers and SKUs. Additionally, many manufacturers’ websites were found to be
difficult to navigate, particularly once we extended the analysis beyond high-dollar physician
preference items. Finally, the item description field was often uninformative as to brand.
Hence, we used an algorithmic approach to assign brand identifiers for the other product
categories.
    Our preferred algorithm implements the Random Effect Expectation-Maximization (RE-
EM) estimation method from Sela and Simonoff (2011), which is an adaptation of a recursive
partitioning tree algorithm to allow for group effects. With no particular assumption made
about the significance of each letter within a SKU, recursive partitioning tree allows us to
obtain overfitting-proof groupings that minimizes the 10-fold cross validation error. Further-
more, the group effects in the RE-EM estimation method allow us to control for systematic
heterogeneity in price across hospital-time.
    Given a transaction i = 1, . . . , N where N is the size of the dataset within a UMDNS
code, price pi of the transaction, dummy matrix Zi indicating each transaction’s hospital-
time group, group effect bi , and attribute vector Di = {di1 , . . . , diL } where dil is the lth digit
of the SKU associated with transaction i, the RE-EM proceeds as follows:

   1. Initialize estimated group effect bˆi to zero.

   2. Iterate through the following steps until the estimated hospital-time effect bˆi converges.

       (a) Estimate a regression tree with recursive partitioning on price adjusted by hospital-
           time group effect, pi − Zi bˆi with attributes Di . Take the terminal nodes, j ∈ J,
           of the tree and create an indicator variable, I(Di ∈ j).
       (b) Fit a linear model, pi = Zi bi + I(Di ∈ j)µp + i and extract bˆi from the model.

   3. Once bˆi converges, take the final grouping j ∈ J and use it as the new product identifier
      for each i.

                                                  27
    At each iteration of step (2a), the tree is pruned using 10-fold cross validation at each split;
the model retains the simplest tree with cross validation error no more than one standard
error away from the tree with the minimum cross validation error.
    With this method, we categorized 149,543 SKUs across 47 UMDNS codes into 6,881
RE-EM brands. For surgical staplers and drug-eluting coronary stents, which we validated
by hand, we identified 3.8 RE-EM brands per “true” stapler brand, 0.8 RE-EM brands per
“true” drug-eluting stent brand.


B.2        Identifying Mergers
We combine our detailed transaction data with data from our M&A roster, which we obtained
from Cooper et al. (2015). These data represent a detailed roster of hospital mergers from
2000-2014. Further information on this data can be found in the Online Appendix to Cooper
et al. (2015). The first column of Table A2 displays the characteristics of hospitals involved
in M&A transactions in the full sample of AHA data from 2000-2014. The second column
focuses on transactions in the period for which we have hospital cost data: 2009-2014. In
our main analysis, we limit to mergers for hospitals we were able to link to the PriceGuide
database; the third column describes these transactions and hospitals. Finally, the fourth
column limits the sample to the first transactions observed for each target or acquirer in the
PriceGuide data, focusing on those transactions for which we observe at least one year of
pre- and post-merger data.20
    Focusing on the first panel, the Table shows that about half of the mergers in 2000-2015
took place in 2009-2015, so this time period is highly relevant for the current analysis. The
third column illustrates that the PriceGuide database covers approximately 28 percent of
the hospitals involved in M&A transactions in 2009-2015. The most severe limitation is in
the fourth column – because the PriceGuide members join the database over time, we only
have both pre- and post-merger data for about 18 percent of the PriceGuide merger data.
This is a substantial limitation, as these are the transactions and hospitals that will identify
our differences-in-differences estimates. However, we still have 81 case studies—covering 33
target hospitals and 98 acquirers—for carefully examining the effects of mergers for a variety
of product categories and consider this a meaningful sample on that basis.
    The facilities in the purchase order data voluntarily joined a subscription service that
allows them to benchmark their own prices and quantities to those of other members in the
database and thus may not be a random sample of US hospitals. In particular, subscription
is costly, so we expect hospitals with greater concerns about supply costs to be overrep-
  20
       Post-merger here refers to years following the year of the merger (i.e. y > τh ).

         Notes: Each column reports the counts and characteristics of merging hospitals in the data at
         varying levels of sample restrictions. Column (1) reports counts and characteristics of all mergers
         in our combined merger roster from 2001-2014. Column (2) reports data on mergers that overlap
         with the timing of the ECRI data. Column (3) presents the mergers for which there exists any data
         in the ECRI database. And, Column (4) presents mergers in the ECRI data for which we have
         adequate pre and post data to perform our difference-in-difference estimation. In Columns (3) and
         (4), the median target size is calculated over the targets which exist in the ECRI data; median
         acquirer size is calculated over all merging hospitals (targets and acquirers) in the data. Data on
         metropolitican area status and case-mix index (CMI) come from CMS Medicare Impact Files. Data
         on census division, beds, FTEs, technologies, admissions, teaching status, non-profit status,
         Medicare and Medicaid share come from the AHA Annual Survey. Output price is calculated using
         data from the CMS HCRIS and Medicare Impact Files as in Dafny et al. (2017).



resented in the database – for example, in a survey of database members, “cost reduction
on PPIs” and “cost reduction on commodities” were the first and second (and nearly tied)
most commonly cited reasons for joining. This is in accord with our own conversations with
purchasing managers who cite a broad array of reasons and product areas as motivations
for benchmarking. Table A2 shows that, on balance, our sample of mergers covers relatively
larger hospitals, treating sicker patients, and more often in urban areas.

C       Medical Supply Usage and Purchasing
For physician preference technologies, usage is driven by physicians choosing which brand
to use to treat a given patient, while prices are determined in negotiation between a hos-
pital administrator and a representative of the brand’s manufacturer. Hospitals typically
rely on the services of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to negotiate contracts for
many product categories, but GPO prices are used as a starting point for direct hospital-
manufacturer negotiations for physician preference items and capital equipment (Schneller
2009). For PPIs, there is no “search” in the conventional sense, as a given brand can only
be purchased directly from its manufacturer. For commodities, a given brand may be sold
by multiple vendors.
    Contracts typically specify a price for the contract duration, often a year. In the short
run, hospitals are reimbursed a fixed amount by private or public insurers based on the
services they provide, and so supply prices come directly from the hospital’s bottom line.
In our conversations with industry participants, the purchasing practices via which these
contracts are negotiated vary widely across organizations. Some hospitals have large ma-
terials management or purchasing departments with agents who specialize in negotiations.
Sometimes a large business unit, such as a catheter lab in the case of stents, will coordinate
its own purchasing separately from the rest of the hospital. Finally, hospitals vary in access
to information on the prices other hospitals pay via GPOs, hospital system membership, or
informal networks of peers.


C.1      GPOs and merger effects
Given the impact that GPOs may have on purchasing, it is natural to wonder how this is
borne out in the data. For example, if merging hospitals switch GPOs, then one might worry
about the extent to which we actually observe prices for these hospitals post-merger. We
address this concern by estimating the responses of quantities in a specification similar to
our standardization model. Here, the dependent variables are an indicator for whether the
hospital purchased any of a given product category in a year and log(quantity) for years in
which any quantity was observed. Appendix Table A3 reports the results of this exercise.
In general, we find no evidence that quantity declines post-merger in any substantial way.21


   21
     The exception to this is that we observe a negative 4.8 percent in the probability that we observe
acquirers purchasing any products from a given PPI category. This estimate is driven largely by Drug Eluting
Stents, for which we observe a 17.5 percent decline in purchase probability. While this result is large, the
fact that it is isolated to one product category helps alleviate concerns that hospitals systematically exit the
data post-merger.

D       Deriving Estimated Savings from Treatment Effects
A main object of interest for this study is the estimated yearly savings a hospital might
experience given the treatment effects we observe. In order to generate these numbers, we
calculate average yearly savings for class C as:
                                              X
                                    save
                                     dC =           β̂u ∗ (spenduhy|y<τh ),
                                              u∈C


where βu represents the target- or acquirer-specific treatment effect for UMDNS code u and
(spenduhy|y<τh ) is the target- or acquirer-specific pre-merger average yearly spending per
hospital. We aggregate these across categories within product class C to obtain estimates
of average yearly savings for target and acquirer hospitals. Table A4 shows the details for
these estimates. We find that target hospitals save $198,375 on PPIs, but pay more for other
medical surgical items ($8,241) and commodities ($14,113), for a net savings of $176,022
post-merger. We find that acquirers save $65,241 on commodities and $14,610 on other
medical/surgical items. However, this is entirely offset by increased spending on PPIs of
$80,172, for a net loss of $320 per year on average.
    Alternatively, we could calculate estimated savings by broad product class using total
average spending across UMDNS codes and the pooled estimates from our stacked regressions
presented in Table 2. Table A6 shows the details for these estimates. Here, we find that
targets save $165,056 and acquirers lose $19,735 per year on average.
    To clarify the source of the difference between the two approaches, note that Table 2
presents the treatment effect estimates from our stacked regressions, where β is estimated
by pooling all UMDNS codes in a given class and weighting observations by average an-
nual spending on each category.22 The covariance between spending and βu across product
categories generates the differences between our two methods of calculating total implied
savings.




   22
      Results are similar if we instead simply average the category-specific coefficients in Table A4, weighting
each coefficient by average annual spending.

Notes: Authors’ calculations from PriceGuide data. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, † p < 0.01. 95% confidence intervals
generated from a wild bootstrap clustered at the hospital-brand level in parentheses (n = 1, 000). Coefficients
estimated from pooled specifications (1) and (2). The dependent variable ln(Price) is the logged transaction price
measured at the hospital-brand-month-year. The dependent variable in the Standardization regressions is an
indicator for whether the hospital bought at least 75% of all units in a product category from a single vendor in a
given calendar year. All price specifications include brand-month-year fixed-effects. Standardization coefficients are
centered to indicate that the specification only includes hospital and yearly fixed-effects.

Notes: Authors’ calculations from PriceGuide data. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, † p < 0.01. Standard errors clustered at
the hospital-brand level in parentheses. Coefficients estimated from pooled specifications (1) and (2). The dependent
variable ln(Price) is the logged transaction price measured at the hospital-brand-month-year. The dependent variable
in the Standardization regressions is an indicator for whether the hospital bought at least 75% of all units in a
product category from a single vendor in a given calendar year. Hospitals are matched to their 10 nearest neighbors
using propensity scores from a probit, which models probability of merger using number of beds, Medicare and
Medicaid share of discharges, teaching status, non-profit ownership, HMO penetration, and log inputs (FTEs and
technologies) and outputs (admissions) as in Dranove and Lindrooth (2003). All price specifications include
brand-month-year fixed-effects. Standardization coefficients are centered to indicate that the specification only
includes hospital and yearly fixed-effects.

Notes: Authors’ calculations from PriceGuide data. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, † p < 0.01. Standard errors clustered at the
hospital-brand level in parentheses. Coefficients estimated from pooled specifications (1) and (2). The dependent variable is
the logged transaction price measured at the hospital-brand-month-year. Small acquirers are hospital systems consisting of
1-3 hospitals pre-merger, and large acquirers are hospital systems with more than 3 hospitals. A target is categorized as “In
HRR” if there is at least one hospital in the acquiring system in the same HRR, and vice versa. Product categories are
classified as “High” concentration if its vendor HHI is above the median within its product class. ln(Output Price) is
estimated using the HCRIS as in Dafny et al. (2017). Standardization is an indicator for whether the hospital purchased at
least 75% of all units in a product category from a single vendor in a given calendar year.
