                                               ABSTRACT

Many studies suggest that years of formal schooling completed is the most important correlate of good
health. There is much less consensus as to whether this correlation reflects causality from more schooling
to better health. The relationship may be traced in part to reverse causality and may also reflect “omitted
third variables” that cause health and schooling to vary in the same direction. The past five years (2010-
2014) have witnessed the development of a large literature focusing on the issue just raised. I deal
with that literature and what can be learned from it in this paper. I conclude that there is enough conflicting
evidence in the studies that I have reviewed to warrant more research on the question of whether more
schooling does in fact cause better health outcomes.

1. Introduction

       For theoretical and empirical reasons, the positive relationship between more schooling

and better health is one of the most fundamental ones in health economics. Clearly, the

relationship is part of the massive literature in health economics on the determinants of the health

of the population, a literature that originates from a demand for health model that I developed

(for example Grossman, 1972a, 1972b, 2000). That model emphasizes that medical care is only

one of many determinants of health, and it is natural to explore others. Moreover, my model

views health as a form of human capital and therefore a determinant of earnings. Hence, it is

natural to allow for and explore complementarities between health capital and other forms of

human capital, the most important of which is knowledge capital, as proxied by the number of

years of formal schooling completed.

       Empirically, the importance of the relationship is highlighted by Kolata (2007, p. 1):

“The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every

country where it has been studied is education. It is more important than race; it obliterates any

effects of income.” It also is underscored by Meara et al. (2008, p. 350): “With the exception of

black males, all recent gains in life expectancy at age twenty-five have occurred among better

educated groups, raising education differentials in life expectancy by 30 percent.”

       Table 1 contains additional empirical support of the importance of this relationship. The

table shows trends in the health and educational attainment of the U.S. population between 1910

and 2000. These trends highlight the dramatic improvements in these outcomes in the past

century. To be specific, the infant mortality rate fell by a factor of almost twenty, and the age-

adjusted mortality rate declined by a factor of almost three. At the same time, there was almost a




                                                 1
ten-fold increase in the percentage of the population who completed four years of college or

more.

<<Table 1 here>>

        To summarize the trends in Table 1, I have run regressions of each of the two mortality

rates on the schooling variable and trend terms. Given the high correlation between schooling

and time, the estimation of these regressions is perhaps more of an art than a science. In general,

my procedure is to experiment with linear, quadratic, and cubic trend specification and to select

the one with the lowest residual variance. For infant mortality, the cubic model outperforms the

other two. For age-adjusted mortality, the quadratic and cubic models do about the same. To be

consistent, I select the cubic model for both outcomes. The schooling coefficient in the age-

adjusted mortality regression is not, however, sensitive to this selection.

        The regression results are presented in Table 2. There are 50 observations in the infant

mortality equation because the schooling variable was available in 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940,

1947, 1950, 1952, 1957, 1959, 1960, 1962, and 1964-2002 (the last year in which infant

mortality was available when I compiled the series). There are 49 observations in the age-

adjusted mortality equation because that series ended in 2001.

<<Table 2 here>>

        The schooling coefficient is negative and statistically significant in each of the two

regressions. The growth in schooling “explains” approximately 30 percent of the reduction in

infant mortality between 1910 and 2000 and approximately 48 percent of the reduction in age-

adjusted mortality.1 The regression results in Table 2, however, and the evidence provided by

Kolata (2007) and by Meara et al. (2008) do not necessarily imply causality from more schooling


1
 For infant mortality, this was calculated as 100* [(22.9*1.617)/124.4] = 30 percent. For age-adjusted mortality, the
computation is 100*[(22.9*28.950)/1,448.2] = 48 percent.

                                                         2
to better health. Health may cause schooling or omitted “third variables” may cause health and

schooling to vary in the same direction.

       Students in poor health are almost certain to miss more days of school due to illness than

their healthy peers and may also learn less while they are in school. Both factors suggest

negative effects of poor health in childhood on school achievement and ultimately on years of

formal schooling completed. Furthermore, this causal path may have long-lasting effects if past

health is an input into current health status. Thus, even for non-students, a positive relationship

between health and schooling may reflect causality from health to schooling in the absence of

controls for past health. Health also may cause schooling because a reduction in mortality

increases the number of periods over which the returns from investments in knowledge can be

collected.

       Productive and allocative efficiency models generate causality from education to health.

In the former model, the more educated are assumed to obtain more health output from given

amounts of medical care and other inputs. In the latter model, the more educated are assumed to

pick a different input mix to produce health than the less educated. That mix gives them more

output than the mix selected by the less educated.

       Since health and schooling are both endogenous, unobserved “third variables” may cause

both of these outcomes to vary in the same direction. Fuchs (1982) identifies time preference as

perhaps the key third variable. He argues that persons who are more future oriented (who have a

high degree of time preference for the future or discount it at a modest rate) attend school for

longer periods of time and make larger investments in their own health and in the health of their




                                                 3
children. Thus, the effects of schooling on these outcomes are biased if one fails to control for

time preference.2

        During the past five years (2010-2014), many studies have appeared that attempt to

assess whether more schooling does in fact cause better health or health behaviors that contribute

to this outcome. In the remainder of this paper, I focus on these studies and what can be learned

from them.

2. Classification and inventory of studies

        Table 3 contains a classification and inventory of the kinds of studies in the period from

2010 through 2014 that I will discuss. Thirty-eight studies are listed in the table, although there

may be others with which I am not aware. These studies are of three types. The first type

directly includes such hard-to-measure third variables as time preference, cognitive development,

noncognitive development, and past health. The second type controls for unobserved genetic

and environmental factors by examining the effects of differences in schooling obtained by

identical twins on differences in their health outcomes. The third type employs the technique of

instrumental variables. The idea here is to find exogenous variables that are correlated with

schooling but not correlated with unmeasured variables that affect health. In addition, they have

no effect on health, with schooling held constant. These variables serve as instruments for

schooling in the estimation of health equations by two-stage least squares. One such instrument

is the enactment of a law that increases the required amount of formal schooling

<<Table 3 here>>

        Many of the studies in Table 3 employ a simple conceptual and econometric framework.

Contributions by Nobel Laureate James J. Heckman and his colleagues (Conti and Heckman,

2
 For a detailed discussion of the framework employed to study the health-schooling relationship, see Grossman
(2006) and the references that I cite in that paper. My discussion includes a model in which schooling causes health
because it makes people more future oriented.

                                                         4
2010; Conti et al., 2010; Savelyev, 2014; Savelyev and Tan, 2014) are of a very different nature.

They employ the framework developed by Heckman and colleagues (for example, Cuhna et al.,

2010), one that conceptualizes the technology of cognitive and noncognitive skill formation in

childhood and adolescence as key determinants of completed schooling and health as an adult.

In their framework, self-productivity (skills produced early in life increase skills at later stages)

and dynamic complementarity (early investments raise the marginal product of later investments)

interact to generate multiplier effects. Hence, investments in adolescence have much larger

payoffs when earlier investments are made.

         Heckman and colleagues stress the importance of noncognitive skills as key third

variables. They include in these skills the “big five personality traits”: conscientiousness,

openness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Their econometric framework is much

more complicated than that in the other studies that I will discuss. It incorporates latent

cognitive and personality skills, measured and unmeasured components of those skills, factor

analysis to control for measured and unmeasured cognitive development, and the simultaneous

estimation of outcome and measurement equations.

         The studies in Table 3 include research that addresses (1) the relationship between an

individual’s own schooling and his or her own health; (2) the relationship between parents’

schooling and their children’s health; and (3) the relationship between schooling and

mechanisms that may lead to worse or better health outcomes. Examples are health knowledge,

fertility choices, and such unhealthy behaviors as cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol

consumption, and overeating and lack of exercise—sometimes reflected by a large body mass

index (BMI) and obesity.3 In the remainder of this paper, I will discuss empirical results in the


3
  I consider fertility as an outcome because children in large families tend to have worse health outcomes than those
in smaller families.

                                                          5
studies in Table 3. Given the large number of studies in that table, I cannot deal with all of them.

I do try, however, to give a balanced picture of the nature of the findings.

3. Inclusion of third variables

       The eight studies in Table 3 that include hard-to-measure third variables all find positive

and significant effects of completed schooling on at least some key measures of adult health and

beneficial health behaviors. For example, Van Der Pol (2011) controls for time preference in the

Dutch DNB Household Survey. In that survey, respondents were asked how much they would

willing to give up today in order to get a certain amount of money next year. Outcomes include

self-rated health, cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), and obesity.

       To cite another example, Conti and Heckman (2010) control for cognitive and non-

cognitive ability at age 10 and health at that age in an examination of outcomes at age 30 in the

1970 British Cohort Study. These outcomes include self-rated health, daily smoking, and

obesity. Conti and Heckman report positive effects of education on self-rated health and the

negative effects of this variable on smoking and obesity. The education effects are more

important for those with higher levels of cognitive ability, but less important for those with

higher levels of noncognitive ability.

       To cite a final example, Savelyev (2014) focuses on life expectancy in the Terman Life

Cycle Study of Children with High Ability. Members of this sample have IQs greater than 140,

which corresponds to the 99.6th percentile of the IQ distribution. They were 11 years old in

1921, were followed through 1991, and all were high school graduates. For men, graduation

from college increases life expectancy at age 30 by approximately 9 years compared to non-

graduates. This result holds the big five personality traits and health status (all measured at age

12) constant. No effects are observed for women. The findings for men indicate that the



                                                 6
favorable effects of education on health persist among those with extremely high levels of

cognitive ability and are not limited to completion of primary or secondary school.

       How much do the significant schooling effects fall once third variables are held constant?

Given differences in outcomes, third variables, and samples in the three studies just reviewed and

in others, there is no straightforward answer to this question. Van der Pol (2011) reports that the

effects of schooling on self-rated health falls between 7 and 14 percent in alternative

specifications once time preference is held constant. The inclusion of the latter variable has,

however, no impact on the effects of schooling on smoking, BMI, and obesity. Conti and

Heckman, who find that the education effect is largest in the case of daily smoking, indicate a

reduction of approximately 25 percent in this effect when cognitive and noncognitive skills and

health at age 10 are employed as regressors. Savelyev (2014) does not consider this issue. He

does indicate, however, that the 9-year increase in life expectancy for college graduates

compared to high school graduates mentioned above exceeds the 6-year differential in that

outcome between the highest and the lowest deciles of his key third variable: conscientiousness.

The important message in the studies that employ direct measures of third variables is that there

are few instances in which large schooling effects are reduced by a significant percentage by the

these variables or in which the net effects of these variables exceed the net effects of schooling.

4. Twin differences

       Results from studies that focus on twin differences have the flavor of a “point-

counterpoint.” Behrman et al. (2011) find no effects of differences in education on differences in

adult mortality or hospitalizations in a Danish twin registry that consists of 2,500 identical

(monozygotic, MZ) twin pairs. Amin et al. (2013) report no effects of education on obesity,

smoking, and physical health in a sample of 741 female MZ twin pairs in the United Kingdom.



                                                  7
Madsen et al. (2010) indicate no overall effects in the same sample employed by Behrman et al.

(2011) but negative effects in the outcomes considered by Behrman and colleagues for males

born before 1935 and negative effects for cases in which there are large schooling differences

within twin pairs.

       The last two findings are counterpoints to the absence of schooling effects in the first two

studies. Webbink et al. (2010) provide another counterpoint. They report a negative impact of

schooling on male obesity in 350 Australian MZ twin pairs. They do not, however, find an effect

in the 350 MZ female pairs.

       In three studies, Lundborg and colleagues provide somewhat stronger counterpoints to

the conclusion that more schooling does not cause better health in twin data (Lundborg, 2013;

Lundborg et al., 2012a; Lundborg et al., 2012b). Lundborg (2013) reports effects in the expected

direction of high school completion on self-rated health, chronic conditions, and exercise

behavior among 347 MZ pairs in the Midlife in the United States survey. There are, however, no

effects on smoking and BMI.

       Lundborg et al. (2012a) find negative effects of schooling on mortality in a Swedish twin

registry consisting of 9,000 MZ pairs. Individuals with at least 13 years of schooling can expect

to live an additional 24 years at age 60 compared to 21 years for those with less than 10 years of

schooling. Moreover, 84 percent of low-educated individuals lived to age 70, compared to 90

percent of high-educated individuals. These results control for twin differences in birthweight

and height.

       Lundborg et al. (2012b) report a negative effect of MZ twin mother’s schooling on her

son’s health in the Swedish twin registry employed in the previous study. The finding pertains to

sons who have enlisted in the military, with health measured by physical examination



                                                 8
administered to 300 twin pairs on enlistment. There is no effect of MZ twin father’s schooling

on the health outcome.

5. Instrumental variables

       All but one of the 22 instrumental variables studies in Table 3 use compulsory school

reform or school entry cutoff dates as the instruments for schooling, sometimes combined with

new school openings at a differential rate among areas. These studies account for more than half

of those in the table, and I will group my discussion of them by the outcomes they consider.

First, I will consider those in which adult mortality is the outcome. Second, I will review those

in which the outcome is adult health, health behaviors, or health knowledge. Finally, I will

comment on those that focus on the impacts of parents’ schooling on infant and adolescent

health. Like the twin differences studies, the instrumental variables studies have the flavor of a

point-counterpoint.

5.1. Adult mortality

       Clark and Royer (2013) report no effect in Britain. They conclude (p. 2089): “Our

results…suggest that economic models that assume a strong causal effect of education on health

ought to be carefully reconsidered.” Meghir et al. (2012) present a similar lack of evidence of a

schooling effect in Sweden. Van Kippersluis et al. (2011) indicate a very different finding for

men but not for women in the Netherlands. For men surviving to age 81, a one-year increase in

the number of years of formal schooling obtained due to compulsory school reform lowers the

probability of dying before age 89 by 3 percentage points relative to a baseline percentage of

those who will die in that period of 50 percent. Buckles et al. (2013) report a complementary

finding for men in the United States. In their study, college completion reduces cumulative




                                                 9
mortality by almost 30 percent relative to the mean for men ages 38-49 in 1980.4 Given the

evidence in the latter two studies, the conclusion by Clark and Royer (2013) seems somewhat

premature.

5.2. Adult health and health behaviors

        When adult health and health behaviors are outcomes, the evidence also is mixed.

Braakmann (2011) finds no effects on variety of self-rated health measures, smoking, heavy

drinking, and diet in Britain. Similar findings are reported by Clark and Royer (2013).

Powdthavee (2011) indicates a negative effect on hypertension based on physical exam in

Britain. Fabrice and Jones (2011) indicate negative effects on smoking and quitting smoking in

France. Buckles et al. (2013) find negative effects on smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity; and

a positive effect on exercise in the U.S. Atella and Kopinska (2014) report negative effects on

BMI and caloric intake and a positive effect on calorie expenditure in Italy.

5.3. Health knowledge and related behaviors

        Agüero and Bharadwaj (2013) show that more educated women in Zimbabwe have more

knowledge about HIV and fewer sexual partners than their less educated peers. Andalón et al.

(2014) show that more educated Mexican women have more conceptive knowledge and are more

likely to use contraception at sexual debut than less educated women. Dinçer et al. (2014) report

similar results for the effects of Turkish women’s education on their knowledge of the ovulation

cycle and their use of modern family planning methods. Finally, Mocan and Cannonier (2012)

find positive effects of women’s schooling on their use of modern contraception and on the

likelihood that they are tested for AIDS in Sierra Leone.

5.4. Infant health, adolescent health, and mechanisms

4
 Buckles et al. (2013) do not use compulsory school reform or school entry age laws as their instrument for
schooling. Instead, they employ the risk of induction into the armed services during the Vietnam War era in that
capacity.

                                                        10
       McCrary and Royer (2011) fail to uncover effects of mother’s schooling on low

birthweight, infant mortality, maternal smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, and prenatal

care use for pregnant women in California and Texas. Chou et al. (2010) uncover negative

effects of mother’s schooling on low birthweight, neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality, and

infant mortality in Taiwan. An increase in schooling associated with compulsory school reform

saved almost 1 infant life in 1,000 live births in that country. Lundborg et al. (2014) show that

an increase mother’s schooling has positive effects on their sons’ physical health and height in

Swedish military enlistment register data. Dinçer et al. (2014) find positive effects of mother’s

schooling on age at first marriage and at first birth, a negative effect on number of pregnancies,

and weak evidence of negative effect on infant mortality in Turkey.

6. Discussion

       There is enough conflicting evidence in the studies that I have reviewed to warrant more

research on the question of whether more schooling does in fact cause better health outcomes.

Future research in this area will be especially helpful if it confronts and tries to address the

following issues:

       School entry ages used by McCrary and Royer (2011) and others as instrument may not

be exogenous because parents can hold their children back or petition to have them start early.

Shigeoka (2014) finds almost 2,000 births per year shifted from a week before to a week after the

school entry cutoff date in Japan.

       Why do the results of instrumental variables studies vary so much? Is it because they

instruments used in different studies may affect different groups, so that local average treatment

effects, rather than average treatment effects, are being obtained?




                                                  11
       Twin studies typically have small sample sizes. Differences in schooling between

identical twins may be small. Why do identical twins obtain different amounts of schooling?

       Some instrumental variables studies find that ordinary least squares estimates are

consistent. Some do not test this. Schooling is endogenous, but is it possible that recursive

model with uncorrelated errors is correct? That is, to what extent do third variables influence

schooling but have no impact on health with schooling held constant?

       Studies I discussed focus on years of schooling completed; what about the quality of

schooling? There is some work in this area (for example, Frisvold and Golberstein, 2011), but

much more could be done.

       What are the mechanisms via which schooling influences health and health behaviors?

Does it provide specific health information or general knowledge that leads to better health

behaviors and improved health outcomes? Alternatively, is more schooling a vehicle in the

construction of a future orientation, one that is required to make decisions today that will have

favorable consequences for many years to come?
