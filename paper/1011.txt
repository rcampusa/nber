                 Unemployment Insurance and Reservation Wages




                                  ABSTRACT




          The present paper examines the reservation wages reported by a large
sample of unemployed individuals in the United States in May 1976. The majority
of unemployed    individuals report reservation wages that are at least as high
as the wage they were paid on their last job. Approximately one—fourth of all
job seekers required a wage that is at least 10 percent higher than the wage on
their previous job.

          Our econometric evidence shows that the level of unemployment benefits
relative to previous wages has a powerful effect on the individual's reservation
wage. A ten percent increase in the U.I. replacement ratio increases the reser-
vation wage by about   percent for job losers who are not on layoff and by
somewhat less for other unemployed groups. Separate regressions to analyze the
high reservation wage per se show that a ten percent increase in the U.I. replace-
ment   ratio also increases by about four percentage points the probability that
an unemployed individual will require a wage increase of 10 percent or more.

          These estimates imply that reducing net unemployment insurance bene-
fits (by lowering gross benefits or by taxing unemployment benefits) could
significantly lower the average duration of unemployment and the relative number
of long duration spells of unemployment. Because of. the norilinear response of
the unemployment duration to the reservation wage, reducing a high unemployment
insurance ratio by ten percentage points is likely to have a greater impact on
unemployment than reducing a low unemployment insurance ratio by ten percentage
points.

1. Introduction

           The principle imperfection in modern labor markets is the downward

rigidity of existing nominal wages. As a result, a decline in the marginal

value product of an employee's labor is likely to cause a temporary or permanent

layoff rather than a downward wage adjustment. Such separations are inefficient

because they waste job specific human capital and cause employees to work at new

jobs in which their productivity is lower than it would be if they remained at

their previous job.1

           Although wage reductions on an existing job are rare, an employee who

loses his job is likely to find that the wage on his next job is lower than the

wage on the job that he lost. There are at least five reasons to expect this

wage reduction: First, the original job loss is likely to have occurred because

of a decline in the value of the employee's services. This may reflect a

deterioration of the employee's own skills, a change in available production

methods that makes existing skills less valuable, or a decline in the real price

of the product that the employee produces. Second, even if there has been no

separations and of the second—best character of contracts that entail such

 decline in the actual value of an employee's services, he may lose his job

because his employer accumulates enough information to decide that the value of

those services is below his wage. Third, as we have already noted, the change

in jobs is likely to involve some loss of job—specific human capital. Fourth, a

prospective     employer who is not able to judge the skill level of a new employee
will pay a lower wage until information accumulates. Finally, employees with
substantial job tenure nay receive wages that exceed the marginal value product
of   their   labor while new   employees are paid less than their marginal value pro-

duct (Medoff and Abraham, 1978, and Lazear, 1931, 1982).

             The actual wage on the new job depends on the job—seeker's willingness

to search and to wait. A job loser may have to wait a long time unless

he reduces his reservation wage below the wage that he received on his last job.

The more he reduces his reservation wage relative to his previous wage, the

sooner the job loser can expect to find new work.'

             The traditional distinction between voluntary and involuntary

unemployment pushes this notion to the extreme and classifies an individual as

voluntarily or involuntarily unemployed according to whether or not he is

willing to work at a wage that is less than or equal to his previous wage. The

search theory model of unemployment2 implies that this two—way classification is

less meaningful than using the individual's reservation wage as a continuous




  1Several empirical studies indicate that a higher relative reservation wage
reduces the probability of leaving unemployment and becoming employed (Baron
and Mellow, 1981, and Warner et al., 1980).

  2See Stigler (1962) for the basic idea of the theory. A more formal model is
presented in a number of places, e.g., McCall (1970), and Mortenson (1971).
                                        —3—


 measure of the eagerness or reluctance of the job—seeker to accept employment.

 Even an individual who is willing to work for less than his previous wage will

 be voluntarily unemployed in the sense that he rejects wage offers below his

 reservation wage. Nevertheless, a comparison of the reservation wage with the

wage on the last job is useful simply because the probability of finding an

acceptable job is likely to decline rapidly as the reservation wage exceeds the
                 1
previous wage.

          An alternative theory might   replace   the notion of voluntary and in-

voluntary unemployment with a comparison of the individual's reservation wage with

the socially optimal reservation wage for that individual. The socially optimal

reservation wage for an individual reflects a balancing of the gains of addi-

tional job search (measured by the increase in the individual's marginal product

in a better job) against the cost of that search (measured by the value of fore-

gone production, net of the value of leisure, during the period of additional

search.) The primary reason for the difference between the privately optimal

reservation wage and the socially optimal reservation wage is that unemployment

insurance benefits decrease the private cost of unemployment but not the social

cost of unemployment.2 Because of unemployment insurance, the privately optimal

reservation wage exceeds the socially optimal reservation wage and job search is

inefficiently prolonged.


  1The starting wage is of course not the only attribute of the new job. Other
features of the job itself, expected future wage increases, pension arrange—
merits, etc., all influence the job's attractiveness. We implicitly assume that
these features do not differ between the previous job and the prospective new
job and that they vary nnotonica11y with the wage.

  2The private reservation wage also reflects the income tax that reduces both
the opportunity cost of unemployment and the reward for finding a better job.
But if the marginal tax rate is constant, this effect is at most of secondary
importance.

            It would be good to xxasure the extent to which private reservation
wages exceed the corresponding social optima and to estimate the actual effect

of unemployment insurance on this gap. Unfortunately, although data are

available on individual reservation wages, no direct observation or calculation

of socially optimal reservation wages is possible. In the present study we

therefore compare an individual's reservation wage with the wage he earned

on his previous job. The wage on the previous job is of interest in itself in

this context and can also be interpreted as an indication of the socially opti-

mal reservation wage.

            The previous wage is likely to exceed the socially optimal reservation

wage for individuals who lost their previous job. By definition, a job loser

was willing to continue working for his previous employer at his previous wage.

Thus the previous wage was at least equal to the individual's previous private

reservation wage. Since unemployment insurance makes the private reservation

wage greater than the social reservation wage, the previous wage was greater

than the previous socially optimal reservation wage. Since the unemployment

itself reflects or causes a fall in the distribution of potential wade

offers,1   the new socially optimal reservation wage is also lower than the pre-

vious socially optimal reservation wage. Thus the previous actual wage exceeds

the new socially optimal reservation wage.

           The present paper examines the reservation wages reported by a large

sample of unemployed individuals in the United States in May 1976. At that



  1The five reasons given above for a lower post—unemployment wage can be
interpreted as reasons for a downward shift of the distribution of potential
wage offers.

time,   the econoniy was still recovering from the recession that ended in

March   1975. The overall unemployment   rate   of 6.7 percent indicated that
substantial    slack still remained in the labor market. We report information

separately for those individuals who are classified as job—losers and those who

report that    they voluntarily quit their previous job. Specific attention is

given   to the relative level of unemployment insurance benefits as a determinant
of the reservation wage.
             A most striking finding in our analysis is that the majority of
unemployed individuals report reservation wages     that   are at least as high as the

wage they were paid on their last job. But the median reservation wage

ratio1 is less important than the substantial fraction of job seekers who

require wages that are significantly higher than their last wage. The evidence

presented in section 3 shows that approximately one—fourth of all job seekers

require a wage that is at least 10 percent higher than the wage on their last

job. Not surprisingly, individuals who voluntarily left their previous job

generally report even higher reservation wage ratios. Fully 31 percent of job

leavers are seeking new jobs that pay at least 10 percent more than their pre-

sent wage.

             Several previous studies (e.g., Baron and Mellow, 19b1, and Warner,

Poindexter and Fean, 1980 ) have noted that the nan of the reservation wage

ratio or of some closely related nasure2 is less than one and concluded that



  1We use the term "reservation wage ratio" for the ratio of the reservation
wage to the wage on the individual's last job.

  2The usual nasure is the ratio of the reservation wage to the wage predicted
for the individual. Section 2 discusses this ratio and the reason why it is
likely to be lower than the reservation wage ratio that we analyzed.
                                          —6—


this is consistent with the theoretical expectation that unemployed     individuals
set low reservation wages. By looking only at the average reservation wage,

these studies fail to see the large   percentage   of individuals who have set

significantly high reservation wage ratios. Only Clark and Summers (1919) note

that a significant fraction of reservation wages exceed the individuals' pre-

vious wages.

           The official procedure of the U.S. Department of Labor classifies an

individual as unemployed if he is not currently working and has done something in

the past four weeks to find employment. No reference is made in this criterion

of uneinploy-ment to the individual's reservation wage. Even someone whose reser-

vation wage is so high that essentialy all feasible wage offers would be

rejected is thus officially classified as unemployed. In section 2 of the pre-

sent paper we use information on the individual reservation wages to adjust the

official unemployment statistics. We define an adjusted unemployment rate by

excluding everyone whose reservation wage is above the wage on their last job.

A more conservative procedure defines an adjusted unemployment rate by excluding

those with reservation wages above 1.1 times their last wage.

           The primary focus of the present research is the effect of

unemployment insurance on reservation wages. Section 5 of the paper summarizes

previous research on this subject and discusses the specification of the reser-

vation wage equations that we use to estimate the effect of unemployment

insurance. Section 6 presents parameter estimates for these equations and sec-

tion 7 discusses the implications for the expected duration of unemployment and

for the probability of long spells of unemployment. There is a brief concluding

section.
 2. Data and Definitions

            Our analysis is based on a special study of the job search methods of

 the unemployed that was conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor in May 1976.1

 A total of 4,668 persons in the Current Population Survey in May 1976 were

 classified as unemployed and asked to fill out a special supplementary question-

 naire concerning previous work experience and earnings, current job—seeking

methods and aspirations, and related questions. In many households, the form

was left to be filled in later or was mailed to the unemployed person after a

telephone interview. The nonresponse rate was 31 percent and resulted in a

total sample of 3,238 completed questionnaires. Although there is no reason to

expect   a systematic bias in the sample of respondents with respect to the
questions of interest in this paper, a 31 percent nonresponse rate is clearly a
reason   for caution in interpreting any precise numbers.

           Since our interest is in the ratio of the individual's reservation

wage to his or her previous wage, we have eliminated from the Department of

Labor sample all those individuals who are classified as new entrants (who have

no previous wage) or reentrants (whose previous wage may refer to a much earlier

period). Some individuals who answered the questionnaire did not provide infor-

mation about their reservation wage or their previous wage. A small group of

respondents provided such extreme answers (reservation wages that were nre

than three times their previous wage or less than one—third of their previous

wage) that we thought it best to disregard those answers as indicating that the

respondents did not understand the question or were unwilling to provide an



   1See Rosenfeld (1977) for a description of the survey and a copy of the
    questionnaire.
                                         —8—




 answer.   Our final sample contains 2,228 nen and women for whom all the required

 data are available.

              Our neasure of the reservation wage was based on the following pair of

 questions:     (1) "What kind of work were you looking for (in the period for April

 18 through May 15)?" and (2) "What is the lowest wage or salary you would accept

 (before deductions) for this type of work?" Individuals who indicated that they

were looking for more than one kind of work were asked to specify their reser-

vation wage for the type of job that they preferred.

           In our basic analysis, we compare this reservation wage to the wage

that the individual describes as "the usual earnings ...    before deductions" on
the "last job at which you worked for two consecutive weeks or more."

Individuals were also asked whether they had had a higher paying job since

January 1, 1971. Approximately one—fourth of the individuals in our sample

responded that they had had such a job and they were asked to specify their

usual earnings on that job. We also present some analysis based on the ratio of

the reservation wage to this previous highest earnings.1

           Survey respondents were also asked whether they received any

unemployment insurance benefits during their current spell of unemployment.

Those who had received benefits were asked what their weekly benefit was. In

our analysis of the effect of unemployment insurance on reservation wages, we

use the ratio of this reported U.I. benefit to the highest previous wage, i.e.,

the highest wage on any other job since January 19114 including the last job.



   1lndividuals may indicate their usual earnings as a rate per hour, per week,
per month or per year. As long as the unit is the same for the reservation
wage and the previous wage, the specific choice of unit is irrelevant. When
the units are not the same, we convert by assuming 140 hours per week and
14.3 weeks per month.
                                               —9—




              It is important to note that our unemployment insurance variable
 refers to the amount of U.I. benefits actually received during the   unemployment
 spell and not to the benefits to which the individual was entitled under the
 law.     This difference makes it very difficult to interpret the distinction bet-

 ween those who receive UI. benefits and those who do not. An individual may not

 receive U.I. benefits because Ci) he is not eligible for benefits (having

 exhausted benefits or had insufficient previous work experience) or because (2)

 he has not yet applied for benefits or because (3) he has applied but has not

yet received benefits because of administrative delays in the payment of U.I.

benefits.

             This last point deserves further explanation. In most states there is

a one week "waiting period" in the first unemployment spell per benefit year

before the individual becomes eligible for unemployment insurance. But even

after the individual is eligible for benefits and is actually accruing benefits,

he may not be receiving those benefits because of administrative delays in pro-

cessing payment. A significant fraction of individuals during the first few

weeks of unemployment may be accruing benefits even though they have not yet

received their first U.I. benefit checks. Such individuals should behave as if

the net cost of unemployment is reduced by the accruing U.I. benefits even though

they are recorded in our statistics as not receiving benefits. Since about half

of the unemployed job losers in May 1976 were in the first     weeks 01' their

unemployment spell, this is a potentially serious problem in interpreting the

receipt   or non—receipt of   U.I. benefits.

            The problem of interpreting the absence of U.I. benefits does not of

course apply to interpreting the ratio of U.I. benefits to wages among those who
                                             —10—




do receive U.I. benefits. Our analysis of the effect of U.I. therefore concentrates

on the effect of variations in the U.I. replacement rate (i.e., the ratio of U.I.

benefits to previous      wages) among the U.I. recipients. Some evidence for the
entire sample confirms that      there are problems      of   interpreting the nonreceipt of

benefits.


3.    Distribution of Reservation Wage Ratios


               As we noted in the introduction, several previous studies have coin—

mented that on average reservation wages are slightly less than some measure of

potential wage. These studies have failed, however, to note that significant

variation of the reservation wage ratio around its average implies that a

substantial fraction of employees have reservation wages that exceed their

potential wage. The present study examines the full distribution of reservation

wages and shows that about one—third of the unemployed state that their minimum

wage requirement exceeds their last wage while less than one—third of the

unemployed are willing to accept a wage reduction of 10 percent or more.

            The Labor Department's own analysis of the questionnaire emphasizes

the willingness of some of the unemployed to accept low wages but says nothing

about the high relative reservation wage required by a substantial group. Thus

the   Labor Department study notes    that   "about 1    out of 5 (unemployed) were

willing   to   accept less than $2.30 an hour (the minimum wage level in May 1976)"

and that "in contrast, only 1 out of 10 of the employed who were paid on an

hourly basis reported such low earnings" (Rosenfeld, 1977, p. 39). In the same

vein, that study reports that "only 6 percent of the unemployed were asking $7

an   hour or more, the earnings reported by         11 percent   of employed workers"
(Rosenfeld, 1977,     pp. 39—t0).
                                            —11—


             In addition to ignoring the high side of the distribution of reser-

 vation wages, the Labor Department's comparisons ignore the differences between

 the potential wages of the unemployed and the actual wages of the employed.

 Indeed, the Labor Department's report itself cautions that the employed and

 unemployed have vastly different demographic characteristics and work experience

 that riake their own comparisons potentially- very misleading.

             Other   researchers have sought to reduce this problem of noncom—
 parability by relating each individual's reservation wage to the wage predicted
 for an employed     individual   with the same demographic characteristics and   labor

 force   experience.1   There is, however, strong reason to believe that the
unemployed differ from the employed in systematic ways that        are not recorded in
the    survey questionnaire but that influence both the probability of unemployment

and the potential wage. Workers of higher "quality" (in a sense that can be

observed by employers or prospective employers but that is        not recorded in the
survey)    are nore likely to be employed and, if' employ-ed,   to earn a higher wage.
Comparing the reservation wage of' an unemployed worker to the wage predicted

from    a regression equation estimated with a sample of employed workers is thus
likely to understate the ratio of the reservation wage to the true potential
wage.

            We avoid the "unobserved quality" bias by comparing each individual's

reported wage to his own past wage. Even this is subject to problems. For job

losers, our reservation wage ratio is likely to understate the ratio of the

reservation wage to the true potential wage for the reasons discussed in



   1See, for example, the studies by Baron and Mellow (1978, 1981) and
Warner, Poindexter, and Fearn (1980).
                                             —12—


 section 1.    For example, an individual who was overpaid on his previous job,

 i.e., whose wage exceeded his marginal product, is more likely to have become

 unemployed. Similarly, individuals are likely to become unemployed when a

 reduction in the demand for a product causes a fall in the individual's marginal

 revenue product. In contrast, for individuals who quit their last job, the pre—

 vious wage may understate the wage that the individual might reasonably hope to

 receive. An   individual   may   quit   because he believes that he is in a job that

does not pay him the value of his marginal product or that does not permit him

to be as productive as he might be in some other occupation or firi. Our analy-

sis therefore presents separate information for job losers and job leavers.

          Although our primary concern is with the distribution of reservation

wages and the relative frequency with which reservation wages exceed previous

wages, we begin in Table 1 by examining the mean reservation wage ratios for

different groups of unemployed workers.

          The first line of Table 1 presents the reservation wage ratio for all

unemployed individuals in our sample grouped by the number of weeks that they

had already been unemployed at the time of the survey. For the sample as a

whole, the mean ratio of the reservation wage to the wage on the last job was

1.01, implying that on average the unemployed are seeking a wage that is higher

than the wage that they received on their last job. The reservation wage ratio

declines with the duration of the unemployment spell but the differences are

not large.1 Even among individuals who have been unemployed for six ntrnths



  'Several earlier studies found that the reservation wages of individual
employees declined with the time that they remained unemployed, e.g.,
Kasper (1967), Keifer and Neumann (1979), and Holt (1970).
    — 13-

or   longer, the mean reservation wage ratio is not significantly different from

one. 1,2

            Eliminating individuals who voluntarily left their previous job and

focusing on job losers shows very similar results (line 2 of Table 1). The

overall mean reservation wage ratio for this group is 1.03 and declines slightly

from 1.06 among those unemployed less than five weeks to 1.0 at 20 weeks and

0.97 after a year. Lines 3 and 4 divide the job losers into those who are on

layoff expecting to return to their original job and those who have no expec-

tation of returning. The group on layoff reports a mean reservation 'wage ratio

of   approximately 1.0 at all durations while the   "other job losers"   report reser-
vation wages   that on average decline from 1.1 times their past wage during the

first four weeks of unemployment to about equal to their last wage after six

months and about 10 percent below their last wage after a year. Although the

decline of 17 percent in the reservation wage is quite significant, it is even

more striking that these job losers began with reservation wages that on average

were 10 percent above their last wage and only reached their last wage after six

months without work. As expected, the job leavers (line 5) have even higher

aspirations which decline only slowly with the length of the spell of unemployment.


   1The standard errors of the mean ratios are approximately 0.03 for most of
the ratios in Table 1. Some of the means refer to relatively small numbers
of individuals (e.g., the mean corresponding to 15 to 19 weeks) and are
subject to standard errors that are approximately twice as great.

   2These figures underestimate slightly the extent of the decline in the
reservation wage when inflation is raising all wages. In 197() wages were
rising at the rate of about 0.6 percent per month. An individual who is
unemployed for five months might ceteris paribus expect a wage that is three
percent higher than his last wage. This is offset to the extent that indi-
vidual skills decay with extended unemployment and that individuals who
experience longer periods of unemployment uay on average be of lower
"quality" relative to their previous wage than individuals who have had only
a short spell of unemployment. Adjusting the figures in Table 1 for inflation
would imply a stronger negative relation between the reservation wage and
unemployment.
                                         —15—

            The last three relate the reservation wage to the highest wage that

the individual earned on any job after January l9T4. For some individuals, the

 last job was a temporary job with a relatively low wage which provides a poor

 standard of comparison. For such individuals, the highest wage since January

197I is a better measure of the potential wage and may even, because of the

passage of time, represent an underestimate of the potential wage in 1916. For

others, however, the highest earnings in the past two years may represent a tem-

porary job with abnormally high wages that reflect the temporary character of

the position.

            The mean reservation wage ratios based on the highest previous wage

are only a few percent below the reservation wage ratios based on the last job.

For all unemployed persons in the sample, the mean is 1.00 in comparison to the

1.07 based on the last wage. For job losers the mean is 0.98, or five percent

below the 1.03 for this group based on the last wage. In short, even when the

reservation wage is related to the highest past wage the mean reflects no

willingness to reduce wages and implies that there is a significant group that

is seeking a higher wage than they have had before.

           Table 2 shows the nature of this distribution of relative reservation

wages explictly. Among all of the unemployed individuals in our sample (line

i), only 2I percent indicated that they would accept a wage less than 90 percent

of their last wage. An additional 11 percent were willing to accept between 90

percent and 100 percent of their previous wage. This is shown as the cuuiula—

tive 35   percent   corresponding to a reservation wage of less than 1.0. Thus

only about one-third of the unemployed were willing to accept any wage reduction

at all.

           A further 27 percent indicated that they would accept any wage equal

to or greater than their last wage but nothing less, thereby bringing the curnula—

Save for Table 2
                                           —17--




tive percentage of the reservation wage ratio less than or equal to 1 to 62 per-

cent. Thus, 38 percent of the unemployed had a reservation wage greater than

their previous earnings. Only about one—fourth of those who required a wage

increase said they would accept an increase of less than 10 percent. The cumu—

lative proportion below a reservation wage ratio of LI was thus 0.72. Fully 28

percent of the unemployed said they would only return to work if they received a

wage that was 10 percent higher than their previous wage.

             The large percentage of the unemployed who require wage increases to

accept new employment is characteristic of both job losers and job leavers.

Line 2 shows that only 41 percent of job losers would accept a reduction from

their last wage and that 24 percent say they would not accept a job unless it

paid at least 10 percent more than their last job. The percentage requiring a

wage increase is even higher for job leavers (line 5).

             Lines 6 through 8 repeat the analysis with the reservation wage rela-

tive to the highest previous wage. Even among the job losers, only 48 percent

say they will accept any reduction in pay at all while 20 percent say they

require a wage that is at least 10 percent higher than their highest previous

wage.

             The   final three lines restrict the sample to individuals between the
ages of 25    and 55.   This excludes the young people and those near retirement,
two groups that nay     have   weaker labor force attachment and therefore relatively
higher reservation wages. But even in        this   age group, the mean   replacement wage

ratio is virtually one (0.99 for all unemployed and 0.98 for job losers) and
less than half of the unemployed indicate a willingness to accept any wage
reduction.

           An important reason for the high reservation wage ratios and the high

fraction of individuals who require a wage increase as a condition of'

reemployment is the system of unemployment insurance benefits. Before pre-

senting the evidence for this conclusion in sections 5 and 6, we turn in the

next section to consider the implications of the high reservation wage ratios

for the general problem of measuring unemployment.


..   The Measurement of Unemployment

           The   Department of Labor does not consider everyone who is   not   working
to be   unemployed. An individual is officially classified as unemployed only if

he is available for work and has n.de specific efforts to find a job within the

past four weeks. The purpose of this standard is to count as unemployed only

those who really want to work but are unable to find a "suitable" job.

           But as we noted in the introduction to this paper, no limit is placed

on the individual's reservation wage in defining his willingness to work and

therefore his unemployment status. No nEtter hov high or infeasible the

individual's reservation wage i.y be, he is classified as unemployed if within

four weeks he did athing to find employment, including asking friends or rela-

tives about jobs, checking with a private or public agency or answering

newspaper ads.

            It is interesting to consider what happens to the measured

unemployment rate if we exclude     individuals with "unreasonably" high reservation
wages. In   May 1976, the   overall unemployment rate was 6.7 percent. Individuals
classified as job losers and job leavers accounted for L.2 percentage points or

a little less than    two—thirds of total unemployment. In   the sample that we ana—

lyzed in   the previous section, only 35 percent of job losers and leavers mdi—
                                         —19--



cated a willingness to work for less than their last pay. If we defined an

individual as unemployed only if he is willing to accept a wage that is lower

than his last wage, 59 percent of those who are currently classified as

unemployed job losers and 68 percent of job leavers would be reclassified and no

longer counted as unemployed. The .2 percent of the labor force that is

classified as unemployed job losers and leavers would be reduced to 1.6 percent

and the overall unemployment rate would fall from 6. percent to 14.1 percent.

This sharp reduction in the defined rate of unemployment occurs without any

reexamination of the reservation wages of those who are classified as new

entrants or reentrants.

            A weaker standard of reclassification continues to regard as

unemployed anyone whose reservation wage does not actually exceed his past wage

even though he is not willing to reduce his wage at all. Among job losers, 31

percent would be reclassified by this standard because their reservation wage

ratio exceeded their last wage; among job leavers, 1.2 percent would be

reclassified. The result would be a 1.14 percentage point reduction in the

unemployment rate to 5.3 percent. Again, this 20 percent reduction in the

unemployment rate occurs without any reclassification of the new entrants and

reentrants.

            An even weaker standard accepts as unemployed anyone whose reservation

wage does not exceed 110 percent of his last wage. Even this very weak standard

eliminates more than one—fourth of job losers and leavers and therefore reduces

the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent.

            Table 3 presents the official May 1976 unemployment rates for the

population as a whole and for several desographic groups and compares these

official rates with two alternative "adjusted" unemployment rates. The

"adjusted   rate 1" figures exclude   from the unemployed that share   of the
     —20--



Save for Table 3
                                        —21—



losers and leavers who reported reservation wages 1.10 or more times their last

wage.     The "adjusted rate 2" figures exclude that share of the losers and
leavers whose reservation wage ratio   exceeds 1.0.   No figures are presented for
the more stringent criterion that classifies an individual as unemployed only if
he is willing to accept less than his previous wage.


            The adjusted rate 2 figures indicate, as we noted in the previous

paragraph, that reclassifying anyone who wants a wage increase in his previous

wage reduces measured unemployment by more than one—fifth. The nist striking

difference among the subgroups is the small effect of reclassification on teen-

agers. Since teenage unemployment includes many more new entrants and

reentrants, reclassification on the basis of previous wages is quite limited.



5. The Reservation Wage Equation: Specification and Previous Research

            We turn now to examine the extent to which the level of unemployment

insurance benefits raises the level of reservation wages and the probability

that the individual's reservation wage ratio will exceed one. In the theory of

search unemployment, the individual's reservation wage is a decreasing function

of the cost of remaining unemployed and therefore an increasing function of the

ratio of unemployment benefits to previous wages.1

            Although unemployment benefit rules differ among states, the typical

benefit fornula provides that an unemployed worker gets basic weekly benefits

equal to about half of his previous gross weekly earnings, subject to a maximum



  'The importance of unemployment insurance as a cause of higher reservation
wages and a longer duration of search is discussed in Feldstein (1913a,b) and
developed in formal nde1s by Baily (1977, 1978), Mortenson (1977) and IIirdett
('979).
                                         —22—




weekly amount that is a binding constraint for a minority of beneficiaries. In
addition, about one—third of the labor force lives in states that provide addi-

tional   benefits for dependents. Unemployment benefits are subject to federal
income tax only when family income exceeds $25,000 for a couple filing a joint
return or $20,000 for a single person filing an individual return; even in these
households, half of' unemployment benefits are excluded in calculating taxable
income.1   Unemployment benefits are also not subject to payroll tax or to state

income tax.2 Unemployment benefits therefore typically replace about two—thirds

of   recipients' lost net income.3
           Earlier studies, although not dealing directly with the reservation
wage ratio, indicate that higher levels of unemployment insurance benefits do
increase reservation wages. Warner, Poindexter and Fearn (1980) use the 1910

Census Employment Survey and relate the job—seekers reported reservation wage to

the itrket wage predicted for someone with those demographic characteristics and

to a dummy variable that indicates whether the individual receives unemployment

insurance benefits. The receipt of unemployment benefits raises the reservation

wage by 8.6   percent   (with a standard error of' 1.o   percent.)   There is no inf or—

mation on the amount of benefits or on the ratio of the reservation wage to the

individual's previous wage.

           Fishe (1982) studies a group of job seekers in Florida for whom data

are available on individual attributes and on the nErket wage of' the job that



     No federal tax was levied on unemployment insurance in 191

  2Soine states levy a tax on the federal income tax base or a tax that is
proportional to the federal tax payments. In either of these cases, unem-
ployment benefits are subject to partial taxation at the state level.

  3See Feldsteiri (l971) for a detailed analysis of unemployment insurance
replacement   rates.
                                       —23—


the individual takes at the end of the unemployment spell. Although there is no

reported information on reservation wages, Fishe uses a censored regression

model to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of a reservation wage equation.

He concludes that unemployment insurance raises the reservation wage and that

the reservation wage varies inversely with the remaining length of the period

for which benefits will still be paid.

           The final study of unemployment insurance and reservation wages of

which   we are aware is the research by Pucher and Harrison (1915) who report

regression equations based on the 1970 Census Employment Survey. They focus on

inner city workers and relate the observed reservation wage to a predicted

potential wage (based on the job seeker's demographic characteristics) and

dumjr variables indicating whether the individual received a small or large

amount of unemployment insurance benefits in the previous year. Since these

unemployment   insurance variables reflect the duration of unemployment but refer
to   a different period, it is difficult to know how their positive coefficients

should be interpreted.

           In short, while the previous studies suggest that unemployment

insurance raises reservation wages, none of these studies actually uses data on

either the ratio of unemployment benefits to wages or on the ratio of the reser-

vation wage to the individual's previous wage. The present study therefore aims

at a more explicit evaluation of the effect of unemployment insurance by

relating the reservation wage ratio to the unemployment insurance replacement

rate. We also give particular attention to the effect of unemployment insurance

on the probability that an individual's reservation wage will exceed the wage

(or 1.1 times the wage) that he earned on his last job.
                                       214


          Our unemployment insurance variable is the ratio of the weekly bene-

fits received by the individual during the current spell of unemployment to the

net wage that he earned on his last job. It would in principle be desirable to

calculate the marginal income tax rate for each person in our sample and to use

that tax rate to calculate the ratio of U.I. benefits to previous net earnings.

Because the data required to calculate each individual's marginal tax rate are not

available for our sample, we have assumed a common marginal tax rate of 30 percent.

          Because we do not recognize differences in marginal tax rates, our

measure of the U.I. replacement ratio understates the replacement ratio for indi-

viduals with high marginal tax rates and overstates the replacement ratio for

individuals with low marginal tax rates. Since individuals with high marginal

tax rates are likely to be individuals with high wage rates and therefore lower

than average U.I. replacement ratios,' our procedure generally understates the low

replacement rates and overstates the high replacement rates.

          An example will illustrate the nature of this bias. Consider a low

wage individual who earns $200 a week, receives benefits of $100 a week and

pays a marginal tax rate of 25 percent. We measure his replacement rate as $100

divided by 70 percent of $200 or 0.71; in reality his replacement rate is $100

divided by 75 percent of $200 or 0.67. A high wage individual earns $1400 a

week, receives benefits of $150 a week and pays a nRrginal tax rate of 35 per-

cent. We nasure his replacement rate as $150 divided by $2d0 or 0.514 when the

correct measure is 0.58. Thus our replacement rates stand in the ratio of 0.71

to 0.514 or 1.31 while the "true" replacement rates stand in the ratio of 0.67


  1Recall that benefits   are generally proportional to wages   up to some maximum
weekly benefit.
                                       —25—


to 0.58 or 1.16.

          The result of exaggerating the variation in the measured U.I. replacement

rate while keeping the mean unchanged is to bias its estimated coefficient in a

regression equation toward zero.1 In addition, any purely random errors in the

U.I. replacement rate introduced by our procedure will cause a further downward bias

of the usual errors in variables type. For both reasons, therefore, our proce-

dure is likely to underestimate the effect of any changes in unemployment benefits.

          We have already described the measurement of the dependent variable of

our analysis, the reservation wage ratio. We use the ratio of the individual's

stated reservation wage to the wage that he earned on his last job. The other

variables in our reservation wage equation are of two kinds:      (1) measures of

other income during unemployment that might raise the reservation wage and

(2) demographic variables that might   influence   the reservation wage directly and

that are included in the equation as a precaution.

         The survey provides information on total nonwage income during the

previous month, an amount that includes not only a small amount of interest and

dividends but also the value of unemployment benefits, welfare, disability

payments, food stamps, etc. We subtract from this an estimate of the

unemployment benefits received during that month and divide the differences by

the wage on the last job. We refer to this as the Nonwage Income Fatio and

expect that it will increase the individual's reservation wage ratio.



  1This is seen most easily in a bivariate regression of any dependent variable
on the U.I. replacement rate. The regression coefficient is the ratio of the
covariance between the variables to the variance of the U.I. replacement rate.
Increasing the variance of the replacement rate by a factor of A increases
the covariance bynd therefore reduces the regression coefficient to
1/ A times its true value.
                                     —26-.


          Since data are not available on the amount of supplementary

unemployment benefits, welfare, and other forms of nonwage incoiie, it is not

possible to measure their specific effects on reservation wages. information is

available, however, on whether or not the individual received welfare payments

or supplementary unemployment benefits. We include binary variables for these

two income sources (which take the value of 1 if that type of income is received

and zero otherwise) and regard their coefficients as a weak indication of

whether each type of income affects the reservation wage ratio in a different

way from other forms of nonwage income. In virtually every equation, the coef-

ficients of these variables are negligible, suggesting that the distinction among

these income sources does not matter. We would emphasize, however, that this is

a very weak test of whether different types of income have different effects on

reservation wage ratios.

          The survey also provides information on whether another worker is pre-

sent in the household. The presence of such a worker provides additional income

which makes finding a job less urgent than it would otherwise be. Such income

is, however, very different from unemployment insurance or other employment—

conditioned transfers; an additional worker in the household has an income

effect but does not change the cost of unemployment and therefore has no substi-

tution effect. We would expect the effect of this variable to be positive but
                                     •      1
small and that is generally what we find.

          Closely related to the possibility of additional family income is the

extent of the individual's family responsibility. We add a binary variable that

is equal to one if the individual is a married man. Since 'we are controlling

f or the presence of an additional worker, the coefficient of the married nan

exogenous but a response to the unemployment.

variable represents a negative income effect and should be expected to reduce

the reservation wage if it has any noticeable effect at all.

              Four other demographic variables are included in the equation without

any clear a priori expectation about the likely direction of their effect on the

reservation wage ratio. They are included because of the possibility that they

might have an effect and might be correlated with the unemployment insurance

replacement ratio. These variables are the individual's age in years, the race

of the individual (a binary variable equal to one if the individual is white),

the sex of the individual (a binary variable equal to one for males) and the

number of years of schooling that the individual has had.'


6. Estimated Effects of Unemployment Insurance on the Reservation Wage Ratio

              Table 1 presents estimated coefficients for the specification

discussed in the last section. Separate equations are estimated for individuals

classified as "job losers on layofft', "other job losers," and "job leavers."

Only individuals who received unemployment insurance are included in the sample

because of the difficulties and ambiguities associated with the non—receipt of

benefits. 2


              The coefficient of the unemployment compensation variable is positive

and significantly different from zero in all three equations, implying that a

higher unemployment insurance replacennt rate raises the reservation wage



  1We have also included the level of the individual's previous wage. The coef-
ficient of this variable is generally insignificant and its presence does not
alter the estimated effect of the U.I. replacement rate.

  hen the sample is expanded to include nonrecipients of unemployment
compensation, the coefficient of the unemployment insurance variable
is generally not significantly different from zero. See section 2 for a
discussion of the difficulties of interpreting the absence of benefits. The
exclusion of nonrecipients is the primary reason why the regression sample is
61&2 instead of the 2228 observations in the tables.
     —28.-

 ratio. The coefficient of 0.129 for job losers on layoff implies that

 increasing the unemployment insurance replacement rate from Q•14 to 0.7 raises

the reservation wage ratio by    percentage points for someone in this group.

The effect is substantially larger for job losers who are not on layoff; an

increase in the U.I. replacement rate from o.1 to 0.7 raises their reservation

wage by nore than 12 percentage points. Before discussing the implication of

these figures for the duration of unemployment or the effect of unemployment

insurance on the probability that the reservation wage ratio exceeds 1.0 or 1.1,

we comment briefly on the other coefficients in Table 4.

          A greater amount of nonwage income relative to the individual's last

wage raises the reservation wage ratio for both groups of job losers but not for

job leavers. Since only some of this nonwage income is conditional on continued

unemployment, the effect is substantially smaller than that of the unemployment

insurance benefits.

          The coefficients of the duninr variables for the receipt of welfare and

of supplementary unemployment insurance are generally insignificant, indicating

that these forms of nonwage income did not affect reservation wages differently

than other forms of nonwage income (except unemployment insurance). The excep-

tion is for the group of job losers who are not on layoff. In this group, the

receipt of welfare and supplementary benefits appears to raise reservation wages

more than other forms of nonwage income.

         The presence of a second worker in the household has only an income

effect and therefore is expected to have a weaker impact on the reservation wage

ratio than unemployment insurance. Although the coefficient is positive in two

of the three equations, it is never statistically significant. This and the

evidence on nonwage income both indicate that unemployment insurance is impor—
                                     —30—



tant because it affects the cost of continued unemployment (a substitution

effect) and not just because it increases the individual!s financial resources.

          The duinny variable for married men reinforces this conclusion. The

negative coefficient reflects the adverse "income effect" of additional spending

responsibilities but the small size and lack of statistical significance

reflects the unimportance of income effects relative to substitution effects.

          None of the four demographic variables had a statistically significant

coefficient. Equations were also estimated with more detailed demographic spe-

cification (e.g., a set of binary variables for age) but these specifications

did not add significantly to the explanatory power of the equation or change

the coefficient of the unemployment insurance variable to any appreciable extent.

          In the next section we show that the duration of unemployment is

likely to increase in a very nonlinear way with the reservation wage ratio.

Increasing the reservation wage ratio from 0.8 to 0.9 has a much smaller effect

on the duration of unemployment than increasing the reservation wage ratio from

1.0 to 1.1. Since the median reservation wage ratio is 1.0, the estimated

effect of unemployment insurance presented in Table )4 implies that the changes

in the reservation wage caused by unemployment insurance can have a very

substantial effect on the probability that the reservation wage exceeds 1.0 or

1.1 and therefore on the likely duration of unemployment.

          The specification of the equation in Table 1 assumes a linear rela—

tionship between the unemployment insurance ratio and the reservation wage

ratio. We have also included a quadratic term in the U.I. ratio but found that

its coefficient is not significantly different from zero. The coefficient of

the quadratic term is however generally positive, suggesting that high U.I.
                                           —31—


ratios have a disproportionately large effect on the reservation wage ratio.

             As   a further check on the effect of   unemployment insurance on the

likelihood    of   high reservation wage ratios, we have used the specification of

Table 4 to study directly the probability that an individual's reservation wage

ratio   exceeds 1.0 or 1.1.     The dependent variables in the "greater than 1.0"

regressions is one if      the individual's reservation wage   ratio exceeds 1.0 and

zero   otherwise. Table    5 summarizes   the effect of the unemployment insurance
ratio on these reservation wage probabilities for the three unemployment groups.
Only the coefficient of the U.I. ratio variable is presented although each coef-

ficient   is taken from a full specification like those of Table 14•     The other

coefficients are qualitatively very similar to those of Table 4, indicating weak

income effects and virtually no differences among demographic groups. The mean

of the dependent variable and the R2 value for the equation as a whole are also

presented.

             In each case, the coefficient of the unemployment insurance variable

is large and statistically significant, indicating a substantial effect of

unemployment insurance on the probability that the unemployed individual will

have a high reservation wage. Consider, for example, the group of job losers on

layoff. The average ratio of unemployment insurance benefits to the previous

net wage for this group is 0.66 and 31 percent of the group have reservation

wages above the wage on their last job. Reducing all unemployment insurance

ratios in this group by 0.21 would reduce the 31 percent with high reservation

wages to 23 percent. Completely eliminating the unemployment insurance reduces

the mean probability of a reservation wage greater than 1 by 0.10 (0.66) = 0.264

to o.ob6.


  1This reduction is approximately equivalent to taxing unemployment benefits.

7.    Unemployment Insurance, Reservation Wages and the Duration of Unemployment

            By raising the reservation wage, high unemployment insurance benefits

increase the expected duration of' unemployment. Because the relationship bet-

ween the reservation wage and the expected duration of unemployment is very

nonlinear, the effect of unemployment insurance is particularly important when

it raises the reservation wage above the wage that the individual earned on his

previous job.1

            Although we lack sufficient information to do a complete analysis of

the   effect of unemployment insurance on expected durations of unemployment, it is
useful to examine the implications of    a   simple model that illustrates the non-
linear character   of the effect of unemployment insurance and of reservation 'wage

ratios.

           Assume that each individual who becomes unemployed adopts a reser-

vation wage (R) that reflects his unemployment benefits, his previous wage

(w0) and other factors that influence his expectations about the distribution

of potential wage offers [f(w)]. Assume further       that the   individual then

receives   wage offers (w) that represent    random drawings from this distribution

of   potential wage offers and accepts   the first offer that exceeds his reser-

vation wage. The   model simplifies reality by assuming that the individual does


  'We are aware that several past investigations (e.g., Baron and Mellow, 1981)
have failed to find a significant relationship between reported reservation
wages and subsequent labor market experience. The theoretical relationship is
unambiguous and several explanations may be proposed for the lack of an
observed relationship. For example, other job attributes may induce workers to
settle  for wages below their stated reservation wage. Alternatively, workers
may revise their reservation wages in response to information obtained 'while
unemployed.
                                           —34—

not revise his reservation wage over time1 and that wage offers arrive in random
         2
order.

             In such a nxdel, the probability (P) that the individual accepts each

wage offer is equal to the probability that the offer exceeds his reservation

wage:

Ci)                                P = J   f(w)   dw.
                                      R

If wage offers are received every t days, the expected duration of unemployment

CE) is E =    t/P.   For the normal distribution, or for any distribution in which

the "tails" have less density per unit of w than the center of the distribution,

P will vary with R in a very nonlinear way. The higher the value of R, the

greater the proportional change in P per unit change in R.3 Since the expected

duration of unemployment is inversely proportional to the acceptance probabi-

lity, the sensitivity of the expected duration of unemployment to the value of R

is an increasing function of R.

             This idea can be illustrated by assuming that the distribution of

potential wage offers is normal. The further assumption that the mean of the

potential wage offers for an unemployed individual is the wage on his last job

is a conservative one since the true mean is probably lower (for the reasons

discussed in section 1) and the assumption of a higher mean increases the pro—


      individual who is unsure about the parameters of f(w) will use his wage
offers to revise his subjective estimates of these parameters and will alter his
reservation wage as his estimates of these parameters change.

  2Th1s precludes a search strater in which the individual ranks firms by the
expected prevailing wage and applies for employment in decreasing order of this
potential wage.

   3This property holds for a much wider class of distributions. Even if the
probability P varies linearly with R (as it would for a uniform distribution),
the expected deviation varies inversely with P and is therefore a nonlinear
function of R.

bability    of acceptance for every reservation wage level and thus reduces the

sensitivity of the expected duration to unemployment insurance. Since the stan-

dard deviation of the potential wage offer distribution is not known, we will

present estimates conditional on a variety of plausible values.

             Before looking at these estimates, it is useful to examine oneexample

in detail. Consider an individual who is an unemployed job loser who is not on

layoff, who receives U.I. benefits that replace 70 percent of his previous net

wage, and whose reservation wage        is   1.1 times the wage on his last job. Assume

that the mean of his potential wage offer distribution is the wage on his last

job and the standard deviation of that distribution is 10 percent of the mean.

Thus the individual's probability of receiving a wage offer as high as his

reservation wage is equal to the probability of exceeding the mean of the offer

distribution by one standard deviation and is thus 1 —            F(l.0)   o.i6 when F()

is the cumulative normal distribution rith mean zero and standard deviation 1.

            The reservation wage ratio equation for "other job losers" presented

in Table 1 implies that each additional 10 percentage points of the U.I. replace-

ment ratio raises the reservation wage ratio by 14.2 percentage points. Thus

lowering the individual's U.I. replacement ratio from 0.7 to 0.5 would reduce his

reservation wage ratio from 1.10 to 1.02. The probability of receiving an

acceptable wage would rise to 1 —       F(0.2) =    0.142.   The expected duration would

fall from t/o,i6 to t/0.142 or to 38 percent of its previous value. This figure

is    shown in Table 6   in   the row corresponding   to an   initial reservation wage
ratio of 1.1    (the   second row) and in the column corresponding to the standard
deviation   equal to 10 percent     of the mean and the reduction in the U.I. ratio from
0.7   to 0.5 (column 7).

            More generally, Table 6 shows the effect of reducing the U. I. replace-

ment ratio on the probability of receiving an acceptable wage offer and on the
       —36—

                                           —37—

 expected duration of unemployment. The figures refer to "job losers not on

 layoff" and use the U.I. ratio coefficient of 0.1i6 presented in Table )4         for   this

group. Although similar calculations could be done for workers on layoff and

for job leavers, the principal effect of iLl. on job search relates to job

losers who are not on layoff.

            The first column shows the initial reservation wage ratio. The next

three columns show the acceptance probabilities corresponding to those reser-

vation wage ratios if the standard deviation of wage offers is 5 percent of the

mean value (column 2), 10 percent (column 3) and 15 percent (column ).             The

next group of columns correspond to the effect of reducing the unemployment

insurance ratio from 0.7 to 0.5. The first of these columns shows the new

reservation wage ratio predicted to result from the reduced unemployment

insurance ratio. For each alternative standard deviation, the next 3 columns

then show the new relative duration of unemployment, i.e., the ratio of the

expected   duration with a U.I. replacement ratio of 0.5 to the expected duration
with a U.I. ratio of 0.7. The final four columns then repeat the analysis for a
reduction in the U.I. ratio from 0.7 to 03.
           The    figures in columns 6,   7 and 8 show   that reducing the U.I.   ratio from

0.7 to 0.5 has    a very substantial   effect on the expected duration of

unemployment     for those individuals whose reservation wage would otherwise equal
or exceed their previous wage. Even someone whose reservation wage ratio is
reduced from 1.0 to 0.92 will experience a 37      percent    decrease in expected
unemployment time if    the standard deviation is equal to ten percent of the zran
wage offer.
           Doubling   the decrease in the U.I. ratio (i.e., decreasing it from 0.7 to

0.3 instead of from 0.7 to 0.5) has a less than proportional effect on the

expected duration. For example, with a starting reservation wage ratio of 1.1
                                         —38—

and a standard deviation of 0.15, the probability of an acceptable wage offer is

0.25 and therefore the expected duration of unemployment is .0 times the inter-

val between wage offers. Reducing the U.I. replacement rate from 0.7 to 0.5

lowers the reservation wage ratio to 1.02 and increases the probability of an

acceptable wage offer to 0.L5. This reduces the expected duration of

unemployment to 2.2 times the wage offer interval, or 56 percent of its previous

value. A further reduction in the U.I. ratio to 0.3 lowers the reservation wage

ratio to 0.93 and thus increases the probability of an acceptable wage offer to

0.68. The expected duration of unemployment falls to 1.5 times the wage offer

interval or 37 percent of its initial value. Thus the first 20 percentage point

reduction in the U.I. replacement ratio implied a 4 percent reduction in the

expected duration while the additional 20 percentage point reduction in the U.I.
                                                                              1
ratio reduced expected duration by only 19 percent of its original value.

            In addition to this analysis of the expected duration of unemployment,

it is   particularly interesting to examine the effect of unemployment insurance
on the probability of long durations of unemployment.        Consider an individual

who,   with a U.I. replacement   ratio of 0.7,   has a reservation wage that is 1.1
times   his previous wage. Table 6 shows that if the standard deviation of wage

offers is 10 percent of his previous wage, the probability that each wage offer

is acceptable is 0.1587. Although the expected duration of unemployment is 6.3

times the interval between wage offers, the probability that the individual will



  1The nonlinearity of this relation reflects the linearity of the specification
in Table 1. If the sensitivity of the reservation wage to the unemployment
insurance ratio were a rapidly decreasing function of the U.I. ratio, the reduc-
tions in low U.I. rates could have a nre powerful effect. Estimates of the
nonlinear generalization of the equations in Table b indicate that nonlinear
specifications are not statistically better and that the direction of nonli-
nearity actually reinforces the conclusion in the text by showing that the sen-
sitivity of the reservation wage is greater at higher levels of the U.I. ratio.
                                        —4 1—


 itself 1.0, even small changes in the reservation wage can have a substantial

 impact on unemployment.

            The analysis of section 6 shows that the level of unemployment bene-

 fits relative to previous wages has a powerful effect on the individual's reser-

 vation wage. A 10 percent increase in the U.I. replacement ratio increases the

 reservation wage by about    percent for job losers who are not on layoff and by

 somewhat less for other unemployed groups. Separate regressions to analyze

 the high reservation wage per se show that a 10 percent increase in the U.I.

 replacement ratio also increases by about four percentage points the probability

 that an unemployed individual will require a wage increase of 10 percent or

more.

            The estimates that we have presented imply that reducing unemployment

insurance benefits could significantly lower the average duration of

unemployment   and the relative number of   long—duration spells of unemployment.
Because   of the nonlinear response of the unemployment duration to the reser-
vation wage, reducing a high unemployment insurance ratio by 10 percentage
points is likely to have a greater impact on unemployment than reducing a low
unemployment insurance ratio by 10 percentage    points.

           Taxing unemployment benefits in the same way that earnings are taxed

would   reduce net unemployment insurance by about 30 percent although the reduc-
tion would be much smaller for individuals with low overall annual income.      The
typical U.I. ratio would decline from about 0.7 to 0.5. Since such a reduction
in the U.I. ratio implies a reduction in the reservation wage ratio of more than
10 percentage points, the implied impact on total unemployment and on relatively
long durations of unemployment would be very substantial.
           The May 1976 survey is currently a unique source of data on reser-
vation wages and unemployment insurance. It would obviously be valuable to have
                                           —12—

a replication of that survey       under different   economic conditions. In such a

replication, it would     be   useful to collect sore information on the individuals

who do not receive unemployment insurance and the reasons why they do not. With

the existing data, a possible next step would be an analysis that explicitly

links the observed durations of unemployment to the reservation wage in the

framework of a model with time—varying reservation wages.

            The   optimal level of unemployment benefits for job seekers     depends on

a   balance between protection and distortion: protection against the discomfort
of reduced consumption during unemployment and distortion of the duration of
unemployment. The      research   presented in this paper suggests that a constant
level of unemployment benefits for an individual may        not   be optimal. Instead,
benefits    might be varied over time to offset the effect of excessive reservation

wages. In particular, it is possible to learn something about the individual's

unobserved reservation wage y the anunt of time that he has remained

unemployed. A long—spell of unemployment reflects combinations of a high reser-

vation wage and/or a string of unlucky wage offers. More forniaU,y, the likeli-

hood function of the individual's reservation wage can be inferred from the

observed duration of unemployment if the distribution of wage offers is known.

This suggests that the optimal U.I. benefit might, ceteris paribus, be a

decreasing function of the duration of the unemployment spell. The formal solu-

tion to this problem remains to be investigated.1



  1The optimal relationship between U.I. benefits and the duration of
unemployment should also reflect the fact that longer spells impose a         greater
financial hardship. A "deductible" in the form of a waiting period or a con-
tinuously   varying replacement ratio nay therefore      be optimal.

Al   I
    figures refer to job losers who are not on teeporary layoff. The unemployment Insurance ratio is the ratio of
                                                                                                                  uneeployment insurance benefits
to wages net of margInal tax liability. The relative duration of

corresponding to the initial reservation wage ratio. The "standard devIation" refers to the standard deviation of potential
