                                              ABSTRACT

By studying intrastate branch banking reform in the United States, this paper provides evidence that
financial markets substantively influence the distribution of income. From the 1970s through the 1990s,
most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and improved
efficiency. Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in the timing of bank deregulation, we evaluate
the impact of liberalizing intrastate branching restrictions on the distribution of income. We find that
branch deregulation significantly reduced income inequality by boosting the incomes of lower income
workers. The reduction in income inequality is fully accounted for by a reduction in earnings inequality
among salaried workers.

1. Introduction

       This paper assesses how financial markets affect the distribution of income by studying

intrastate branch banking reform in the United States. From the 1970s through the 1990s, most

states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and

improved bank efficiency and performance (Flannery, 1984; Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998). While

researchers have examined the impact of these reforms on aggregate economic activity (e.g.,

Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996; Black and Strahan, 2002; Huang, 2008; and Kerr and Nanda, 2009),

we provide the first evaluation of how branch deregulation altered the distribution of income. We

test whether removing these restrictions intensified, ameliorated, or had no effect on income

inequality and also study particular channels linking bank deregulation and income distribution.

       Policy and theoretical debates motivate our analysis (Allen and Gale, 2000). Since Thomas

Jefferson first opposed the creation of the Bank of the United States, U.S. policymakers have

expressed concerns that big banks would primarily help the wealthy and widen the distribution of

income (Hammond, 1957). If banking is a natural monopoly, then unregulated, monopolistic banks

may earn rents through high fixed fees that disproportionately curtail the economic opportunities of

the poor (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Banerjee and Newman, 1993; and Galor and Zeira,

1993). Based on this argument, politicians in many U.S. states implemented and maintained

restrictions on bank branching for much of the 20th century (Southworth, 1928; White, 1982).

Furthermore, most countries regulate bank mergers and acquisitions, with the advertised goals of

constraining the expansion of powerful banks and expanding access to credit (Barth et al, 2006).

       Countervailing arguments, however, challenge the view that regulations on bank expansion

help the poor. These regulations could curtail competition and raise fees that disproportionately hurt

the poor. Indeed, Flannery (1984) and Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) show that U.S. branching




                                                  1
restrictions created and protected local banking monopolies, which allowed banks to maintain

higher fees and interest rate margins. From this perspective, intrastate branch deregulation will

operate on the extensive margin, disproportionately expanding economic opportunities for the poor.

       The deregulation of intrastate branching provides a natural setting for identifying and

assessing the impact of bank regulatory reform on the distribution of income. As shown by

Kroszner and Strahan (1999), national technological innovations triggered branch deregulation at

the state level. Specifically, (1) the invention of automatic teller machines (ATMs), in conjunction

with court rulings that ATMs are not bank branches, weakened the geographical bond between

customers and banks; (2) checkable money market mutual funds facilitated banking by mail and

telephone, which weakened local bank monopolies; and, (3) improvements in communications

technology lowered the costs of using distant banks. These innovations reduced the monopoly

power of local banks, weakening their ability and desire to fight against deregulation. Kroszner and

Strahan (1999) further show that cross-state variation in the timing of deregulation reflects the

interactions of these national technological innovations with preexisting state-specific conditions.

For example, deregulation occurred later in states where politically powerful groups viewed large,

multiple-branch banks as potentially serious competitors. Moreover, as we demonstrate below,

neither the level nor rate of change in the distribution of income before deregulation helps predict

when a state removed restrictions on bank branching, suggesting that the timing of branch

deregulation at the state level is exogenous to the state’s distribution of income. Consequently, we

employ a difference-in-differences estimation methodology that exploits the exogenous cross-state,

cross-year variation in the timing of branch deregulation to assess the causal impact of bank

deregulation on the distribution of income.




                                                   2
       The paper’s major finding is that deregulation of branching restrictions substantively

tightened the distribution of income by disproportionately helping lower income workers. While

income inequality widened in the overall U.S. economy during the sample period, branch

deregulation lowered inequality relative to this national trend. This finding is robust to using

different measures of income inequality, controlling for time-varying state characteristics, and

conditioning on both state and year fixed effects. We find no evidence that reverse causality or prior

trends in the distribution of income account for these findings. Furthermore, the economic

magnitude is consequential. Seven years after deregulation, the Gini coefficient of income

inequality is about four percent lower than before deregulation after conditioning on state and year

fixed effects. Put differently, deregulation explains about 60% of the de-trended variation of

inequality relative to state and year averages.

       Removing restrictions on intrastate bank branching reduced inequality by boosting the

incomes of the relatively poor, not by hurting higher income workers. Deregulation increased the

average incomes of those in the bottom quarter of the income distribution by more than five percent,

but deregulation did not significantly affect the incomes of those in the upper half of the distribution

of income. These results are consistent with the view that the removal of intrastate branching

restrictions triggered changes in banking behavior that had disproportionately positive repercussions

on lower income individuals.

       To provide additional evidence that bank deregulation tightened the distribution of income

by affecting bank performance and not through some other mechanism, we show that the impact of

deregulation on the distribution of income varied across states in a theoretically predictable manner.

In particular, if branch deregulation tightened the distribution of income by improving the operation

of banks, then deregulation should have had a more pronounced effect on the distribution of income




                                                   3
in those states where branching restrictions were particularly harmful to bank operations before

deregulation. Based on Kroszner and Strahan (1999), we use four indicators of the degree to which

intrastate branching restrictions hurt bank performance prior to deregulation. For example, in states

with a more geographically diffuse population, branching restrictions were particularly effective at

creating local banking monopolies that hindered bank performance. After deregulating, therefore,

we should observe a bigger effect on bank performance in states with more diffuse populations.

This is what we find. Across the four indicators of the cross-state severity of branching restrictions,

we find that deregulation reduced income inequality more in those states where these branching

restrictions had been particularly harmful to bank operations. These findings increase confidence in

the interpretation that deregulation reduced income inequality by enhancing bank performance.

       We finish by conducting a preliminary exploration of three possible explanations of the

labor market channels underlying these findings. We view this component of the analysis as a

preliminary exploration because each of these explanations warrants independent investigation with

individual-level, longitudinal datasets. Nevertheless, we provide this extension to further motivate

and guide future research on the channels linking bank performance and the distribution of income.

       The first two explanations stress the ability of the poor to access banking services directly.

In Galor and Zeira (1993), for example, credit market imperfections prevent the poor from

borrowing to invest more in education, which hinders their access to higher paying jobs.

Deregulation that eases these credit constraints, therefore, allows lower income individuals to invest

more in education, reducing inequality. A second explanation focuses on the ability of the poor to

become entrepreneurs. In Banerjee and Newman (1993), financial imperfections are particularly

binding on the poor because they lack collateral and because their incomes are relatively low

compared to the fixed costs of obtaining bank loans. Thus, deregulation that improves bank




                                                   4
performance by lowering collateral requirements and borrowing costs will disproportionately

benefit the poor by expanding their access to bank credit.

       A third explanation highlights the response of firms to the lower interest rates triggered by

deregulation, rather than stressing increased access to credit by lower income individuals. While the

drop in the cost of capital encourages firms to substitute capital for labor, the cost reduction also

increases production, boosting the demand for capital and labor. On net, if the drop in the cost of

capital increases the demand for labor and this increase falls disproportionately on lower income

workers, then deregulation could reduce inequality by affecting firms’ demand for labor.

       Although branch deregulation stimulated entrepreneurship and increased education, our

results suggest that deregulation reduced income inequality primarily by boosting the relative

demand for low-income workers. More specifically, deregulation dramatically increased the rate of

new incorporations (Black and Strahan, 2002) and the rates of entry and exit of non-incorporated

firms (Kerr and Nanda, 2009). However, we find that the reduction in total income inequality is

fully accounted for by a reduction in earnings inequality among salaried employees, not by a

movement of lower income workers into higher paying self-employed activities or by a change in

income differentials among the self-employed. Furthermore, the self-employed account for only

about 10% of the working age population, and this percentage did not change significantly after

deregulation. On education, Levine and Rubinstein (2009) find that the fall in interest rates caused

by bank deregulation reduced high school dropout rates in lower income households. Yet, changes

in educational attainment do not account for the reduction in income inequality triggered by branch

deregulation during our sample period. Rather, consistent with the view that bank deregulation

increased the relative demand for low-income workers, we find that deregulation increased the

earnings of low-education workers relative to workers with more education.




                                                    5
       This paper relates to several strands of research and to current policy debates. First, the

international policy community increasingly emphasizes the benefits of providing the poor with

greater access to financial services as a vehicle for fighting poverty and reducing inequality.

Burgess and Pande (2007) find that when India reformed its banking laws to provide the poor with

greater access to financial services, this policy change reduced poverty by boosting wages in rural

areas. Our findings also suggest that financial development might help the poor primarily by

intensifying competition and boosting wage earnings, not by increasing the business income of the

poor. Second, following the onset of the current financial crisis, many stress the potential dangers of

financial deregulation. Though our work does not address the causes of the crisis, the results do

indicate that regulations that impeded competition among banks during the 20th century were

disproportionately harmful to lower income individuals. Thus, reforms to bank regulations could

substantively affect the distribution of income. Finally, our work complements recent cross-country

analyses of finance and the distribution of income. Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2007) find

that an overall index of banking sector development is associated with lower income inequality

across countries. We improve on this work by analyzing the impact of a specific, exogenous policy

change rather than a broad index of financial development and by using a differences-in-differences

methodology rather than simple cross-country comparison that combine to yield sharper inferences

about a policy change and reduce concerns about endogeneity bias.

       This paper also relates to a substantive body of work on the effects of branch deregulation.

Besides the investigations discussed above, researchers have examined the impact of branch

deregulation on output volatility (Demyanyk, Ostergaard, and Sorensen, 2007; Acharya, Imbs and

Sturgess, 2008), the wage rate gap between men and women bank executives (Black and Strahan,

2001), and the income growth of proprietors differentiated by race and gender (Demyanyk, 2007).




                                                   6
In this paper, we examine the impact of branch deregulation on the distribution of income in the

overall economy and help resolve a debate about bank regulation that extends over two centuries.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and

econometric methodology. Section 3 provides the core results, while Section 4 provides further

evidence on how deregulation influences labor market conditions. Section 5 concludes.



2. Data and methodology

       To assess the effect of branch deregulation on income distribution, we gather data on the

timing of deregulation, income distribution, and other banking sector and state-level characteristics.

This section presents the data and describes the econometric methods.

2.1. Branch deregulation

       Historically, most U.S. states had restrictions on branching within and across state borders.

With regards to intrastate branching restrictions, most states allowed bank hold companies to own

separately capitalized and licensed banks throughout a state. Other states were “unit banking states,”

in which each bank was typically permitted to operate only one office.

       Beginning in the early 1970s, states started relaxing these restrictions, allowing bank

holding companies to consolidate subsidiaries into branches and permitting de novo branching

throughout the state. This deregulation led to significant entry into local banking markets (Amel and

Liang, 1992), consolidation of smaller banks into large bank holding companies (Savage, 1993;

Calem, 1994), and conversion of existing bank subsidiaries into branches (McLaughin, 1995). This

relaxation, however, came gradually, with the last states lifting restrictions following the 1994

passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act.




                                                   7
       Consistent with Jayaratne and Strahan (1996), and others, we choose the date of

deregulation as the date on which a state permitted branching via mergers and acquisitions (M&As)

through the holding company structure, which was the first step in the deregulation process,

followed by de novo branching. Appendix Table 1 presents the deregulation dates. Twelve states

deregulated before the start of our sample period in 1976. Arkansas, Iowa and Minnesota were the

last states to deregulate, only after the passage of the Riegle-Neal Act in 1994. We have data for 50

states and the District of Columbia. Consistent with the literature on branch deregulation, we drop

Delaware and South Dakota because the structure of their banking systems were heavily affected by

laws that made them centers for the credit card industry.

       Over this period, states also deregulated restrictions on interstate banking by allowing bank

holding companies to expand across state borders. We confirm this paper’s results using the date of

interstate deregulation instead of the date of intrastate deregulation. However, when we

simultaneously control for inter- and intrastate branch deregulation, we find that only intrastate

deregulation enters significantly. Thus, we focus on intrastate rather than interstate deregulation

throughout the remainder of this paper.

2.2. Income distribution data

       Information on the distribution of income is from the March Supplement of the Current

Population Survey (CPS), which is an annual survey of about 60,000 households across the United

States. The CPS is a repeated, representative sampling of the population, but it does not trace

individuals through time. The CPS provides information on total personal income, wage and salary

income (earnings), proprietor income, income from other sources, and a wide-array of demographic

characteristics in the year prior to the survey. Most importantly for our study, we start with the 1977

survey because the exact state of residence is unavailable prior to this survey. Each individual in the




                                                   8
CPS is assigned a probability sampling weight corresponding to his or her representativeness in the

population. We use sampling weights in all our analyses.

       We measure the distribution of income for each state and year over the period 1976-2006 in

four ways. First, the Gini coefficient of income distribution is derived from the Lorenz curve.

Larger values of the Gini coefficient imply greater income inequality. The Gini coefficient equals

zero if everyone receives the same income, and equals one if a single individual receives all of the

economy’s income. We frequently use the logarithm of the Gini coefficient in the regression

analyses. Our second measure of income distribution is the Theil index, which is also increasing in

the degree of income inequality. If all individuals receive the same income, the Theil index equals

zero, while the Theil index equals Ln(n) if one individual receives all of the economy’s income,

where n equals the number of individuals. An advantage of the Theil index is that it is

computationally easy to decompose it into inequality accounted for by differences in income

between groups in the sample and inequality accounted for by differences among those within each

group of the sample. Third, we examine the difference between the natural logarithm of incomes of

those at the 90th percentile and those at the 10th percentile (Log (90/10)). Finally, we use the

difference between the natural logarithm of incomes of those at the 75th percentile and those at the

25th percentile ((Log (75/25)). Appendix Table 2 provides more detailed information on the

construction of these income distribution indicators.

       Consistent with studies of the U.S. labor market, our main sample (a) includes prime-age

(25-54) civilians that have non-negative personal income, (b) excludes individuals with missing

observations on key variables (education, demographics, etc), (c) excludes the richest 1% of

individuals, (d) excludes people living in group quarters, (e) excludes individuals who receive zero

income and live in households with zero or negative income from all sources of income, and (f)




                                                   9
excludes a few individuals for which the CPS assigns a zero (or missing) sampling weight.

Appendix Table 3 provides details on the construction of the sample.

       There are 1,859,411 individuals in our sample. Table 1A provides summary statistics on the

sample of individuals, while Table 1B gives summary statistics on the income inequality measures.

The average age in the sample is 38 years, 49% are female, and 75% are white, non-Hispanic

individuals. In the sample, 49% have a high school degree or less, while 27% graduated from

college. Only 9% of the individuals report being self-employed (entrepreneurs).

       In Table 1B, we present basic descriptive statistics on the four measures of income

inequality, which are measured at the state-year level. In particular, we have data for the 31 years

between 1976 and 2006 and for 48 states plus the District of Columbia. Thus, there are 1,519 state-

year observations. Besides providing information on the means of the inequality indicators and their

minimum and maximum values, we also present three types of standard deviations of the natural

logarithms of the inequality indexes: cross-state, within-state, and within state-year. These standard

deviations help in assessing the economic magnitude of the impact of bank branch deregulation on

the distribution of the income that we report below.

2.3. Control variables

       To control for time-varying changes in a state’s economy, we use the U.S. Department of

Commerce data to calculate the growth rate of per capita Gross State Product (GSP). We also

control for the unemployment rate, obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and a number of

state-specific, time-varying socio-demographic characteristics, including the percentage of high-

school dropouts, the proportion of blacks, and the proportion of female-headed households.

       We also test whether the impact of deregulation on income inequality varies in a predictable

way with different state characteristics at the time of deregulation. As we discuss below, we control




                                                  10
for the interaction of branch deregulation with a unit banking indicator, the small bank share, the

small firm share and population dispersion, each of which we measure in the year before

deregulation. The unit banking indicator equals one if the state had unit banking restrictions prior to

deregulation and zero otherwise. The following states had unit banking before deregulation:

Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North

Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The small bank share equals

the fraction of banking assets in the state that are held by banks with assets below the median size

bank of each state, while the small firm share equals the proportion of all establishments operating

in a state with fewer than twenty employees. Data on the small firm share and small bank share are

from Kroszner and Strahan (1999). Population dispersion equals one divided by population per

square mile, which is obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.

2.4. Methodology

       We use a difference-in-differences specification to assess the relation between branch

deregulation and income distribution, based on the following regression set-up:

       Ys,t = Αs + Βt + βDs,t + δXs,t + εs,t,      s = 1, …, 49;    t = 1976, …, 2006.                 (1)

In equation (1), Ys,t is a measure of income distribution in state s in year t, Αs and Βt are vectors of

state and year dummy variables that account for state and year fixed-effects, Xs,t is a set of time-

varying, state-level variables and εs,t is the error term. The variable of interest is Ds,t, a dummy

variable that equals one in the years after state s deregulates and equals zero otherwise. The

coefficient, β, therefore indicates the impact of branch deregulation on income distribution. A

positive and significant β suggests that deregulation exerts a positive effect on the degree of income

inequality, while a negative and significant β indicates that deregulation pushed income inequality




                                                   11
lower. In total, we have data for 48 states plus the District of Columbia, over 31 years, so the 1,519

state-year observations serve as the basis for much of our analysis.

       The difference-in differences estimation technique allows us to control for omitted variables.

We include year-specific dummy variables to control for nation-wide shocks and trends that shape

income distribution over time, such as business cycles, national changes in regulations and laws,

long-term trends in income distribution, and changes in female labor force participation. We include

state-specific dummy variables to control for time-invariant, unobserved state characteristics that

shape income distribution across states. We estimate equation (1) allowing for state-level clustering,

i.e. allowing for correlation in the error terms over time within states.



3. Branch deregulation and income distribution

3.1. Preliminary results

       Our empirical analysis rests on the assumption that the cross-state timing of bank branch

deregulation was unaffected by the distribution of income. Figure 1 shows that neither the level of

the Gini coefficient before deregulation nor its rate of change prior to deregulation explains the

timing of branch deregulation. In a regression of the year of deregulation on the average Gini

coefficient before deregulation or the rate of change of the Gini coefficient in the years before

deregulation, the t-statistic on the inequality indicators are 0.20 and -1.16 respectively. Furthermore,

in unreported robustness tests, we find that changes in the state-specific labor protection laws

examined by Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006) do not predict the timing of branch deregulation.

       Additional evidence that income inequality did not affect the timing of branch deregulation

emerges from a hazard model study of deregulation. Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999), Table

2 reports tests of whether the Gini coefficient of income inequality influences the likelihood that a




                                                   12
state deregulates in a specific year given that it has not deregulated yet. While the Kroszner and

Strahan (1999) sample period starts in 1970, we do not have Gini data available before 1976. Also,

since we use the original Kroszner and Strahan (1999) dataset, our sample period ends in 1994,

when there were three states that had not deregulated yet – Arkansas, Iowa and Minnesota.

        Table 2 indicates that the timing of bank branch deregulation does not vary with the degree

of income inequality. Column 1 reports the results of a regression with only the Gini coefficient of

income inequality, while columns 2 – 5 provide regression results controlling for numerous state-

level control variables, including those state characteristics employed by Kroszner and Strahan

(1999). As in Kroszner and Strahan (1999), we find that states with a larger share of small banks

and better capitalized small banks deregulate later, while states with a higher share of small firms

deregulate earlier. As shown, the Gini coefficient does not enter significantly in any of the Table 2

regressions.

3.2. Deregulation and the distribution of income

        In Table 3, we assess the impact of branch deregulation on income inequality using four

indicators of income inequality and two regression specifications. In Panel A, the regressions

simply condition on state and year fixed effects, which are not reported. Panel B also includes

numerous time-varying, state-specific characteristics: the growth rate of per capita gross state

product, the proportion of blacks in the population, the proportion of high-school dropouts in the

population, the proportion of female-headed households in the population, and the unemployment

rate.

        The Table 3 results indicate that bank branch deregulation substantially reduced income

inequality. The branch deregulation dummy enters negatively and significantly at the 5% level in all

eight regressions. For example, consider the Gini coefficient. The column 1 results suggest that




                                                   13
deregulation induced a 2.2% reduction in the Gini coefficient, which is economically large. To

gauge the economic effect of this result, we compare the coefficient estimate to the standard

deviation of the logarithm of the Gini coefficient after accounting for state and year fixed effects.

This standard deviation is 0.037 as shown in Table 1, suggesting that branching deregulation

explains about 60% of the variation of income inequality relative to state and year averages.

       The Table 3 results indicate that deregulation tightened the distribution of income even

when conditioning on time-varying state-level factors. Higher unemployment is associated with

higher income inequality, though the other state characteristics do not enter independently

significantly. This does not imply that these other characteristics, such as per capita economic

growth, an economy’s socio-demographic traits, or educational attainment, are unrelated to income

inequality. Rather, it suggests that after conditioning on state and year fixed effects, unemployment,

and branch deregulation, there is not a significant, independent link between each of these traits and

the various measures of income inequality. Most importantly for the purposes of this paper, the

results on deregulation are robust to conditioning on these factors.

       Additional robustness tests confirm these findings. Controlling for the size of each state’s

aggregate economy, the level of real per capita income in each state, or lagged values of each state’s

Gini coefficient yields similar results. We were also concerned that the migration of labor across

state lines could affect the results. If deregulation induces interstate labor reallocations that tighten

the distribution of income, we want to identify and understand these dynamics. In unreported

regressions, we regress the share of immigrants per state-year on the branch deregulation dummy,

while controlling for year and state-fixed effects. We did not find any significant effects of branch

deregulation on migration flows. We also controlled for migration flows directly in the Table 3

regressions and obtain the same conclusions. Thus, interstate labor migration does not seem to be




                                                    14
driving this paper’s results. Finally, the results hold when examining household income, rather than

individual income.

3.3. Dynamics of deregulation and the distribution of income

        We next examine the dynamics of the relation between deregulation and inequality. We do

this by including a series of dummy variables in the standard regression to trace out the year-by-

year effects of intrastate deregulation one the logarithm of the Gini coefficient:

                Log (Gini)st = α + β1D-10st + β2D-9st + … + β25D+15st + As +Bt + εst,              (2)


where the deregulation dummy variables, the “D’s,” equal zero, except as follows: D-j equals one

for states in the jth year before deregulation, while D+j equals one for states in the jth year after

deregulation. We exclude the year of deregulation, thus estimating the dynamic effect of

deregulation on income distribution relative to the year of deregulation. As and Bt are vectors of

state and year dummy variables, respectively. At the end points, D-10st equals one for all year that

are ten or more years before deregulation, while D+15st equals one for all years that are fifteen or

more years after deregulation. Thus, there is much greater variance for these end points and the

estimates may be measured with less precision. Figure 2 plots the results and the 95% confidence

intervals, centering the estimates around year 0, the year of deregulation.

        Figure 2 illustrates two key points: innovations in the distribution of income did not precede

deregulation and the impact of deregulation on inequality materializes very quickly. As shown, the

coefficients on the deregulation dummy variables are insignificantly different from zero for all years

before deregulation, with no trends in inequality prior to branch deregulation. Next, note that

inequality falls immediately after deregulation, such that D+1 is negative and significant at the 5%

level. Thus, the particular mechanisms and channels connecting bank deregulation with the

distribution of income must be fast acting. The impact of deregulation on inequality grows for about



                                                    15
seven years after deregulation and then the effect levels off, indicating a steady-state drop in the

Gini coefficient of inequality of about 3.5%. In sum, changes in inequality do not precede

deregulation and deregulation has a level effect on inequality, but does not have a trend effect.

3.4. Deregulation and income for different income groups

       Although the results demonstrate that income inequality fell after intrastate branch

deregulation, the analyses do not yet provide information on whether the distribution of income

tightened because the rich got poorer, or because deregulation disproportionately helped the poor.

We now address this issue by examining the impact of branch deregulation on the incomes of

individuals across the full distribution of incomes. More specifically, we compute the logarithm of

income for the ith percentile of the distribution of income in each state s and year t, Y(i)s,t. We do

this for i equal to 5, 10, 15, …, 90, 95. We then run 19 regressions of the form:

                              Y(i)st = α + γDst + As +Bt + εst,                                     (3)

where the regressions are run for each ith percentile of the income distribution. Figure 3 depicts the

estimated coefficient, γ, from each of these 19 regressions and also indicates whether the estimates

are significant at the 5% level.

       Figure 3 shows that intrastate branch deregulation tightened the distribution of income by

disproportionately helping relatively low income individuals. Deregulation boosted the incomes of

those with incomes below the 40th percentile. Deregulation did not have a significant impact on

others. Rather than reducing the incomes of relatively high income individuals, deregulation

reduced income inequality by increasing the incomes of the comparatively poor.




                                                   16
3.5. Mechanism: impact of deregulation as a function of initial conditions

       We next assess whether the impact of deregulation on the distribution of income varies in

predictable ways across states with different initial conditions. If the impact of deregulation on

income inequality varies in a theoretically predictable manner, this provides greater confidence in

the conclusions, sheds empirical light on the mechanisms through which deregulation influences the

distribution of income, and also reduces concerns about reverse causality.

       If bank deregulation reduced income inequality by boosting bank performance, then the

impact of bank deregulation should be stronger in states where branch regulation had a more

harmful effect on bank performance prior to deregulation. Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999),

we consider four initial conditions that reflect the harmful effects of branch regulation before

deregulation. First, unit banking -- where states typically restricted banks to having one office --

was the most extreme form of branching restriction and exerted the biggest effect on bank

performance before deregulation. Thus, we expect that deregulation exerted a particularly large

impact on income inequality in states that had unit banks before they deregulated. Second, states

with a high share of small banks will tend to benefit disproportionately from branching restrictions

that protect small banks from competition. Thus, we expect that deregulation had an especially large

impact on inequality in states with a comparatively high ratio of small banks at the time of

deregulation. Third, small firms tend to face greater barriers to obtaining credit from distant banks

than larger firms, suggesting that local branching restrictions that protect local banking monopolies

were particularly harmful in states dominated by small firms. Thus, we expect that deregulation had

a bigger impact in states with a large proportion of small firms prior to deregulation. Finally, we

examine population dispersion. Local banking monopolies will be particularly well-protected if the

population is diffuse, so that other banks tend to be far away. This suggests that deregulation would




                                                  17
have a bigger effect on inequality in states with high initial population dispersion. These four initial

conditions are not independent. States that had adopted unit banking before deregulation tended to

have a higher share of small banks and firms and more dispersed populations. The correlations

between the four characteristics are far from perfect, however. The highest pair-wise correlation

coefficient is 0.53. Since we do not have strong reasons to favor one indicator over another, we

provide the results on each in our assessment of whether intrastate branch deregulation has a

particularly large effect on the distribution of income in those economies where theory suggests the

impact will be largest.

       The results in Table 4 indicate that the impact of branch deregulation on income inequality

was stronger in states where branching restrictions had been especially harmful to bank activities

before deregulation. As shown in Table 4, branch deregulation reduced income inequality more in

states that had (a) unit banking (column 1), (b) a more dispersed population (column 2), (c) a higher

share of small banks (column 3), and (d) a larger share of small firms (column 4). More specifically,

deregulation exerted a strong, negative effect on inequality in unit banking states, while this effect

was weaker, both economically and statistically, in non-unit banking states. In terms of population

dispersion, the share of small banks, and the share of small firms, the results indicate that branch

deregulation exerted an economically large and statistically significant impact on income inequality

in those states with above the median values of these pre-deregulation characteristics. Branch

deregulation reduced inequality more in states where branching restrictions had been particularly

harmful to the operation of the banking system before liberalization, suggesting that branch

deregulation tightened the distribution of income by enhancing bank performance.




                                                   18
4. Labor market channels

4.1. Theories of how financial markets affect labor markets and the distribution of income

       Having found that branch deregulation decreased income inequality by affecting bank

performance, we now explore three potential channels underlying these findings. The first two

explanations rely on (i) branch deregulation improving the ability of the poor to access banking

services directly and (ii) the poor using this improved access to either purchase more education or

become entrepreneurs. The third explanation focuses on firms’ demand for labor, not on the poor

directly using financial services. These explanations are not mutually exclusive.

       In terms of entrepreneurship, financial imperfections represent particularly severe

impediments to poor individuals opening their own businesses for two key reasons: (1) the poor

have comparatively little collateral and (2) the fixed costs of borrowing are relatively high for the

poor. From this perspective, branch deregulation that improves credit markets will lower the

barriers to entrepreneurship disproportionately for poor individuals (Banerjee and Newman, 1993).

       In terms of human capital accumulation, financial imperfections in conjunction with the high

cost of schooling represent particularly pronounced barriers to the poor purchasing education,

perpetuating income inequality (Galor and Zeira, 1993). In this context, financial reforms that ease

financial market imperfections will reduce income inequality by allowing talented, but poor,

individuals to borrow and purchase education.

       Textbook price theory provides a third channel through which bank deregulation affects

income inequality that does not involve the poor directly increasing their use of financial services.

Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) show that branch deregulation reduced the cost of capital. Reductions

in the cost of capital induce firms to (1) substitute capital for labor and (2) expand output, which

increases demand for capital and labor. On net, if the output effect dominates, the reduction in the




                                                  19
cost of capital will increase the demand for labor. Even under these conditions, however, the impact

of deregulation on inequality is ambiguous because we do not know if the increased demand for

labor falls primarily on higher- or lower-income workers. If deregulation disproportionately

increases the demand for lower-income workers, then branch deregulation could tighten the

distribution of income by affecting firms’ demand for labor, not by directly increasing the use of

financial services by relatively low-income individuals.

4.2. Evidence on banks, inequality, and labor markets

       To provide an initial assessment of the entrepreneurship channel, we decompose the impact

of bank branch deregulation on income inequality into that part accounted for by a reduction in the

income gap between the self-employed and wage earners and that part accounted for by a reduction

in income inequality within the self-employed and within wage earners. We conduct this

decomposition in two-steps. First, using the Theil index, we decompose income inequality into the

“between” component, which measures income inequality between the self-employed and wage

earners, and the “within” component, which is composed of inequality among the self-employed

and inequality among wage earners. This decomposition is done for each state and year. We then

estimate the impact of deregulation on each of these components controlling for state and year fixed

effects. This yields that part of the estimated change in income inequality from deregulation that is

accounted by a reduction in inequality between the self-employed and wage earners and that part

accounted for by a reduction in inequality within the two groups.

       Enhanced entrepreneurship does not directly account for the impact of deregulation on the

distribution of income. As shown in Panel A of Table 5, none of the change in income inequality is

accounted for by a reduction in between group inequality. All of the reduction in income inequality

from deregulation is accounted for by a reduction in income inequality among salaried workers. The




                                                  20
change in between group inequality is actually positive, but insignificant. These results are

unsurprising in light of the following observations: (1) the self-employed account for only 9% of the

sample, (2) the proportion self-employed individuals did not increase following branch

deregulation, and (3) the self-employed do not, on average, have higher incomes than salaried

employees after accounting for educational differences (Hamilton, 2000). These results do not

suggest that the relation between branch deregulation and entrepreneurship is unimportant. Bank

deregulation boosted the rate of entry and exit of firms (Black and Strahan, 2002; Kerr and Nanda,

2009). Nonetheless, the decomposition findings indicate that direct changes in entrepreneurial

income and the movement of lower-income salaried workers into higher-income entrepreneurial

activities do not account for the tightening of the distribution of income following deregulation.

       In Panel B of Table 5, we conduct a similar decomposition but focus on education groups.

We divide the sample into those with some education beyond a high school degree (about 51% of

the sample) and those with educational attainment of a high school degree or less (about 49% of the

sample). Since Panel A showed that all of the reduction in income inequality is accounted for by a

reduction in inequality among wage earners, we focus only on wage earners in conducting the

decomposition by educational attainment.

       The reduction in income inequality triggered by branch deregulation is accounted for by

both a closing of the gap between low- and high-educated workers and by a fall in inequality among

low-educated workers. From Panel B of Table 5, 73% (0.0074/0.0102) overall income inequality is

accounted for by a reduction in inequality within the two education categories, and the bulk of this

reduction arises because of a tightening of the distribution of income among the less-educated

group. Furthermore, 27% (0.0028/0.0102) of the reduction in income inequality explained by bank

deregulation is accounted for by a reduction in the income gap between education groups. The




                                                  21
between group results are consistent with at least two possible explanations: (1) bank deregulation

eased credit constraints and induced lower-income individuals to increase their investment in

education, thereby reducing income inequality and (2) bank deregulation increased the demand for

workers in the lower-education group, reducing between group inequality.

       To help distinguish among possible explanations for these findings, Table 6 presents two

additional analyses. First, we test whether bank deregulation lowers earnings inequality among

workers of different ages. Besides examining workers between the ages of 25 and 54 as above, we

also assess the 30-54 and 53-54 age groups. Since Figure 3 shows that the impact of deregulation on

income inequality is almost immediate and Levine and Rubinstein (2009) find that the main impact

of deregulation on education involves a reduction in high school dropout rates, then if deregulation

is reducing earnings inequality by increasing education we should obverse this primarily among the

relatively young workers, not those who are older than 30 or 35. If we find the relation between

deregulation and earnings inequality across the different age groups, this suggests that increased

educational attainment is not the primary channel during our estimation period.

       Second, we more directly control for education by eliminating the educational attainment

component of wage earnings. Specifically, in the analyses thus far, we have computed measures of

earnings inequality based on the unconditional wage earnings of individuals. We now condition

each individual’s earnings on educational attainment. That is, we compute that part of an

individual’s earnings that are unexplained by years of education. Then, we assess the impact of

branch deregulation on measures of earnings inequality that are computed based on conditional

earnings. If branch deregulation also reduces these conditional earnings inequality measure, this

suggests that deregulation is not reducing earnings inequality only by its affect on educational

attainment. In particular, we first regress log earnings on six dummy variables corresponding to the




                                                  22
number of years of educational attainment (0-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, 16, and more than 15 and year

fixed effects. We then collect the residuals to calculate the conditional earnings inequality measures.

In unreported robustness tests, we also condition on gender and ethnicity, and obtain the same

results.

           As shown in Table 6, education does not account for the impact of bank deregulation on

earnings inequality, suggesting that branch deregulation reduced earnings inequality primarily by

boosting firms’ relative demand for low-income workers. First, across the four earnings inequality

indicators, we obtain very similar results when using different age samples of workers as reported in

Panels A-C. The easing of credit constraints in response to bank deregulation is most likely to affect

the educational choices of individuals in school, or just out of school. It seems unlikely that branch

deregulation will cause a sufficiently large and rapid increase in the educational attainment of

workers above the age of 35, such that the resulting increase in earnings would tighten economy-

wide measures of earnings inequality in the year after deregulation. Second, bank deregulation

reduces conditional earnings inequality, where the conditioning is done based on educational

attainment. As shown in Panel D, the estimated impact of deregulation on earnings inequality holds

for unconditional and conditional earnings. These findings imply that deregulation is not reducing

earnings inequality only through its affect on educational attainment. Rather, though needing

additional research, the findings are more consistent with the view that bank branch deregulation

reduced earnings inequality by boosting the relative demand for low-income workers.




                                                   23
5. Conclusions

       Policymakers and economists disagree sharply about the impact of bank regulations on the

distribution of income. While some argue that the unregulated expansion of large banks will

increase banking fees and reduce the economic opportunities of the poor, others hold that

regulations restrict competition, protect monopolistic banks, and widen the distribution of income.

More generally, an influential political economy literature stresses that income distributional

considerations, rather than efficiency considerations, frequently exert the dominant influence on

bank regulations as discussed in Claessens and Perotti (2007) and Haber and Perotti (2008).

       We find that liberalizing restrictions on intrastate branching across the states of the U.S.

tightened the distribution of income. This finding is robust to an array of sensitivity analyses. We

find no evidence that reverse causality drives the results. Moreover, the impact of deregulation on

income distribution varies in a theoretically predictable manner across states with distinct economic,

financial, and demographic characteristics at the time of deregulation. Critically, deregulation

tightened the distribution of income by disproportionately helping the poor, not by hurting the rich.

These findings support the view that branch regulation in the United States restricted competition,

protected local banking monopolies, and impeded the economic opportunities of the relatively poor.

NOTE – The table provides descriptive statistics for the following measures of income inequality: [1] Gini coefficient, [2] Theil index,
[3] log ratio of the 90th and 10th percentiles of the income distribution, and [4] log ration of the 75th and 25th percentiles of the income
distribution. Each measure of inequality is based on total personal income of respondents to March Current Population Surveys
described in Table 1A. We use sampling weights in all calculations of inequality measures. Inequality measures are discussed in
more details in Appendix Table 2. The number of observations in the table corresponds to 49 states (we exclude Delaware and
South Dakota) times 31 years between 1976 and 2006. For each measure of inequality we report the mean, the minimum and the
maximum values, as well as the standard deviation of log of each measure (except log(90/10) and log(75/25) which are already in
logs). We report three types of standard deviations: cross-state, within-state, and within state-year. These standard deviations are
useful in calculating the economic magnitude of the impact of bank deregulation on income inequality.

NOTE - The model is a Weibul hazard model where the dependent variable is the log expected time to bank branch
deregulation. All the right-hand side variables are included in levels. Sample period is 1976 to 1994 and the sample
comprises 37 states that deregulated after 1977. States drop from the sample once they deregulate. Data on per capita Gross
State Product are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Proportion blacks, high-school dropouts, and female-headed
households are calculated from the March Supplements to the Current Population Surveys. Data on unemployment rate are
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. All other control variables are taken from Kroszner and Strahan (1999).
Standard errors are adjusted for state-level clustering and appear in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance levels at
10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

NOTE – The table presents estimates of the impact of bank deregulation on income inequality as a
function of initial state characteristics. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the Gini
coefficient. All models control for state and year fixed effects. Since we control for state fixed effects
the initial state characteristics are dropped from the regressions. Unit banking states are: CO, AR, FL,
IL, IA, KS, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OK, TX, WI, WV, and WY. Data on population dispersion are from
the Census Bureau. Data on the share of small banks and small firms is obtained from Kroszner and
Strahan (1999). These data exclude 10 states that deregulated in 1960 and therefore have 310 fewer
state-year observations. Standard errors are adjusted for state-level clustering and appear in
parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

NOTE - The table reports the impact of intrastate deregulation on the Theil index of income
inequality. The number of observations in each decomposition is 1,519, corresponding to 49 states
(we exclude Delaware and South Dakota) times 31 years between 1976 and 2006. All
decompositions control for state and year fixed. In panel A we divide the sample into two mutually
exclusive groups: (a) those who are self-employed, and (b) those who work for wages. In panel B
we divide the sample of wage workers into two mutually exclusive groups: (a) those with twelve or
less years of completed education, and (b) those with thirteen or more years of completed
education. In the first column in both panels we estimate the overall impact of intrastate
deregulation on the Theil index of inequality using all groups. In the next column we estimate the
impact of deregulation on inequality between the different groups, whereas in the third column we
estimate the impact of deregulation on inequality within the different groups combined. The second
and the third columns add up to the first column. In the next columns we estimate the impact of
deregulation on income inequality separately within each of the groups. Standard errors are
adjusted for state level clustering and appear in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance
levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

NOTE – The table shows the impact of bank deregulation on the natural logarithm of
different measures of earnings inequality. Standard errors are adjusted for state level
clustering and appear in parentheses. All specifications control for state and year
fixed effects and do not include other control variables. In panels A-C, the inequality
measures are based on real annual earnings as reported by CPS respondents. Panels
A-C differ only in the ages of the respondents. In panel D, in contrast, we first regress
log real annual earnings on six educational categories corresponding to years of
completed education (0-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, 16, and 16+) and then calculate measures of
inequality based on the residuals.

NOTE – March Current Population Surveys (CPS) are available at <http://cps.ipums.org/cps/>. We start with the 1977 survey
because exact state of residence is not available prior to 1977. We follow the literature and exclude Delaware and South Dakota
because of large concentration of credit card banks in these states. From 1977 to 1982, group quarters included housing units
containing five or more people unrelated to the person in charge. As of 1983, group quarters were defined in the CPS as non-
institutional living arrangements for groups not living in conventional housing units or groups living in housing units
containing ten or more unrelated people or nine or more people unrelated to the person in charge. Because we use sampling
weights to construct measures of income inequality, we exclude persons with missing or zero sampling weights.

                                 NOTE – The figure plots the impact of intrastate bank deregulation on the natural logarithm
                                 of the Gini coefficient of income inequality. We consider a 25 year window, spanning from
                                 10 years before deregulation until 15 years after deregulation. The dashed lines represent
                                 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for state-level clustering. Specifically, we report estimated
                                 coefficients from the following regression:

                                 The D’s equal zero, except as follows: D-j equals one for states in the jth year before
                                 deregulation, while D+j equals one for states in the jth year after deregulation. We exclude the
                                 year of deregulation, thus estimating the dynamic effect of deregulation on the different
                                 percentiles of income distribution relative to the year of deregulation. As and Bt are vectors
                                 of state and year dummy variables that account for state and year fixed effects, respectively.

                                  NOTE – Each bar in the figure represents the estimated impact of bank deregulation on a natural
                                  logarithm of a specific percentile of income distribution. Dark bars represent estimates significant
                                  at 5% after adjusting the standard errors for clustering. Light bars represent statistically
                                  insignificant estimates. Specifically, we report the estimates of γ from 19 separate regressions of
                                  the following form:
                                                                       Y(i)st = α + γDst + As +Bt + εst
                                  where Y(i)st is the natural logarithm of ith percentile of income distribution in state s and year t.
                                  Dst is a dummy variable which equals to zero prior to bank deregulation and equals to one
                                  afterwards. As and Bt are vectors of state and year dummy variables that account for state and
                                  year fixed effects, respectively. Each of the 19 regressions has 1,519 observations corresponding to
                                  49 states (we exclude Delaware and South Dakota) times 31 years between 1976 and 2006.
