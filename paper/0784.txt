                                   ABSTRACT


          Investment abroad has come to play a major role in the total invest-
                                                                little attentLon
ment undertaken by U.S. firms. Despite this development, veryinvestment.
has been paid to the impacts of domestic tax policy on foreign
          One reason has been the presumption that, since  changes in domestiu
tax rules ordinarily also apply to foreign—source income, policy changes should
affect foreign and domestic investment similarly. However, the fact that the
tax on foreign—source income is deferred until the income is repatriated repre-
sents a crucial difference in the treatment of foreign and domestic income. So
long as the U.S. tax is deferred, the effective U.S. tax rate on foreign—source
income can be shown to be irrelevant to a firm' s optimal foreign reinvestment
decision. Foreign investment is now largely accomplished by firms reinvesting
earnings abroad, so the reinvestment decision is of primary importance. Thu ,
                                                                                a
decrease in the effective U.S. tax rate which applies  to both domestic and
foreign investment income can be thought of as a cut in the tax on domestic
investment income, which is encouraging to domestic investment (perhaps at the
expense of foreign investment), combined with a cut in the tax on foreign
investment income, which has no effect on the optimal foreign reinvestment deci-
sion. Consequently, the impacts on foreign and domestic investment of an
apparently neutral policy could be very different.

          Another reason that the response of foreign investment has been
neglected in domestic policy discussions is the lack of evidence on the magnt—
tude of that response. This paper utilizes the theory just described to confirm
that foreign investment is influenced negatively and quite strongly by the
after—tax rate of return to domestic investment. A further test, in which a
                                                      tax" term are included

                                                   in absolute value, confirming
separately, produces coefficients virtually equal
that the net domestic rate of return is the appropriate variable. The results
indicate that a tax incentive which has been found to raise net domestic invest-
ment by a dollar reduces net foreign investment by at least twenty cents. This
conclusion is further reinforced by results from a forward—looking (Tobin's q)
model.

           While these results do not point to the primary outcome of a domestic
 policy change being a domestic—foreign reallocation of the capital stock, they
 indicate that a significant reallocation does take place. With open econony tax
 analysis still in its infancy, the question of how this evidence alters the
 usual conclusions is largely an open one.

            The rate of investment in the United States has recently become the

focus of unprecedented concern. Feldstein (1981), for example, demonstrates

that net fixed nonresidential investment as a fraction of GNP dropped by nearly

forty percent between the late l960's and the late 1910's. He has also argued

that much of the investment decline can be attributed to tax laws and, in

particular, to the interaction of tax laws with the high rates of inflation

experienced in the l910s.l Recent initiatives to alter the tax treatment of

capital income have been based, at least in part, on a desire to increase th

rate of capital formation.

            At the same time that increasing the rate of domestic investment bs

become an objective of tax policy, foreign investment by U.S.—based firms ha3

come to play a major role in the total business investment undertaken. Inded,

foreign   investment as a fraction of GNP grew at nearly the same rate as dome3tic
investment fell over the most recent decade.
             In the theoretical public finance literature, serious attention is for
the first time being devoted to the possible inadequacies of the closed—ecOfl)rnY

models of taxation on which our predictions of tax effects are based. For

example, Goulder, Shoven, and 1Jhalley (forthcoming) have recently demonstrated

that savings and investment incentives can produce outcomes that differ grealy
                                                  investment with respect to ra;es
depending on the elasticities of international

of return at home and abroad. Unfortunately, there is virtually no evidence on

 which to base an assumption about these crucial parameters.

              In fact, even the size of U.S. foreign investment relative to dom€tic

 investment has often been poorly understood. It is argued here that, becaus

 figures on foreign investment should be compared to net domestic investment,

 investment abroad by U.S. firms has reached levels approximately as high as ialf

 of the domestic counterpart in recent years. With foreign investment of thi;

 magnitude, it is at least plausible that the closed econonr models of taxatin

 would lead to inaccurate conclusions,
                                         regarding the impacts of investment an

 savings policies on total investment.

           This paper examines the importance of the response in U.S. foreign

 direct investment to changes in domestic tax policy..2   First, a brief review of
the recent pattern of direct investment and of the literature on its deter-

minants will be presented. In Section II, a simple theory of foreign investient

is developed. Evidence from the past fifteen years is then used to both

strongly confirm the implications of the theory and to indicate the existenc of

highly significant domestic policy effects on foreign investment.    In the

conclusion, the importance of these results for domestic policy analysis is

considered.



 I. Foreign Investment and Existing Evidence on Its Determinants

          As noted in the introduction, investment abroad has come to occupy a

major position in the total investment undertaken by U.S. firms. As Figure J

illustrates, increases in foreign investment coupled with domestic investmen.,

declines have resulted in foreign investment between about one—third and one--

half as large as net domestic fixed investment.   Indeed, foreign direct inve3t—

ment as a fraction of GNP increased between the late 1960's and the late 191)'s

 by over 115 percent, while the comparable domestic measure fell by nearly 40

 percent. It should be noted that foreign direct investment is a figure most

 accurately compared to net domestic investment, since one component of foreign

 investment, earnings reinvested abroad, is net of depreciation allowances.3

           The fact that foreign direct investment is by nature a net figure

 helps explain why the situation depicted in Figure 1 diverges so significantly

 from the popular perception of the relative size of foreign to domestic

 investment. Goldsbrough (1919), for example, illustrates the relative impor-

 tance of direct investment by reporting that it is less than five percent as

 large as gross domestic fixed capital formation.

          These figures demonstrating the importance of foreign investment might

also seem surprising in light of the important and widely—cited conclusion of

Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that domestic savings and domestic investment are

very closely linked; that is, most of the world appears to be best characterized

as consisting of economies nearly closed to net international investment flows.

One explanation is that the previous result was based on a study of a cross—

section of countries, so the U.S., as only one observation, does not necessarily

exhibit such a savings—investment relationship. More importantly, net business

fixed investment represents only a small fraction of total gross national

investment. So, while investment abroad is a large part of the net investment

undertaken by U.S. firms, it may not appear significant as a fraction of total

national savings or investment.

          The existence of sizable foreign investment flows does not, of course,

hold any implication for the role of rates of return (and, hence, tax rates)

in determining investment flows. In fact, efforts to relate the level of
                                       _)4


foreign   investment to rates of return at home and abroad have met with a

striking lack of success.5 Hufbauer (1915) was led to the conclusion that there

is no "observable connection between HNC expansion, cost of capital at home, and

average earnings on investment abroad. The behavior of MNCs might have ratier

little to do with the classical theory of foreign investment." As a result,

studies of direct investment have often resorted to explaining U.S. investment

abroad based on investment levels in the U.S. (Herring and Willett (1912) arid

Kohihagen (1911)), on GNP in the host countries (Scaperlanda and Mauer (l97)),

or on total investment levels in the host countries (Snoy (1975)).

            Notable exceptions to the ad hoc nature of much of the work on fo'eign

investment are the Jorgenson—type neoclassical investment models, which hav

been estimated for foreign investment by, for example, Stevens (1972), Kwack

(1912), and Goldsbrough (1919). While these models provide good explanations of

foreign investment, it can be argued that the encouraging results are mainly

attributable to the numerator of the "optimal capital stock" term (output or
foreign subsidiaries), rather than the denominator (the cost of capital) which
is   of primary interest for policy analysis. In fact, none of these models

incorporates tax effects in the cost of capital measure, but it would be

straightforward to replace the cost of capital term by the tax—adjusted cost of

capital, as Kopits (1972) has done in his study of dividend remittances. One

could also test the separate significance of the tax—adjusted cost of capitii

term and   the   output term.

            There are more serious questions about the applicability of the

neoclassical investment model, however. One important aspect of the model i

that there is no connection between the domestic and foreign investment deci—
                                          —5—



 sions of the firm. That is, the foreign subsidiary is implicitly viewed as a

perfect competitor, even with the domestic parent firm. With foreign production

and domestic production often representing alternative means of serving the same

markets, this characterization leaves a good deal to be desired.

          Looked at in a slightly different way, the neoclassical closed—economy

investment model is used to determine the combination of factors optimally used

to produce a given output. The foreign investment decision, by contrast to the

closed—economy investment decision, primarily concerns the location of

production. Thking the location of production (the level of foreign subsidiary

output) as given in a model of foreign investment neglects the most interesting

aspect of the problem.

          As we shall see in Section III, the recent evidence suggests that a

simple economic model which meets these objections can be used to successfully

explain annual movements in direct investment and to test for the effects of

taxes. A crucial element in that success is the careful theoretical specifica-

tion of the influence of tax policy. The next section is devoted to a

discussion of the determinants of foreign investment and, in particular, the

influence of taxes.


II. xes and Foreign Investment

          Our   analysis   of foreign investment begins with the familiar proposi-

tion of classical foreign investment theory that firms tend to invest more

abroad as the rate of return available abroad rises and as that available at

home declines. This simple specification is best thought of as the product of a

disequilibrium model of investment, in which a firm's decision to invest at home

or abroad is a function of the differential return available abroad.6 It

 wages which are reflected in current measured rates of return.

           A further reason for foreign investment to compete with domestic

 investments can be introduced by appealing to either externally— or internally—
                                     the firm. The existence of external financial

 is   frequently asserted that any measure of available returns neglects such

 important determinants of expected return as to be empirically useless. Such

 factors as the desire of innovative, oligopolistjc firms
                                                                    to exploit their par-
 ticular advantages in production or distribution, and the presence of impediments

 to international trade, no doubt play a major role in explaining the existence of

 multinational firms, as does the quest for stability through vertical

 integration.8 However, unless we include in our study a period in which firms

 are discovering and exploiting major new opportunities abroad, the factors which

 explain the existence of multinational firms may not so strongly cause year—to—

year variations in foreign investment. Bather, as is shown in the next section,

measured rates of return can account for a great deal of the fluctuation in

investment over recent years.

            The complexity of the tax treatment of foreign source income makes

necessary   a careful specification of the net—of--tax rate of return to which
foreign investment would be   expected   to respond. The         governments   of   host
countries   have the first opportunity to tax the returns produced in their

jurisdictions. The rate of return net of the foreign corporate income tax can

be written as:


                               rfj =     r*(l    —   t*)                                   (i)


where r* is the gross rate of return earned abroad9 and t is the effective

rate of host country taxation.    Foreign countries often collect another tax (a

"withholding tax") at a time dividends are paid to         the   parent company. The

return, after total foreign taxes, on a one—period investment with income

repatriated to the parent firm can, therefore, be written as:
                                                      —8—




                            raft        =         r*(l - t*)(l         -
                                                                           t)             (2)



            The U.S., in turn collects on foreign source income a tax at the regu-

lar corporate rate, but allows a credit for taxes paid to the foreign governnent

(up to the level of the U.S. tax liability). The U.S. tax is ordinarily

collected only upon repatriation of profits to the U.S. parent. Thus, the

parent   firm can receive a net—of—tax rate of return from an investment abroad
of:

                           =       r*(l       —
                                                  t),       if t t +        t   —
                                                                                    t*t   (3)
                           =   r*(l       —    t*)(i        —   t),   otherwise


where t is the effective U.S. tax rate on foreign—source income, prior to the

credit.1°

            Obviously the effective tax rate on foreign source income is affected,

in all except the "excess credits" case, by the firm's decision of whether to

repatriate earnings. The question of how to characterize this feature of the

tax system in a tractable model of the foreign investment decision has plagued

researchers. Horst (1911) takes the approach of weighting the tax liabilities

by the fraction of foreign—source income typically paid out, to derive an after—

tax return:


                rp = r*El      —   (i   —     p)t*      —   pt],      if t t + 4— t*4      (14)



                         = r*[l     —   t         —
                                                      ptw(l     —   t*)1,   otherwise



where p is the foreign subsidiary payout ratio.
                                       —9—



          The specification is deceptively simple, however. First, the dividend

payout ratio is chosen by the firm and, in general, will depend on the tax

rates, so the temptation to interpret an average of tax rates weighted by an

observable payout ratio as the appropriate influence over marginal investment

decisions should be avoided.11    Also, expression (Ii) is appropriate only if a

firm which is making a marginal investment will continue to pay out the current

fraction p of its earnings over the live of the investment. Finally,              is

derived by assuming that direct investment abroad is accomplished by an explicit

transfer of funds from the parent to the subsidiary, rather than the implicit

transfer implied by a retention of earnings by a foreign subsidiary.

          In fact, Hartman (1981) argues that U.S. foreign direct investment now

typically is accomplished by foreign subsidiaries retaining earnings.

Furthermore, the nature of the U.S. tax system provides a strong incentive for

foreign subsidiaries to be self—financing to the greatest extent possible. That

is, the present value of tax liabilities is reduced, without any corresponding

change in financial characteristics of the firm, if a foreign subsidiary retains

it.s earnings, rather than paying dividends to its parent while receiving from

the parent additional explicit direct investment (whether in the form of debt or

equity). The reason for this strong result is that U.S. taxes are due only upon

the repatriation of earnings. Thus, it is not surprising that dividend payments

are discouraged, unless a net financial transfer from the subsidiary to the

parent is desired. This proposition is not completely general in the complex

universe of interacting tax systems, as is clear from an example considered by

Alworth (1981).   If a host country provides so high a level of dividend relief

to foreign—owned subsidiaries that the firm's total current tax burden declines
                                          —10—


with higher repatriation rates, a firm will tend to accelerate rather than defer

its dividend payments to its parent. As a general proposition, however, the

logic underlying expression ()4) —— that a U.S. firm undertaking a transfer of

funds abroad is receiving dividends at rate p which is expected to continue

over the life of the investment ——      is   open to question.

          The importance of this insight rests in its implications for the

financing of a marginal investment. Based on this theory, the marginal direct

investment comes at the expense to the parent firm of a repatriated dollar, up

to the point of subsidiary profits being exhausted. For total investments

larger than available earnings, the marginal investment is financed by an expli—

cit transfer from the parent.


A. Retained Ernings
          Consider, first, the subsidiary deciding whether to reinvest for one

period or to repatriate a dollar of after—foreign—income tax earnings.
                              (i—t)
Repatriation gives the parent (it*) dollars to invest at, say, a net domestic

rate of return r, or, at the end of the period,                      (i +   re).   Reinvestment

produces 1 +   r*(l   —   t*)   of foreign earnings or, upon repatriation to the parent

at the end of the period,               (i +   r*(i   —   t*)).12   That is, a firm can pay

the U.S. tax, thereafter earning a rate of return r or can defer the U.S. tax

but later pay the same rate on the original dollar plus the rate of return that

dollar earns in the interim. Thus, the present value of tax payments to the

U.S. on a dollar of foreign—source income, when discounted at                r*(l_t*), are

equal in the two cases. Therefore, the relevant net foreign rate of return Lo

be compared to the opportunity cost (re) of investing abroad is the after—

foreign—income—tax rate of return. As discussed in more detail by Hartinan
                                         —11--



 (1981), this argument is not crucially dependent on the one—period nature of

this example, as long as repatriation of earnings from abroad is expected to

occur eventually.13

          This result highlights the crucial role of deferral, in cases of the

U.S. tax rate on foreign—source income exceeding the foreign tax rate. If

deferral were not available, a higher U.S. tax would obviously represent a

disincentive to reinvestment abroad. The conventional analysis of the tax

system, including deferral, which relies on some weighted average formula simi-

lar to equation (1), still incorporates a disincentive effect of higher U.S.

taxes on foreign—source income.1 As we have seen, once both the current and

future tax liabilities relevant to the repatriation decision have been taken

into account, the U.S. tax on foreign source income is neutral with respect to

the reinvestment decision. Of course, the U.S. tax is entirely irrelevant when

the foreign tax rate exceeds the U.S. tax rate on foreign—source income. Thus,

within our general model foreign investment accomplished by retaining foreign

earnings abroad can be described by:


                                 =   T*
                                      re(..n'    *(i — t*))                 (c)

          This general neutrality of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source

income has important implications for the country's mix of domestic and foreign

investment, since the U.S. tax law treats domestic and foreign investment income

similarly, except for the deferral of foreign—source income and depreciation

provisions to be discussed below. That is, while an increase in the general rate

of corporate income taxation decreases the alternative rate of return rn, it has

no effect on r*(1 —   t*)   and, hence, it tends to encourage foreign reinvestment
                                          —12—


of earnings. The extent of this encouragement is the topic of Section III.


B. Transfers of Funds

         The tax effects on the foreign investment accomplished by a transfer

of funds from parent to subsidiary are less straightforward, depending on anti-

cipated paths of investment in the future. Th.ke, first, the case of a U.S. tax

higher than the corresponding—foreign tax. We know from the discussion above

that after an investment project begins to generate earnings, the rate of reLurn
                                                              domestic rn, is the after—
on reinvestment, appropriate for comparison with the

foreign—income tax rate of return. Thus, we can view an investment abroad as

earning a present value of r(1 —        t)   in the first period, but also gaining a

firm access to the higher return r(1 —           t*)   on earnings reinvested, because of

the deferral of the U.S. tax. The future reinvestment opportunities will, as a

consequence, affect current decisions. Suppose, for example, that r* is

expected to be so low in the future that only a one—period investment is con—

templated. Then, the relevant effective tax rate on foreign—source income is t,

since there is no deferral advantage. On the other hand, if repatriation of

earnings will be deferred indefinitely, the value of reinvesting at the higher

return may come to dominate the decision, in which case the firm's decision takes

on the character of the reinvestment decision discussed above. So, the relevant

tax rate on foreign source income is between t             and t, with the exact vaue

depending on the set of future investment opportunities.'5 Of course, if the

foreign tax exceeds the U.S. tax, some combination of the foreign corporate
                                                                       parameter. Thus for
income tax and the foreign withholding tax is the important

a new investment, we can write the general expression:

                             *                            *
                  It*   =   It(rn,   r*, r*t, r*t*, r*tw(l —    t*))                (6)
                                       —13—



where the I- function is specific to the particular firm being considered.

It could well be highly unstable in aggregate form.


III. Domestic Taxes and Reinvestment Abroad

          Fortunately, since reinvestment of foreign source income accounts for

nearly ninety percent of U.S. direct investment abroad, the theory of this

source of direct investment, given by equation (5),     is   by far the more straight-

forward. In order to facilitate comparison with Feldstein's results on tax

impacts on domestic investment as a fraction of GNP, a simple linear rela-

tionship is chosen for estimation:


                      1*
                            =   a +     + 2r*(1   —   t*)                       (T)




where Y is U.S. GNP.16 In measuring real net rates of return, it is important

to correct for the tax laws' mismeasureinent of profits and to take account of

all the taxes paid. t.ta on rn are taken from Feldstein (forthcoming), where

considerable attention has been paid to the accurate measurement of depreciation

and to the taxes paid by corporations, shareholders, and creditors in the U.S.

By contrast, only the taxes paid currently by the foreign subsidiary to the

foreign government are relevant in the construction of r*(l —       t*),   so, aside

from the mismeasurement of profits under a nrriad of foreign tax systems, the

foreign variable is directly observable.17

          The use of reported after—tax earnings is problematic, but information

on depreciation and inventory accounting is not available, so no adjustment can

be made. Measurement errors in r*(l —    t*)   will be systematically related to
                       1*
measurement errors in — ,       so we can anticipate the estimate 2 being
                                            —1 14...




biased. A bias will, in general, occur in our estimate                    as well, but, as

we will see, these problems do not appear to be serious.

             When (7) is estimated using annual date for the 15 years 1965—1919, we

obtain: 18


               're   =    .003136 -  .o6i r + .1412 r*(1_t*) - .00186 D714                  (8)
                         (.0001489) (.oo198 (.oo1414)         (.0001489)

                                                                            = 937
                                                                       D.W. = 2.15
                (standard errors in parentheses)                       SER    .000)405



These results imply that the simple model of foreign direct investment deve-

loped in the previous section provides for successful explanation. Of par-

ticular interest, here, is the highly significant negative estimated impact of

the domestic real net rate of return. Even more significant is the rate of

return to U.S. investment abroad, although, as mentioned above, it is

constructed in such a way as to introduce spurious correlation with Ie

             Equation (8) has very important implications for the impact of

domestic tax policy on foreign investment. Before exploring these implications,

further tests are performed to confirm the result. First, since r can be

thought of as r(l —                where         is the effective tax rate on domestic

income, the variable can be split into a "gross rate of return" term r and a

"tax" term rt5 .         This   produces the result:



         =     .003681 — .0674 r + .0684               + .01411 r*(l_t*) — .00188 D74 (9)
              (.oor58) (.0138) (.0420)                  (.oo4i6)         (.000637)

                                                                            = .931
                                                                       D.W. = 2.15
                                                                       SER = .0004214
                                                   —15—



As expected due to the corriation of r with rtus                        ,   it   is difficult to esti—

mate precisely the separate tax effect. However, the similarity of the                                r and
rt5 coefficients certainly supports the hypothesis.that r(l —                          t5)         is the

appropriate variable. 19

               As noted above, these results cannot be taken too seriously without

addressing the issue of bias caused by the measurement error in the real after—

foreign—tax rate of return r*(1 —                t*),    and its correlation with the measurement

error in foreign investment. Since it is the domestic variables on which we

will place major emphasis, it is reassuring that the correlation of rn and

r*(l —   t*)     is only —.03.

               To confirm that the potential bias is small, equation (8) was reesti—

mated using instrumental variables. The real after—foreign—tax rate of return

r*(i —   t*)     was instrumented using variables expected to be related to worldwide

real capital returns but not the measurement error in r*(l —                         t*).
Specifically, current and lagged employment, industrial production, and the real

GNP of the seven most significant host countries were weighted by their share of

U.S. foreign investment.20 While these variables explained only 81.1 percent of

the variation in r*(1 —          t*)   ,   in   the first stage regression, the following

results emerged:

         = .003696  - .0681 r + .0701 rt5 + .003 r*(l_t*) — .ooi8y D7        (ii)
           (.001760) (.0139)   (.o123)     (.0052)         (.ooo6')

                                                                 = .931
                                                            D.W. = 2.12
                                                            SER = .000125


These instrumental variables estimates are virtually identical to the ordinary

least squares results reported as equations (8) and (9), implying that we can

have a great deal of confidence in the estimated domestic tax impacts. Thken

together, the empirical results have the important implication that a tax change

which makes domestic investment more attractive will significantly reduce

foreign investment. Furthermore, they are supportive of the theory developed in

Section II, with respect to the impact of a change in the tax rate applied to

all corporate income.

          While the tax rate on domestic income, t5 ,   differs   from the U.S. tax

rate on foreign source income, t (for example, foreign subsidiaries are not

allowed to use accelerated depreciation and do not receive the investment tax

credit), annual fluctuations in the two series, which result largely from the

inflation—induced mismeasurement of taxable profits, are undoubtedly highly

correlated. The fact that the r and rt5 coefficients are virtually iden—

tical in absolute value would, thus, seem to be very strong evidence that t does

not affect foreign investment. M noted above, a specification including a

separate tus variable serves to reinforce our conclusion. The weight of the

evidence., therefore, strongly supports the basic proposition that even an

apparently non—discriminatory tax change is far from neutral in its effects on

the domestic—foreign investment decision.

          These results can be placed in perspective by reference to the
                                       —11—



Feldstein   conclusions. His estimated coefficient of rn's impact on domestic

investment as a fraction of GNP for the 195I_1918 period is •)459•21 When his

equation was re—run for the 1965—1979 period, incorporating the major revisions

to   the net domestic investment figures performed in early 1981, the coefficient
was reduced to   .312, with a standard error of .072. Thus, a change in tax

policy affecting domestic investment has an opposing effect on foreign invest-

ment (by retained earnings) approximately twenty percent as large. How the ana-

lysis of domestic policy changes might be affected by this factor will be con-

sidered later, but first we turn to the estimation of tax effects on "immature"

foreign operations, i.e., those not generating sufficient earnings to finance

their investments.


IV. Domestic xes and "New" Direct Investment

            Compared to reinvested earnings, the explanation of capital transfers

to foreign affiliates presents serious difficulties of both a conceptual and an

empirical nature. One obvious problem is the complexity and ambiguity of the

possible tax effects discussed above. The unavailability of tax data also

requires unattractive compromises. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the

return on the existing stock of U.S. capital abroad has much relevance to firms

which are primarily involved in the beginning phases of new investments. ken

together, these factors are not encouraging to empirical work, so it is not

surprising that the results are not as significant as those in the case of

reinvestment.

            The most obvious problems encountered in estimating the tax effects

included in equation (6) is the lack of reliable data on the effective foreign

corporate tax rate t , the foreign withholding rate t, and the effective
                                         —18—



U.S. tax rate on foreign—source income t. While one could construct average

effective tax rates from tax return information, only the rates on repatriated

earnings are reported and there is little reason to believe such information is

representative. Consequently, instead of estimating the appropriate equation

(6), we are forced to use an equation like (11):




               4 =       +       +   2r*(1   —   t*)    +
                                                            tusr*(1   —   t*)                   (ii)




The estimates produced by this equation could be meaningful if two conditions

are met. First, if, as argued above, t , the effective U.S. tax rate on

domestic income, is highly correlated through time with the effective U.S. tax

rate on foreign source income, t ,      it   can be used as a proxy for unobservable t

as shown. Also, if variations through time in r*(1 —              t*)      primarily result from

variations in r* ,    equation   (ii) may provide an unbiased estimate of the effect

of domestic taxes, though, of course, no information about the effect of t*

            Unfortunately, all of these problems appear to cause the noise in the

regression to overwhelm the signal, as shown by the result (12).

While   the equation implies the expected positive response to the foreign rate of

return and negative response to the tax parameter, the estimated coefficients

are so insignificant as to be nearly meaningless. The instrumental variables

estimation procedure (equation (13)) produces the anticipated sign for the

    coefficient as well, the coefficients are again so imprecisely estimated as

not to be usefull for analysis.

                                                               DW = 1.85

Thus, we must conclude that based on the available information, one can say very

little about the domestic tax effects on the foreign investment of firms with

relatively new operations abroad.


V. Further Confirmation of the Results

          One could legitimately argue that a model describing foreign invest-

ment as a function of current alternative rates of return neglects important

components of the anticipated return to investments made today. Similar con-

cerns Lth respect to domestic investment have led to increased use of models

based on Tobin's "q" theory of investment. By relating investment to the ratio

("q") of the stock market valuation of existing assets to the replacement costs

of those assets, this theory incorporates anticipated future rate—of—return

changes which are reflected in current market values.

          This "forward—looking't approach to investment has a great deal to

recommend it. Unfortunately, no direct application to foreign investment is

possible, since the market does not provide a separate valuation of domestic and

foreign assets owned by a U.S. multinational firm. Rather, we have available a
                                       —20—


variety of estimates of qt? which are largely, but not, of course, totally,

representative of domestic capital and no estimate of the corresponding "q."

It is worth noting that domestic investment models of the "q" type are subject to

the criticism that the desirability of domestic and foreign investment are con-

founded in the tq measure.

          In order to confirm our results from Section III that the increasel

attractiveness of domestic investment tends to reduce foreign investraent, we
                                                     're
ignore the problem and estimate a model in which           is a function of only "q"

and a variable removing 19714 from consideration, as above. Using the "q"

measure reported in Summers (1981) produces equation (114).

                                                                         =   .52314

While this model does not produce the precise explanation of foreign investment

we obtained with the rate of returns equations, the "q" coefficient is highly

significant and of the expected negative sign, and the              is similar to the

values given in similar domestic investment equations. Summers also presents

data which allow us to construct a tax—adjusted value q', which takes into

account the effects of accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit on

investment incentives. Reestimation using q' produces:

                                                                            =    .51JJ

That   is, the tax—adjusted "q'T provides a slightly worse          explanation.     More
worrisome    is the fact that the residual for 1913 is so large as to account for

over seventy percent of the total residual variance. It is obvious from the

data that our exclusion of any information on the attractiveness of investment

abroad has   prevented   these equations from explaining the large investment

increase in 1973, which r*(1 —        t*)   was able to explain in the Section III

regressions. Since an outlier like 1973 can so drastically affect the results,

equations (ib) and (15) were re—run excluding 1973 information by use of a

second dunmr variable.

This time, the tax—adjusted variable performs slightly better. Otherwise, the
                                            -22—


coefficients of the "q" variables are virtually identical to the previous set.

Clearly, the significant results were not an artifact of the one outlier.

             Using   this very different model of investment has tended to confiri:i
our previous conclusions: that the attractiveness of domestic investment has a
significant negative impact on the level of foreign investment. The results
regarding domestic tax effects are not nearly so strong as in the previous
model,    but Summers found the results on domestic investment to be mixed as well.

Summer' s parameter estimates were unstable, but our coefficients are between

about ten percent and fifty percent as large in absolute value as his estimated

effects on domestic investment (and, of course, the opposite sign). In

conclusion, the "q" model      of   investment, despite its obvious shortcoming of

allowing no measurement of a "q" for investment abroad, has added evidence in

favor    of our previous results.

IV. Implications      and Conclusions

            The evidence presented in this paper points to U.S. multinational

firms being strongly influenced in their decisions to reinvest earnings abroad

by the after—tax rate of return abroad compared to that available in the U.S.

With   reinvestment of earnings now being the predominant form of U.S. foreign
direct    investment and with foreign direct investment representing a sizable part

of the   total investment of U. S.    firms, the   impact on the relative return to
foreign   investment should, it would seem, be an important factor in evaluating

proposed tax changes.

            In particular, the theoretical model argues that changes in the tax

treatment of corporate earnings, even when these changes apply to both domestLc

and foreign source income, can have effects on the incentive to invest abroad
                                        —23—


versus at home. This surprising result follows because the tax on foreign

source income is deferred until income is repatriated. Thus the tax is best

thought of as a tax on dividends and, as such, can be shown to have no effect on

the foreign subsidiary's optimal reinvestment decision. Changes in the tax

treatment of domestic income, on the other hand, do change the relative attrac-

tiveness of investing at horse, and so, can affect foreign investment if there is

substitutability. Since most provisions of the U.S. tax law apply to income

wherever earned, tax policy changes often appear to affect foreign and domestic

investment incentives similarly, but, according to this theory, can be far from

neutral.

             The empirical evidence supports the conclusions of the model and indi-

cates that domestic tax policy has powerful effects on decisions to invest

abroad at the expense, in the aggregate, of investment at home. We estimate

that an effective tax rate change which would increase domestic investment by

one dollar would, at the same time, cut U.S. investment abroad by at least

twenty cents (taking into account only the estimated impact on the reinvestment

decision).

             How this conclusion might influence the support for investment incen-

tives clearly depends on the reasons that increased capital formation is

favored. For instance, if concern over labor productivity or the "overall

strength of the economy" make increasing the level of domestic productive assets

one's goal, the considerations raised here would be of little importance. Of

course, one who did not accept the evidence that total investment responds to

tax policy might still favor the shift toward domestic investment implied by our

estimated tax effects.
                                        —2 —


           On   the other hand, many view increased capital formation as a way to

promote "international competitiveness," and might argue that operating abroad

tends to promote exports, so that any decline in foreign investment would be

counterproductive. This position is, of course, controversial, as some evidence

points to foreign investment substituting for exports.

           Those who support investment incentives on economic welfare grounds

might find their case altered by the recognieion of international investment

effects. Since the welfare argument centers on the discouragement to investment

produced by the tax wedge between private and social returns, the finding that

the total investment effect is exaggerated by at least one—fourth by looking at

only   domestic investment might be thought to weaken the argument. However, such
a conclusion    neglects the issue of sectoral misallocation of capital. As has

been noted by p. 4usgrave (1969), the foreign tax credit produces an unfavorable

allocation of capital, from the standpoint of "national welfare," because the

nation receives only the after—foreign—tax return to capital invested abroad

while receiving the gross return to capital invested at home. The multinational

firm, responding to after—tax rates of return, is encouraged to invest abroad

even when the national return at home exceeds that abroad. That argument is

much strengthened by our conclusion that the firm's reinvestment decision is

based on a comparison of the after—foreign—tax    foreign return with the after—tax
domestic   return. Any policy, such as a tax cut, which results in domestic

investment at the expense of foreign investment, by helping correct this

misallocation of capital, produces a welfare gain in addition to the gain from

any increase in total investment. Furthermore, one might be     concerned about
worldwide economic welfare. As we have shown, the effective tax rate on     foreign
                                     —25—


source income, as viewed from the perspective of a reinvesting subsidiary, is

given by the host country tax alone. Thus, if the home country effective tax

rate is brought closer to the host tax rate, worldwide economic efficiency gains

should follow, as capital is reallocated toward its most productive use.

          The results reported here, while confirming the importance of domestic

tax effects on international invesbrnent, are only a beginning. For example, the

investment in the U.S. by foreign firms has been completely ignored. While that

investment is also growing rapidly in importance, the specification of tax

incentives provided by each foreign country's treatment of foreign source income

and the availability of data present more difficult problems than those

confronted in this paper.

    1-See Feldstein (forthcoming). This work has generated much controversy.

See, for example, Fair (1981).


    2Foreign direct investment, as distinguished from portfolio investment,

takes place in a foreign operation over which the U.S. parent firm has control.


    3For several reasons, foreign direct investment figures cannot be thought of

as the precise equivalent of the domestic investment numbers. One difference is

that the net domestic investment figures cited by Feldstein are obtained by

subtracting from gross investment a depreciation figure adjusted for such fac-

tors as inflation to approximate as closely as possible economic depreciation.

Given the different currencies in which some foreign subsidiaries' books are

kept as well as the variety of depreciation practices prevailing in different

areas, the Commerce Department makes no attempt to similarly adjust the book

depreciation figures used in computing foreign investment.

          In addition, foreign direct investment is most accurately thought of

as a financial transaction: an implicit or explicit supply of parent firm

funds to a foreign affiliate. To the extent that additional funds are borrowed

abroad or supplied by foreign "minority" owners, our figures understate the
                                               —27—


investment undertaken abroad under the control of U.S. firms. On the other

hand, foreign direct investment does not necessarily mean purchase of real

assets and, so, may overstate the foreign equivalent of domestic net fixed

investment. However, the tendency of foreign financing to be short—term

(Robbins and Stobaugh (1973, Ch. 4)) and the incentive to minimize exchange risk

by financing current assets, but not fixed assets, through foreign short—term

borrowing (Robbins and Stobaugh (1972)), both imply that foreign direct invest-

ment may be an adequate indicator of net fixed investment abroad.

             The estimates of Kopits (1980) provide dramatic confirmation of this

theory.     The elasticity of the stock of foreign direct investment with respect
to   total subsidiary assets is almost identically one (1.014), while the corresponding

derivative (.351) is very close to the typical share of plant and equipment
•                   •
in total subsidiary assets .4o. Kopits estimated
                                                          •         t direct investment
                                                                   total subsidiary assets
of .351 (estimated with a 1966 cross section of countries) is virtually iden—

tical to the value, .36,               Lx fixedinvestment in subsidiaries
                              of
                                            L total subsidiary assets       implied by the
time series (1958—65) estimates of Robbins and Stobaugh (1972). Thus, even

though    data limitations force us to        follow the usual practice of using foreign

direct    investment    figures   as   if they represented net fixed investment (See

Goldsbrough (1919)), there is ample evidence to support this procedure.


          careful reading of Goldsbrough reveals a precise treatment of the "net

versus gross" problem in the remainder of             the paper.

          survey   of the relevant empirical iork can be found in Hufbauer (1975).

Frisch (1981) provides some evidence that rates of return influence the distri-

bution of investment across foreign countries, but whether relative rates of
                                     —28—



return influence the total amount of foreign investment is an open question.

    6The existence of differential risk patterns across countries, providing
opportunities for diversification which individuals may not be able to pursue

except through the operations of multinational firms, casts doubt on the

stronger proposition that the firm's desired capital stock in each region would

be at the level required to equalize marginal returns. Recognition of the risk

factor suggests its inclusion in the model of the foreign investment decision.

However, risk serves to complicate the analysis, without holding potential for

measurement in the present context, and so, it is ignored here. As will be

clear from Section III, this amounts to assuming that the riskiness of antici-

pated returns on foreign investment as a whole is unrelated to the mean return

over time.


    TThe author owes this observation to Stewart Myers.


    8For discussions of these aspects of foreign investment, see Caves (1911)

and Vernon (1971, Ch. 3 and 1).


    9For simplicity, we will consider the two—country case here.


    -0It should be noted that, while the statutory tax rate on domestic incore

equals that on foreign—source income, some provisions of the law, such as

allowable depreciation, do differ. Therefore t should not necessarily be thought

of as the effective tax rate applied to domestic income, although the two rates

might be highly correlated over time.


    11Horst explicitly examines the dependence of p on tax parameters in his
                                       —29—


1977 paper, but is forced to utilize an observed value to weight tax rates in

his calculations.


         firm with an excess of foreign tax credits faces alternatives of

(i —   4)(l + r)    versus (i —   t)(i + r*(1 —
    13The one exception to this fairly general proposition is the case of a sub-

sidiary which, according to the rates—of—return test just described, would

repartriate earnings but which also anticipates more profitable opportunities in

the "near future." Just as it is not optimal for a subsidiary to repatriate

earnings and receive capital transfers simultaneously, an optimal strater would

not involve repatriating earnings and receiving capital transfers very soon

thereafter. Thus, a firm might be willing to reinvest abroad over the short run

even when the investment does not produce an acceptable one—period after—foreign

income—tax rate of return when compared to the opportunity cost. That is, the

conclusion is even more at odds with the conventional wisdom, which sets higher

standards for reinvestment, than is our basic result. Since this lock—in effect

is the product of a very special pattern of expected future returns and of the

time period over which r* is measured, it is not very interesting conceptually

and is ignored in the remaining analysis.


    114A notable exception is the work of Kopits (1972, 1980), who focuses on the

repatriation decision, arguing that higher deferrable U.S. taxes on foreign

source income increase the "cost of repatriation" and, hence, encourage rein-

vestment.

issues). It is adjusted for anticipated inflation by subtracting the new—issue

similar with other estimates of expected inflation.

measured as the financial transaction, rather than the resulting real capital

investment, the use of lagged values seems less appropriate here. Nevertheless,

when equation (8) was   run   with lagged returns, the r coefficient was   a   very

similar   .0608 and still statistically significant.
