Can Market Participants Report their Preferences Accurately (Enough)?

                                          ABSTRACT

In mechanism design theory it is common to assume that agents can perfectly report their
preferences, even in complex settings where this assumption strains reality. We experimentally
test whether real market participants can report their real preferences for course schedules
“accurately enough” for a novel course allocation mechanism, approximate competitive
equilibrium from equal incomes (A-CEEI), to realize its theoretical benefits. To use market
participants’ real preferences (i.e., rather than artificial “induced preferences” as is typical in
market design experiments), we developed a new experimental method. Our method, the “elicited
preferences” approach, generates preference data from subjects through a series of binary
choices. These binary choices revealed that subjects preferred their schedules constructed under
A-CEEI to their schedules constructed under the incumbent mechanism, a bidding points auction,
and that A-CEEI reduced envy, suggesting subjects were able to report their preferences
accurately enough to realize the efficiency and fairness benefits of A-CEEI. However, preference
reporting mistakes did meaningfully harm mechanism performance. One identifiable pattern of
mistakes was that subjects had relatively more difficulty reporting cardinal as opposed to ordinal
preference information. The experiment helped to persuade the Wharton School to adopt the new
mechanism and helped guide aspects of its practical implementation, especially around
preference reporting.

1        Introduction
One of the exciting features of market design research is that it can help bring mechanisms
designed using abstract microeconomic theory into practice to solve real-world resource
allocation problems. This feature has encouraged an explosion of research in matching
and auction theory and has led to several well-known market design “success stories”, in
which a mechanism has made it all the way from theory to practice. These include auctions
for wireless spectrum around the world and matching mechanisms for entry-level medical
labor markets, public schools and organ transplantation.1 To bring these market design
mechanisms to practice often requires innovative academic research to help test the theory
and evaluate its suitability for practice. In this spirit, this paper reports on a novel kind of
laboratory experiment — based on bringing real market participants’ real preferences into
the laboratory, as opposed to inducing subject preferences as is typical in the market design
experimental literature — that tested a new market design and helped shepherd it from
theory to practice.2
        The context is the problem of combinatorial assignment — matching bundles of indi-
visible objects to agents without the use of monetary transfers, e.g., matching students to
schedules of classes — well known to be a difficult problem in market design. The theory
literature on this problem contains mostly impossibility theorems that prove there is no
perfect mechanism,3 while the mechanisms used in practice have been shown to have criti-
cal flaws.4 In an attempt to make progress on this problem, Budish (2011) proposed a new
mechanism for combinatorial assignment, called approximate competitive equilibrium from
equal incomes (A-CEEI). A-CEEI, unlike prior mechanisms, satisfies attractive properties
of efficiency, fairness and incentives, though as the name implies only does so approximately.
        At around the same time Budish (2011) was published, an opportunity to potentially
implement a new mechanism arose at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Wharton’s mechanism, a “fake-money” bidding points auction used widely at many educa-
tional institutions,5 was having the kinds of efficiency, fairness and incentives problems one

would expect given the theoretical criticisms of the mechanism (Sönmez and Ünver 2010)
and the Wharton administration convened a committee to consider alternatives.
   While attractive in theory, however, A-CEEI makes an assumption that raises a serious
concern about its suitability for use in practice: market participants can perfectly report
their preferences to the mechanism. In Budish (2011), agents have ordinal preferences
over all feasible bundles. As is standard in mechanism design theory (Fudenberg and Tirole
1991, Myerson 1991, Bergemann and Morris 2005), agents are assumed to be able to directly
report these preferences to the mechanism. But this assumption often strains reality, and
A-CEEI is such a case. In a context such as Wharton’s, there might be hundreds of millions
of feasible schedules in a given semester.
   Clearly, in such combinatorial allocation settings, perfect preference reporting is an
unrealistic goal, and whether market participants can report perfectly is an uninteresting
question. Instead, the relevant question to answer before seriously considering bringing the
theory to practice is whether market participants can report their preferences “accurately
enough” to realize the benefits of the mechanism. Let us make this question more precise. In
any practical implementation of the A-CEEI mechanism, participants cannot be expected
to manually rank all schedules. Instead, participants must report a limited set of preference
data — via what is known as a preference reporting language (Milgrom 2009, 2011) —
that can be used to construct an ordinal ranking over schedules. The question is whether
participants can report such preference data with sufficient accuracy (i.e., whether the
ordinal ranking generated by the preference data they report is close enough to their true
preferences) that the efficiency and fairness benefits of A-CEEI are realized.
   This positive question about A-CEEI’s suitability in turn raises a deeper methodological
question that pertains to market design more broadly. How can a researcher generate data
that yields an assessment of preference reporting if agents’ true preferences are fundamen-
tally unknown? In the case of A-CEEI, how can we compare the ordinal ranking generated
from the data agents report to the mechanism to agents’ true preferences? How can we mea-
sure the extent to which inaccurate preference reporting harms mechanism performance?
   One potential approach would be to use the induced preferences methodology that is
regularly employed in market design experiments. In an induced preferences experiment,
the researcher gives subjects artificial preferences and offers monetary rewards based on how
well the subjects perform in the mechanism as evaluated based on these artificial preferences.
For example, if in a multi-object matching experiment a subject is given an induced value
for the bundle {A,B} of $25, and then obtains the bundle {A,B} in the laboratory matching
market, the subject would be compensated with a payment of $25. While this technique
fake-money Vickrey auction in an initial allocation round and then uses double auctions in subsequent
rounds.

has been extremely important in the history of market design experiments and is invaluable
for answering certain kinds of questions,6 we found it to be limiting in our setting.
       To see why, consider what we could learn about preference reporting to A-CEEI from
experiments in which we used the induced preferences approach. If we induced preferences in
a format that could be immediately reported to the mechanism (e.g., in the same language
as the preference reporting language used by A-CEEI in the laboratory), we would just
be telling subjects their preferences and asking them to report them right back to us.
This trivializes our central question about reporting complex preferences, and instead tests
whether subjects believe the advice in the experimental instructions that it is in their best
interest to report their preferences truthfully (which is an interesting question in its own
right; see Hassidim, Romm and Shorrer 2016, Li 2017, Rees-Jones 2018, Rees-Jones and
Skowronek 2018).
       If we induced preferences in a format different from what could be reported back to
the mechanism, this too misses the central question of interest. This exercise would be
testing whether subjects can translate a small amount of information from one language
the researcher created (for conveying preferences to the subject) and another language the
researcher created (for reporting preferences back to the mechanism). For example, we could
induce a subject with the preference ranking over bundles {1,2} > {1,3} > {2,3} > {1,4} >
{2,4} > {3,4}, and ask them to report item values for objects that express these preferences.
Or, we could give subjects more general preference goals — e.g., a course in marketing is
worth 100 points, a course in accounting is worth 80 points, you only want one course per
major, early morning classes are worth 50 points less than afternoon classes, etc. — and
ask subjects to use the preference reporting language to express these induced preferences.
Such experiments would certainly yield insight as to whether subjects have a basic grasp
of a preference-reporting language. But they intrinsically cannot test whether real market
participants can translate their own real preferences — however these preferences, over a
combinatorially large set of outcomes, are represented in their own minds — into an A-CEEI
preference report.
       To be able to use real market participants’ real preferences, we developed a new experi-
mental design methodology, which we call the “elicited preferences” approach. The elicited
preferences approach collects data on subjects’ real preferences by directly asking subjects
binary comparison questions. In our setting, these questions were of the form: Do you
prefer Schedule A or Schedule B? When a subject says they prefer Schedule A to Sched-
ule B, we treat this as their true preference (i.e., just as we assume a subject who is paid
more to obtain Schedule A than Schedule B in an induced preferences experiment prefers
   6
   In Roth’s (2015a) recent survey of the literature on market design experiments, every laboratory exper-
iment discussed, but for the present paper, uses the induced preferences methodology.



                                                    3
Schedule A over Schedule B).7 Put differently, our elicited preferences approach replaces
the (reasonable) assumption of the induced preferences approach — that subjects prefer to
earn more money from the experiment — with the (we argue also reasonable) assumption
that subjects are able to report which of two schedules they prefer when asked directly.8
       With the elicited preference approach, we are able to bring real market participants’
real preferences into the laboratory market. Specifically, our experimental subjects were
Wharton MBA students who were asked to report their real preferences over schedules of
real Wharton courses to A-CEEI using a realistic, professionally designed user interface.
As described in detail in Section 2.5, we carefully tailored the binary comparisons we asked
subjects to generate the necessary preference data to test preference reporting accuracy
and to test whether subjects could report preferences accurately enough to realize the
efficiency and fairness benefits of A-CEEI relative to the incumbent bidding points auction.
In addition, comparing the performance of the mechanism with regard to efficiency and
fairness measures based on binary comparisons to efficiency and fairness measures based on
what subjects report to A-CEEI, we can quantify the harm caused by preference reporting
mistakes.
       There were two other advantages to using real market participants’ real preferences.
First, the realism enhanced the demonstration value of the experiment. Demonstration to
policy makers who ultimately decide whether to implement a market design is a common
goal of market design experiments (Roth 2015a); using real market participants’ real prefer-
ences yields a more realistic, and thus more persuasive, demonstration. Second, the realism
facilitated a search for “side effects” of the mechanism; that is, issues left out of the theory
that might be important for practice.9 Issues left out of the theory are especially of concern
here because A-CEEI had never been used before; many other market design implementa-
tions have had direct precedents that assuage these concerns.10 Because our experimental
   7
      Our use of the term “elicted preferences” is inspired by a computer science literature on the problem of
eliciting preference information in complex allocation environments (e.g., combinatorial auctions) by using a
relatively small number of carefully-chosen preference queries. See Sandholm and Boutilier (2006) and Chen
and Pu (2004) for surveys of this literature and see Boutilier (2002) and Parkes (2005) for early contributions.
    8
      Outside of market design, it is common to design laboratory experiments around participants’ real pref-
erences; famous examples include Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990) and Roth et al. (1991). Note that
in these latter settings, theory testing is possible without inducing preferences: in dictator and ultimatum
games, subjects’ preferences are assumed to be known a priori (favoring more money to less), and in endow-
ment effect experiments the quantity of trade is sufficient to establish the effect without knowing subjects’
precise values for the objects. In market design experiments, in contrast, theory testing often requires the
researcher to have precise knowledge of subjects’ heterogeneous preferences, which the induced preferences
methodology directly produces.
    9
      Our use of the term “side effects” is meant to analogize the FDA drug approval process. The first step
in that process is not to test the efficacy of the drug (that is the last step), but rather to ensure that the
drug is not harmful to humans for some unforeseen reason.
   10
      In many other practical market design implementations, there were close precedents that could be used
to convince practitioners that the theory worked as intended in practice; these precedents lessen the concern
about unintended consequences of the theory. For example, the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm



                                                       4
subjects were real market participants who were playing in a realistic environment, we
could search directly for side effects using surveys. The surveys, both quantitative and
free-response, covered topics such as perceived fairness, satisfaction with received schedule,
ease of use, transparency and overall “liking” of the mechanism.
    An important disadvantage of our elicited preferences approach is that subjects’ behav-
ior is not incentivized.11 This lack of incentives likely caused subjects to exert less effort
in the laboratory than they would have if playing for real stakes, which in turn adds noise
to subjects’ behavior. We took care in the design to ensure that such noise pushes against
finding accurate preference reporting and against our finding benefits of the A-CEEI mech-
anism so that our results on the efficiency and fairness gains of A-CEEI would constitute a
lower bound (see Section 2.6 for a discussion).12
    We briefly summarize the main results. Students reported their preferences accurately
enough that A-CEEI outperformed the benchmark, the incumbent Wharton bidding points
auction, on each of our quantitative measures of efficiency and fairness, with most (though
not all) differences statistically significant. The magnitudes were modest but all broadly
consistent with the theory. However, we also found that subjects had significant difficulty
with preference reporting (although large mistakes were comparatively rare) and that this
difficulty meaningfully harmed mechanism performance. The efficiency and fairness im-
provement of A-CEEI over the bidding points auction would have been substantially larger
if not for preference reporting mistakes. The only negative side effect we found in the surveys
was that students found A-CEEI to be somewhat of a “black box”, i.e., non-transparent.
    The experiment persuaded Wharton to adopt A-CEEI — implemented as “Course
Match” beginning in Fall 2013 — and guided several aspects of its practical implemen-
tation.13 Some limited data from the first year of implementation underscores the external
validity of our findings: A-CEEI increased equity in both total expenditure and the dis-
was independently discovered and implemented by the medical profession in the 1940s, about 15 years before
the publication of Gale and Shapley (1962). Roth and Peranson (1999) report on the successful modification
of the Gale-Shapley algorithm to accommodate married couples. When the Gale-Shapley algorithm was
implemented for school choice, the economists involved in the implementation could point to the algorithm’s
decades of success in the medical labor market. Doctors discovered the idea of pairwise kidney exchange in
the late 1990s; the economists who became involved helped to optimize what had been an ad hoc process to
increase the number of potential matches.
   11
      A similar lack of incentives arises in market design studies that utilize other types of surveys to ask about
preferences and/or beliefs, such as Budish and Cantillon (2012), Kapor, Neilson and Zimmerman (2020) and
Rees-Jones (2018). See Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) for a general discussion of the benefits and costs
of survey data.
   12
      Also note that the lack of incentives is not intrinsically a feature of the elicited preferences approach we
propose. If we could have offered with some probability that students would obtain in real life the schedule
they obtained in the lab version of the mechanism, or a schedule they chose in a binary comparison, then
all behavior would have been incentivized. However, we were unable to get the Wharton administration to
provide such stakes in the laboratory experiment, for the obvious reasons.
   13
      After Wharton elected to adopt the new mechanism in spring 2012 the work of practical implementation
began in earnest. The engineering component of this work is reported in Budish et al. (2017).



                                                        5
tribution of popular courses and survey data suggest that A-CEEI has increased students’
satisfaction with their assigned schedules, their perceptions of fairness and their overall
satisfaction with the course allocation system. For example, the percentage of students
responding that they found the course allocation mechanism “effective” or “very effective”
increased from 24% in the last year of the bidding points auction to 53% in the first year
of A-CEEI, and the percentage of students who agreed or strongly agreed that the course
allocation mechanism “allows for a fair allocation of classes” increased from 28% to 65%.


Contributions and Related Literature. Our paper makes four contributions to the
market design literature. First, and most directly, the paper provides evidence on the
efficacy of a specific mechanism for course allocation, Budish’s (2011) A-CEEI mechanism.
Other work that discusses novel course-allocation mechanisms includes Sönmez and Ünver
(2010), Budish and Cantillon (2012), Budish et al. (2013), Nguyen, Peivandi and Vohra
(2016), Hashimoto (2018), Akbarpour and Nikzad (2020), and Nguyen and Vohra (2020).
      Second, the paper contributes to an ongoing dialogue in the literature about the impor-
tance of preference reporting and language design (Milgrom 2009, 2011). We add to the
burgeoning empirical literature on preference reporting errors and the harm they can cause
to a mechanism’s performance (see, e.g., Hassidim, Romm and Shorrer 2016, Rees-Jones
2018, Rees-Jones and Skowronek 2018). At the same time, we show that participants can
report complex preferences accurately enough to realize the benefits of a mechanism with
complex reporting requirements.
      Third, the paper introduces a new experimental design methodology, the “elicited pref-
erences” approach, which allows researchers to evaluate market designs in the laboratory
using real market participants’ real preferences by designing appropriate binary compar-
isons. This methodology can be used to evaluate other market designs with non-trivial
preference reporting requirements. This methodology may also be useful for evaluating de-
cision supports for market designs, i.e., tools that are designed to help participants more
accurately report their preferences. Such decision supports play an important role not only
in market designs with complex preference reporting requirements such as A-CEEI, but
also in settings where the preference reporting per se is simple but thinking through one’s
preferences is difficult, e.g., school choice (cf. Narita 2016, Kapor, Neilson and Zimmerman
2020). By comparing subjects’ ability to report their preferences with and without a par-
ticular decision support, the “elicited preferences” approach can identify the efficacy of that
decision support and help optimize the performance of existing market designs.
      The elicited preferences methodology is a complement to the induced preferences method-
ology, which has been at the heart of a rich experimental literature in market design.14
 14
      Some of the earliest examples of experiments using the induced preferences methodology include the early


                                                       6
Within matching, experiments using induced preferences have explored decentralized mar-
kets (e.g., Echenique and Yariv 2013), including issues such as unraveling and congestion
(e.g., Niederle and Roth 2009); the transition to centralized clearinghouses (e.g., Kagel and
Roth 2000); and problems in those centralized clearinghouses such as strategic misreport-
ing (e.g., Castillo and Dianat 2016, Echenique, Wilson and Yariv 2016) and clearinghouse
collapse (e.g., McKinney, Niederle and Roth 2005). In addition, a rich line of experimental
work has used induced preferences to explore school choice mechanisms in the laboratory,
including work comparing the performance of various mechanisms, such as deferred accep-
tance, the Boston mechanism, and top trading cycles (e.g., Chen and Sönmez 2006, Pais
and Pintér 2008, Calsamiglia, Haeringer and Klijn 2010, Featherstone and Niederle 2016,
Ding and Schotter 2017). Finally, induced preference laboratory experiments have been
used to explore new matching mechanisms (e.g., Fragiadakis and Troyan 2019, Hakimov
and Kesten 2018, Hakimov et al. 2019) and to explore new incentives criteria for market
design (e.g., Li 2017, Chen et al. 2018).
    Last, our paper contributes a new theory-to-practice success story to the market design
literature. This is valuable for two related reasons. The first reason is that market design
implementations beget further market design implementations. The Wharton committee
was already familiar with the work done by economists re-designing spectrum auctions and
matching markets, and this gave the committee some comfort that economists might have
something useful to say about their problem, too. Our specific market design implementa-
tion paves some new ground — the mechanism descends from general equilibrium theory as
opposed to auction or matching theory, ordinary individuals are asked to report the kinds
of complex preferences more commonly associated with high-stakes combinatorial auctions,
and a lab experiment played a pivotal role in the adoption decision — so we have some
hope that one day other researchers seeking to implement new market designs will be able
to use our implementation as a helpful precedent, just as we used the spectrum auctions
and matching markets as a helpful precedent.
    The second reason, as emphasized by Roth (2002), is that academic work on the practical
implementation of market design theory is an important complement to the theory itself.
This work shows whether a particular theory is robust and raises new questions for theory to
consider (e.g., the optimal design of preference reporting languages). As Roth (2002) writes:
“Whether economists will often be in a position to give highly practical advice depends in
part on whether we report what we learn, and what we do, in sufficient detail to allow
scientific knowledge about design to accumulate. . . . If the literature of design economics
double auction experiments of Chamberlin (1948) and Smith (1962) and combinatorial auction experiments
such as Rassenti, Smith and Bulfin (1982) and Goeree and Holt (2010). See Kagel, Lien and Milgrom
(2010) for an interesting twist on the methodology that uses theory and simulations to guide which induced
preferences to explore.


                                                    7
does mature in this way, it will also help shape and enrich the underlying economic theory.”


Organization of the Paper.            The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
2 describes the experimental design. Section 3 provides initial data on subjects’ preference
reporting ability and presents our results on fairness and efficiency. Section 4 analyzes
preference reporting mistakes. Section 5 reports on the survey data and the search for
unintended consequences of the mechanism. Section 6 reports on the first year of practical
implementation and concludes.


2     Experimental Design

2.1    Real Market Participants’ Real Preferences

Our experimental subjects were Wharton MBA students, recruited by an email sent by the
Wharton administration (see Appendix A).15 There were 132 subjects over eight experi-
mental sessions, conducted in a computer lab at Wharton during the week of November 28,
2011 (see the full text of the experimental instructions in Appendix C).
    Subjects were given a list of 25 Wharton course sections for the upcoming Spring 2012
semester. These courses were chosen by the Wharton Course Allocation Redesign Team (the
“Wharton committee”) to be representative of course offerings in the upcoming semester
with a tilt towards popular courses (see the list of courses and sample descriptions in
Appendix D). Each course section had a capacity of 3 to 5 seats.
    Subjects were instructed that they would participate in two course allocation procedures,
Wharton’s current system and an alternative system, and that their goal in the study was
to use each system to obtain the best course schedule they could given their own true
preferences. Here is some of the key text from the experimental instructions:

      “While using each system, please imagine that it is the spring term of your
      second year at Wharton, so this will be your last chance to take Wharton classes.
      Please try to construct your most preferred schedule given the courses that are
      available.”

      The email indicated that the study was voluntary but that participation was appreciated by the Dean’s
office and as a further inducement offered $250 to two randomly selected subjects per session. The email
did not mention that the study was about course assignment. We wanted to attract student subjects
who were generally representative of the Wharton MBA student body and to avoid attracting students
who were disproportionally happy or unhappy with the current course auction. Subjects were statistically
representative of the Wharton student population on every dimension except race and, importantly, were
representative with regard to attitudes toward the Wharton bidding points auction (see discussion in Section
2.6 and Table A1 in Appendix B).

       take the decisions in this session seriously as well. We will provide you with
       time to think carefully while using each system.”

We then gave subjects five minutes to look over the course offerings and think about their
preferences before describing the first mechanism.


2.2    Flow of Each Experimental Session

In half of the sessions we ran the bidding points auction (BPA) first, and for half of the
sessions we ran A-CEEI first.16 Details of the mechanisms are in Sections 2.3 and 2.4,
respectively. For each mechanism:

   i. We read aloud the instructions for that specific mechanism.

   ii. Subjects participated in that mechanism to assemble a schedule of spring 2012 courses
       (starting from a blank slate for each mechanism).

  iii. Subjects responded to Likert-scale survey questions about their experience with the
       mechanism. See Section 5 and Appendix J for details of the surveys.

After subjects had participated in both mechanisms:

   i. Subjects performed a series of binary comparisons between pairs of schedules. These
       binary comparisons were designed to provide measures of efficiency, fairness and pref-
       erence reporting accuracy. See Section 2.5 for details of the binary comparisons.

   ii. Subjects responded to Likert-scale survey questions comparing the two mechanisms.

  iii. Subjects provided free-form response comments.


2.3    Wharton Bidding Points Auction (BPA)

At the time of the experiment, Wharton’s bidding points auction, a variant on the bidding
points auction mechanism used at a wide variety of educational institutions (Sönmez and
Ünver 2010), worked as follows. In the first round of the BPA, students would submit bids
for courses, with the sum of their bids not to exceed their budget (of an artificial currency
called bidding points). If a course had k seats, the k highest bidders for that course obtained
a seat, and paid the k + 1st highest bid. After this first bidding round there were then eight
additional rounds, spaced over a period of time lasting from the end of one semester to the
beginning of the next, in which students could both buy and sell courses using a double
  16
   We did not find any significant differences in the results based on which mechanism was used first. See
Appendix F for details of this analysis.



                                                    9
auction.17 In each round of the double auction, for each course, all offers to buy were
aggregated into a demand curve, all offers to sell were aggregated into a supply curve (with
empty seats treated as additional supply offered at an ask price of 0), and, if demand and
supply crossed, trades would be executed at the lowest market-clearing price (i.e., a 0-DA
in the terminology of Rustichini, Satterthwaite and Williams 1994).
    Our laboratory implementation of the BPA was as similar as possible to the real Wharton
bidding points auction, subject to the constraints of the laboratory. For time considerations,
we used four rounds instead of nine.18 For the first round, subjects were given five minutes
to select their bids, with an initial budget of 5,000 points. For the remaining three rounds,
subjects were given two-and-a-half minutes to select their bids and asks. The experiment
used the standard web interface of the real Wharton bidding points auction so that it would
be as familiar as possible to subjects. The instructions for the BPA were familiar as well,
since all subjects had previously used the real Wharton bidding points auction mechanism
to pick their courses. (See Appendix C, “Instructions for Course Auction.”)


2.4     Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes (A-CEEI)

A-CEEI has four steps: (i) students report their preferences, (ii) each student is assigned an
equal budget (5,000 points in the experiment) plus a small random amount (used to break
ties),19 (iii) the computer finds (approximate) market-clearing prices, (iv) each student is
allocated her most preferred affordable schedule — the affordable schedule she likes best
given her report in step (i) based on her budget set in step (ii) and the prices found in step
   17
      While the first round of the auction closely resembles a real-money Vickrey auction, the attractive
properties of the Vickrey auction do not translate to the fake-money setting. The mathematical difference is
that preferences are not quasi-linear over objects and money because the money is fake and the game is finite.
Intuitively, someone who bids 10,000 dollars in a real-money auction and loses to someone who bids 10,001
may be disappointed, but at least they can put their money to some alternative use, whereas a student who
bids 10,000 points in a fake-money auction and loses to someone who bids 10,001 may end up graduating
with a large budget of useless course-auction currency. As a result, unlike the Vickrey auction, the bidding
points auction is not strategy-proof and equilibrium outcomes can be highly unfair and inefficient. Note,
however, that if the game were infinitely repeated then unspent fake money would always have a future use
and so the quasi-linearity assumption would be valid. See Prendergast (2017) for an implementation of a
mechanism in this spirit in the context of allocating donated food to food banks across the US.
   18
      In practice, the final allocation of popular courses (i.e., courses with a positive price) is mostly determined
by the outcome of the first round. This gave the Wharton committee confidence that there would not be
much lost by using four rounds instead of nine. In the lab, too, most of the action took place in the first
round.
   19
      Budish’s (2011) result that prices exist for A-CEEI that (approximately) clear the market requires that
students have non-identical budgets. See also Reny (2017) for a recent generalization of this result. The
budgets can be arbitrarily close to equal but cannot be exactly equal. The intuition is that the budget
inequality helps break ties. For example, suppose students A and B both place an extremely high value on
course X, which has one available seat. If A’s budget is 5000 and B’s budget is 5001, then setting the price
of course X to 5001 clears the market because B can afford it while A cannot. The Auction breaks ties in the
auction itself rather than in the budgets. If both A and B bid 5000 points for course X, then the computer
randomly selects one student to transact.

(iii).20
       The instructions described the A-CEEI mechanism, which was unfamiliar to the sub-
jects, and explained to subjects that their only responsibility in using the mechanism was to
tell the computer their true preferences; the computer would then compute market-clearing
prices and buy them the best schedule they could afford at those prices. Because our in-
terest was in whether subjects could report their preferences accurately enough to realize
the theoretical benefits of the A-CEEI mechanism — and not in testing whether subjects
could infer the strategy-proofness of the mechanism — we explicitly instructed subjects to
be as truthful as possible in their preference reporting. The instructions advised students:
“...you do not need to think about the prices of the courses or the values that other students
assign to courses. You get the best schedule possible simply by telling the computer your
true values for courses.”21 The instructions used the metaphor of providing instructions to
someone shopping on your behalf to explain the rationale for reporting one’s true prefer-
ences as accurately as possible. (See Appendix C, “Instructions for the Course Matching
System.”)


2.4.1      Preference Reporting Language

As discussed in the Introduction, A-CEEI requires an ordinal ranking over all feasible sched-
ules from each agent, so that the mechanism can always select the agent’s most-preferred
affordable bundle from any possible choice set. In any practical implementation of A-CEEI,
  20
      See Budish (2011) for a more complete description of how A-CEEI works. See Othman, Budish and
Sandholm (2010) and Budish et al. (2017) for the computer science behind how to calculate the market-
clearing prices in step (iii).
   21
      We thought seriously about whether or not to caveat our instructions by more specifically explaining that
A-CEEI is only approximately strategy-proof, not exactly strategy-proof, and therefore there theoretically
are conditions under which an agent could benefit from misreporting. For reasons outlined in detail here,
we decided that the best advice we could provide subjects was to report their preferences truthfully, and
that dwelling on the difference between approximate and exact strategy-proofness would be confusing. At
any realized prices, truthful reporting is best because it ensures the student receives her most-preferred
affordable bundle at those prices. For it to be profitable for a student to benefit from misreporting her
preferences, it must be the case that the misreport advantageously influences prices while at the same time
the misreport does not cause the student to get the wrong bundle at the influenced prices. Formally, by
reporting preferences as u’ instead of u, this changes prices from p to p’, and the student gets more utility
from the bundle the mechanism thinks she likes best at p’ (based on her misreport u’) than from the bundle
she likes best at p (based on her true preferences u). The main reason why such misreports are hard to
find, even in small markets, is that students require at most one unit of any particular course. Therefore,
the “demand reduction” strategies that are typically used to profitably manipulate prices in multi-object
allocation mechanisms do not work here: if a student reduces demand for a course this can indeed reduce
the price for that course, but since reducing demand means pretending to want zero units instead of one
unit, this does not do the student any good. A second reason why such misreports are likely to be hard to
find is the black box nature of the approximate Kakutani fixed point computation. Footnote 31 of the 2010
working paper version of Budish (2011) gives an example of the kinds of profitable manipulations that were
found in extensive computational exploration in small markets and they are non-intuitive. Since there is a
risk to misreporting — one is no longer guaranteed one’s most-preferred affordable schedule at the realized
prices — and the benefits of misreporting are difficult, if not impossible, to realize, we decided the best
advice we could give was to advise subjects to report truthfully.


                                                      11
agents cannot be expected to directly report preferences over all possible bundles. Instead,
agents will need to report a more limited set of information that describes their preferences,
using a language provided as part of the mechanism implementation (cf. Milgrom (2011)).
    The preference reporting language we implemented in the lab, a simplified version of
the language proposed in Othman, Budish and Sandholm (2010) and similar in spirit to the
language proposed in Milgrom (2009), had two components. First, subjects could report
cardinal item values, on a scale of 1 to 100, for any course section they were interested in
taking; if they did not report a value for a course section its value was defaulted to 0.22
Second, subjects could report “adjustments” for any pair of course sections. Adjustments
assigned an additional value, either positive or negative, to schedules that had both course
sections together. Adjustments are a simple way for students to express certain kinds
of substitutabilities and complementarities.23 Subjects did not need to report schedule
constraints, which were already known by the system. The user-interface for this language,
designed by Wharton information technology professionals, is displayed as Figure 1.
    To calculate a subject’s utility for a schedule, the system summed the subject’s val-
ues for the individual courses in that schedule together with any adjustments (positive or
negative) associated with pairs of courses in the schedule. The subject’s rank order list
over all schedules could thus be obtained by ordering schedules from highest to lowest util-
ity.24 Observe that this means that the cardinal preference information subjects submit for
individual courses and pairs of courses induces an ordinal ranking over all feasible schedules.
    We emphasize that while both we and the Wharton committee believed this preference
reporting language to be reasonable — in particular, the Wharton committee felt strongly
that adding more ways to express non-additive preferences would make the language too
complicated — there is no reason to believe that this preference reporting language is
optimal. As we discuss in the conclusion, optimal language design is an interesting open
question for future research.
    Given the complexity of preference reporting, and in particular the complexity of trans-
lating cardinal item values and adjustments into an ordering over schedules, we provided
subjects with a decision support tool, the “top-ten widget”, which allowed them to translate
  22
     We recommended reporting a positive value for at least 12 course sections to ensure receipt of a complete
schedule of five courses.
  23
     If subjects could report adjustments over arbitrary sets of courses rather than just pairs of courses,
then in principle the language would allow students to express any possible ordinal ranking over schedules,
making the language expressive as defined, e.g., in Nisan (2006). We explore limitations of the language in
further detail in Section 4.
  24
     Computationally, it is not necessary to ever formulate a student’s complete rank order list over schedules.
Instead, the question of what is a student’s most-preferred affordable schedule at a given price vector can
be translated into a mixed-integer program. This is an important computational advantage because integer
programming, though NP-hard, is speedy in practice for problems of this size. The practical implementation
of A-CEEI solves billions of integer programs in the process of finding approximate market clearing prices.
See Budish et al. (2017) for more details on the computational procedure.

Notes: Figure 1 is a screenshot of the top of the user interface for preference reporting. Of the nine course sections that
are visible, the hypothetical subject has reported positive values for the first eight. To make adjustments, subjects
clicked two checkboxes in the far right column of the interface and were prompted to enter the adjustment in a dialog
box. Any previously entered adjustments were listed at the top of the interface. The hypothetical subject has made
one adjustment of -91, which tells the mechanism that getting the two accounting classes (i.e., the first two courses
visible) together in his schedule together is worth 0, effectively reporting that the subject wants one or the other, but
not both, accounting courses.

calculated to be their 10 most-preferred schedules (displayed in order, with the accompa-
nying sum of the cardinal utilities and adjustments next to each schedule). Subjects could
use this widget at any time while reporting their values and could go back to make modifi-
cations to their values, e.g., if they realized the 10 schedules listed were not their favorites
or were in the wrong order. Students were given 10 minutes to report their preferences.

14
     Notes: Figure 2 is a screenshot of a binary comparison. It shows two schedules and asks the subject to pick which of the two the subject prefers.
2.5      Binary comparisons

A simple methodological innovation, binary comparisons, is what allowed us to elicit prefer-
ence data that reflects market participants’ real preferences. The logic behind the method-
ology is that while reporting ordinal preferences over every possible schedule using the
preference reporting language is cognitively complex and all but certain to be somewhat
inaccurate, making a binary comparison between two specific schedules is cognitively simple
and likely to accurately reflect true preferences.
       After using both mechanisms, subjects were shown up to 19 pairs of schedules, and
asked to report which of the two schedules they preferred, on a scale of “Strongly Prefer”,
“Prefer” and “Slightly Prefer” for each schedule. See Figure 2 for a screenshot.
       We designed the set of binary comparisons to yield data to test whether agents were
able to report preferences accurately enough to realize the efficiency and fairness benefits
of A-CEEI relative to the BPA as well as to provide data to directly test agents’ preference
reporting accuracy.


2.5.1      Efficiency and Fairness

Efficiency

Subjects’ first and last binary comparisons were between the schedule the subject received
under A-CEEI and the schedule she received under the BPA. This comparison was asked
twice, as the first question and the last question, with the order of the schedules reversed.25
These binary comparisons yield a simple social welfare comparison between the two mech-
anisms. Specifically, if more subjects prefer their A-CEEI schedule to their BPA schedule
than vice versa, with similar strength of preference, this suggests that a social planner de-
ciding between the two mechanisms should prefer A-CEEI, as should a student choosing
between the two mechanisms from behind a veil of ignorance. Note that this comparison
can be made at the individual-subject level, treating each subject as an independent obser-
vation for statistical tests, and also at the market-session level, aggregating up preferences
to ask which of the two mechanisms generates more social welfare at the session level.26
  25
     The schedule shown on the left in the first question was shown on the right in the last question. These
binary comparisons were only asked if the schedules received under the two mechanisms were different.
  26
     We are interested in both individual-level and session-level results and it is worth noting that there are
inherent tradeoffs between the two. Looking at individual-level data reflects the fact that we care about
individual agents being made better off by a mechanism and gives us more data to run our statistical tests,
but ignores the session-structure of our data. Looking at session-level data respects the fact that mechanisms
are, by definition, implemented at the market level, but gives us only eight sessions to run our statistical
tests.




                                                      15
Fairness

To measure fairness, each subject completed up to six binary comparisons per mechanism
that directly assessed whether the subject envied another subject’s schedule. Envy occurs
when an individual prefers someone else’s schedule to her own schedule; envy freeness is
one of the oldest and most well established criteria of outcome fairness in economics (Foley
1967, Moulin 1995). To increase the chance of detecting envy, each subject was only shown
schedules from the set of others’ schedules that generated at least 50% of the utility of
the subject’s own A-CEEI schedule, based on the preferences the subject reported under
A-CEEI. Restricting to this set aimed to ensure that subjects would face at least somewhat
desirable alternative schedules when answering these binary comparisons. If more than six
schedules of other subjects were in this set, six schedules from this set were chosen randomly
by the computer to be used in binary comparisons. If six or fewer schedules were in this
set, all schedules in the set were used in binary comparisons. This design choice makes the
implicit assumption that schedules generating less than 50% of the utility of the subject’s
own A-CEEI schedule will not be envied, an assumption that we are able to evaluate ex
post (see Appendix G).27
       We use these binary comparisons and the definition of envy freeness to ask whether
subjects experienced more envy under one mechanism than another. Similar to the analysis
for efficiency, we will use these binary comparisons to generate a test of fairness at the
individual-level (i.e., did a subject experience more envy under one mechanism than the
other) and a test of fairness at the session level (i.e., did subjects in a market experience
more envy under one mechanism than the other).


Remark: Joint Tests

We emphasize that these binary comparison measures of efficiency and fairness are neces-
sarily joint tests of preference reporting and the mechanisms. That is, these comparisons
answer the question: is preference reporting accurate enough that A-CEEI is able to outper-
form the BPA on measures of efficiency and fairness? In addition, by comparing efficiency
and fairness outcomes based on binary comparisons to the corresponding outcomes if we
were to assume reported preferences were accurate, we can assess the extent to which im-
perfect preference reporting harmed mechanism performance.
  27
   Results in Appendix G show that while this assumption is unlikely to hold perfectly, its failure to hold
works against us finding that A-CEEI generates less envy than the BPA.




                                                    16
2.5.2      Preference Reporting

All binary comparisons are tests of the A-CEEI preference reporting language, because we
can assess whether the subject’s preference reports accurately predict their true preference
as elicited by the binary comparison between the two schedules. In addition to the binary
comparisons described above, we included five binary comparisons that were aimed specif-
ically at preference reporting accuracy, which compared the schedule the subject realized
under A-CEEI to the schedule that subject would have received (if distinct) if their budget
had been 10% or 30% higher or 10% or 30% lower than it actually was. These binary com-
parisons provide local tests of preference reporting accuracy, examining schedules similar to
the one the subject received. We investigate why subjects may have had difficulty reporting
preferences in Section 4.


2.6      Discussion: Incentives

Before we present the results, we want to return to the issue discussed in the Introduction
that decisions in our experiment are not incentivized. As described in detail in the Introduc-
tion, we could not use the induced preferences methodology, since that would not allow us
to test our fundamental research question of whether market participants could report their
real preferences accurately enough to realize the theoretical benefits of A-CEEI. As noted in
footnote 12, we were not able to incentivize choices in our experiment, since doing so would
have required giving subjects some positive probability of receiving — for a real upcoming
Wharton spring semester — each of the schedules they constructed in the mechanisms and
selected in the binary comparisons. The typical response when researchers are unable to
offer desired incentives in a laboratory experiment is to attempt to run a field experiment.
In the field, both real market participants’ real preferences and incentives for their choices
are usually already in place. Such an experiment might have randomly assigned students to
use different course allocation mechanisms (e.g., assigned some to use A-CEEI and others to
use the Wharton bidding points auction, each for a subset of the available spring semester
seats).28 Given the nature of the problem, however, running a field experiment was just as
infeasible as providing incentives for our laboratory study.29
       We therefore faced a design challenge. While we were able to bring real market par-
ticipants’ real preferences into a controlled laboratory environment, we were not able to
  28
      To evaluate whether one mechanism outperformed the other, such a field experiment would presumably
also need an incentivized elicitation procedure, e.g., testing for envy by giving students the option to trade
their realized schedule for the realized schedules of other students, with some positive probability.
   29
      A field experiment was a non-starter at Wharton, presumably both for logistical reasons and due to
concerns about students’ perceptions of fairness. The prospect of such a field experiment also raises a
Catch-22, since even if the Wharton Administration had considered such a field experiment, they would
likely have wanted to see initial evidence that the mechanism could be successful — evidence of the kind
generated by a laboratory experiment like ours.


                                                     17
incentivize their decisions and we needed to understand and mitigate any potential risk of
the absence of incentives.30
       The main risk is that subjects might not exert as much effort in an unincentivized
experiment as they would in an incentivized one. We thus took care to design the experiment
so that such lack of effort, if present in our setting, would bias against finding that agents
could report their preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI to realize the benefits promised
by the theory.
       Imagine there are two kinds of experimental subjects, “triers” and “non-triers”. Triers
exert the same level of effort in the experimental tasks as they would if fully incentivized,
while non-triers exert zero effort in the mechanisms and their binary comparison responses
are pure noise, i.e., 50/50 coin flips. This noise from the non-triers biases towards less accu-
rate preference reporting under A-CEEI and less ability to detect a difference in efficiency
or fairness between A-CEEI and the BPA. This pushes against finding that subjects can
report preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI to outperform the BPA: noise from the
non-triers biases our results away from finding that subjects can report their preferences
accurately and biases our results away from finding that A-CEEI improves efficiency and
fairness relative to the BPA.
       A subtler case is if the lack of incentives causes subjects to exert effort that is interme-
diate between full effort and pure noise. To understand what would happen in this case
would require an understanding of the function mapping the level of effort to how well
subjects perform in the experimental mechanisms and how accurately they reply to binary
comparisons. We of course do not know this function, but, given that the BPA is familiar to
subjects while A-CEEI is unfamiliar, we might expect partial effort to harm A-CEEI more
than the BPA, which also pushes against finding that A-CEEI outperforms the BPA.
       A second potential risk that is distinct from low effort, and which would bias some
results in our hypothesized direction, is that students in the lab disliked the Wharton
bidding points auction in practice and thus attempted to sabotage its performance in the
lab. While we cannot rule out this possibility entirely (nor could we even if the experiment
were incentivized), a few things give us comfort. First, the subjects in the experiment were
representative of the Wharton student body as a whole, both on demographic measures and,
crucially, on their perception of the Wharton Auction’s effectiveness (see Appendix Table
A1 in Appendix B).31 Second, subjects were recruited to the experimental sessions by an
  30
     While subjects’ decisions were not incentivized, subjects were compensated for their time in the form of
two $250 prizes per session to randomly chosen subjects. The Wharton committee thought that two $250
prizes per session would be more appropriate and attractive compensation than paying each student the
expected value of roughly $30. Suffice it to say, MBA students are different from the typical undergraduate
subject pool.
  31
     We used anonymous Wharton IDs to match experimental subjects to data from an administration
survey conducted at the end of each school year. Our laboratory subjects rated the Wharton Auction’s


                                                     18
email that came from the Wharton administration that did not mention course allocation
and subjects were explicitly asked in the experimental instructions to take their decisions
seriously in the lab just like they do in real life. Our impression, given the attentiveness of
the subjects and the questions they asked during the sessions, is that the Wharton students
in the laboratory took this direction seriously.


3     Results on Fairness and Efficiency
In this section, we present summary statistics on the use of the preference reporting language
and provide initial evidence on subjects’ preference reporting ability in Section 3.1. We then
explore whether subjects reported preferences accurately enough to achieve the fairness and
equity benefits of A-CEEI in Sections 3.2–3.4.


3.1    Preference Reporting Language Use and Accuracy

Panel A of Table 1 shows summary statistics on how subjects used the preference reporting
language. The first four rows show that subjects assigned positive cardinal utilities to
about half of the 25 available courses on average and that they used the cardinal utility
range provided by the reporting language (e.g., about half of courses to which they assigned
positive values had 0 < v < 50 and about half had 50 ≤ v ≤ 100, where v indicates
cardinal utility level). The last three rows suggest that most subjects chose not to use any
adjustments (e.g., the median subject used zero adjustments and the average number of
adjustments across all subjects was slightly more than one).
    Panel B of Table 1 provides initial evidence about preference reporting accuracy. In
particular, we take the binary comparison as reflecting the subject’s true preference and
ask whether the subject’s reported preferences to A-CEEI correctly ranked the schedules
from the binary comparison. If so, we say the preference reports were consistent for that
binary comparison; otherwise, we say the preference reports generated a contradiction.
The first observation about this data is that subjects are usually consistent. As shown in
the first row of Panel B, 84.41% of binary comparisons were correctly ranked by reported
preferences.32
“effectiveness” an average of 4.69 on a scale of 0 to 7, essentially identical to the overall Wharton average of
4.68.
  32
     While subjects are consistent for the majority of comparisons, if we instead look at data by subject we see
that 75.4% of subjects’ preference reports generated at least one contradiction. This number reflects the fact
that a larger fraction of our subjects exhibit preference reporting errors than subjects in prior experimental
work with induced preferences. For example, Rees-Jones and Skowronek (2018) find that 23.3% of subjects
with induced preferences over five objects fail to report these to a strategy-proof mechanism in the correct
rank order. That our number is substantial higher may reflect the more complex data reporting demands
of A-CEEI than the rank order list in Rees-Jones and Skowronek (2018).

Notes: Panel A reports on the use of the preference reporting language for the 132 subjects in the experiment. v is
the cardinal value assigned to a particular course section. Panel B reports summary statistics on the rate at which
preference reports are consistent, defined as the ordinal ranking implied by the subject’s preference report correctly
predicting the preference as reported in a binary comparison. “If contradiction, median utility difference” reports the
median utility difference of the schedule preferred by the binary comparison minus the schedule that the reported
preferences ranked higher. “If contradiction, median % utility difference” reports the median of the utility difference
divided by the utility of the schedule that the reported preferences ranked higher. These data cover the 126 subjects
for whom we collected binary choice data (see footnote 37 about the other six subjects).



    In addition, preference reports are more often consistent when a subject’s binary com-
parison indicates a strong preference. For example, preference reports are consistent 92.11%
of the time when a subject’s binary comparison indicates that they “Strongly Prefer” one
of the schedules.
    Because the preference reports generate a cardinal utility measure for each schedule,
we can also ask about the “size” of contradictions. That is, we can calculate the cardinal
utility assigned to each schedule in a binary comparison and ask whether the preference
reports were “close” to correctly ranking the two schedules when they failed to do so. The
smaller is the utility difference, the closer the preference reports were to correctly ordering
the schedules (or, put differently, the smaller the changes to preference reports would need
to be to eliminate the contradiction). The third row of Panel B reports that, conditional
on a contradiction, the median utility difference between schedules is 38 for all comparisons
and 30.5 for “Strongly Prefer” comparisons, which is roughly a third of the value of a
single highly-preferred course, or about 10% of the average value of an A-CEEI assigned


                                                         20
schedule. Appendix Figure A1 shows histograms of the binary comparisons by the utility
difference between the schedules. Negative utility differences reflect the preference reports
failing to predict the preferred schedule (i.e., contradictions). These histograms underscore
that “large” contradictions are exceedingly rare. For example, contradictions with a utility
difference of more than 100 utils constituted just 2.41% of all binary comparisons, and just
1.36% of “Strongly Prefer” binary comparisons.
   Taken together, these results suggest that while there were indeed preference report-
ing errors, preference reports to A-CEEI rather accurately reflected subject preferences as
elicited by the binary comparisons. The preference reports were consistent with the elicited
preferences 84.41% of the time overall and were consistent with the elicited preferences
92.11% of the time when the subject had a strong preference. In addition, when preference
reports generated a contradiction, the utility differences between the schedules were usually
quite small. These findings suggest hope that agents are able to report their preferences
accurately enough to reap the efficiency and fairness benefits of A-CEEI, the question we
turn to next.


3.2   Comparing A-CEEI and the BPA

Our main results comparing A-CEEI to the BPA appear in Table 2, which presents results
of our efficiency tests (top panel) and fairness tests (bottom panel). Given that experi-
mental subjects participate in the market with the other subjects in their session, the table
presents results at the individual-subject level (left column) and the market-session level
(right column).
   We provide our main tests of whether subjects can report their preferences accurately
enough for A-CEEI to outperform the BPA using binary comparison data (first row of each
panel) and give an indication of the extent to which imperfect preference reporting harmed
mechanism performance by showing the same tests using reported preference data (second
row of each panel). The difference in these tests gives a sense of magnitudes for the harm
caused by preference reporting mistakes (a statistical test of this difference is in the bottom
row of each panel). Just as the tests using the binary comparisons generate a lower bound
on the benefits of A-CEEI (i.e., because of the lack of incentives and the limited time to
report preferences), the tests using reported preference data provide an upper bound on the
performance benefits of A-CEEI relative to the BPA if preference reporting could be made
more accurate, e.g., through education and training of students or by giving students more
time to think about and report their preferences than was possible in the laboratory.
   We discuss the results from the top panel on efficiency in Section 3.3 and the bottom
panel on fairness in Section 3.4. To complement the results presented in Table 2, we present



                                              21
robustness tests of our binary comparison results that utilize the rich nature of the binary
comparison data (e.g., including the intensity of preference) and otherwise redefine our
outcome variables in Appendix Table A2. As discussed throughout Section 3.3 and 3.4,
these robustness tests show that our results are similar under different definitions of our
key outcome variables.
   We make two remarks regarding methodology. First, we believe it is appropriate to use
one-sided statistical tests for the analyses in this section. In the tests based on reported
preferences (cells (C), (D), (G) and (H)), we are testing directional predictions based on
the theoretical efficiency and fairness benefits of A-CEEI and the theoretical efficiency and
fairness problems of the BPA (Sönmez and Ünver 2010). In the tests based on binary
comparisons (cells (A), (B), (E) and (F)), a one-sided test is appropriate given the nature
of our research question. If we reject the null, we will conclude that subjects were indeed able
to report their preferences accurately enough to realize the theoretical efficiency and fairness
benefits of A-CEEI. If we fail to reject the null, we will conclude that subjects had sufficient
difficulty with preference reporting that the theoretical benefits failed to manifest.33 That
said, we recognize that some readers may prefer two-sided tests; two-sided tests would
double all p-values in the table, and in particular would cause the individual-subject binary
comparison result to go from marginally significant at the 10 percent level to insignificant.
   Second, while we report statistical tests separately for each of the eight cells in the
matrix, we consider the gestalt of the results as more informative than any individual
test. More specifically, we take comfort that all of the binary comparison results are in
the same direction, and that the binary comparison and reported preference results are
all consistent with the conclusion that subjects reported accurately enough to realize the
theoretical benefits of A-CEEI but that imperfect preference reporting harmed mechanism
performance.


3.3    Efficiency Tests

Binary Comparison, Individual-Subject (Table 2, Cell A)

As described in Section 2.5, our binary comparisons on efficiency provide a measure of
social welfare by asking subjects which of the two mechanisms they prefer based on their
realized schedules. In particular, we asked subjects who received different schedules from
the two mechanisms whether they preferred the schedule they received under A-CEEI or
the schedule they received under the BPA. This question was asked twice, once as the first
binary comparison and once as the last binary comparison with the order of the schedules
  33
     Note that even if the BPA were to perform much better than A-CEEI, we would not conclude that the
BPA is a better mechanism on efficiency or fairness grounds. Rather, we would go back to the drawing
board regarding the preference reporting language.

Notes: See definitions for the labels listed in the table in the sections of the main text corresponding to each cell
(A)-(H). For Efficiency (top panel), we test whether agents are more likely to prefer their A-CEEI schedule to their
BPA schedule. For Fairness (bottom panel), we test whether subjects experience less envy in A-CEEI than in the
BPA. Individual-Subject preferences were aggregated to a preference at the Market-Session level using a majority-rule
social welfare criterion. P-values reported in cells (A)-(H) are one-sided sign tests. P-values reported in the “Both”
rows are matched-pair sign tests that compare a subject’s (or session’s) classification based on binary comparisons to
that subject’s (or session’s) classification based on reported preferences, with the null hypothesis that the median of
these differences is equal to 0.



reversed between the two.
    Consequently, individual subjects can fall into one of four mutually exclusive groups
based on their binary comparison data. Subjects can either: prefer their A-CEEI schedule


                                                            23
in both binary comparisons (which we label “Prefer A-CEEI”), prefer their BPA schedule
in both binary comparisons (“Prefer BPA”), not display a consistent preference between
the two schedules they received (“Indeterminate preference”) or receive the same schedule
from both mechanisms (“Identical outcome”).34
       As reported in Cell A of Table 2: 56 subjects Prefer A-CEEI, 42 subjects Prefer BPA, 17
subjects have an Indeterminate preference and 17 subjects receive Identical outcomes. To
test whether A-CEEI outperforms the BPA, we treat each subject as an independent obser-
vation, assign subjects with an indeterminate preference or identical outcomes as having no
preference between the mechanisms and perform a one-sided sign test.35 The test yields a
p-value of p = 0.094. This result suggests that subjects are able to report their preferences
accurately enough for A-CEEI to outperform the BPA on this efficiency measure, though
only at the 10% significance level.
       As shown in Appendix Table A2 Cell I and Cell K, results look similar under robustness
specifications that make our definition of preference stricter or more inclusive. In Cell I,
subjects are only classified as Prefer A-CEEI if they state that they Prefer or Strongly Prefer
their A-CEEI schedule to their BPA schedule in both binary comparisons (and likewise for
the BPA). Under this stricter definition, fewer subjects are classified as having a preference,
but A-CEEI is still preferred to the BPA, at least marginally statistically significantly (see
Cell I, p = 0.057). In Cell K, subjects are classified as having a preference based on the
average intensity of subjects’ preferences across the two binary comparisons, which allows us
to assign a preference to eight additional subjects who previously were classified as having an
Indeterminate preference.36 This yields an overall count of 59 subjects preferring A-CEEI
and 47 preferring the BPA (see Cell K, p = 0.143).
  34
      As shown in Figure 2, subjects were not given an option to report that they were indifferent between
two schedules and so seeming preference reversals among subjects with an Indeterminate preference may be
a reflection that some subjects felt indifferent between the two schedules. It could also be an indication of
subject errors or random choices. As discussed in Section 2.6, the extent to which subjects respond randomly
works against us finding any differences between the mechanisms.
   35
      We treat “Prefer A-CEEI” (and, later, “Less Envy A-CEEI”) as A-CEEI outperforming the BPA, “Prefer
BPA” (and, later, “Less Envy BPA”) as the BPA outperforming A-CEEI and all other classifications as A-
CEEI and the BPA performing equally well. The sign test assigns a positive value to an observation in
which A-CEEI outperforms the BPA and a negative value to an observation in which the BPA outperforms
A-CEEI. It then tests whether the median of these values is equal to 0. Note that with data of this form,
the sign test is equivalent to a binomial probability test whether our data could have come from a data
generating process in which A-CEEI outperforms the BPA and the BPA outperforms A-CEEI are equally
likely to arise.
   36
      Under this more inclusive definition, we assign subjects a preference for A-CEEI if they indicated a
stronger preference when they said they preferred their A-CEEI schedule than when they said they preferred
their BPA schedule (three subjects) and assign them a preference for the BPA if the opposite (five subjects).




                                                     24
Binary Comparison, Market-Session (Table 2, Cell B)

To conduct our session-level tests, we aggregate these individual preferences up to the
session level based on a majority-rule social welfare criterion. We count the number of
Prefer A-CEEI and Prefer BPA in each session. If there are more of the former, we classify
the session as “Prefer A-CEEI”; if there are more of the latter, we classify the session as
“Prefer BPA”; and if there are an equal number, we classify the session as a “Tie”.
   As reported in Cell B of Table 2: 6 sessions Prefer A-CEEI, 0 sessions Prefer BPA and 2
sessions are a Tie. To test whether A-CEEI outperforms the BPA, we treat each session as
an independent observation and perform a one-sided sign test. The test yields a p-value of
p = 0.016. Looking at the market-session level reaffirms the individual-subject level results
and indicates that agents are able to report their preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI
to outperform the BPA on this efficiency measure.
   As shown in Appendix Table A2 Cells (J) and (L), we get similar Market-Session level
results from our other definitions of preference, albeit with slightly less statistical confidence
(both Cell J and Cell L, p = 0.109).


Reported Preference, Individual-Subject (Table 2, Cell C)

The second row of Table 2 runs the same tests as the row above, but uses reported pref-
erence data rather than binary comparison data. Notice that we still have the same four
classifications as when analyzing the binary comparison data in Cell A, but definitions
have changed slightly since preferences are based on reported preference data. Subjects’
preference reports may imply they receive higher utility from their A-CEEI schedule than
their BPA schedule (which we label Prefer A-CEEI), receive higher utility from their BPA
schedule than their A-CEEI schedule (Prefer BPA) or receive the same utility from different
schedules from each of the two mechanisms (Indeterminate preference). If they receive the
same schedule from both mechanisms we again use the label Identical outcome.
   As reported in Cell C of Table 2: 79 subjects Prefer A-CEEI, 35 subjects Prefer BPA,
1 subject has an Indeterminate preference and 17 subjects receive Identical outcomes. A
one-sided sign test yields a p-value of p < 0.001.


Reported Preference, Market-Session (Table 2, Cell D)

Applying the same majority-rule social welfare criterion to the individual preferences based
on reported preferences yields a test of whether A-CEEI outperforms the BPA at the market-
session level based on reported preferences. As reported in Cell D of Table 2: 7 sessions
Prefer A-CEEI, 0 sessions Prefer the BPA and 1 session is a Tie. A one-sided sign test
yields a p-value of p = 0.008.


                                               25
Discussion

Results from the top row of Table 2 demonstrate that subjects are able to report preferences
accurately enough to realize the efficiency benefits of A-CEEI. At both the individual level
(p = 0.094) and the session level (p = 0.016), A-CEEI schedules are preferred to BPA
schedules. In addition, reported preference data suggests that absent preference-reporting
mistakes A-CEEI would dramatically outperform the BPA.
      Comparing results in the top row and the second row allows us to test whether A-CEEI
outperforms the BPA to a statistically significantly greater extent in reported preferences
data than in binary comparison data. For the individual-subject data, we run a matched-
pair sign test that compares a subject’s classification based on binary comparisons to that
subject’s classification based on reported preferences, with the null hypothesis that the
median of these differences is equal to 0. As shown in the bottom row of the efficiency
panel, this test yields a p-value of p < 0.001. This suggests that while subjects report
their preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI to outperform the BPA by a slim margin
using individual-subject data, preference-reporting mistakes significantly harmed mecha-
nism performance. Note that we do not see a significant difference when we run a similar
matched-pair sign test on the session-level data.


3.4      Fairness Tests

Binary Comparison, Individual-Subject (Table 2, Cell E)

As described in Section 2.5, our binary comparisons on fairness allow us to investigate
whether subjects experience less envy in A-CEEI than in the BPA. In particular, for each
mechanism, each subject was asked to compare her realized schedule from that mechanism
to (up to six) desirable schedules that other subjects in her session received from that
mechanism. This generates a measure of how many schedules each subject envies in each
mechanism.
      Consequently, individual subjects can again be classified into one of four mutually ex-
clusive groups based on their binary comparison data. Subjects can either: experience less
envy under A-CEEI than the BPA (which we label “Less Envy A-CEEI”), experience less
envy under the BPA than A-CEEI (“Less Envy BPA”), experience no envy under either
mechanism (“No Envy either”) or experience the same amount of envy (i.e., envy the same
positive number of others’ schedules) in both mechanisms (“Same Envy both”).
      As reported in Cell E of Table 2: 40 subjects are classified as Less Envy A-CEEI, 23
subjects are Less Envy BPA, 65 subjects are No Envy either and 4 subjects are Same
Envy both.37 To test whether A-CEEI outperforms the BPA, we treat each subject as an
 37
      These 65 subjects classified as No Envy either include six subjects for whom we do not collect data

independent observation and perform a one-sided sign test. The test yields a p-value of
p = 0.022, demonstrating that subjects experience less envy under A-CEEI than under the
BPA.
    As shown in Appendix Table A2 Cells M, O, and Q, results are robust to three different
measures of envy. Our first approach uses a stricter definition of preference, treating sub-
jects as envying another subject’s schedule only if they Prefer or Strongly Prefer the other
subject’s schedule to their own. Fewer subjects are classified as Less Envy A-CEEI and
Less Envy BPA, but our results remain strong (Cell M, p = 0.001). Our second approach
considers envy freeness as a 0-1 criterion and asks whether the subject was envy free in one
mechanism but not the other. We now classify subjects as having Less Envy A-CEEI if
they do not experience any envy in A-CEEI but do experience envy in the BPA and as Less
Envy BPA if they do experience envy under A-CEEI but do not experience any envy under
the BPA.38 Subjects are still less likely to experience envy under A-CEEI than the BPA
(Cell O, p = 0.030). Our third approach combines the two previous approaches, using the
binary measure of envy freeness but using the stricter envy definition of Prefer or Strongly
prefer. Our results remain significant (Cell Q, p = 0.005).


Binary Comparison, Market-Session (Table 2, Cell F)

As above, we compute our session-level results by aggregating up the individual classification
as described with regard to Cell E to the session level. We count the number of Less Envy
A-CEEI and Less Envy BPA in each session. If there are more of the former, we classify
the session as “Less Envy A-CEEI”; if there are more of the latter, we classify the session
as “Less Envy BPA”; and if there are an equal number, we classify the session as a “Tie”.
    As reported in Cell F of Table 2: 5 sessions are Less Envy A-CEEI, 1 is Less Envy BPA
and 2 are a Tie. To test whether A-CEEI outperforms the BPA we treat each session as
an independent observation and perform a one-sided sign test. The test yields a p-value
of p = 0.109. Consequently, while we find statistically significant results with regard to
fairness at the individual level, we have only directional evidence in support of A-CEEI
outperforming the BPA at the session level.
    As shown in Appendix Table A2 Cells N, P, and R, we get similar results at the Market-
on envy due to a bug in our survey code: in the first three sessions we did not collect binary comparison
data from subjects who received the same schedule under both A-CEEI and the BPA. While this bug was
unfortunate, we believe, if anything, it is likely to work against us finding less envy under A-CEEI than
the BPA. We come to this conclusion by looking at the other 11 subjects with identical A-CEEI and BPA
schedules. Among this group, nine are No Envy either and two are Less Envy A-CEEI. Consequently, if the
missing six subjects were similar to these 11, their data would have made our results somewhat stronger.
  38
     We classify fewer subjects as Less Envy A-CEEI and Less Envy BPA, because now we treat anyone who
experiences envy under both mechanisms as Same Envy both, even if the number of schedules they envy is
different across the two mechanisms.

Session level from our other definitions of envy, with results significant for our stricter
definition of envy (Cell N, p = 0.016) and directional when considering envy-freeness or
envy-freeness with our stricter definition of envy (both Cell P and Cell R, p = 0.227).


Reported Preference, Individual-Subject (Table 2, Cell G)

Again, the second row of the fairness panel runs the same tests as the row above, but
uses reported preference data rather than binary comparison data. We focus on the same
subjects and the same comparison schedules but measure envy based on whether a subject’s
reported preferences suggest they get more utility from another subject’s schedule than their
own schedule. We then generate the same four classifications as when analyzing the binary
comparison data.
   As reported in Cell G of Table 2: 35 subjects are Less Envy A-CEEI, 4 subjects are
Less Envy BPA, 93 subjects are No Envy either and 0 subjects are Same Envy both. A
one-sided sign test yields a p-value of p < 0.001.


Reported Preference, Market-Session (Table 2, Cell H)

As above, we classify sessions based on the number of subjects in each session with the
individual classifications in Cell G. As reported in Cell H, this exercise finds that all eight
of the sessions are classified as Less Envy A-CEEI. A one-sided sign test yields a p-value of
p = 0.004.


Discussion

Results from the binary choice data show that subjects are able to report the preferences
accurately enough to realize the fairness benefits of A-CEEI. At the individual level, we
find that subjects are less likely to experience envy under A-CEEI than under the BPA
(p = 0.022). At the session level, the pattern of results is directionally consistent but not
statistically significant (p = 0.109). Again, as expected, A-CEEI dramatically outperforms
the BPA when abstracting away from preference reporting mistakes.
   Comparing results in the first and second row of the panel allows us to test whether
A-CEEI outperforms the BPA to a statistically significantly greater extent in reported pref-
erences data than in binary comparison data. Again we run a matched-pair sign test that
compares a subject’s classification under binary comparison data to that subject’s classifi-
cation under the reported preference data. As reported in the bottom row of the fairness
panel, this test yields a p-value of p = 0.072 for the individual-subject level. This suggests
that while subjects report their preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI to outperform the
BPA, preference-reporting mistakes marginally statistically significantly harmed mechanism

performance. We find a similar, directional result at the market-session level (one-sided sign
test, p = 0.125)


4         Difficulty with Preference Reporting
The efficiency and fairness results in Section 3 showed that difficulty with preference report-
ing meaningfully harmed mechanism performance. While A-CEEI outperformed the BPA
in our efficiency and fairness tests based on the binary comparisons data, A-CEEI outper-
formed the BPA to a greater extent in our measures based on the reported preference data,
which assume that preference reporting is perfect. In this section, we aim to understand
the causes of preference reporting difficulty and to identify ways that preference reporting
accuracy might be improved.
         Conceptually, we distinguish between two possible reasons why subjects’ preference re-
ports might not reflect their underlying true preferences. First, subjects may have had
difficulty using the preference reporting language we provided in the lab to express their
underlying true preferences, even though in principle it was mathematically feasible for
them to do so with the language. We evaluate this concern in Section 4.1. Second, there
are some kinds of preferences that mathematically cannot be expressed using the language
we provided. If such preferences were present in our subject pool, this would necessarily
create a discrepancy between subjects’ reported preferences and their true preferences. We
evaluate this concern in Section 4.2.39 Section 4.3 discusses the results from this section.


4.1        Difficulty Using the Preference Reporting Language

To assess whether agents had difficulty using the preference reporting language we provided,
we first explore whether they were able to effectively use each of its components: cardinal
values to express preferences for individual courses and pairwise adjustments to express
certain kinds of complementarities and substitutabilities for pairs of courses. We explore
subjects’ ability to use each of these components of the language in turn.
         To examine subjects’ ability to report cardinal item values, we differentiate between the
ordinal and cardinal component of a subject’s reported preferences for individual courses.
For this analysis, we drop the 87 binary comparisons in which one or both schedules triggered
an adjustment. For the remaining 1574 binary comparisons, we differentiate between binary
    39
     In addition, subjects using A-CEEI in the lab environment might have failed to put in sufficient effort
to fully conceptualize their preferences or to reflect their preferences using the reporting language. While we
designed our experiment so that noise in subjects’ preference reports (and binary comparison choices) would
work against us finding evidence that subjects reported their preferences accurately enough for A-CEEI to
outperform the bidding points auction, failure to report preferences carefully could certainly contribute to
preference reporting errors.



                                                      29
comparisons in which the reported preferences can rank the two schedules based only on the
ordinal information in the preference reports or whether the cardinal information is needed
as well. For example, if we rank course sections by a subject’s assigned cardinal item values
and find that schedule A consists of the subject’s {1st , 3rd , 5th , 7th , 9th } highest value course
sections while schedule B consists of the subject’s {2nd , 4th , 6th , 8th , 10th } highest value
course sections, then we know the preference reports rank schedule A over schedule B based
on ordinal information alone (i.e., we do not need to know the specific cardinal utilities the
student assigned to each course).
    If instead, schedule A consists of a subject’s {1st , 2nd , 8th , 9th , 10th } highest value course
sections and schedule B consists of a subject’s {3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th } highest value course
sections, ordinal information alone is insufficient for the reported preferences to rank the
schedules. Comparisons that rely on cardinal information are those for which the subject’s
ability to report cardinal preference information accurately is put to the test.
    Table 3 reports Probit regressions with a dependent variable equal to 1 if the pref-
erence reports contradicted the binary comparison choice.40 Column 1 of Table 3 shows
that comparisons that rely on cardinal information are more likely to be associated with a
contradiction than those that rely on ordinal information alone (the excluded group). The
interpretation of the coefficient is that preference reports are 21 percentage points more
likely to generate a contradiction when they rely on cardinal information than when they
rely on ordinal information only. This difference is both economically large, relative to an
average rate of contradiction of 15.8% among comparisons of schedules without an adjust-
ment, and highly statistically significant, with a z-stat of 7.00. While part of this sizeable
effect is no doubt due to the fact that binary comparisons that are revealed ex post to have
relied on ordinal information were likely easier for the preference reports to rank ex ante,
the result also suggests that subjects had meaningful difficulty reporting cardinal utilities
to the preference reporting language.41
    To examine subjects’ ability to report complementarities and substitutabilities, we ex-
plore subjects’ use of adjustments. Pairwise adjustments were not used as widely as one
might have expected — just 1.08 per subject on average as shown in Table 1. Due to the
   40
      We report marginal effects so that the coefficients can be interpreted as the change in probability of a
contradiction and cluster our standard errors at the subject level to account for correlations in the errors for
each subject. Appendix I demonstrates the robustness of the results presented in Table 3.
   41
      If we re-run regression (1) with the reported-preference utility difference between schedules as an ad-
ditional control variable, the coefficient on Cardinal is 0.150 with a z-stat of 5.41. This is lower than the
coefficient without such a control (0.208), which suggests that comparisons that rely on cardinal information
are more likely to be a close call than comparisons that rely on ordinal information only, but the coefficient
remains economically large, which suggests that reporting cardinal preference information is per se difficult.
Similarly, if we re-run regression (1) controlling for a dummy for whether the binary comparison reflected a
slight preference, preference, or strong preference — which may be correlated with the difficulty of reporting
preferences consistent with the binary comparison — the coefficient on Cardinal becomes 0.176 with a z-stat
of 6.19.

relatively limited use of adjustments, only 87 binary comparisons involved a schedule in
which an adjustment was activated. For this analysis, we compare these binary compar-
isons, which we say relied on combinatorial information, to the other 1574 comparisons.
Column 2 of Table 3 finds that preference reports are directionally, but not significantly,
less likely to generate a contradiction when they rely on combinatorial information. While
it is hard to draw conclusions with this data, the result suggests that adjustments did not
detract from preference reporting accuracy.
    Finally, ability to report preferences might be driven by some combination of cognitive
ability and effort. While we cannot directly measure these variables, we have a proxy
for them in whether students have a high or low grade point average. We define High
GPA as being above the median grade point average among our subjects. Column 3 of
Table 3 reports that preferences reported by subjects with higher grade point averages are
marginally statistically significantly less likely to generate contradictions.42

4.2    Limitations of the Preference Reporting Language

The preference reporting language we used in the experiment was not fully expressive (as
defined, e.g., in Nisan 2006), meaning that there exist ordinal preferences over schedules
that subjects would be mathematically unable to express using the language that was pro-
vided. The issue is that many kinds of non-additive preferences cannot be expressed using
pairwise adjustments.43 Additionally, there are many kinds of non-additive preferences that
in principle could be expressed using the language but for which the language does not seem
especially natural.44
    The set of potential non-expressible preferences is vast, and we do not have a disciplined
way of exploring all such possibilities as a source of preference reporting contradictions.45
Instead, we explored two specific sources of non-additive preferences that the Wharton
committee suggested to us would be the most important, both of which arise from scheduling
considerations per se rather than the contents of the classes within the schedule.
    The first is whether a student’s schedule is balanced — at least one class on each day
Monday through Thursday (none of the course sections in our experiment met on Friday,
as is typical at Wharton). The second is whether the schedule is contiguous — every
day on which a student has class he has at most one 1.5-hour gap between the start of
the first class and the end of that last one. According to the Wharton committee, these
characteristics make a schedule “elegant” and are highly valued by at least some students.
However, subjects are not able to express a value for either characteristic using the preference
reporting language in the experiment. We therefore investigate whether the preference
reports generated a higher probability of a contradiction when the schedule in a binary
comparison that receives a lower utility based on reported preferences is elegant in at least
one of these two ways (and so may generate utility that the subject was unable to report
using the preference reporting language) and the other schedule in the binary comparison
is not elegant in that way.
    Column 4 of Table 3 shows that comparisons in which the schedule with the lower
more likely to misreport their preferences in strategy-proof environments.
  43
     We discussed with the Wharton committee whether to allow subjects to express adjustments over arbi-
trary sets of courses rather than just pairs, which in principle would make the language fully expressive. In
these discussions, the committee concluded that arbitrary set-wise adjustments would be too complicated
for students.
  44
     For example, suppose a student wants to express that they want at most one out of a set of k classes. They
could express this in principle using just pairwise adjustments, but it would take k (k−1)
                                                                                        2
                                                                                             such adjustments
(reporting that any two of the k courses together have negative total value). A simpler way to convey the
same preferences would be to report a constraint of the form “at most one out of these k”, were the ability
to do so provided. See Milgrom (2009) for an example of a preference reporting language that allows agents
to express preferences of this form — at most k out of set S. There are numerous analogous examples.
  45
     With roughly 50,000 possible schedules in the lab, there are 50,000! possible ordinal preferences over
schedules, or roughly 1012,499 . As such, the up to 19 binary comparisons we ask of subjects do not provide
enough data to identify patterns in such a large set without prior guidance on where to look.



                                                      32
utility is elegant in a way that the schedule with the higher utility is not are marginally
statistically significantly more likely to yield a contradiction (z = 1.78). That preference
reports are more likely to make a contradiction when they give a lower value to an elegant
schedule than to a schedule that is not elegant in that way suggests that at least some of
the contradictions are due to the preference reporting language failing to provide a way
for agents to report important features of their preferences. A caveat is that each of these
types of non-expressible preferences (i.e., being balanced and being contiguous) account
for only a small number of contradictions each.46 That said, there are likely many other
non-expressible preferences that we do not quantify here.


4.3      Discussion

Results from this section provide some evidence as to the sources of inaccurate preference re-
porting. First, subjects had particular difficulty with reporting cardinal preference intensity
information — preference reports were dramatically more likely to generate a contradiction
when they relied on cardinal information to determine which schedule was preferred. Sec-
ond, when subjects expressed non-additive preferences they did so with reasonable accuracy,
but they did so rarely. Third, subjects with higher grades reported preferences that were
less likely to generate contradictions, suggesting that higher performing students were bet-
ter able to report preferences. Fourth, evidence suggests that there were some non-additive
preferences that were important to subjects but that subjects were unable to express with
the language provided.
       These results provide empirical support for some common intuitions in the market design
literature, such as the ease of reporting ordinal information relative to cardinal information
(Bogomolnaia and Moulin 2001), the importance of non-additive preferences (Cantillon and
Pesendorfer 2007, Reguant 2014) and the overall importance of language design (Milgrom
2009, 2011). We also hope that the overall logic of the results in this section gives the reader
additional comfort as to the validity of the experimental methodology.
       It is worth noting that our results on preference reporting also guided practical im-
plementation at Wharton in a few ways. First, Wharton opted to use the same language
in practical implementation as was used in the lab, based on the overall level of accu-
racy of the reports taking into consideration that subjects had only 10 minutes to report
their preferences and had only minimal training. Second, Wharton provided students with
  46
     There are 15 contradictions in which the lower utility schedule is balanced and the higher utility schedule
is not, and 35 contradictions in which the lower utility schedule is contiguous and the higher utility schedule
is not. If we run the regression reported in Table 3 Column 4 separately on balanced and contiguous, the
coefficient on balanced is 0.15 and significant at the 1% level, and the coefficient on contiguous is 0.034 and
not significant. The large magnitude on balanced suggests this feature may be important to a meaningful
proportion of students, but the number of observations is small.



                                                      33
extensive training on how to use the reporting language with significant training focused
specifically on how to think about cardinal preference intensity, since this was such an im-
portant source of difficulty in the lab. Third, Wharton enhanced the top-ten widget in
the preference reporting user interface to allow students to see substantially more than 10
schedules, allowing students to assess whether they had reported their preferences accu-
rately not just for their very most preferred schedules (which may be unattainable if the
student likes mostly popular courses) but further down their overall ranking as well.47 To
date, Wharton has opted not to incorporate other ways to report non-additive preferences
beyond the pairwise adjustment tool, fearing excessive complexity. Developing a conceptual
understanding of the tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity is an interesting open
area for future research.


5         Analysis of Survey Data
As noted in the Introduction, an additional advantage of using real market participants
as experimental subjects and asking them to use a mechanism with their real preferences
is that we could search for “side effects” — issues not captured by the theory that could
undermine the potential benefits of a new market design. For example, a mechanism might
have attractive theoretical fairness properties but market participants might nevertheless
subjectively find it to be unfair. A mechanism might have attractive incentive properties but
participants might not understand that they should report truthfully (see Hassidim, Romm
and Shorrer 2016, Li 2017, Rees-Jones 2018, Rees-Jones and Skowronek 2018). Market
participants might find a mechanism to be frustrating or confusing, properties that would
undermine the practical appeal of a mechanism but that seem difficult to capture in a
theoretical model.
         Concern about side effects was especially pronounced in our setting both because of
the nature of the mechanism being considered and the nature of the allocation problem.
Regarding the mechanism, A-CEEI had never been used before, so lacked reassuring prece-
dent, and it is complex in several ways that intuitively raise concerns about side effects.
Regarding the setting, fear that a new market design might lead to unexpectedly dissatisfied
market participants was high at Wharton, where student satisfaction is a top priority —
the Wharton committee was concerned about student satisfaction both with regard to the
final allocation and the process that lead to that allocation.
         To address these concerns, we collected a wide variety of survey data to search for
issues missed by the theory. After subjects used each mechanism, we asked them a number
    47
    In the free-response component of our survey, several subjects specifically mentioned the top-ten widget
as a helpful feature of the user interface.



                                                    34
of survey questions about that mechanism (see questions and results in Appendix Table
A8). In this section, we highlight the main results from this search for side effects. A full
discussion of our survey results can be found in Appendix J.
       One set of survey questions covered “liking” of the mechanism, and we found very little
difference in subjects’ answers to these questions between A-CEEI and the BPA. Our main
takeaway from this set of questions was that there was not some important unmeasured
side effect that caused subjects to dramatically prefer either A-CEEI or the BPA that our
main efficiency and fairness analyses would have missed. These results also seemed to give
comfort to the Wharton committee that there was nothing unexpected about the A-CEEI
mechanism that led the Wharton student subjects to dislike the system.
       Another set of questions asked about strategic play, asking for a level of agreement with
the statements: “I had to think strategically about what other students would do in this
course allocation system” and “Someone with perfect knowledge of the historical supply and
demand for courses could have had an advantage over me in this system”. Subjects reported
much higher agreement with these two for the BPA than for A-CEEI, suggesting that they
at least partially understood that A-CEEI was strategy-proof. However, some subjects still
stated agreement with these statements for A-CEEI. A lesson for implementation that came
out of these survey responses was to do a more thorough job of explaining A-CEEI’s strategy-
proofness to students, since understanding that historical information and strategizing was
not necessary for A-CEEI was positively correlated with other measures of satisfaction with
A-CEEI.48
       A final set of questions asked about transparency, asking for a level of agreement with
the statements: “I understand how this course allocation system works” and “I felt like I had
control over my schedule in this course allocation system”. Subjects reported significantly
less agreement with these statements for A-CEEI than for the BPA, suggesting they felt
that A-CEEI was a “black box”, i.e., non-transparent. The transparency issue constitutes a
side effect in that it negatively impacted market participants’ evaluation of the mechanism
and was not anticipated by the theory.
       Wharton acted on this finding in their practical implementation of A-CEEI in two ways.
First, Wharton administrators did student-wide presentations about the new mechanism to
explain in detail how it works, the theory behind it and the experimental evidence, all in an
effort to enhance transparency. Second, Wharton made a simple but important change to
the mechanism’s user interface. In the user interface implemented in the lab, subjects were
shown the schedule they received under A-CEEI but were not shown market-clearing prices.
This prevented subjects from understanding why they received their specific schedule and
  48

(2008, 2013), Roth (2008), Azevedo and Budish (2019) and Li (2017).

why, for example, they failed to get some particular course they valued highly. In the
practical implementation, Wharton modified the user interface so that students are shown
the market-clearing prices.49
    Finally, the survey data revealed a positive side effect with regard to gender. At the time
of our experiment, the Wharton administration was facing evidence that women at Wharton
disproportionately disliked the Wharton bidding points auction. A Wharton survey of all
second-year students in the year of our experiment found that women reported lower ratings
for the effectiveness of the real Wharton bidding points auction than men did (seven-point
scale of effectiveness, 4.95 for men vs. 4.28 for women, t-test, two-sided, p < 0.001).50 The
administration was therefore interested in whether A-CEEI would also display a gender
disparity. Our survey questions about the BPA generated the same pattern as the Wharton
administration had seen in their data. However, there was no gender gap in liking of, or
satisfaction with, A-CEEI. Eliminating the gender difference that was present in attitudes
toward the BPA was a positive side effect of A-CEEI not anticipated by the theory.51


6     Conclusion
Wharton formally decided to adopt A-CEEI for use in practice after a series of adminis-
trative meetings in the few months following our experiment. This could not have been an
easy decision given the complexity of the A-CEEI mechanism and the lack of direct prece-
dent. Based on our conversations with the committee, our sense is that what ultimately
was pivotal in Wharton’s decision to adopt A-CEEI was not any one experimental result
but rather the full set of experimental results: the efficiency and fairness gains relative to
the BPA; the finding that preference reports were on the whole reasonably accurate, with
large mistakes comparatively rare; the finding that the efficiency and fairness gains would
be meaningfully larger if preference reporting accuracy could be improved; the strategic
simplicity gains identified in the survey; and the lack of any unexpected side effects, beyond
the transparency issue which the committee felt could be addressed in practice with better
communication and some modest changes to the user interface.
    Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain the data that would have been necessary
to do a full empirical before-and-after comparison of the two mechanisms.52 However, the
  49
     Gérard Cachon, the chair of Wharton’s Course Allocation Redesign Team, wrote to us in personal
correspondence: “I have heard that this makes a difference – some students say ‘when I saw the prices, I
understood why I got what I got.’”
  50
     While the survey question asked about “effectiveness” broadly, it was the only question asked about the
BPA and so responses are likely to be driven by feelings about the BPA on multiple dimensions.
  51
     If we interpret the BPA as “competitive” because it is highly strategic and A-CEEI as “noncompetitive”
because it is approximately strategy-proof, the finding echoes a famous finding in the gender literature
(Niederle and Vesterlund 2007).
  52
     Ideally, we would have used a school-wide survey to obtain true preference from students during the last


                                                     36
limited data that are available are all consistent with the claims made by the theory and
the experiment. One simple way to measure outcome fairness is to look at the distribution
of the most popular courses; for any one student we cannot tell if their failure to get
popular courses reflects unfairness of the mechanism or their preferences, but the aggregate
distribution suggests that A-CEEI improved equity. In the last fall of the bidding points
auction, 32% of students got zero of the top 20 most popular courses and 5% got three
or more, versus 13% and 0%, respectively, under A-CEEI. That is, under A-CEEI fewer
students got none of the most popular courses and fewer (i.e., none) got three or more.
Another way to measure outcome fairness is to look at the distribution of the cost of
students’ final schedules. The cost of a student’s schedule is defined as the cost of buying
all the classes in that student’s schedule at the prices determined by the market design
(i.e., the market clearing prices determined by A-CEEI or the prices in the BPA). The Gini
index of this distribution went from 0.54 in the last fall of the bidding points auction to
0.32 in the first fall of A-CEEI.53 In addition, we used school-wide surveys to investigate
the change in mechanisms. At our urging, the annual administration survey of the student
body added a few questions about course allocation in the last year of the bidding points
auction’s use, written in such a way that they could be used again in the first year of
A-CEEI (which was implemented as “Course Match”) with minimal change to language.
The percentage of students responding either Agree or Strongly Agree to the statement “I
was satisfied with my schedule from {the course auction system / course match}” increased
from 45% in 2013 (the last year of the bidding points auction) to 64% in 2014 (the first year
of A-CEEI). The percentage responding either Agree or Strongly Agree for the statement
“{The course auction, Course match} allows for a fair allocation of classes” increased from
28% to 65%. The percentage of students responding either effective or very effective to
the question “Please rate the effectiveness of the {course auction, course match} system”
increased from 24% to 53%.
    An interesting open question for future research is how to design a better preference
reporting language, both in this specific setting and in general. The results of the experi-
ment show that the language used in the lab and adopted for implementation allowed for
year of the Wharton bidding points auction; this would have allowed us to compare student outcomes from
actual play of the bidding points auction to counterfactual play of A-CEEI, analogously to other studies
that have used survey data such as Budish and Cantillon (2012), de Haan et al. (2015) and Kapor, Neilson
and Zimmerman (2020). Unfortunately, the Wharton administration did not want to conduct such a survey,
fearing that a survey of students’ “true preferences” at the time they were participating in the bidding
points auction would have been confusing — especially given that a school-wide announcement had been
made concerning the adoption of the new, truthful mechanism. Due to the complexity of the equilibrium of
the bidding points auction, it is an open question whether it is possible to infer true preferences from strategic
play in the absence of such a survey (e.g., as He (2017), Agarwal and Somaini (2018) and Calsamiglia, Fu
and Güell (2020) are able to do in the school-choice setting).
  53
     For further details on these data and the engineering details of the practical implementation see Budish
et al. (2017).

preference reports that were accurate enough to yield the efficiency and fairness benefits of
A-CEEI, but the results do not at all suggest that the language is optimal. One specific
direction to consider based on the experimental results would be to allow students to report
richer kinds of non-additive preferences. A more difficult conceptual question is how to
think about the overall tradeoff between a language’s expressiveness and its efficacy. Too
simple of a language may actually complicate the mechanism for participants, who must
struggle with how to translate their real preferences into too simplistic of a language.54 Too
complicated of a language would also be sub-optimal, if participants are unable to effectively
“speak” the language. How to design a language that is optimal for a specific setting is a
fascinating question in need of a conceptual breakthrough.
    A perhaps-related question is whether and how to incorporate prior information about
the structure of preference heterogeneity in the relevant population into preference report-
ing. Typically in market design, a mechanism does not assume anything about the agent’s
preferences that the agent does not explicitly report to the mechanism via the supplied lan-
guage. Contrast this with, e.g., common practice at e-commerce companies such as Amazon
or Netflix, which interact whatever data they gather about any particular user’s preferences
with their prior on the structure of preferences in the population to form a posterior of that
user’s type and make recommendations accordingly. That the Wharton committee was
able to identify preferences (e.g., about the temporal structure of schedules as described in
Section 4.2) that students had difficulty reporting suggests the potential for advancement
on this front.
    The induced preferences methodology has been critically important in the history of
market-design experiments, tracing all the way to the early double auction experiments of
Chamberlin (1948) and Smith (1962). But, to study whether real market participants can
report complex preference information “accurately enough” to realize the benefits of a new
mechanism, we needed a new approach. We therefore developed the elicited preferences
methodology, in which real market participants play based on their real preferences, with
tailored binary comparisons used to assess reporting accuracy and mechanism performance.
We suspect that as market design continues to grow as a field — and as computers continue
to become more powerful, data more plentiful, and decision supports more sophisticated
— market designs leveraging complicated preference information will become increasingly
feasible and increasingly common. Other market design researchers can utilize the method-
  54
     A practical example of using a too-simple reporting language is the restriction on the ability of military
cadets to trade off years of service against their desired military branch in cadet-branch matching (Sönmez
and Switzer 2013). Also related are limitations on the length of preference lists in school choice (cf. Pathak
and Sönmez 2013). See also Hatfield and Kominers (2017) who study theoretically how the design of the
contract language in many-to-many matching affects whether preferences, as expressed through the language,
are guaranteed to be substitutable and to yield a stable match.

B     Subject Representativeness
Subjects were representative of all Wharton MBA students on demographics as well as
attitudes towards, and behavior in, the Wharton Auction. Using data provided by the
Wharton Dean’s Office, Table A1 shows the demographics of our 132 subjects as well as
the universe of Wharton MBA students in the 2011-2012 academic year. The final column
reports the p-value of either a test of proportions or a t-test comparing our subjects to the
universe of students. We see that based on demographics, our subjects are representative
of the Wharton student body with p > 0.1 for each variable except race.
    Important for our purposes, our subjects look identical to the student body with regard
to Auction behavior: namely, the number of points they had at the start of the Spring
Auction (which began before the study took place) and the number of points they had
when our study took place (points in the fourth round of the Spring Auction). For the
second-year students in our study, we also examine data on their attitudes towards the
Wharton Auction as measured on the preceding spring’s stakeholder survey. Our second-
year subjects were almost identical to the universe of second-year subjects in reports on the
effectiveness of the Wharton Auction.

Notes: Table A1 reports data provided by Wharton. Due to Wharton’s policy of grade non-disclosure, GPA levels
cannot be reported. For the variables Total Registered Credits and Wharton Credits in Panel A and the variables in
Panel B, the number of MBA students that appear in the mean is 1,649. There are 11 students for whom we have
general demographic and GPA information but for whom we do not have auction information. The auction beliefs
data in Panel C came from the stakeholder survey completed by rising second year students the preceding spring, so
we only have it for the second-year students. Tests are two-sided t-tests (for continuous variables) or two-sided tests
of proportions (for binary variables).

C        Study Instructions

    Study	  Instructions	  
    	  
    Thank	  you	  for	  participating	  in	  this	  study.	  	  
    	  
    If	  you	  have	  a	  question	  about	  the	  study	  at	  any	  time,	  please	  raise	  your	  hand.	  
    	  
    In	  this	  study	  you	  will	  be	  constructing	  hypothetical	  class	  schedules	  for	  the	  spring	  
    semester	  of	  your	  second	  year	  at	  Wharton.	  	  
    	  
    You	  will	  construct	  a	  schedule	  twice,	  once	  under	  each	  of	  two	  different	  course	  
    allocation	  systems.	  	  
    	  
    One	  course	  allocation	  system	  is	  a	  simplified	  version	  of	  Wharton’s	  current	  MBA	  
    “Course	  Auction”.	  The	  other	  is	  an	  alternative	  course	  allocation	  system	  for	  Wharton	  
    MBA	  courses	  called	  the	  “Course	  Matching	  System”.	  
    	  
    Half	  the	  sessions	  in	  the	  study	  will	  use	  the	  “Course	  Auction”	  first	  and	  half	  will	  use	  the	  
    “Course	  Matching	  System”	  first.	  
    	  
    After	  you	  construct	  a	  schedule	  under	  each	  system,	  you	  will	  answer	  a	  series	  of	  
    questions	  about	  the	  schedule	  you	  have	  constructed	  and	  about	  the	  system	  that	  you	  
    used.	  	  
    	  
    After	  you	  have	  constructed	  schedules	  under	  both	  systems,	  you	  will	  be	  asked	  to	  
    compare	  around	  15	  to	  20	  pairs	  of	  schedules.	  For	  each	  pair	  of	  schedules	  you	  will	  be	  
    asked	  which	  of	  the	  two	  you	  prefer.	  
    	  
    While	  using	  each	  system,	  please	  imagine	  that	  it	  is	  the	  spring	  term	  of	  your	  second	  
    year	  at	  Wharton,	  so	  this	  will	  be	  your	  last	  chance	  to	  take	  Wharton	  classes.	  Please	  try	  
    to	  construct	  your	  most	  preferred	  schedule	  given	  the	  courses	  that	  are	  available.	  
    	  
    We	  are	  using	  a	  subset	  of	  25	  spring	  semester	  course	  sections.	  These	  course	  sections	  
    were	  selected	  to	  be	  representative	  in	  terms	  of	  scheduling,	  department,	  and	  
    popularity	  level.	  	  
    	  
    There	  may	  be	  some	  courses	  that	  you	  would	  be	  interested	  in	  taking	  that	  are	  not	  
    included	  on	  this	  list.	  There	  is	  a	  limited	  set	  of	  courses	  because	  there	  are	  only	  
    approximately	  18	  students	  in	  the	  study	  today	  and	  so	  we	  cannot	  replicate	  the	  entire	  
    course	  offerings	  of	  a	  normal	  spring	  semester.	  (Note	  that	  the	  actual	  roster	  for	  this	  
    spring	  may	  differ	  in	  terms	  of	  which	  courses	  are	  offered,	  the	  professors	  teaching	  
    them,	  and	  their	  meeting	  times.)	  
    	  
    We	  ask	  you	  to	  imagine	  that	  these	  are	  the	  only	  courses	  available	  in	  the	  spring	  
    semester	  of	  your	  second	  year	  at	  Wharton,	  and	  to	  construct	  your	  most	  preferred	  
    schedule	  given	  these	  courses.	  Since	  this	  is	  your	  last	  semester,	  any	  budget	  points	  that	  
    you	  do	  not	  use	  are	  worthless.	  


                                                                       49
Please	  imagine	  that	  you	  do	  not	  need	  to	  take	  any	  particular	  courses	  for	  your	  major	  or	  
any	  other	  graduation	  requirements,	  but	  that	  you	  do	  need	  to	  take	  5	  credit	  units.	  	  If	  
you	  have	  already	  taken	  one	  of	  the	  courses	  in	  the	  sample,	  then	  you	  should	  assume	  
that	  you	  cannot	  take	  the	  course	  again	  in	  the	  spring	  semester.	  On	  the	  other	  hand,	  you	  
should	  assume	  that	  you	  can	  take	  any	  course	  in	  the	  sample	  that	  you	  have	  not	  already	  
taken,	  that	  is,	  ignore	  any	  prerequisite	  requirements.	  Notice	  that	  all	  of	  the	  courses	  
are	  semester	  length	  and	  worth	  one	  credit	  unit.	  
	  
Imagine	  that	  this	  is	  the	  schedule	  you	  would	  construct	  the	  week	  before	  classes	  begin.	  
Once	  classes	  start	  you	  would	  be	  able	  to	  drop	  a	  course,	  but	  you	  would	  have	  to	  replace	  
it	  with	  a	  course	  that	  had	  an	  open	  seat.	  	  
	  
In	  real	  life,	  we	  know	  you	  take	  these	  decisions	  very	  seriously.	  We	  ask	  that	  you	  take	  
the	  decisions	  in	  this	  session	  seriously	  as	  well.	  We	  will	  provide	  you	  with	  time	  to	  think	  
carefully	  while	  using	  each	  system.	  	  
	  
Note:	  Neither	  the	  schedules	  you	  construct	  nor	  the	  decisions	  you	  make	  in	  this	  
experiment	  will	  have	  any	  impact	  on	  your	  actual	  spring	  semester	  courses	  or	  your	  point	  
budget	  in	  the	  actual	  Wharton	  MBA	  Course	  Auction.	  
	  
The	  course	  sections	  that	  are	  available	  are	  listed	  in	  the	  packet	  that	  has	  been	  given	  to	  
you.	  Please	  take	  five	  minutes	  to	  look	  through	  the	  packet	  of	  courses	  that	  are	  
available.	  Think	  about	  how	  interested	  you	  are	  in	  each	  of	  the	  courses	  and	  what	  
would	  be	  your	  ideal	  schedule	  or	  schedules.	  We	  will	  begin	  with	  the	  first	  system	  in	  
five	  minutes.

Instructions	  for	  the	  Course	  Auction	  
	  
This	  procedure	  is	  a	  simplified	  version	  of	  Wharton’s	  current	  MBA	  Course	  Auction.	  It	  
is	  similar	  to	  the	  Course	  Auction	  that	  you	  have	  already	  used	  during	  your	  time	  at	  
Wharton,	  but	  with	  a	  few	  differences:	  
	  
        • Every	  student	  starts	  with	  the	  same	  number	  of	  budget	  points	  (5,000)	  
        • There	  are	  4	  rounds	  of	  auction	  activity	  	  
        • All	  students	  are	  considered	  second-­‐year	  students	  bidding	  on	  courses	  for	  
              their	  last	  semester	  
        • All	  students	  need	  5	  credit	  units	  (CUs)	  
	  
You	  are	  given	  a	  budget	  of	  5,000	  points.	  There	  are	  then	  4	  rounds	  of	  the	  auction,	  all	  of	  
which	  we	  will	  play	  today.	  In	  the	  first	  round	  you	  can	  bid	  on	  as	  many	  courses	  as	  you	  
would	  like	  so	  long	  as	  the	  sum	  of	  your	  bids	  is	  less	  than	  or	  equal	  to	  your	  budget.	  In	  the	  
next	  three	  rounds,	  you	  can	  buy	  and	  sell	  courses	  with	  other	  students.	  
	  
	  
Instructions	  for	  Round	  1	  	  
	  
Submitting	  Bids	  
	  
In	  the	  first	  round,	  you	  can	  submit	  bids	  for	  as	  many	  different	  course	  sections	  as	  you	  
like.	  The	  sum	  of	  your	  bids	  cannot	  exceed	  your	  budget	  of	  5,000	  points.	  	  
	  
	  
How	  are	  prices	  calculated?	  
	  
Prices	  are	  calculated	  the	  same	  way	  as	  in	  the	  current	  Wharton	  Course	  Auction.	  The	  
price	  of	  a	  section	  is	  set	  at	  the	  highest	  losing	  bid	  or	  100	  points,	  whichever	  is	  higher.	  
For	  example,	  if	  a	  section	  has	  5	  seats,	  the	  price	  for	  the	  section	  is	  set	  equal	  to	  the	  sixth	  
highest	  bid	  for	  it,	  if	  that	  bid	  is	  at	  least	  100	  points,	  otherwise	  the	  price	  is	  100.	  	  For	  
example,	  if	  the	  sixth	  highest	  bid	  is	  120,	  then	  the	  five	  highest	  bidders	  would	  each	  get	  
a	  seat	  and	  be	  charged	  120	  points.	  If	  fewer	  students	  bid	  for	  a	  section	  than	  it	  has	  seats,	  
then	  the	  price	  of	  the	  section	  is	  set	  to	  100.	  	  
	  
	  
What	  sections	  do	  I	  get?	  	  
	  
You	  get	  any	  section	  for	  which	  your	  bid	  is	  greater	  than	  or	  equal	  to	  the	  price.	  In	  the	  
event	  of	  a	  tie,	  where	  two	  or	  more	  students	  submit	  exactly	  the	  same	  bid	  and	  there	  is	  
not	  enough	  space	  for	  all	  of	  them,	  the	  computer	  randomly	  assigns	  the	  available	  seats	  
to	  students	  who	  bid	  that	  amount.	  
	  




                                                                       51
	  
What	  happens	  to	  my	  budget?	  	  
	  
For	  each	  section	  that	  you	  receive,	  your	  budget	  will	  be	  decreased	  by	  the	  price	  of	  the	  
section.	  For	  example,	  if	  you	  bid	  1000	  for	  the	  only	  section	  of	  Course	  A	  and	  its	  price	  is	  
400,	  then	  you	  will	  receive	  a	  seat	  in	  Course	  A,	  and	  your	  budget	  will	  be	  decreased	  by	  
400	  points.	  If	  you	  do	  not	  get	  a	  seat	  in	  the	  course	  then	  you	  will	  not	  give	  up	  those	  400	  
points.	  
	  
             	  
Instructions	  for	  Rounds	  2,	  3,	  and	  4	  
	  
Submitting	  Bids	  and	  Asks	  
	  
In	  Rounds	  2	  through	  4,	  you	  can	  submit	  bids	  for	  as	  many	  different	  sections	  as	  you	  
like,	  just	  as	  in	  Round	  1.	  You	  can	  also	  submit	  asks,	  which	  are	  offers	  to	  sell,	  for	  any	  
section	  that	  you	  currently	  have.	  The	  sum	  of	  your	  bids	  cannot	  exceed	  your	  current	  
budget.	  You	  can	  ask	  whatever	  amount	  you	  like.	  
	  
	  
How	  are	  prices	  calculated?	  	  
	  
For	  any	  section	  where	  there	  are	  both	  bids	  and	  asks,	  a	  trading	  price	  is	  set	  if	  there	  is	  
at	  least	  one	  bid	  higher	  than	  the	  lowest	  ask.	  When	  this	  is	  the	  case,	  the	  computer	  sets	  
a	  price	  to	  make	  as	  many	  trades	  as	  possible.	  This	  involves	  finding	  a	  price	  such	  that	  
the	  number	  of	  bids	  higher	  than	  that	  price	  is	  the	  same	  as	  the	  number	  of	  asks	  lower	  
than	  that	  price.	  	  
	  
Suppose	  the	  following	  bids	  and	  asks	  are	  submitted	  for	  a	  section	  during	  a	  round.	  	  
                             Bids:	  101,	  323,	  143,	  103,	  187,	  280,	  156,	  and	  152.	  
                             Asks:	  225,	  64,	  298,	  171,	  and	  0.	  
To	  see	  which	  bids	  and	  asks	  are	  successful	  and	  what	  the	  clearing	  price	  is,	  first	  
arrange	  all	  the	  bids	  in	  descending	  order	  and	  the	  asks	  in	  ascending	  order	  as	  shown	  in	  
the	  table	  below:	  
	  




                                                                       52
Since	  only	  the	  top	  three	  bids	  are	  higher	  than	  the	  three	  lowest	  asks	  (and	  the	  fourth	  
highest	  bid	  is	  lower	  than	  the	  fourth	  lowest	  ask),	  only	  three	  trades	  can	  go	  through.	  
The	  clearing	  price	  is	  determined	  as	  the	  larger	  of	  the	  first	  losing	  bid	  and	  the	  highest	  
winning	  ask;	  in	  this	  case,	  the	  first	  losing	  bid	  is	  156,	  and	  highest	  winning	  ask	  is	  171	  
—	  hence	  the	  clearing	  price	  is	  171.	  The	  clearing	  price	  amount	  is	  transferred	  from	  
each	  of	  the	  successful	  bidders	  to	  each	  successful	  seller	  (the	  accounts	  of	  unsuccessful	  
bidders	  and	  sellers	  remain	  unaffected).	  
	  
If	  there	  are	  extra	  seats	  in	  a	  section,	  for	  example	  if	  a	  section	  does	  not	  reach	  capacity	  
in	  Round	  1,	  then	  those	  seats	  are	  treated	  as	  if	  they	  are	  being	  offered	  for	  an	  ask	  of	  100	  
points.	  
	  
You	  can	  always	  be	  guaranteed	  to	  drop	  a	  section	  by	  submitting	  an	  ask	  of	  “0”.	  	  
	  
	  
What	  should	  my	  schedule	  look	  like	  at	  the	  end	  of	  Round	  4?	  
	  
At	  the	  end	  of	  Round	  4	  you	  should	  have:	  (1)	  no	  more	  than	  5	  credit	  units	  in	  your	  
schedule;	  (2)	  no	  sections	  that	  have	  a	  time	  conflict	  with	  each	  other;	  and	  (3)	  no	  more	  
than	  one	  section	  in	  each	  course.	  	  
	  
	  
Is	  my	  schedule	  after	  Round	  4	  my	  final	  schedule?	  
	  
Not	  necessarily.	  Recall,	  you	  should	  imagine	  that	  this	  is	  the	  schedule	  you	  would	  
construct	  the	  week	  before	  classes	  begin.	  Once	  classes	  start	  you	  would	  be	  able	  to	  
drop	  a	  course,	  but	  you	  would	  have	  to	  replace	  it	  with	  a	  course	  that	  had	  an	  open	  seat.	  	  
	  
	  
	  
If	  you	  have	  any	  questions,	  please	  raise	  your	  hand.	  




                                                                      53
Instructions	  for	  Between	  Systems	  
	  
You	  have	  just	  constructed	  a	  schedule	  under	  the	  first	  system	  and	  answered	  some	  
questions	  about	  the	  schedule	  and	  the	  system.	  You	  will	  now	  construct	  a	  schedule	  
under	  the	  other	  system.	  	  
	  
You	  are	  constructing	  a	  schedule	  in	  this	  system	  starting	  “from	  scratch”	  such	  that	  the	  
decisions	  you	  and	  the	  other	  students	  in	  this	  session	  made	  while	  using	  the	  first	  
system	  do	  not	  affect	  anything	  about	  activity	  in	  this	  system.	  	  
	  
You	  should	  again	  construct	  the	  best	  schedule	  you	  can	  for	  your	  spring	  term	  of	  your	  
second	  year	  at	  Wharton.	  The	  same	  course	  sections	  are	  available	  for	  this	  system	  as	  
were	  available	  for	  the	  last	  one.




                                                              54
Instructions	  for	  the	  Course	  Matching	  System	  
	  
The	  Course	  Matching	  System	  is	  different	  from	  the	  Wharton	  Course	  Auction	  with	  
which	  you	  may	  be	  familiar.	  	  
	  
The	  Course	  Matching	  System	  works	  differently	  from	  an	  auction	  in	  that	  you	  do	  not	  
directly	  bid	  for	  course	  sections.	  Instead,	  the	  computer	  acts	  as	  your	  agent	  to	  buy	  the	  
best	  schedule	  of	  courses	  you	  can	  afford.	  	  
	  
Your	  job	  is	  to	  tell	  the	  computer	  how	  much	  you	  value	  individual	  course	  sections	  and	  
whether	  you	  assign	  extra	  value	  (or	  negative	  value)	  to	  having	  certain	  course	  sections	  
together.	  This	  process	  will	  be	  explained	  in	  detail	  below.	  
	  
Since	  you	  can	  tell	  the	  computer	  how	  much	  you	  like	  every	  course	  or	  pair	  of	  courses	  
that	  might	  be	  in	  your	  schedule,	  the	  Course	  Matching	  System	  only	  needs	  one	  round.	  
In	  that	  round,	  the	  computer	  will	  use	  your	  preferences	  to	  buy	  you	  the	  best	  schedule	  
you	  can	  afford.	  
	  	  
Since	  the	  computer	  is	  going	  to	  optimally	  buy	  courses	  for	  you,	  your	  job	  is	  to	  provide	  
the	  computer	  with	  all	  the	  information	  it	  needs	  about	  how	  much	  you	  value	  the	  
courses.	  This	  is	  obviously	  very	  important,	  since	  the	  computer	  is	  going	  to	  buy	  the	  
optimal	  schedule	  for	  you	  given	  only	  what	  it	  knows	  about	  how	  you	  value	  courses.	  
	  
The	  way	  to	  communicate	  your	  values	  to	  the	  computer	  is	  as	  follows:	  
	  
	  
1) You	  tell	  the	  computer	  how	  much	  you	  value	  each	  course	  section	  that	  you	  
         have	  any	  interest	  in	  taking.	  	  
         • First,	  you	  pick	  a	  favorite	  course	  section	  and	  assign	  it	  a	  value	  of	  100.	  
         • Second,	  you	  assign	  all	  other	  course	  sections	  that	  you	  have	  any	  interest	  in	  
              taking	  a	  value	  between	  1	  and	  100.	  
         	  
The	  reason	  that	  you	  assign	  your	  favorite	  course	  section	  a	  value	  of	  100	  and	  all	  other	  
sections	  a	  number	  between	  1	  and	  100	  is	  that	  all	  values	  are	  relative.	  	  
              	  
For	  example,	  if	  you	  value	  every	  course	  at	  100	  then	  you	  are	  telling	  the	  computer	  that	  
you	  value	  all	  courses	  equally.	  If	  you	  value	  one	  course	  at	  100	  and	  another	  course	  at	  
50,	  you	  are	  telling	  the	  computer	  you	  value	  the	  course	  at	  100	  twice	  as	  much	  as	  the	  
course	  at	  50.	  	  
	  
Unlike	  using	  other	  course	  allocation	  systems,	  when	  using	  the	  Course	  Matching	  
System,	  you	  do	  not	  need	  to	  think	  about	  what	  other	  people	  are	  doing.	  All	  you	  need	  to	  
do	  is	  communicate	  how	  you	  value	  course	  sections	  to	  the	  computer	  so	  it	  knows	  how	  
to	  make	  tradeoffs	  for	  you.	  	  
              	  




                                                                 55
How	  does	  assigning	  value	  to	  courses	  work?	  
               	  
Suppose	  that	  among	  the	  many	  course	  sections	  you	  assign	  a	  positive	  value,	  you	  tell	  
the	  computer	  the	  following	  values	  for	  the	  single	  section	  courses	  A	  through	  E:	  	  
               	  
               Course	  A	  =	  100	  
               Course	  B	  =	  80	  	  
               Course	  C	  =	  60	  
               Course	  D	  =	  15	  
               Course	  E	  =	  10	  
               	  
This	  tells	  the	  computer	  that	  you	  are	  particularly	  interested	  in	  Courses	  A,	  B	  and	  C,	  
and	  somewhat	  interested	  in	  Courses	  D	  and	  E.	  	  In	  particular,	  it	  tells	  the	  computer	  that	  
you	  prefer	  getting	  Courses	  A,	  B,	  and	  C	  (100	  +	  80	  +	  60	  =	  240)	  than	  getting	  Courses	  A,	  
D,	  and	  E	  (100	  +	  15	  +	  10	  =	  125).	  	  
	  
It	  also	  tells	  the	  computer	  that	  you	  prefer	  getting	  Courses	  B	  and	  C	  (80	  +	  60	  =	  140)	  
than	  Courses	  A,	  D,	  and	  E,	  which	  only	  sum	  to	  125.	  For	  any	  two	  schedules,	  the	  
computer	  thinks	  you	  prefer	  whichever	  schedule	  has	  a	  larger	  sum.	  
	  	  
	             	  
For	  simplicity,	  this	  example	  valued	  only	  5	  course	  sections.	  You	  should	  list	  a	  positive	  
value	  for	  as	  many	  courses	  that	  you	  have	  any	  interest	  in	  taking.	  	  We	  recommend	  that	  
you	  assign	  a	  positive	  value	  to	  at	  least	  12	  course	  sections.	  	  This	  way	  the	  computer	  can	  
distinguish	  between	  a	  section	  that	  has	  low	  positive	  value	  to	  you	  and	  a	  section	  that	  
has	  zero	  value	  to	  you.	  	  	  
	  
	  
	  
Can	  I	  assign	  values	  for	  multiple	  sections	  of	  the	  same	  course?	  
               	  
Yes,	  and	  you	  will	  probably	  want	  to	  do	  this.	  To	  explain,	  suppose	  three	  sections	  of	  a	  
course	  are	  offered,	  all	  on	  Mondays	  and	  Wednesdays.	  Professor	  Smith	  teaches	  the	  
10:30-­‐12:00	  and	  12:00-­‐1:30	  sections	  while	  Professor	  Jones	  teaches	  the	  3:00-­‐4:30	  
section.	  You	  may	  assign	  values	  of	  90,	  80	  and	  15	  to	  these	  three	  sections,	  respectively,	  
to	  signify	  that	  you	  greatly	  prefer	  Professor	  Smith	  to	  Professor	  Jones,	  and	  slightly	  
prefer	  10:30	  to	  12:00.	  Because	  you	  can	  only	  take	  one	  section	  of	  a	  course,	  you	  will	  be	  
assigned	  at	  most	  one	  of	  these	  three	  course	  sections,	  even	  though	  you	  entered	  values	  
for	  all	  three.	  
               	  
Again,	  there	  is	  no	  limit	  to	  the	  number	  of	  course	  sections	  that	  you	  may	  assign	  a	  
positive	  value.	  
               	  
	  
	  
	  



                                                                    56
2) You	  tell	  the	  computer	  if	  you	  assign	  extra	  (or	  negative)	  value	  to	  certain	  
       pairs	  of	  classes.	  	  
       	  
       To	  do	  this,	  you	  check	  the	  boxes	  next	  to	  any	  two	  sections	  and	  indicate	  an	  extra	  
       positive	  or	  negative	  value	  to	  having	  both	  sections	  together.	  These	  “adjustments”

Why	  might	  I	  assign	  extra	  value	  to	  two	  courses	  together?	  
              	  
Some	  students	  might	  get	  extra	  value	  from	  having	  two	  courses	  that	  are	  back-­‐to-­‐back	  
in	  their	  schedule	  (e.g.	  they	  do	  not	  like	  breaks	  between	  classes).	  	  
              	  
Some	  students	  might	  get	  extra	  value	  from	  having	  two	  courses	  that	  are	  related	  in	  
their	  schedule	  (e.g.	  they	  might	  get	  extra	  value	  from	  taking	  two	  courses	  from	  the	  
same	  department	  if	  each	  one	  becomes	  more	  useful	  with	  the	  other).	  
              	  
You	  can	  think	  of	  these	  courses	  as	  complements,	  i.e.	  the	  combination	  of	  the	  two	  
courses	  together	  is	  greater	  in	  value	  than	  the	  sum	  of	  their	  values.	  	  
	  
	  
How	  does	  assigning	  extra	  value	  work?	  
              	  
Suppose	  you	  specify	  the	  following	  values	  for	  single	  section	  courses	  A	  through	  C:	  	  
	  
              Course	  A	  =	  40	  
              Course	  B	  =	  30	  
              Course	  C	  =	  85	  
              	  
And	  suppose	  you	  assign	  an	  extra	  value	  of	  20	  for	  getting	  Course	  A	  and	  Course	  B	  
together.	  
              	  
Then	  you	  are	  telling	  the	  computer	  that	  getting	  Course	  A	  and	  Course	  B	  together	  in	  
your	  schedule	  has	  a	  value	  of	  90	  (90	  =	  40	  for	  Course	  A	  +	  30	  for	  Course	  B	  +	  20	  for	  
getting	  both	  together).	  
              	  
This	  means	  that	  the	  computer	  would	  try	  to	  get	  you	  Course	  A	  and	  Course	  B	  together	  
before	  trying	  to	  get	  you	  Course	  C.	  If	  you	  had	  not	  assigned	  the	  extra	  value	  to	  Courses	  
A	  and	  B	  together,	  the	  computer	  would	  have	  tried	  to	  get	  you	  Course	  C	  before	  trying	  
to	  get	  you	  Courses	  A	  and	  B.	  
              	  	  	  
              	  
Why	  might	  I	  assign	  negative	  value	  to	  two	  courses	  together?	  
	  
Some	  students	  might	  get	  negative	  value	  from	  having	  two	  courses	  that	  are	  back-­‐to-­‐
back	  in	  their	  schedule	  (e.g.	  they	  prefer	  to	  take	  breaks	  between	  classes).	  	  
              	  



                                                                      57
Some	  students	  might	  get	  negative	  value	  from	  having	  two	  courses	  that	  are	  related	  in	  
their	  schedule	  (e.g.	  they	  might	  decide	  that	  they	  only	  want	  to	  take	  one	  class	  from	  a	  
certain	  department).	  
              	  
You	  can	  think	  of	  these	  courses	  as	  substitutes,	  i.e.	  the	  second	  course	  is	  worth	  less	  
when	  you	  already	  have	  the	  first.	  	  
              	  
              	  
How	  does	  assigning	  negative	  value	  work?

              Course	  C	  =	  55	  
              	  
And	  suppose	  you	  assign	  a	  negative	  value	  of	  -­‐20	  for	  getting	  Course	  A	  and	  Course	  B	  
together.	  
              	  
Then	  you	  are	  telling	  the	  computer	  that	  getting	  Course	  A	  and	  Course	  B	  together	  in	  
your	  schedule	  has	  a	  value	  of	  50	  (50	  =	  40	  for	  Course	  A	  +	  30	  for	  Course	  B	  -­‐	  20	  for	  
getting	  both	  together).	  
              	  
This	  means	  that	  the	  computer	  would	  try	  to	  get	  you	  Course	  C	  before	  getting	  you	  
Course	  A	  and	  B	  together.	  If	  you	  had	  not	  assigned	  the	  negative	  value	  to	  Courses	  A	  and	  
B	  together,	  the	  computer	  would	  have	  tried	  to	  get	  you	  Courses	  A	  and	  B	  before	  trying	  
to	  get	  you	  Course	  C.	  
              	  
You	  can	  also	  use	  an	  adjustment	  to	  tell	  the	  computer	  “I	  want	  to	  take	  at	  most	  one	  of	  
these	  two	  courses”.	  Using	  the	  example	  above,	  suppose	  you	  want	  to	  take	  either	  
Course	  A	  or	  Course	  B,	  but	  you	  absolutely	  do	  not	  want	  to	  take	  both.	  Then	  you	  should	  
assign	  a	  negative	  value	  of	  -­‐70	  for	  Course	  A	  and	  B	  together.	  That	  negative	  adjustment	  
tells	  the	  computer	  that	  the	  combination	  has	  value	  0	  to	  you	  (0	  =	  40	  for	  Course	  A	  +	  30	  
for	  Course	  B	  –	  70	  for	  getting	  both	  together).	  	  Therefore,	  you	  may	  get	  Course	  A	  or	  
Course	  B,	  but	  the	  computer	  will	  never	  get	  both	  for	  you.	  	  
	  
	  
When	  do	  I	  not	  need	  to	  enter	  in	  an	  adjustment?	  
	  
You	  do	  not	  need	  to	  enter	  an	  adjustment	  when	  two	  sections	  are	  from	  the	  same	  
course	  or	  two	  sections	  are	  offered	  at	  the	  same	  time.	  The	  computer	  already	  knows	  
that	  you	  cannot	  take	  these	  sections	  together.	  	  For	  example,	  if	  Professor	  Baker	  
teaches	  two	  sections	  of	  the	  same	  course,	  one	  from	  9:00-­‐10:30	  and	  the	  other	  from	  
10:30-­‐12:00,	  then	  you	  can	  assign	  a	  positive	  value	  for	  each	  of	  them,	  but	  you	  don’t	  
need	  to	  assign	  a	  positive	  or	  negative	  adjustment	  for	  the	  combination.	  	  	  
	  



                                                                      58
Once	  the	  computer	  knows	  how	  much	  you	  value	  each	  course	  section,	  it	  will	  buy	  the	  
best	  schedule	  you	  can	  afford.	  
	  
	  
How	  do	  I	  know	  that	  I	  am	  reporting	  my	  values	  right?	  
	  
To	  help	  make	  sure	  you	  are	  reporting	  your	  values	  right,	  you	  can	  click	  a	  button	  on	  the	  
navigation	  bar	  to	  see	  your	  top	  10	  schedules.	  Given	  the	  values	  you	  reported,	  the	  
computer	  thinks	  that	  these	  are	  your	  10	  favorite	  schedules,	  ranked	  in	  order.	  This	  
means	  that	  the	  computer	  will	  try	  to	  buy	  you	  these	  schedules	  in	  this	  order.	  If	  the	  
order	  of	  these	  schedules	  does	  not	  look	  right	  to	  you,	  go	  back	  and	  adjust	  your	  values	  
until	  they	  appear	  in	  the	  right	  order.	  
	  
	  
What	  is	  my	  budget	  that	  the	  computer	  will	  use	  to	  buy	  courses	  for	  me?	  	  
	  
Each	  student	  is	  given	  a	  budget	  of	  5,000	  points.	  	  
	  
	  
How	  are	  prices	  determined?	  
	  
The	  Course	  Matching	  System	  sets	  prices	  based	  on	  demand	  for	  the	  courses	  so	  that	  
demand	  equals	  supply.	  Courses	  that	  are	  more	  highly	  demanded	  get	  higher	  prices	  
and	  courses	  that	  are	  less	  popular	  get	  lower	  prices	  or	  prices	  of	  zero.	  
	  
One	  way	  to	  think	  about	  how	  prices	  are	  set	  is	  that	  each	  student’s	  computer	  asks	  for	  
the	  best	  possible	  schedule	  for	  its	  student.	  When	  everyone	  has	  their	  best	  possible	  
schedule,	  some	  courses	  will	  have	  too	  many	  students.	  The	  price	  of	  those	  courses	  will	  
rise.	  Then,	  given	  the	  new	  set	  of	  prices,	  each	  student’s	  computer	  asks	  again	  for	  the	  
best	  possible	  schedule	  for	  its	  student	  at	  the	  new	  set	  of	  prices.	  Some	  courses	  will	  be	  
undersubscribed	  or	  oversubscribed	  and	  prices	  will	  adjust	  again.	  This	  process	  
repeats	  until	  there	  is	  a	  set	  of	  prices	  where	  all	  popular	  courses	  are	  full	  and	  every	  
student	  gets	  their	  best	  possible	  schedule	  given	  those	  prices.	  
	  
Given	  the	  set	  of	  prices,	  it	  may	  be	  necessary	  to	  break	  a	  tie	  between	  two	  or	  more	  
students	  who	  want	  a	  course	  section.	  	  These	  potential	  ties	  are	  broken	  by	  assigning	  a	  
randomly	  selected	  small	  budget	  increase	  to	  each	  student.	  	  
	  
	  
Shouldn’t	  the	  values	  I	  report	  to	  the	  computer	  depend	  on	  the	  prices	  of	  courses	  or	  other	  
student’s	  values?	  
	  
No!	  The	  Course	  Matching	  System	  is	  designed	  so	  you	  do	  not	  need	  to	  think	  about	  the	  
prices	  of	  the	  courses	  or	  the	  values	  that	  other	  students	  assign	  to	  courses.	  You	  get	  the	  
best	  schedule	  possible	  simply	  by	  telling	  the	  computer	  your	  true	  values	  for	  courses.	  
	  	  



                                                                  59
To	  see	  this,	  notice	  that	  if	  your	  favorite	  course,	  to	  which	  you	  assign	  a	  value	  of	  100,	  is	  
a	  course	  whose	  demand	  is	  less	  than	  the	  number	  of	  available	  seats,	  then	  it	  will	  have	  a	  
price	  of	  zero	  and	  you	  will	  get	  that	  course	  without	  using	  any	  of	  your	  budget.	  The	  
computer	  can	  then	  use	  the	  remainder	  of	  your	  budget	  to	  try	  to	  get	  the	  other	  course	  
sections	  that	  you	  value	  highly.	  
	  
Another	  way	  to	  think	  about	  reporting	  your	  values	  to	  the	  computer	  is	  to	  imagine	  you	  
are	  sending	  the	  computer	  to	  the	  supermarket	  with	  your	  food	  budget	  and	  a	  list	  of	  
your	  preferences	  for	  ingredients	  for	  dinner.	  You	  want	  to	  report	  your	  true	  values	  so	  
that	  the	  computer	  can	  make	  the	  right	  tradeoffs	  for	  you	  when	  it	  gets	  to	  the	  
supermarket	  and	  observes	  the	  actual	  prices	  for	  each	  ingredient.	  	  
	  
	  
Are	  my	  values	  equivalent	  to	  “bids”?	  
	  
No!	  As	  mentioned	  above	  your	  values	  are	  only	  compared	  to	  each	  other	  and	  never	  
compared	  with	  other	  students’	  values.	  	  
	  
	  
Is	  the	  schedule	  I	  receive	  after	  I	  report	  my	  values	  my	  final	  schedule?	  
	  
Not	  necessarily.	  Recall,	  you	  should	  imagine	  that	  this	  is	  the	  schedule	  you	  would	  
construct	  the	  week	  before	  classes	  begin.	  Once	  classes	  start	  you	  would	  be	  able	  to	  
drop	  a	  course,	  but	  you	  would	  have	  to	  replace	  it	  with	  a	  course	  that	  had	  an	  open	  seat.	  	  
	  
	  
If	  you	  have	  any	  questions,	  please	  raise	  your	  hand.

D     List of Course Sections Available in Experiment and Ex-
      cerpt of Course Descriptions
At the beginning of each session, along with the instructions reproduced as Appendix C, we
distributed to students the list of course sections available in the experiment as well as course
descriptions. This list and the first two course descriptions are reproduced below and on
the following page. The number of available seats was selected by the Wharton Committee
to create scarcity in the laboratory environment anticipating 20 subjects per session. Our
actual turnout varied between 14-19 subjects per session. In order to maintain scarcity
with fewer subjects we adjusted course capacities as follows. If 18-19 subjects attended, we
used the capacities below (107 seats total). If 16-17 subjects attended, we turned five-seat
courses into four-seat courses (97 seats total). If 14-15 subjects attended we turned five-seat
courses into four-seat courses and turned four-seat courses into three-seat courses (86 seats
total).

ACCT742: PROBLEMS IN FIN REPORTIN - LAMBERT R

Financial statements are a primary means for firms to communicate
information about their performance and strategy to investors and
other groups. In the wake of numerous accounting scandals and the
recent financial meltdown (which accounting both helped and hindered),
it is more important than ever for managers and investors to
understand (i) the financial reporting process, (ii) what financial
statements do and do not contain, and (iii) the types of discretion
managers have in presenting transactions they have undertaken. This
course is designed to help you become a more informed user of
accounting numbers by increasing your ability to extract, interpret,
and analyze information in financial statements.

While this is not a course in equity valuation per se, equity
valuation is one of the most common uses of financial statement data.
Accordingly, we will examine the relation between Accounting 742 -
stock prices and financial statement information. We will also study
the use of financial ratios and forecasted financial statement data in
models of distress prediction.



ACCT897: TAXES AND BUS STRATEGY - BLOUIN J

Traditional finance and strategy courses do not consider the role of
taxes. Similarly, traditional tax courses often ignore the richness of
the decision context in which tax factors operate. The objective of
this course is to develop a framework for understanding how taxes
affect business decisions.

Part of being financially literate is a having a basic understanding
of how taxation affects business decisions that companies typically
face: forming the business and raising capital, operating the firm,
distributing cash to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases, expanding through acquisition, divesting lines of
business, and expanding internationally. Taxes have a direct impact on
cash flow and often divert 40% to 50% of the firm’s pretax cash flow
to the government. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms
plan accordingly is important whether you will be running the firm
(e.g., executive in large company, entrepreneur, or running a family
owned business) or assessing it from the outside (e.g., financial
analyst, venture capitalist, or investment banker). Taxes are
everywhere and it pays to have some understanding of them.

                   Notes: Histograms show the distribution of utility differences between the two schedules in the binary
                   comparison. The x-axis reports the difference in the cardinal utilities, as determined by the preference
                   reports to A-CEEI, of the preferred schedule minus the other schedule. Negative utility differences indi-
                   cate contradictions (i.e., binary comparisons for which the preference reports failed to correctly rank the
                   schedules). Panel A shows data from all binary comparisons. Panel B shows data from binary comparisons
                   in which subjects “Prefer” or “Strongly Prefer” one of the schedules. Panel C shows data from binary
                   comparisons in which subjects “Strongly Prefer” one of the schedules.

F       Order Effects of Main Results
In four of our eight sessions, subjects used the Auction first; in the other four sessions,
subjects used A-CEEI first. If using A-CEEI forces subjects to think about their prefer-
ences more deeply than using the Auction — and this deeper thought contributes to better
outcomes — then we might expect A-CEEI to do particularly well relative to the Auction
when subjects use the Auction before A-CEEI (i.e., before they have engaged in the deep
thought) as compared to when they use the Auction after A-CEEI. In Table A3 we replicate
Table 2 for the two orders and show that our main efficiency and fairness results are quite
similar, regardless of which mechanism was used first. If anything, results are directionally
stronger when A-CEEI is played first, although differences are far from significant.

G      Assessing Our Envy Assumption
As discussed in the main text, our envy comparisons involved asking subjects to compare
their realized schedule from a mechanism to schedules received by other subjects in the
session from the same mechanism. To increase the chance of detecting envy, we selected
schedules from the set of others’ schedules that delivered at least 50% of the cardinal utility
of the subject’s A-CEEI schedule (i.e., based on the subject’s reported preferences). This
design choice allowed us to ensure that we were showing subjects relevant schedules, but it
made an implicit assumption that schedules with less than 50% of the cardinal utility of
the subject’s A-CEEI schedule would not be envied. Here, we assess that assumption.
    Figure A2 shows a binned scatter plot of the envy comparisons faced by subjects in
the experiment. The graph shows the probability of a subject displaying envy and how it
varies with the percentage of the subject’s A-CEEI schedule cardinal utility generated by
the other subject’s schedule in the envy comparison.

Notes: Envy binary comparison data from each mechanism is split into 10 bins based on the percentage of A-CEEI
utility generated by the other subject’s schedule. The x-axis value is the mean percentage of A-CEEI schedule utility
in the bin (to prevent outliers from affecting the location of the highest utility bin, “Other schedule percentage of
A-CEEI utility” is Winzorized to the 99th percentile value of 124% of A-CEEI utility). The y-axis value reflects the
percentage of envy comparisons in the bin in which the subject at least weakly preferred another subject’s schedule
to their own. A separate quadratic fit is shown for each mechanism.




                                                                 67
   Three results are apparent from Figure A2. First, as the utility from the other schedule
decreases (as a percentage of a subject’s A-CEEI schedule utility), the likelihood that the
subject experiences envy falls. In the bin with the 10% highest other schedule utility on
the far right of the figure, envy occurs roughly 40% of the time. As the utility from the
other schedule decreases (moving left along the figure), envy rates fall in both mechanisms.
Second, the data suggest a leveling off of envy rates near 10% (i.e., slightly below 10% for
A-CEEI and slightly above 10% for the Auction). This result suggests that as the utility
of the other subject’s schedule falls to 50% of the subject’s A-CEEI utility, the rate of
envy does not go to zero (i.e., it remains positive). Third, the envy rate remains higher in
the Auction than in A-CEEI, even as the other schedule’s utility decreases to 50% of the
subject’s A-CEEI utility.
   These three results allow us to assess our assumption and how it may affect our envy
estimates. The first result, that envy is decreasing in the utility of the other schedule, is
consistent with the underlying intuition of the assumption. The second result, however,
suggests that the assumption does not strictly hold — we would likely have observed at
least some envy if we had shown subjects binary comparisons that included schedules that
delivered less than 50% of the subject’s A-CEEI utility. Nevertheless, the third result
suggests that our assumption likely works against us finding that A-CEEI generates less
envy than the Auction, since showing subjects additional schedules with lower utility would
likely generate higher rates of envy in the Auction than in A-CEEI.

H      Additional Efficiency Analyses Based on Reported Pref-
       erences
As raised in Section 2.5, the reported preference data allows us to analyze additional mea-
sures of ex-ante social welfare and ex-post Pareto efficiency. These results, rather than
speaking to our main question of whether agents can report their preferences accurately
enough to realize the theoretical benefits of A-CEEI, instead explore how A-CEEI com-
pares to the Ausction under the assumption of perfect preference reporting. These analyses
can be interpreted as providing a further sense of magnitudes for the upper bound on the
performance of A-CEEI relative to the Auction.
    First, we can look directly at the differences in utility between the schedules a subject
received from the two mechanisms. For each subject, we calculate ln(utility from A-CEEI)
– ln(utility from Auction), where “utility from A-CEEI” is the cardinal utility generated by
the schedule the subject received under A-CEEI and “utility from Auction” is the cardinal
utility generated by the schedule the subject received under the Auction. A histogram
of these differences for the 114 subjects who get different utility from their two realized
schedules is shown below as Figure A3.
    The bulk of the mass of the histogram is to the right of 0 in Figure A3, a visual
confirmation of the fact that, based on reported preferences, 69% (79/114, see Cell C of

Notes: Figure A3 shows a histogram of the difference in ln(utility from A-CEEI) – ln(utility from Auction). The
graph excludes the 18 subjects who got the same utility from both schedules. One observation had difference in
ln(utility) more negative than -1 and is included in the furthest left bar of the histogram.

Notes: Figure A4 plots the CDF of cardinal utility based on subjects’ reported preferences for both the Auction and
A-CEEI. Three utilities (two in the Auction and one in A-CEEI) are above 2,000 and have been Winsorized at 621,
the next-highest utility value (roughly the 99th percentile).



Table 2) of subjects who get different utility from their two realized schedules prefer their
A-CEEI schedule to their Auction schedule. Moreover, the winners win more than the
losers lose; 37 students have at least a 20% utility increase when comparing the Auction
to A-CEEI, whereas only six students have at least a 20% utility decrease when comparing
the Auction to A-CEEI.
       Second, we can compare the distribution of utilities from realized schedules coming from
each mechanism. Figure A4 plots these distributions for the same 114 subjects analyzed in
Figure A3. The distribution of utilities under A-CEEI second-order stochastically dominates
the distribution under the Auction. This implies that a utilitarian social planner prefers the
distribution of outcomes under A-CEEI to that under the Auction, so long as the planner
has a weak preference for equality (the social welfare analogue of risk-aversion). However,
the right tail of outcomes from the Auction generates higher utilities than the right tail
of outcomes from A-CEEI. This arises since some people “win” the Auction, achieving
schedules that are quite desirable and unattainable under A-CEEI. Consequently, we do
not obtain first-order stochastic dominance.
       Third, we examine ex-post Pareto efficiency. We formulate an integer program that
solves for the maximum number of Pareto-improving trades in each session given subjects’
reported preferences and the initial allocation arrived at in the experiment.55 The theory

       We restrict attention to trades in which each subject in the trade gives and gets a single course seat. A

of A-CEEI shows that it is approximately ex-post Pareto efficient. However, there may
be Pareto-improving trades because of the small amount of market-clearing error that is
sometimes necessary to run the mechanism.56 The Auction is not Pareto efficient even
approximately (see Sönmez and Ünver 2010). Table A4 reports the results of this exercise.
As predicted by the theory, there is substantially less scope for Pareto-improving trades
under A-CEEI than under the Auction.
subject may engage in an unlimited number of trades, and a trade may involve arbitrarily many subjects.
An additional fictitious player called the “registrar” holds all unused capacity and has zero utility from each
course.
  56
     Budish (2011) shows that there need not exist prices that exactly clear the market, but guarantees
existence of prices that clear the market to within a small amount of approximation error. See Reny (2017)
for a recent generalization. In the theory, error is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of excess
demand errors (too many students assigned to a class) and excess supply errors (empty seats in a positively
priced class). The Wharton Committee viewed excess demand errors as more costly than excess supply errors
and tuned the A-CEEI software accordingly for the experiment. Over the eight sessions, there were 10 total
seats of excess supply (median: one seat per session) and two total seats of excess demand (median: zero
seats per session). The Pareto-improving trades exercise reported in the text treats the registrar as owning
the 10 seats of excess supply and ignores the two seats of excess demand. In the practical implementation
of A-CEEI at Wharton, we modified the mechanism in a small way to entirely prevent excess demand errors
that cause violations of strict capacity constraints (e.g., due to fire codes). See Budish et al. (2017).

I    Robustness of Contradiction Analysis
To show the robustness of our contradiction analysis we replicate the results on the causes
of contradictions presented in Table 3 of Section 4, providing three types of robustness tests.
We include one table for each set of tests.
    First, Table A5 shows the same specifications as Table 3 but also includes a dummy
for each subject, to control for potential differences in preference reporting ability across
subjects. Given the Probit specification, this analysis effectively drops subjects who never
experience a contradiction, narrowing our focus to the 1336 binary comparisons made by
subjects who have at least one contradiction. In addition, we do not run the analysis based
on High GPA since that variable relies on between-subject varation and does not vary within
subject. We again report marginal effects so that the coefficients can be interpreted as the
change in probability of a contradiction, and we cluster at the subject level. Compared to
Table 3, coefficients do not change much.
    Second, Table A6 shows the same specifications as Table 3 but includes additional
controls. In particular, it includes a dummy variable for the order in which the binary
comparison appeared, a dummy for the type of binary comparison (i.e., whether it was an
envy comparison, etc.) and a dummy for each session. We again report marginal effects so
that the coefficients can be interpreted as the change in probability of a contradiction and

J         Analysis of Survey Data
After subjects completed using each individual mechanism, we asked them to report their
level of agreement, on a seven-point Likert scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree,
with 12 relatively subjective statements such as “The way courses are allocated through this
course allocation system is fair” (Q1) and “I like this course allocation system” (Q7). After
the completion of both mechanisms we asked subjects three additional questions allowing
them to report which system they preferred (Q13), which they thought others would prefer
(Q14) and in which system they liked their schedule better (Q15). Last, we provided subjects
with the opportunity to provide anonymous free-response comments. The complete list of
questions as well as mean responses are provided in Table A8.
         We organize our discussion of the survey results into three topics: overall satisfaction,
strategic simplicity and transparency. In each of the following three subsections, we discuss
the questions associated with that topic. Our grouping of questions into topics is relatively
consistent with groupings based on a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the survey
questions, as described in Appendix K.


Overall Student Satisfaction

Many of the survey questions aimed at assessing students’ overall satisfaction with the two
mechanisms. These included questions Q1 (“system is fair”), Q4 (“best outcome I could
hope for”), Q5 (“satisfied”), Q6 (“enjoyed”), Q7 (“like”), Q8 (“fellow students will like”),
Q13 (“prefer”), Q14 (“fellow students would prefer”) and Q15 (“better schedule”).57
         Of these, only two questions yielded statistically significant differences and these were
only marginally statistically significant. While these two questions (Q6 and Q7) favored
A-CEEI, several of the other questions directionally favor the Auction.


Strategic Simplicity

By far the largest differences between A-CEEI and the Auction concerned two questions
about strategic play: “I had to think strategically about what other students would do in
this course allocation system” (Q11) and “Someone with perfect knowledge of the historical
supply and demand for courses could have had an advantage over me in this system” (Q12).
Another question that is perhaps related to strategic simplicity, “This course allocation
system is simple” (Q10), also elicited a large difference between the two mechanisms.58
    57
      We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) of the survey data, reported in Appendix K. The
first principal component’s largest coefficients were all of the questions we interpreted as having to do with
overall satisfaction, as well as Q2 and Q9, which have to do with ease of use.
   58
      In the PCA referenced in the previous footnote, the largest magnitudes in the second principal component
were Q3, Q10, Q11 and Q12, and the largest in the third principal component were Q11 and Q12.

                                                 Panel C: Free Response
Please use this page to write any additional comments about your experience during this session. These are anonymous
comments, so please do not include your name.

Notes: For Panel A, 1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree and the mean difference is the mean of the Auction
responses subtracted from the mean of the A-CEEI responses. The p-values for the mean difference column are from
Wilcoxon sign-rank tests of whether the differences are symmetrica around zero. For Panel B, 1 = Strongly Prefer the
Auction, 7 = Strongly Prefer A-CEEI. Unlike in Panel A, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in Panel B tests whether the
responses are symmetric around 4.00, the midpoint of the Likert response scale. Significance is denoted with stars:
*** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1.



     These results suggest that subjects broadly understood the claim made in the experi-
mental instructions that the A-CEEI mechanism did not require strategizing. One might be
somewhat surprised that the difference between A-CEEI and the Auction on these measures


                                                               76
is not even larger. A potential explanation is that at least some of our subjects were reluc-
tant to accept, or did not understand, that the A-CEEI mechanism was not “gameable” like
the Auction (cf. Hassidim, Romm and Shorrer 2016, Li 2017, Rees-Jones 2018, Rees-Jones
and Skowronek 2018).


Transparency

The two questions on the survey on which A-CEEI performed significantly worse than the
Auction were “I understand how this course allocation system works” (Q3) and “I felt like
I had control over my schedule in this course allocation system” (Q9).
       Our interpretation of these results, in conjunction with some of the free-response com-
ments, is that some subjects felt that A-CEEI was a “black box”, i.e., non-transparent.59


Gender

In response to all 12 of our survey questions about the Auction, the average response for
women indicated that they were (at least directionally) less satisfied than men with the
Auction. Six of the 12 questions (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q7, Q9, Q11) displayed significant gender
differences (t-tests with p < 0.1). Compared to men, women statistically significantly liked
the Auction less (Q7, p = 0.021), thought it was less fair (Q1, p = 0.087), found it less easy
to use (Q2, p = 0.065), understood it less well (Q3, p < 0.01), felt less control over the
outcome (Q9, p = 0.057) and had to think more strategically to use it (Q11, p = 0.032).
In contrast, there was no systematic gender preference for A-CEEI. Women were at least
directionally more satisfied than men with A-CEEI in five of the questions, and men were at
least directionally more satisfied than women in seven of the questions. Only two questions
displayed statistically significant gender differences, and they went in opposite directions.
Women understood A-CEEI less well than men (Q3, p = 0.070), but men said they had to
think more strategically to use it (Q11, p = 0.061).60
  59
     In the free responses, one subject wrote: “I like the idea of getting the best schedule I could afford, but
didn’t like feeling like I wasn’t in control. I would feel helpless if I got a schedule that wasn’t close to what
I preferred.” Another wrote: “The course matching system is just a black box where there’s one round and
we rely on the computer to make judgments for us.”
  60
     The lack of significant gender differences when evaluating A-CEEI is not about sample size, which is by
definition the same for the A-CEEI tests as the Auction tests, nor is it about the p-value cutoff of 0.1. Of
the other 10 gender t-tests for A-CEEI, the smallest p-value is 0.276 and six are above 0.5. Meanwhile of
the other six gender t-tests for the Auction, three are p = 0.108, p = 0.113 and p = 0.171, and only one is
above 0.5. As is obvious from the text above, all of the close p-values involve women being directionally less
satisfied than men with the Auction.

 K        Principal Components Analysis of Survey Data
 The following table reports a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the survey data
 reported in the main text as Table A8. The PCA illustrates which survey questions tend
 to move together in subjects’ responses. For questions 1-12 the PCA utilizes the difference
 between the subject’s A-CEEI response and Auction response.

 Notes: Table A9 provides the correlation coefficients for the first eight principal components. The variables included
 in the analysis are the 15 survey questions, treating the first 12 survey questions as difference variables (the A-CEEI
 response less the Auction response) and leaving the last three survey questions as is. Bolded values are greater than
 or equal to .75 times the maximum coefficient magnitude for that column.
