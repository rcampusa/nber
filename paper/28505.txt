                                         ABSTRACT

The economic crisis associated with the emergence of the novel corona virus is unlike standard
recessions. Demand for workers in high contact and inflexible service occupations has declined,
while parental supply of labor has been reduced by lack of access to reliable child care and in-
person schooling options. This has led to a substantial and persistent drop in employment and
labor force participation for women, who are typically less affected by recessions than men. We
examine real time data on employment, unemployment, labor force participation and gross job
flows to document the gendered impact of the pandemic. We also discuss the potential long-term
implications of this crisis, including the role of automation in depressing the recovery of
employment for the worst hit service occupations.

1    Introduction
Recessions in the United States are usually associated with a larger employment drop for men than
for women (Doepke and Tertilt (2016) and Albanesi (2019)). This asymmetry is partly explained
by gender differences in the occupation distribution, with men primarily employed in production
occupations and women concentrated in service occupations, which tend to be less cyclical (Albanesi
and S
    ¸ ahin (2018), Olsson (2019)). Additionally, married women tend to increase their attachment to
the labor force during economic downturns relative to expansions, as a form of household insurance
that reduces the adverse impact of recessions (Ellieroth (2019)). The lower cyclicality of women's
employment has determined a reduction in the cyclical volatility of aggregate employment, as the
share of women in the workforce increased from the 1970s onward (Albanesi (2019)).
    The recession resulting from the emergence of COVID-19 sharply differs from typical recessions.
First, there has been a sizable drop in the demand for services, as a result of both the mitigation
measures enacted to contain the pandemic and consumers' response to the risk of infection (Chetty
et al. (2020)). Given the concentration of women in service occupations, they have been dispro-
portionately hit by the corresponding employment losses. Second, limited availability of in-person
childcare and schooling options have led many mothers to exit the labor force. Thus, both demand
and supply of female employment have been adversely affected during the pandemic, removing an
important source of household insurance and an automatic stabilizer for the aggregate labor market
(Albanesi et al. (2020), Alon et al. (2020b)).
    To highlight the unprecedented behavior of the labor market during the pandemic, we first
briefly review the historical evidence on the cyclicality of employment by gender. We then examine
real time data on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the labor market. First, we classify
occupations by their exposure to the pandemic, based on contact intensity and ability to work
remotely. We show that women are overrepresented in high-contact and inflexible occupations
most affected by the pandemic. While these occupations account for 15% of total employment,
73% of workers employed in these jobs are women. Employment in these occupations dropped
by 40% from February to April 2020 and, by the end of the year, was still 10 percentage points
below pre-pandemic values. We then examine the behavior of employment, unemployment and
non-participation during the pandemic, and the role of the occupation distribution in accounting
for gender differences in the response. We find that, controlling for age and education, employment
was on average 5.3 percentage points lower in the spring (March to May) and the summer (June to
August) relative to February 2020, and 3 percentage points lower in the fall (September to Decem-
ber). Employment fell more for women compared to men at every stage of the pandemic, with the
biggest gender differences estimated for married women with children, whose employment fell by an
additional 4 percentage points compared to men in that category in the spring and summer. Con-
trolling for occupation attenuates the decline in employment and the gender differences by about
one third. Overall, women's employment losses account for 66% of the aggregate decline in employ-


                                                 1
ment in the spring, 63% in the summer and 59% in the fall of 2020, though their pre-pandemic share
of the population was 52%. A very similar pattern holds for unemployment, suggesting that the
occupational distribution accounts only for a small fraction of the incremental employment losses
suffered by women during the pandemic. Non-participation rises by approximately one third of a
percentage point during the pandemic compared to February 2020 and controlling for occupation
reduces this effect to 0.1 percentage points. The gender gap is largest for this variable with women's
share of the rise in non-participation accounting for 70% of the aggregate in the spring, 86% of the
average in the summer, and over 100 percent of the average in the fall, as male non-participation
declines while women's non-participation continues to be higher than in February 2020. Women
with children show the largest gaps in the increase in non-participation compared to men in the
same category, though controlling for occupation, attenuates the gap for single women. Even con-
trolling for occupation, married women with children experience a rise in non-participation that is
approximately 0.5 percentage points larger than married men for the summer and fall.
   To isolate labor demand and labor supply factors, we also examine the behavior of gross job
flows. We find sizable and significant gender gaps in the response of employment to unemployment
(EU) flows and employment to non-participation (EN) flows. Controlling for age and education,
EU rise more than twice as much for women compared to men in the spring and summer. Even
with occupation controls, sizable gender gaps remain in the spring for single parents and married
workers. Turning to EN, which more than doubles during the pandemic, we find sizable gender
gaps pointing to a greater rise for women. These remain after controlling for occupation for single
parents in the spring and summer and for married parents in summer. To interpret our findings
for 2020, we use a similar approach to examine the behavior of employment, non-participation,
EU and EN flows during the great recession. We show that the pattern of gender differences were
completely reversed relative to the 2020 recession. Women's employment fell by substantially less
than men's and their non-participation rose by less, with differences in the occupational distribution
accounting for all the gender gaps for married workers.
   We conclude by discussing some of the continuing impacts of the pandemic. Given its dispro-
portionate impact on women's employment and participation, and the link between gender wage
gaps and non-participation spells for women, one possible implication of the 2020 recession is a
rise in gender wage gaps. Adda, Dustmann, and Stevens (2017) estimate that 13% of the gender
wage gap can be explained by spells of non-participation, which are associated with human capital
depreciation and skill obsolescence. We also consider the prospect for a full recovery of aggregate
employment. Our point of departure is that since the 1990 recession the United States has ex-
perienced "jobless recoveries," that is cyclical rebounds in economic activity where labor market
performance did not keep pace with GDP growth and aggregate demand recovery. One possible
explanation of this phenomenon is that the job losses associated with structural change, such as the
trend decline in manufacturing, and technological advancements leading to the emergence of labor
saving technologies, such as automation, are concentrated in recessions and they are not reversed


                                                  2
as the economy recovers (Groshen and Potter (2003), Jaimovich and Siu (2020)). This scenario is
plausible for the pandemic recession, even more so as the risk of infection is expected to persist for
several years, which may generate additional incentives to adopt labor saving technologies in order
to limit the costs associated with adapting workplaces and practices to this new reality. To explore
this possibility, we consider susceptibility to automation by occupation, using an index created by
Autor and Dorn (2013) as well as our own measure. We find that about half of the inflexible/high-
contact occupations that have experienced the biggest declines in employment during the pandemic
have high susceptibility to automation.
    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the evidence on cyclicality of employment
by gender. Section 3 introduces our occupational classification and documents the distribution of
occupation by gender and exposure to COVID-19. Section 4 examines real time data on the impact
of the pandemic recession on employment, unemployment, non-participation and gross job flows
for men and women, and compares it to the great recession. Section 5 discusses the continuing
impacts.


2     Employment by Gender in Typical Recessions
We briefly review the evidence on the cyclicality of employment by gender in typical recessions. We
use yearly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 1976 and 2019. The sample
includes workers of age from 25 to 54, armed force excluded. We focus on the employment to
population ratio by gender, marital status and by presence of children younger than 12 years old.
     C denote the cyclical component of the logarithm of real GDP per capita in year t, and ei,C
Let yt                                                                                       t
the cyclical component of the logarithm of the employment to population ratio for group i, where
the groups vary by gender, marital status and the presence of children. The cyclical components
are extracted with a Hodrick-Prescott filter with smoothing parameter  = 6.5 (Ravn and Uhlig
(2002)). We estimate:
                                                     ei,C
                                                      t
                                                             C
                                                          = yt +        t                                                   (1)

                                           ^i,C
and then compute the standard deviation of e t
                                                  ^ C over the sample period and take its ratio

                              C . The variable e
to the standard deviation of yt                  t  captures the component of employment to
population ratio for group i that is associated to cyclical variations in GDP, and its standard
deviation is a measure of the cyclicality of this variable. The results are reported in Table 1.

                                                               3
   Consistent with Doepke and Tertilt (2016) and Albanesi (2019), we find that female employ-
ment is less cyclical than male employment. The standard deviation of the cyclical component of
the employment to population ratio is 66% of the standard deviation of GDP for men and 46%
for women. The differences are larger for single individuals than for married, with the standard
deviation for married men equal to 51% of the standard deviation of GDP and the standard devi-
ation of married women equal to 42%, while the corresponding values for single men and women
are respectively 104% and 52%. The differences in cyclicality by marital status likely stems from
differences in age and educational attainment, as single individuals are more likely to be young and
less skilled, and these categories of workers are more business cycle sensitive (Mincer (1991), Shimer
(1998)). We also consider how exposure to business cycles varies with the presence of children of
age less than 12 years old. We find that both for single and married individuals, those without
children display lower cyclicality than those with children, and that gender gaps in cyclicality are
smallest for individuals with children compared to those without, conditional on marital status.
Individuals married without children display the lowest cyclicality, with the standard deviation
of their employment to population ratio equal to 61% of the standard deviation of GDP for men
and 34% for women in this group. At the other extreme, single individuals with children display
the highest cyclical volatility in employment, with the standard deviation of their employment to
population ratio equal to 174% of the standard deviation of GDP for men, and 99% for women.
Single parents are the demographic group most exposed to standard business cycle risk. Single
fathers's exposure is 3 times as large as for married fathers, while single mothers' exposure is twice
as large as for married mothers. Again, this difference may be related to differences in educational
attainment across single and married parents (Taylor (2010)).
   There are two main factors that account for the lower cyclicality of female employment. The
first is occupation and industry distribution and the second the cyclical properties of labor supply.
Albanesi and S
             ¸ ahin (2018) show that women are more likely to be employed in service providing
industries and service occupations, which tend to be less cyclical compared to goods producing
industries and production occupations that employ a larger share of men. They show that this
accounts for most of the difference in the loss in employment during recessions since 1990. The
occupation and industry distribution by gender does not vary by marital status (Cortes and Pan
(2018)) and can explain why both for single and married workers employment is less cyclical for
women.
   The second factor leading to lower cyclicality of female employment applies exclusively to mar-
ried individuals, and is related to household insurance via labor supply, also known as the "added
worker effect." Since the first study isolating this mechanism Lundberg (1985), a variety of con-
tributions have confirmed the importance of this channel. Cullen and Gruber (2000) show that
unemployment insurance benefits crowd out the spousal increase in labor supply associated with a
spell of unemployment, Stephens (2002) estimates the added worker effect in response to job dis-
placement. Parker and Skoufias (2004) examine data from Mexico and find that there is a sizable


                                                  4
added worker effect in economic downturns, Juhn and Potter (2007) examine the evolution over
time of the added worker effect in the United States. Shore (2010) examines the risk sharing of
marriage over the business cycle and finds that husbands' and wives' incomes are less positively cor-
related in recessions. Additionally, in cohorts of couples who had been married through relatively
bad times, high-earning husbands tend to be married to low-earning wives and vice versa, with a
large and statistically significant effect. Blundell, Pistaferri, and Saporta-Eksten (2016) examine
the link between wage and consumption inequality using a structurally estimated life-cycle model
incorporating consumption and family labor supply decisions, and find a sizable role for household
insurance via wives' labor supply.
    Albanesi (2019) shows that this channel renders women's labor supply countercyclical, and
Ellieroth (2019) specifically shows that married women are less likely to leave the labor force and
are more attached to employment in recessions. She shows that this form of precautionary labor
supply in response to the higher threat of job loss experienced by their husband in recessions
accounts for 30% of married women's low cyclicality of employment.1
    The impact of children on married women's labor supply over the business cycle has not so far
been studied by this literature, but the lower cyclicality of employment for both single and married
workers without children compared to those with children may reflect lower ability to adjust labor
supply in response to business cycle variation on part of married individuals of both genders.


3     Exposure to the COVID-19 Recession by Occupation
To determine exposure to the COVID-19 recession, we classify occupations along two dimensions
based on their flexibility and contact intensity. The distinction between flexible and inflexible
occupations is made according to whether the occupation can be carried out remotely. Flexible
occupations include occupations that allow their employees to work remotely, whereas inflexible
occupations involve outdoor activities or require operating on site equipment. The distinction
between high-contact and low-contact occupations is based on workers' physical proximity to cus-
tomers or co-workers while on the job. We then document the distribution by gender across these
occupations.
    We create the measures of flexibility and contact intensity using data from the Occupational
Information Network (O*NET). The O*NET survey started in 1998 and updated on an irregular
basis. We use the most recent version published in February 2020. O*NET asks a random sample
   1
     A number of recent papers develop quantitative models capturing the implications for consumption smoothing
and welfare. See Park et al. (2020) show that wives increase their labor supply significantly in response to increases
in the variance of husbands' permanent wage shocks, reducing the welfare cost of increased earnings risk since the
early 1970s. Ortigueira and Siassi (2013) examine the role of the family as a risk sharing institution in an economy
with idiosyncratic labor income and unemployment risk. Mankart and Oikonomou (2017) build a theory of joint
household search in a frictional labor market to argue that the acyclicality of the labor force is due to the added
worker effect. Wu and Krueger (2021) calibrated life-cycle two-earner household model with endogenous labor supply
can rationalize the extent of consumption insurance against shocks to male and female wages.



                                                          5
of U.S. workers in each occupation various questions about typical work activities required in their
occupations. To measure occupations' flexibility, we consider fifteen questions, reported in the
Online Appendix, designed to elicit whether workers are performing tasks that can be executed
remotely, or whether they are bound to their work location by the need to operate or inspect
equipment. Respondents answer each question on an ordinal scale of one to five, and we take the
average across respondents' answers. To compute the contact intensity measure, we use a question
asking about physical proximity to other people while working. Again, respondents answer on
an ordinal scale of one to five with each number assigned with a specific example describing the
distance to other people. The Online Appendix presents the measures of flexibility and contact
intensity by occupations' major groups.
     We classify occupations as inflexible if their inflexibility score is above the median and as
flexible otherwise. Similarly, we consider the occupation to be high-contact occupation if an average
respondent says that she works at arm's length or closer to other people, which is closer than safe
social distancing distance of 6 feet. Based on these two criteria, we aggregate occupation groups into
four categories: flexible and high-contact, flexible and low-contact, inflexible and high-contact, or
inflexible and low-contact. This grouping is reported in Table 2.2 Flexible/high-contact occupation
comprise mainly education jobs, while flexible/low-contact occupations comprise managerial and
professional occupations. Inflexible/high-contact occupations are dominated by healthcare and
services, both personal and hospitality. Finally, the inflexible/low-contact category comprises most
production, protection and transportation occupations, as well as construction and farming.

occupations show the largest decline in employment, reaching a trough of -38% in April, and only
recovering to -12% by September, with further declines by the end of the year. Inflexible/low-
contact occupations are the second worst hit, with a decline in employment of close to 30% in
April, though employment for these occupations is only 5% lower than one year prior by the fall.
Employment in flexible/high-contact occupations dropped to a low of -17% relative to one year prior
in April but recovered rapidly, and has remained 2-8% lower than one year prior in the summer and
fall. Finally, flexible/low-contact occupations were the least impacted, with a drop in employment
of -9% relative to one year prior in April, and a recovery to 2-4% lower relative to one year prior
from June onward. Inflexible/high-contact and inflexible/low-contact occupations comprise most
workers deemed essential, even if this designation varies by state (Blau, Koebe, and Meyerhofer
(2020)). Yet, these two categories experience the biggest decline in employment.

    Table 3 reports the distribution of workers by gender across occupations for four categories de-
fined in Table 2. The inflexible/high-contact occupations are the most vulnerable to the COVID-19
shock and are dominated by female workers. We find that 23% of female workers are employed
in occupations that are inflexible/high-contact, while only 7% of men work in these occupations,
corresponding to a female share of employment in these occupations of 73%. Flexible/high-contact
occupations also exhibit a high female share at 74%. Male workers are disproportionately rep-

     Flexible/high-contact occupations, which primarily include teaching occupations, are the only category displaying
seasonable variation. Results are very similar for all categories to considering log variations from February 2020.

workers are employed in these occupations, with a female share of employment of only 17% in this

employment, specifically 57% of female employment and 50% of male employment, with a female
share of 49%.

    Figure 2 displays the log variation in the employment to population ratio by occupation and
gender. For flexible/low-contact occupations, which account for the biggest share of employment,
the drop in employment in the spring was similar for men and women, though female employ-
ment remained approximately 1 percentage point lower in the summer and fall compared to men.
For flexible/high-contact occupations, employment for women fell by approximately 5 percentage
points more in April and in the fall compared to men, though the drop in employment for women
was smaller than for men in the summer. For the inflexible occupational categories, there are some
notable differences. For inflexible/high-contact occupations, men's employment fell by 8 percentage
points more in April compared to women. Though it recovered to approximately 18% lower relative
to one year prior by July, it stayed at that level or lower through the fall. By contrast for women,
employment was only 13% lower relative to one year prior by August, and it has remained mostly
stable through the fall. For inflexible/low-contact occupations the pattern is reversed. Women's
employment dropped to 42% relative to one year prior in April and only 25% for men. Men's em-
ployment recovered slowly but steadily, reaching a level 10% lower than 1 year prior by September.
Women's employment also eventually recovered to that level, though there was a period of further
reduction in early fall.
    Two patterns emerge from these results. First, for flexible/low-contact occupations, the recovery
in employment was smaller for women. Though the difference by gender is small, it is still notable
as this category accounts for the largest share of female employment, and therefore affects a large
segment of the female workforce. The second pattern is that in inflexible occupations, workers with
the lowest representation by gender lost more jobs. This may be due to negative selection of male
workers into female dominated inflexible/high-contact occupations and of female workers into the
male dominated inflexible/low-contact occupations. Additionally, essential frontline workers are
concentrated in inflexible/low-contact occupations and since, as documented in Blau, Koebe, and
Meyerhofer (2020), they are more likely to be men, this may contribute to the greater decline of
employment for women in this category.

   The Online Appendix documents the cyclical behavior of employment for the occupational cat-
egories we define by gender and marital status. Flexible/low-contact occupations are the least
cyclical for all workers, followed by inflexible/high-contact occupations, whereas inflexible/low-
contact occupations display the highest cyclicality. Albanesi et al. (2020) show that this variation
is driven by differences in the skill distribution, with workers without a college degree dispropor-
tionately represented in inflexible/low-contact occupations. Additionally, workers in high-contact
occupations tend to be employed in service providing industries, which are less cyclical than goods
producing industries. However, within occupations large differences remain by gender and marital
status, reflecting the aggregate pattern document in Table 1.
   The behavior of employment over the course of the pandemic is driven by a combination of
demand and supply factors that likely differ by gender and are influenced by age and education, in
addition to the presence of children. To disentangle these effects, we turn to a labor flow approach
to employment dynamics and use regressions to control for age and education.

4        Labor Market Impact of the Covid-19 Recession
To examine the dynamics of employment over the course of 2020, we estimate the following regres-
sion:

                                  3
                     yi,t =  +          × I ( ) + I i (f ) + I i (m) + I i (c) + Xt
                                                                                  i
                                                                                    +      i,t                (2)
                                  =1

where i indexes an individual, t  2 is a month in 2020,  is an indicator variable for one of three
phases of the pandemic, with  = 1 corresponding to March to May,  = 2 corresponding to June
to August and  = 3 corresponding to September to December. The variable I i (f ) is a dummy for
gender, equal to 1 for female, I i (m) is a dummy for marital status, equal to 1 for married, and I i (c)
                                                                                  i include a set
is a dummy for children under the age of 12 present, equal to 1 if they are, and Xt
of controls for age, educational attainment and, in some specifications, occupation, as categorized
in Section 3. Additionally, we include a full set of interactions between the phase effects and the
gender, marital status and presence of children dummies, and the age, education and occupation
controls. The coefficients  estimate the effect of each phase of the pandemic on the dependent
variable. The coefficients on the interactions estimate the differential impact of the pandemic on
individuals by gender, marital status and presence of children in each phase of the pandemic. The
estimated value of  will be the average value of the dependent variable for male, single, childless
individuals in February 2020.
        We consider three main outcomes: employment, unemployment, and non-participation. Addi-
tionally, we estimate this specification for employment to unemployment (EU) and unemployment
to employment (UE) flows to isolate labor demand, and employment to non-participation (EN),
unemployment to non-participation (UN) flows, to isolate labor supply effects.4 The definition
of labor market status follows the CPS except that those who report being employed but absent
from work for no particular reasons are classified as unemployed. The stock variables are based on
the repeated cross-sectional data. To construct the labor status transitions, we utilize the panel
structure of the CPS. Additional details are reported in the Online Appendix.
        We begin with employment, unemployment and non-participation. Table 4 reports the average
change in these variables in each phase of the pandemic relative to February 2020, calculated
from the change for each demographic group weighted by the corresponding population shares
for February 2020. We report these estimates for the specification with and without occupation
controls. We also report the share of the change accounted for by women for each specification.
The rest of the table reports the estimated change relative to February 2020 in the three phases
for the pandemic for each demographic group, for the specification with occupational controls.
        Employment declined on average by 5.3% in spring, 5.1% in summer and 2.7% in the fall without

    Lee, Park, and Shin (2021) estimate a similar specification focussing only on April 2020 and November 2020 and
they do not examine labor flows.

The table reports selected estimates from specification 2 for employment, unemployment and non-participation. The full set
of estimates are reported in the Online Appendix. Phases of the pandemic correspond to March to May for Spring, June
to August for Summer, September to December for Fall. The average effect is obtained by summing the contribution of each
demographic group, obtained by multiplying the corresponding estimated effect for each phase of the pandemic with the group's
population share in February 2020. The average effect is reported for the specification without and with occupational controls.
In each case, "Share women" is the sum of all female contributions divided by the average effect for the specification with
occupation controls. The effects by demographic groups are reported for the specification with occupational controls. Asterisks
denote significance levels, * for 10%, ** for 5% and *** for 1%. Population shares In February 2020 are reported in the Online
Appendix. All values in percentage. Source: Authors' calculations based on CPS.



occupation controls, and by 3.6%, 3.3% and 2.8% controlling for occupations. This suggests that
the occupational distribution can account for over a third of the decline in employment in spring and
summer. The share of this change accounted by women is similar with and without occupational
controls, ranging from 63 to 66% in the spring and summer and equal to 59% in the fall, much
larger than women's share in the population in February 2020, which was 52%. Figure 3, panels
(a) and (b) displays the gender differences in the changes in employment in the three phases of
the pandemic by demographic group, with and without occupation controls. The figure clearly
shows that women in all demographic groups suffer larger losses in employment compared to men
at every stage of the pandemic, with the biggest gender differences estimated for married women
with children, whose employment falls by an additional 4 percentage points compared to men in
that category in the spring and summer. For married women without children, employment falls by
3 percentage points more than for men in that category over the same time period. Among single
parents, women's employment falls by 2.5 percentage points more than men's in summer, and among
single individuals without children, women's employment losses are 2 percentage points larger than
men's in spring and 1 percentage point larger in summer. Controlling for occupations attenuates
the gender differences in employment losses by about one third in spring and summer. For fall,
controlling for occupation reduces the gender gaps in employment losses for married workers, though


                                                               11
it magnifies these gaps for single workers. For single women with children there is a significantly
larger drop in employment relative to comparable men only in the fall. These estimates suggest
that for single mothers and married women, the occupation distribution plays a limited role in
accounting for the gender gaps in the drop in employment.

               We find a very similar pattern for unemployment, both in terms of the average response, the
contribution of occupation controls and for the gender wage gaps by demographic group. Figure 8 in
the Online Appendix displays the gender differences in the change in unemployment by demographic
group with and without occupation controls.

and by 0.2 percentage points in the fall without controlling for occupation, and by 0.1 percent-
age points in spring, summer and fall with occupation controls, suggesting that the occupational
distribution accounts for one half to two thirds this rise during the pandemic. Without occupa-
tion controls, women's share of the rise in non-participation ranges from 73% in spring to 78%
in the fall. Controlling for occupation, women account for 70% of the rise in non-participation
in the spring, 86% in the summer and 179% in the fall, as male non-participation declines over
that time period, whereas it rises substantially for women. Figure 3, panels (c) and (d), displays
the gender differences by demographic group for the three phases for the pandemic. Without con-
trolling for occupation, gender differences are particularly large and significant for single parents,
among whom women's non-participation rises by nearly 1 percentage point more than men's in the
spring and summer. They are also sizable for married parents, among whom women experience
a rise in non-participation of approximately 0.5 percentage points more than men in summer and
fall. Controlling for occupation reduces the gender gap substantially in the spring and summer,
but not in the fall, when single women without children and married women with children show
a rise in non-participation that is approximately 0.5 percentage points higher than comparable
men. This suggests that the occupation distribution is a more important factor in the response of
non-participation for single mothers than it is for married mothers.
    To explore the potential role of labor demand and supply factors during the pandemic, we
also examine gross labor market flows. To capture the impact of demand factors, we consider the
employment to unemployment flow (EU) and the unemployment to employment flow (UE). The
EU flow is commonly interpreted as a measure of job destruction and usually rises dramatically at
the start of recessions. The UE flow measures the rate at which the unemployed find jobs, and it
tends to fall dramatically in recessions and rise during recoveries. To capture the impact of labor
supply factors, we consider the employment to non-participation flow (EN) and the unemployment
to participation flow (UN). The first captures voluntarily quits, while the second is often interpreted
as a key measure of labor market attachment during recessions.5 The estimates of the effect of the
pandemic on these flows by demographic group are reported in Table 5.6
    We find that EU rises by 3 percentage points in spring, 2 percentage points in summer and
0.5 percentage points in fall, and controlling for occupations lowers these values by a third in the
spring and summer, while raises the value for fall to 0.8. These are large changes, as on average
monthly EU flows range between 1.5-2 percentage points for men and 1-1.5 percentage points for
   5
     See Krusell et al. (2017) for a detailed documentation of the cyclical properties of gross job flows in the United
States.

     The possibility of classification error is an important concern when analyzing gross job flows. Earlier research has
found these errors to be sizable for transitions between unemployment and non-participation. A standard approach
to correct this issue is to adjust the gross flows data using Abowd and Zellner (1985) estimates of misclassification
probabilities based on resolved labor force status in CPS reinterview surveys, as in Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2015).
However, given the short time span of our data and the exceptional nature of the labor markets transitions during the
pandemic, it is questionable that those corrections accurately capture the extent of misclassification for our sample.
For that reason, we do not apply any adjustment.

The table reports selected estimates from specification 2 for labor flows EU, UE, EN, UN. The full set of estimates are reported in
the Online Appendix. Phases of the pandemic correspond to March to May for Spring, June to August for Summer, September
to December for Fall. The average effect is obtained by summing the contribution of each demographic group, obtained by
multiplying the corresponding estimated effect for each phase of the pandemic with the group's population share in February
2020. The average effect is reported for the specification without and with occupational controls. In each case, "Share women"
is the sum of all female contributions divided by the average effect for the specification with occupation controls. The effects
by demographic groups are reported for the specification with occupational controls. Asterisks denote significance levels, *
for 10%, ** for 5% and *** for 1%. Population shares In February 2020 are reported in the Online Appendix. All values in

women in 1976-2007 (see Albanesi and S
                                     ¸ ahin (2018)). Women contribute to 67% of this rise in the
spring, 59% in the summer and 57% in the fall, controlling for occupations, which is lower than
women's share without occupation controls in spring and summer, suggesting that the occupation
distribution substantially contributes to explaining gender differences in EU flows over that period.
This can be seen in Figure 4, which displays the gender gaps by demographic groups with and
without occupation controls. These gaps are substantial in spring and summer for all demographic
groups, ranging from 1 percentage point for single without children to 2.2 percentage points for
married with children in spring, and ranging from 0.5 percentage points for single without children
to 1.5 percentage points for single with children in summer. Controlling for occupations mostly
eliminates the gender differences in summer and fall, though they remain significant and sizable for
spring, at approximately 1.25 percentage points for married workers and 2 percentage points for
workers who are single with children. These results suggest married women and single women with
children were disproportionately impacted by job losses in the spring, beyond the effects associated
with their occupation distribution.
     Turning to UE flows, they show a substantial decline of 0.3 percentage points in spring, 0.5
percentage points in summer and 0.8 percentage points in fall, suggesting that the labor market
has not yet reached a recovery phase. Occupational controls reduce the magnitude of the effect of the
pandemic in summer and fall, though most of the effects by demographic group and corresponding
gender gaps are not statistically significant.

            For the flows into non-participation, we find a substantive rise during the pandemic with a
sizable gender difference. EN flows rose 0.2 percentage points in spring, and by 0.1 percentage
points in summer and fall. This is a very large increase as the average EN flows have averaged
approximately 0.023 for men and 0.035 for women in recent years (Albanesi and S
                                                                              ¸ ahin (2018)).
Controlling for occupation moderates this rise only for the summer. While the contributions to the
rise in EN were similar by sex in the spring, women account for 102% of the increase in EN for the
summer and 67% for the fall controlling for occupation. Married women with children in the fall
and single women without children in the summer and single men without children in the spring
display the largest increases to the rise in EN. By contrast EN falls of single men with children in
all phases of the pandemic, and for married men with children in the summer. As shown in Figure
5, controlling for occupations, the gender differences in the change in EN are only significant for
single women with children in the spring and summer, for whom EN rises by 0.7 percentage points
more than comparable men, and married women with children in the summer, for whom EN rises
by 0.2 percentage points more than for comparable men. Turning to UN flows, we find that there is
an increase of 0.1 percentage points during the pandemic. This rise is disproportionately accounted
for by women, controlling for occupation, particularly in the spring and summer, however we do
not find significant gender differences by demographic group.
            The disproportionate rise in EN flows for women during the pandemic is striking, as it follows
several decades of continued convergence in EN flows across genders (Albanesi and S
                                                                                  ¸ ahin (2018)).
Historically, women have exhibited higher EN flows than men, with most of the difference accounted
for by men's higher rate of job to job transition (EE flows), with the gap mostly accounted for by

women's tendency to exit the labor force temporarily after the birth of a child (Royalty (1998)).
However, as women's participation has grown, there has been a decline in their EN transition rates.
Additionally, as shown in Ellieroth (2019), women's EN flow rate tends to fall in recessions. We
do not find significant gender differences in the behavior of UN flows during the pandemic It bears
noting that historically UN flows have been higher for women than for men. However, women's
increased labor force attachment has determined a converge (Albanesi and S
                                                                         ¸ ahin (2018)) that has
considerably contributed to increasing the average duration of unemployment in the United States
since the early 1990s (Abraham and Shimer (2001)).

4.1                                   Comparison to the Great Recession
To understand how the pandemic recession differs from a standard business cycle, we replicate
the previous analysis for the great recession. We estimate a version of equation 2, where the pre-
recession phase corresponds to March 2007 to November 2007, and we consider 3 phases of the
subsequent business cycle. The Recession phase, December 2007 to June 2009, which corresponds
to the NBER recession dates, the Recovery 1 phase, July 2009 to December 2010, and the Recovery
2 phase, January 2011 to July 2012. We split the recovery in two phases, as most labor market
indicators substantially lagged GDP and aggregate demand during the first part of the recovery.
The full regression results are reported in the Online Appendix, Table 6 reports the average effects
on the recession in the three phases and the contribution of women and Figure 7 displays the gender
differences by demographic group for the most salient variables.
            Employment falls 2.5 percentage points on average in the Recession phase, and by 1.7 percentage

                                                                                           16
points in the Recovery 1 phase, and returns to pre-recession levels in the Recovery 2 phase, without
controlling for occupations. The share of employment changes accounted for by women is only
11% in the Recession phase, and rises to 33% in the recovery 1 phase. Adding occupation controls
attenuates the average employment decline in the Recession phase, but increases it substantially
in the two recovery phases, and increases the share of the change in employment accounted for by
women to 43% in the Recession phase, 49% in the Recovery 1 phase and 52% in the Recovery 2
phase. These results suggest that the occupational distribution is a significant factor in women's
smaller losses in employment compared to men. This is confirmed in Figure 6, where panels (a)
and (b) display the gender differences by demographic group for employment, with and without
occupational controls.
   Women's employment losses are sizably smaller than men's for every demographic group in
the specification without occupational controls. Among single workers without children, women's
employment falls by 2 percentage points less than men's in the Recession phase, and 2.5 percent-
age points less in the Recovery 1 phase. Among single parents, women's employment falls by 3
percentage points less than men's in both the Recession and Recovery 1 phase. The gender gaps
for married workers are smaller, with women's employment dropping by 1 percentage point less
than men's in the Recession phase. In the recovery phase, among married workers without chil-
dren, the drop in women's employment is 1.5 percentage points smaller than men's, while it is 1
percentage point smaller for married parents. In the Recovery 2 phase, the gender gap is still siz-
able for single workers without children, with women's employment dropping 1.5 percentage points
less than men's, while gender gaps decline substantially in magnitude for the other demographic
groups. Controlling for occupation eliminates gender gaps for married workers in all phases. For
single workers without children, gender gaps are reduced by about half in all phases. For single
parents, gender gaps also shrink by half in the Recession and Recovery 1 phase, while in during
Recovery 2 women's employment drop is 0.75 percentage points bigger than men's. The pattern
is similar for unemployment and EU flows, suggesting that women perform better than men dur-
ing the great recession and the ensuing recovery. While the occupational distribution accounts
for most of the gender difference in employment and unemployment changes for married workers,
single women retain an advantage compared to single men at the trough of the recession and its
immediate aftermath.
   Turning to non-participation, it rose on average by 0.3 percentage points relative to pre-recession
in the Recession and Recovery 1 phase, and by 0.2 percentage points in the Recovery 2 phase, with-
out controlling for occupation, with women accounting for approximately 85% of this change. How-
ever, once occupation controls are included, average non-participation decreases by 0.1 percentage
points at every stage of the cycle, with women accounting for 74-82% of this change. The bottom
panels in Figure 6 display the gender gaps by demographic groups, with and without occupation
controls. In the specification without occupational controls, men's non-participation rises by more
than women for every demographic group, with the largest gender gaps recorded for single parents.

The table reports selected estimates from specification 2 for employment, unemployment and non-participation. The full set
of estimates are reported in the Online Appendix. Pre-recession corresponds to March 2007 to November 2007. Phases of the
great recession correspond to December 2007 to June 2009 for Recession, July 2009 to December 2010 for Recovery 1, and
January 2011 to July 2012 for Recovery 2. The average effect is obtained by summing the contribution of each demographic
group, obtained by multiplying the corresponding estimated effect for each phase of the pandemic with the group's population
share pre-recession. The average effect is reported for the specification without and with occupational controls. In each case,
"Share women" is the sum of all female contributions divided by the average effect for the specification with occupation controls.
Population shares pre-recession are reported in the Online Appendix. The effects by demographic groups are reported for the
specification with occupational controls. Asterisks denote significance levels, * for 10%, ** for 5% and *** for 1%. All values

In the specification with occupation controls, non-participation declines by more for women than for
men, and gender gaps are most pronounced for single parents and married parents in the Recovery
2 phase. Estimates for EN and UN flows confirm the pattern that prevails for non-participation.

4.2      Discussion
Our analysis suggests that during 2020, women with children experienced a substantial reduction
in labor supply in addition to the losses in employment from the decline in demand for labor in
service occupations most affected by the pandemic. This decline in labor supply was concentrated
among married women in the fall and was likely driven by the increased childcare needs associated
with the disruptions to school activities associated with the pandemic.
     Why did mothers respond to the lack of predictable in person schooling activities in households
where fathers are also present? Likely, gender norms played a role, but assuming that parents
decide on the distribution of child supervision responsibilities in a cooperative fashion, this response
should be driven by differences in the opportunity cost as measured by wages. It is well documented
that in the United States and other advanced economies, there is a substantial child penalty for
mothers that reduces their wages throughout the course of their lifetime (Cortes and Pan (2020)).
The penalty is driven by a combination occupational choices, labor supply on the intensive and
extensive margin, and differences in wages, that begin well before women have children and have an

effect throughout their working lives (Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard (2019) and Adda, Dustmann,
and Stevens (2017)). The mean child penalty can be decomposed into explained effects, such as
differences in mean values of background characteristics like education and race, and unexplained
effects, which include the child penalty and different returns on non-child characteristics for mothers,
compared to non-mothers or men. Cortes and Pan (2020) estimate that the long run child penalty­
three years or more after having the first child­ for US mothers is 39% and they also find that child
related penalties account for two thirds of the overall gender wage gap in the last decade.
    Given the child penalty, most working mothers at the start of the pandemic were likely to be
earning less than their spouses, and for those households the optimal response to the increased
child supervision needs was for mothers to reduce labor supply. This option would be available
to families for whom husbands' earnings are high enough. While this prediction is hard to test
in real time given the unavailability of data on earnings by labor market transition at a monthly
frequency, if this mechanism is at play, we should observe two patterns as the pandemic hits.
First, earnings for husbands whose wives remain in the labor force should fall compared to those
of husbands whose wives do not participate. Second, for two earner households, earnings of wives
who remain employed should rise compared to their husbands. Figure 7 displays evidence that is
broadly consistent with these patterns. The left panel displays husbands' weekly earnings by their
wives' employment status in February 2020 and in the three phases of the pandemic. Compared to
February 2020, earnings for husbands with employed wives fall in comparison to those of husbands
whose wives are out of the labor force. However, the differences in weekly earnings are relatively
small, and revert to pre-pandemic levels by fall. The right panel displays the wife/husband wage
ratio for two earner couples. This ratio increased from 85% in February 2020 to 102% in spring
2020 and remained elevated at 98% in summer, though it dropped to pre-pandemic levels by the
fall. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis the mothers' lower wages can explain their
departure from the workforce in response to the childcare demands driven by the pandemic, but a
deeper analysis is warranted as more data becomes available.
    Of course, the child penalty may have affected the demand for women's labor during the pan-
demic, in addition to their labor supply. Cajner et al. (2020) show that employment losses were
concentrated disproportionately among lower wage workers at the beginning of the pandemic and
Chetty et al. (2020) find that by the fall, lower wage workers' employment was still more than 20%
below pre-pandemic values, with a much larger recovery for higher wage workers. Given that the
child penalty tends to relegate women at the lower end of the wage distribution, it may have also
played a role in their disproportionate loss of employment during the spring.

on women via the likely impact on their relative wages and on the whether the susceptibility to
automation of the occupations most adversely affected by COVID-19 may impede a full recovery
of aggregate employment.

5.1          Gender Wage Gaps
Working mothers have been disproportionately hit by employment losses during the pandemic,
both in terms of labor demand and labor supply. This may have effects well beyond the duration
of the pandemic. The impact on wages and lifetime earnings of mothers who leave the labor
force temporarily to take care of children are substantial. Adda, Dustmann, and Stevens (2017)
estimate that the component of the child penalty associated with "atrophy" during spells of non-
participation, due to human capital depreciation or skill obsolescence, accounts for 13% of the
overall gender wage gap. Additionally, employer investments in human capital and the career
paths offered to women are affected by the expectation of career interruptions (Albanesi and Olivetti
(2009)). After many decades of increasing labor market attachment for women (Goldin (2006)),
the reduction in mother's labor supply associated with the pandemic may reverse the slow progress
made in this area. Alon et al. (2020a) conjecture that the rise in remote work may help women, as
it may increase sharing of child care responsibilities with fathers now working remotely. While this
may be a possibility for some parents, the rise in mothers' non-participation during the pandemic
suggests that in the aggregate this is unlikely to play a large role. In addition, remote work has
grown for most classes of workers during the pandemic, but it has increased considerably more for


                                                     21
women (Bick, Blandin, and Mertens (2020)). Lack of flexibility has long been seen as a barrier to
women's career advancement (Goldin (2014), Cort´
                                               es and Pan (2019)), and increased ability to work
remotely, which is expected to continue after the pandemic, when child care needs are normalized,
may benefit women. However, if it is mostly women who continue to take advantage of remote
work arrangements, they may be stigmatized and miss out on career advancement opportunities,
particularly in highly competitive professional and managerial occupations.

5.2   Employment Recovery
A critical question as we look forward to the end of the pandemic is whether employment will return
to pre-pandemic level and jobs that were lost during the pandemic will be reinstated. While em-
ployment losses during the pandemic were concentrated in occupations and industries that typically
fare well during standard recessions, we can still examine the patterns of labor market recovery in
recent business cycles to gain some perspective. Since the 1990 recession, the US has experienced
"jobless recoveries," that is, even as GDP and aggregate demand rebound from the trough of the cy-
cle, labor market indicators continue to stagnate and employment struggles to attain pre-recession
levels. Two main factors appear to be behind this phenomenon.
   Albanesi (2019) argues that the subdued behavior of employment during recoveries since the
1990s is driven by the flattening of female labor force participation over that period. Recoveries
have always been jobless for men, but as long as female labor force participation was rising, fe-
male employment tended to grow very rapidly in recoveries, leading to faster growth in aggregate
employment. Since female participation stopped trending upwards, the rate of growth of women's
employment during recoveries has been similar to men's, leading to sluggish performance in the
aggregate. Given that women have been more strongly affected by the pandemic and that their
labor force participation has fallen, while it does not usually decline in recessions, if the recovery
from the pandemic is associated with a rebound of female participation to pre-pandemic levels this
may lead to a more energetic and faster recovery in aggregate employment compared to recent
cycles. However, a second explanation for jobless recoveries points in the opposite direction. The
hypothesis is that the slow and incomplete rebound of aggregate employment is due structural
change leading to a permanent decline in manufacturing employment (Groshen and Potter (2003))
and routine jobs (Jaimovich and Siu (2020)). While these phenomena are driven by slow moving
trends in technology, the job losses associated with the resulting restructuring are concentrated in
recessions. As the economy recovers, those jobs are not reinstated and firms meet the rebound in
demand with labor saving new technologies. This phenomenon affects primarily middle skill jobs
which are particularly cyclical (Foote and Ryan (2015)), and is a key mechanism through which
the trend toward job polarization (Acemoglu and Autor (2011)) has affected business cycles.
   While the pandemic has affected service occupations that have been less sensitive to standard
business cycle variation and may seem less amenable to automation, it is useful to examine whether
there is the potential to replace the workers who have been laid off during the pandemic with

                                                 22
technologies. Embracing automation, software and AI to reduce labor intensity, as demand recovers
post-pandemic, has the added advantage of saving employers from the costs of adapting workplaces
and practices to mitigate the ongoing risk of infection that is expected to persist, as long as a
substantial fraction of the world population does not have access to vaccines and remains susceptible
to the coronavirus. To examine the susceptibility to automation by occuption, we use two proxies.
One is Routine Task-Intensity (RTI), an index developed in Autor and Dorn (2013) that calculates
the routine, manual, and abstract task inputs in each occupation based on job task requirements
from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT).7 Higher values of RTI correspond to higher
susceptibility to automation, and we classify occupations with above median RTI as High-RTI
occupations. As an alternative, we also use the question 'How automated is your current job?'
in O*NET. Answers are on the scale of 1 (Not at all automated) to 5 (Completely automated).
To derive an occupation based measure, we compute the average score for each occupation and
classified occupations with score higher than the median as Highly Automatable occupations.

      The share of High-RTI occupations and Highly Automatable occupations in the four occupation
categories we introduced in Section 3 are very similar and are reported in Table 7. We find that
approximately 40-45% of the inflexible/high-contact occupations, the category most affected by the
pandemic, are susceptible to automation. This is only slightly lower than for inflexible/low-contact
occupations, the most exposed to standard recessions, of which approximately 50% are highly sus-
ceptible to automation. The most automatable occupational category is the flexible/low-contact,
as it includes Office and Administrative and Sales and Related occupations, which are cognitive and
routine. The least automatable group of occupations is flexible/high-contact comprised of Educa-
tion, Training, and Library occupations. These findings suggest that even health care and personal
service occupations are susceptible to automation, leaving open the possibility that employment
losses in those occupations may not be fully reversed as the broader economy recovers from the
pandemic.
      Another factor that may prevent the full recovery of employment post-pandemic is the ex-
pected continuation of remote work for many workers in flexible/high contact occupations (Altig
et al. (2020)). The normalization of remote work may displace office time and business travel,
leading to a permanent decline in the demand for building cleaning, security and maintenance ser-

      RTI is defined as the log(routine task input) - log(abstract task input) - log(manual task input).

vices, hospitality services, transportation and other support services (Autor and Reynolds (2020)).
This raises the prospect that the workers employed in these jobs, mainly concentrated in the in-
flexible/high contact and inflexible/low-contact occupations based on our categorization, will not
rebound to pre-pandemic level of employment.


6    Conclusion
The emergence of COVID-19 has been an unprecedented shock to labor markets in the United
States and around the world. Unlike in standard recessions, the adverse impact of the pandemic
on employment, unemployment and labor force participation has mostly hit women, particularly
mothers. Both labor demand factors, such women's disproportionate representation in service
occupations most vulnerable to the pandemic, and labor supply factors, like closures of childcare
centers and in-person schools, contributed to this outcome. While the pandemic may end in the
United States as vaccines become widely available, some of its labor market impacts may be long
lived. The increase in non-participation for women will likely reduce their wages when they re-enter
the workforce. Additionally, many occupations that have suffered from large employment losses
during the pandemic are highly susceptible to automation. This raises the prospect that as the
economy recovers, at least some of the jobs lost may not be reinstated.

    Appendix
A      Data
We use monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) between January 2020 and Novem-
ber 2020. The sample includes workers of age from 25 to 54. Armed force excluded. Those whose
current or past occupation information is unavailable are excluded. The labor market statuses are
divided into three groups: Employed, Unemployed, Not in the Labor Force. The distinction across
categories follows the definition from the CPS except that those who report being employed but
absent from work for no particular reasons are classified as unemployed. The stock variables are
based on the repeated cross-sectional data. To construct the labor status transitions, we utilize
the panel structure of the CPS where the individuals are surveyed for four consecutive months,
absent from the survey for eight months, and then re-surveyed for another four months. We match
individual observations across consecutive months using the IPUMS-CPS identifier (CPSIDP). To
verify the matching process, we made sure the matched-individuals have the consistent age, gender,
and race. Using the IPUMS-CPS identifier gives us a 99 percent of matching success rate (In the
analysis about the great recession, the success rate drops to 95 percent). With the panel data
created, we calculate monthly labor market status transition for each individual. For example, if
an individual reports being employed in month t - 1 and not being in the labor force in month t,
we conclude they made a E to N transition in t.
    For the analysis of husbands' earnings by wives' employment status, we use earnings infor-
mation from the Outgoing Rotation Groups (Earner Study) in the CPS. The Outgoing Rotation
Group consists of the households who are being interviewed for the fourth month or eighths month.
Household members who are employed at the time are asked additional questions regarding earn-
ings and hours worked. We identify married couples using SPLOC, the variable that gives the
person number of a respondent?s spouse who lives in the same household. If a man-woman pair in
the sample share the same household serial number and their SPLOC corresponds to each other?s
person number, we consider them as a married couple.


B     Occupational Classification
We create the measures of flexibility and physical contact intensity using data from the Occupational
Information Network (O*NET). O*NET survey started in 1998 and updated on an irregular basis.
We use the most recent version published in February 2020. O*NET survey asks a random sample
of U.S. workers in each occupation various questions about typical work activities required in their
occupations. Respondents answer each question on an ordinal scale of one to five. To measure
occupations' flexibility, we take the average across respondents answers to the following fifteen
questions:
    · How frequently does your current job require electronic mail?

    · How often is dealing with violent or physical aggressive people a part of your current job?

    · How often does your current job require you to work outdoors, exposed to all weather condi-
      tions?

    · How often does your current job require that you be exposed to diseases or infection?

                                                 29
   · How often does your current job require that you be exposed to minor burns, cuts, bites, or
     stings?

   · How much time in your current job do you spend walking or running?

   · In your current job, how often do you wear common protective or safety equipment such as
     safety shoes, glasses, gloves, hearing protection, hard hats, or life jackets?

   · How important is inspecting equipment, structures, or materials to the performance of your
     current job?

   · How important is performing general physical activities to the performance of your current
     job?

   · How important is handling and moving objects to the performance of your current job?

   · How important is controlling machines and processes to the performance of your current job?

   · How important is operating vehicles, mechanized devices, or equipment to the performance
     of your current job?

   · How important is repairing and maintaining mechanical equipment to the performance of
     your current job?

   · How important is repairing and maintaining electronic equipment to the performance of your
     current job?

   · How important is performing for or working directly with the public to the performance of
     your current job?

   To compute the contact intensity measure, we use the following question asking about physical
proximity to other people:

   · How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job?

Again, respondents answer on an ordinal scale of one to five. Unlike other questions, however,
each number is assigned with a specific example describing the physical distance to other people
(1: beyond 100 ft., 2: private office, 3: shared office, 4: at arm's length, 5: near touching). Table
8 presents the measures of flexibility and physical contact intensity by occupations' major groups.

C                                              Exposure to Standard Recessions by Occupation
We report summary statistics on the cyclicality of employment by gender, marital status and
occupation. We consider the four occupational categories defined in Section 3 and we measure
employment as the employment to population ratio for each category of worker. We extract the
cyclical component from the employment series with a Hodrick-Prescott filter with smoothing
parameter  = 6.5. Flexible/Low contact occupation have the lowest standard deviation relative
to GDP, whereas Inflexible/Low contact have the highest, though both have high correlations with
GDP lagged by one year. Inflexible/High contact occupations have the lowest standard deviation
relative to GDP and the lowest correlation.
    Within occupation, there is a substantive difference in the standard deviation relative with
and the correlation to GDP by gender and marital status. For both single and married workers,
men display higher cyclicality, and the cyclicality is substantially higher for singles compared to
married for both men and women. The gender differences in these measure of cyclicality are most
pronounced for single workers. for all occupations other than Inflexible/High contact, there are
only very small differences in cyclicality between married men and married women.

                                                                                      E/P                                                                                                                                         E/P

We report the full set of estimation results for specification 2 estimated during the pandemic
(Section 4) and during the great recession (Section 4.1). All specification include age and education
controls. Individuals belong to one of the three age groups, aged 25-34, 35-44 and 45-54 years old.
Likewise, we divide the sample into three education categories: high school degree or less, some
college, and bachelor's degree or higher. To control any age-specific or education-specific impact
of the pandemic, we include the age group dummies and education group dummies as well as their
interactions with the recession phases in all specifications.
    As the measure of occupation, we use the 2-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)
code provided by the CPS. To take into account the recessions' impact by occupation, we include
2-digit occupation dummies and their interactions with the recession phases.
    The share in the population of each demographic group is reported in Table 9.
