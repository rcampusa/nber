                                            ABSTRACT

When the VAR representation of a times series has a non-fundamental representation, standard SVAR
techniques cannot be used to exactly identify the effects of structural shocks. This problem is know
to potentially arise when one of the structural shocks represents news about the future. However, as
we shall show, in many case the non-fundamental representation of a time series may be very close
to its fundamental representation implying that standard SVAR techniques may provide a very good
approximation of the effects of structural shocks even when the non-fundamentalness is formally present.
 This leads to the question: When is non-fundamentalness a real problem? In this paper we derive
and illustrate a diagnostic based on a $R^2$ which provides a simple means of detecting whether
non-fundamentalness is likely to be a quantitatively important problem in an applied settings. We
use the identification of technological news shocks in US data as our running example.

           When a structural model has a nonfundamental VAR representation, standard
        SVAR techniques cannot be used to properly identify the effects of structural shocks.
        This problem is know to potentially arise when one of the structural shocks represents
        news about the future. However, as we shall show, in many cases the nonfundamental

        implying that standard SVAR techniques may provide a very good approximation of
        the effects of structural shocks even when the nonfundamentalness is formally present.
        This leads to the question: When is nonfundamentalness a real problem? In this paper
        we derive and illustrate a diagnostic based on a R2 which provides a simple means of
        detecting whether nonfundamentalness is likely to be a quantitatively important prob-
        lem in an applied settings. We use the identification of technological news shocks in
        US data as our running example.

1       Introduction
Nonfundamentalness in times series arises when the economic variables used by an econo-
metrician do not contain enough information to recover the economy’s structural shocks. In
such a case, standard Structural VAR (SVAR) techniques cannot be used to properly recover

structural disturbances since the economic variables do not allow for a VAR representation
where the residuals are linear combinations of the underlying structural shocks.1,2 Lütkepohl
[2012], among others, has pointed out that such a nonfundamentalness problem is quite likely
to arise in the presence of new shocks, or in other words, in situation where agents actions
reflect news regarding future events. More recently, Forni and Gambetti [2014] have pro-
posed a test for nonfundamentalness. This is a test of the sufficiency of the econometrician’s
information set to identify some structural shocks. In follow up work, Forni, Gambetti, and
Sala [2014] used this sufficient information test to explore whether the nonfundamentalness
is present in simple SVARs used of identify news shocks.3

       Nonfundamentalness is clearly an important concept in time series econometrics, but is
it quantitatively relevant in applied problems? That is, even if a time series has only a
nonfundamental VAR representation, does it mean that SVAR techniques applied to the
system are un-informative about structural shocks of interest? In this paper we will (i)
illustrate that even in the presence of nonfundamentalness, SVAR techniques can be very
informative about structural shocks as the fundamental representation may be close to the
nonfundamental representation implying that the nonfundamentalness problem may cause
                                                                    4
only minor bias in the estimation of structural impulses                and (ii) propose a simple diag-
nostic based on an R2 that helps determine whether or not nonfundamentalness, even when
it is found to be present, is likely to alter substantially the results obtained from SVAR
   1
      The first critiques of structural VAR models on the basis of potential nonfundamentalness are Hansen
and Sargent [1991] and Lippi and Reichlin [1993].
    2
      As shown in Beaudry and Portier [2014], on a qualitative ground, a model with news shocks may give
rise to a nonfundamental representation but does not necessarily do so. It depends on the precise properties
of the news process as well as the variables available to the econometrician.
    3
      In order to explore the importance of nonfundamentalness for the identification of news shocks, Forni,
Gambetti, and Sala [2014] use a dataset composed of 107 US quarterly macroeconomic series and estimate its
principal components. They begin by identifying news shocks following the identification strategy proposed
in Barsky and Sims [2011] and show that the resulting estimated shocks are not orthogonal to the estimated
principal components, which is evidence for nonfundamentalness. They then explain why estimating an
augmented VAR that includes principal components from a large data set offers a means of overcoming a
nonfundamentalness problem.
    4
      We are not the first to recognize that standard SVAR methods may work well in identifying shocks even
when the underllying system suffers from nonfundamentalness. This point has been previously illustrated
in Sims [2012] which looks at the issue in a quantitatively reasonable DSGE model. Beaudry, Portier, and
Seymen [2013] have also shown that the two prominent structural VAR approaches in the news literature
(Beaudry and Portier [2006] and Barsky and Sims [2011]) are in general capable of recuperating news shocks
dynamics from artificially generated data.

techniques. In particular, we will show that a sufficient information test will generally detect
significant nonfundamentalness even when it economic importance is very minor. We will
also show when the R2 associated with the aforementioned sufficient information test is a a
better indication of the quantitative relevance of the nonfundamentalness problem than the
significance level of the test itself.

       The paper will begin by illustrating, using a simple example, why nonfundamentalness
should be viewed as a quantitative issue not an either/or issue with respect to its implica-
tions for SVAR exercises. To do so, we exploit a simple Lucas’ tree model with news. We
will show that for reasonable discount factors nonfundamentalness, while present, is not a
quantitative problem in this setup. Nonetheless, we show that a sufficient information test
for nonfundamentalness will detect significant nonfundamentalness. This example will help
motivate our interest in the R2 associated with their test as a measure of the relevance of
nonfundamentalness. We then turn to formally showing when the R2 from this test is indeed
a measure of the bias in the identification of structural shocks, which will explain the results
we have obtained with the simulated Lucas’ tree model. We will show that the relative bias
in recovering the true structural shocks is of the order of half the R2 of the projection of
the misspecified structural shocks on the true ones. Finally, we will complete the exercise
by examining whether the identification of technological news shocks is likely subject to a
quantitatively important nonfundamentalness problem. To do so, we replicate the proce-
dure suggested by Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014] of including the principal components
extracted from a large data set into an SVAR as a means of overcoming the potential non-
fundamentalness problem. To identify technological news shocks, we use a procedure that
extends the logic of Beaudry and Portier [2006], with a new identified as the only shock that
can have a permanent effect on TFP but that does not have a impact effect on TFP. It has
been argued elsewhere that this procedure, while different to that used by Forni, Gambetti,
and Sala [2014], provides a robust way of identifying technological news shocks (see Beaudry
and Portier [2014] and Portier [2014]).5 Our finding is that nonfundamentalness is not a

    The object of this work is not to debate whether our preferred strategy for the identification of news
shocks is better or not to that proposed in Barsky and Sims [2011] and used by Forni, Gambetti, and
Sala [2014]. The issue is whether previous results which have suggested the importance of news shocks in
business cycles could have been misleading due to the problem of nonfundamentalness. For this argument to

serious problem in the identification of technological news shocks, even though there may
remain debate on how best to use SVAR techniques to identify the effects of news.6


2     On the severity of the nonfundamentalness problem
      in a stylized model
In this section, we simulate the simple Lucas’ tree model with news presented in Forni,
Gambetti, and Sala [2014]. In this model, nonfundamentalness is always present. We use this
model to show that for modest to high values of the discount factor, the nonfundamentalness
is not quantitatively important.

2.1     A simple Lucas’ tree model with news

Consider an endowment economy with one representative tree and one representative house-
hold. The tree produces each period a dividend Θt , that we call TFP. The process of Θ has
a news component ν and a surprise one u:

                                         Θt = Θt−1 + νt−2 + ut ,

                                                               7
where νt and ut are gaussian with unit variance.                   Preferences are given by
                                                     ∞
                                                     X
                                                E0         β t ct ,
                                                     t=0

such that the equilibrium price of a tree, that we call SP for stock prices, is given, after
solving the model, by
                                          β        β
                                 SPt =       Θt +     (βνt + νt−1 ) .

be relevant it should be applied to identification strategies that claim to provide evidence in support of news
shocks (as the one we use here), not to an identification strategy such as used by Barsky and Sims [2011] that
have suggested that such shocks may be rather unimportant even when disregarding the nonfundamentalness
problem. See Beaudry, Nam, and Wang [2011] for an in depth discussion of the robustness of Barsky and
Sims’s [2011] results.
    6
      Using our chosen identification strategy, and using the factors of Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014], we
first show that the identified news shocks do not pass the fundamentalness test they proposed. However, we
find that the R2 of this regression is small. Accordingly, when we re-estimate our VARs with the principal
components included, we find that the impulse responses associated with news shocks are not significantly
modified. In particular the news shock obtained after including the principal components to the VAR
continue to generate business cycle type fluctuations, as consumption, hours and investment increase in the
short run, while TFP increases only in the long run.
    7
      Our results are robust to a change of the TFP process (longer or shorter news) and to the relative size
of the variances.

The determinant of the moving average coefficients matrix is

                                            β2         β

The roots of that determinant are 1 and −β. We assume that only current and past values
of TFP and SP are observed by the econometrician. As |β| < 1, the shocks νt and ut are
nonfundamental for the variables ∆Θt and ∆SPt , and cannot be recovered by an econo-
metrician. Note that when β goes to one, in economic terms when the stock price weights
future Θs a lot, we get closer to the fundamental case. What do we mean by “closer”? The
metric we will consider is the distance between the estimated impulse response functions to
                                                                           8
the identified news shock νet and their theoretical counterpart.

2.2       Simulation results

We simulate the above model, and recover the observables TFP and SP. We then estimate
a bivariate VAR and use the simple Beaudry and Portier [2006] short run identification
scheme. The news is identified as the shock that has no effect on impact on TFP. We then
compare the IRF of TFP and SP to a news shock, and perform the Forni and Gambetti’s
[2014] sufficient information test for nonfundamentalness. In our context, the test consists
in projecting νet (the identified news shock) on a constant and the past of the true νt and ut
that have been used to generate the data. As the shocks are i.i.d. and orthogonal one to
each other, the R2 of that regression should be 0 if νet was indeed equal to νt .

       We consider three values for β : .01, .7 and .99. The nonfundamentalness problem is
expected to be “less severe” when β is large, as agents react more strongly to news shocks.
   8
    This illustrate a result found in more general linear rational expectations models by Ljungqvist and
Sargent [2004] and Mertens and Ravn [2010]. In such models, the effect of news shocks on the MA repre-
sentation of the model solution involves a parameter referred to as the anticipation rate. The anticipation
rate measures the rate at which rational forward looking agents discount future innovations. In this Lucas’
tree model, this rate depends only on discount rate β. In more general models (see for example Mertens
and Ravn [2010]), it involves other parameters, such as intertemporal elasticity of substitution (which is one
here), Frisch elasticity of labour supply, capital share, etc...


                                                      5
We consider estimations over T = 250 periods (result are similar with T = 1000). The VAR
has five lags. For the test for nonfundamentalness, we project νet on a constant and one or
four lags of νt and ut . For each of those experiments, we run 10,000 simulations.
   In Figures 1 to 3, we display the 95% bands and the median for the estimated responses
of TFP and SP to an identified news shock, together with the theoretical response. The
visual inspection of these IRF is a first indicator of nonfundamentalness severity. We also
present more formal measures. First, we plot the empirical density of the p-value of the
nonfundamentalness test. This test is the F-test that the coefficients of νt and ut lags are all
null. Second, we plot the empirical density of the R2 over the 10,000 simulations for each
model. The R2 is the one of the regression of νet on a constant the past of νt and ut . Note
that the p-value will answer the question “Is there nonfundamentalness?” while the size of
the R2 will be more indicative of another question, namely “Does it matter?”. Results are
presented in Figures 1 to 3 and are very telling.

   When β = .1 (Figure 1), nonfundamentalness is a real problem. Estimated IRF are far
from the theoretical ones (what matters are the two first periods, as the model responses are
flat after and therefore quite easy to catch with the VAR). The p-value of the nonfundamen-
talness test are always equal to zero: fundamentalness is always rejected. Finally, R2 s are
close to 1: estimated shocks can be very well predicted by current theoretical innovations:
nonfundamentalness does matter.
   With a more realistic value of β = .99 typically used in quarterly models, SP data
put much more weight on expectations of Θ in the data generating model. As shown in
Figure 2, the theoretical nonfundamentalness now has little quantitative bite: estimated
IRF are very close to that implied by the model. Nevertheless, the theoretical news shock
is found nonfundamental when performing the F-test with four lags (although not with
one lag). But even if fundamentalness is rejected, R2 s are less than 0.1, which suggests that
nonfundamentalness may not matter quantitatively, and which is confirmed by the inspection
of the IRF.
   Finally, Figure 3 shows a case where R2 s are around .3. This is obtained for β = .7. The
IRF are very well captured, except for a blip in TFP in period 2. Nevertheless, testing for


                                               6
fundamentalness will systematically reject it, as the p-values of the F-test are always less
than 1%, and are actually zero more than 95% of the simulations. How can we explain that
IRF are so well estimated and nevertheless fundamentalness rejected? This arises because
the R2 s of the regression of νet on past values of the νt s are small (around .1 with one lag,
around .3 with four lags).

This figures are derived from the simulation of a simple Lucas’ tree model with news. In panel (a) and (b)
are represented the theoretical responses to a news shock (dashed lines) together with the median and 95%
confidence interval obtained from the repeated estimation (10,000 replications) of a VAR 2 impulse response
to the shock that does not affect TFP on impact. The estimated news shock is then projected on one or four
lags of the two theoretical shocks, and we test for orthogonality. Panels (c) and (d) show the distribution of
the p-value for the orthogonality test. Panels (e) and (f ) show the distribution of the R2 s of those regressions.

This figures are derived from the simulation of a simple Lucas’ tree model with news. In panel (a) and (b)
are represented the theoretical responses to a news shock (dashed lines) together with the median and 95%
confidence interval obtained from the repeated estimation (10,000 replications) of a VAR 2 impulse response
to the shock that does not affect TFP on impact. The estimated news shock is then projected on one or four
lags of the two theoretical shocks, and we test for orthogonality. Panels (c) and (d) show the distribution of
the p-value for the orthogonality test. Panels (e) and (f ) show the distribution of the R2 s of those regressions.

This figures are derived from the simulation of a simple Lucas’ tree model with news. In panel (a) and (b)
are represented the theoretical responses to a news shock (dashed lines) together with the median and 95%
confidence interval obtained from the repeated estimation (10,000 replications) of a VAR 2 impulse response
to the shock that does not affect TFP on impact. The estimated news shock is then projected on one or four
lags of the two theoretical shocks, and we test for orthogonality. Panels (c) and (d) show the distribution of
the p-value for the orthogonality test. Panels (e) and (f ) show the distribution of the R2 s of those regressions.

                                                                           10
3         A R2 diagnosis for the severity of nonfundamental-
          ness
In this section, we propose a theoretical explanation for our simulation results. In a Factor
Augmented VAR (FAVAR) model, we consider a misspecified VAR representation that would
omit the factors. Using that misspecified model to identify structural shocks, we show that
the bias in recovering these shocks is of the size of the R2 of the projection of (misspecified)
structural shocks on the past of the factors, which corresponds to the regression proposed
by Forni and Gambetti [2014]. We also show that a small R2 is compatible with a clear
rejection of fundamentalness. In such a case, nonfundamentalness is of little quantitative
importance.

3.1        The Econometric Setup

Assume that data are generated according to the following FAVAR(1) model,9 labeled as
M0 :
                                    Yt = By Yt−1 + Bf ft−1 + y,t ,
                                                                                                       (M0 )
                                    ft = Cf ft−1 + f,t ,
where the vector Yt contains n variables of interest and ft is a vector of (observed) relevant
q factors. As usual, we assume that the variance of each factor is normalized to unity.10
Our goal is to assess the quantitative effects of omitting the relevant set of factors ft at the
estimation stage and thus when identifying the true structural shocks. The analysis is then
similar to a standard omitting variable problem in linear regression.
        Assume that there is a unique linear transformation that maps innovations y,t into
structural shocks ηt according to
                                                y,t = A0 ηt ,

where A0 is a non-singular matrix. As usual, we impose the normalization assumption that
E(ηt ηt0 ) = In . This orthogonality/normalization assumption is not sufficient (except if n = 1)
to identify the structural shock, since E(y,t 0y,t ) = A0 A00 is symmetric. At least n(n − 1)/2
    9
     For the clarity of the presentation, we consider a FAVAR model with one lag only. Results can be easily
extended to a more general lags structure.
  10
     This representation adds factors in a VAR representation of the data and thus differs from a more general
representation of dynamic factor models (see Stock and Watson [2005]).


                                                     11
restrictions have to be imposed to identify A0 . To fix ideas, we assume that identification is
achieved by imposing point restrictions in the form

                                               R vec (A0 ) = r,                                            (1)

where R is a (m × n2 ) selection matrix and r a (m × 1) vector of m restrictions.11 Combining
with the covariance matrix, these additional restrictions allow to identify each elements of
A0 . r = 0 corresponds to a case of zero impact restriction, which is often assumed in the
SVAR literature. When n = 2, a single zero restriction in A0 is sufficient to uncover shocks.
This is for example the case of Beaudry and Portier [2006], in which technological news are
identified by imposing that they have no contemporaneous effect on the level of TFP. In
what follows, we do not need to be explicit about the identifying restrictions R, and will
keep the matrix A0 unspecified.

3.2       The misspecified model

We assume that the factors are not used and/or observed by the econometrician, who there-
fore estimates the following VAR(1) model M1 :

                                             Yt = B̃y Yt−1 + ˜yt ,                                    (M1 )

whereas M0 constitutes the Data Generating Process of Yt . We further assume that the
econometrician uses the restriction (1) to identify the structural shocks.
      This model improperly ignores the role played by the factors ft . We are in a typical
case of missing relevant variables in VARs.12 The omitted variables problem will affect
the misspecified VAR model M1 in various ways. First, by omitting the factor ft−1 , the
VAR(1) model will not properly uncover the size of the shock, because part of the identified
structural shocks will be polluted by the missing factors ft−1 . Second, the omitting factor
ft−1 will affect the dynamics of yt and the matrix B̃y does not properly summarize the true
dynamic structure of the economy. Third, the covariance structure of the variables yt and ft
can affect the proper measurement of the auto-regressive matrix B̃y at the estimation stage.
In what follows, we explicitly measure the biais introduced by these elements.
 11
      These restrictions can be generalized to other identification schemes.
 12
      See Stock and Watson [2001], [2005], Canova [2006] and Lütkepohl [2005] for a discussion of this issue.

                                                      12
       The restricted structural shocks (the ones obtained from M1 ) are denoted ˜yt = Ã0 η̃t . We
impose the same normalization assumption E(η̃t η̃t0 ) = In and the same additional restrictions
                                                    
                                              R vec Ã0 = r,

where R and r are the same as in model M0 . Denoting Σ̃ = E(˜yt ˜0yt ) and Σ = E(y,t 0y,t ), we
deduce Ã0 Ã00 = Σ̃ ≥ Σ = A0 A00 in the matrix sense and kÃ0 k ≥ kA0 k, because the canonical
residual omits the factor ft−1 . We now examine in more details the effects of omitting ft−1
in the estimation of model M1 and for the identification of structural shocks.

3.3       Consequences for identification

The vector of the residuals from the estimation of model M1 is given by

                                        b̃y = MY ˜y = MY Y,


where ˜y is the T × n of error terms for each of the n equations, Y is the T × n matrix of
                                            0
                                                  −1 0
the corresponding Yt and MY = I − Y−1 Y−1     Y−1    Y−1 is the orthogonal projection matrix
to Y−1 , i.e. the matrix containing the lagged values of Y . Using model M0 and the same
notations, we deduce

                                     MY Y     = MY F−1 Bf0 + MY y .

This implies for the estimated misspecified structural shocks
                                         0
                                     ηA
                                     b̃ e0 = MY F−1 Bf0 + MY y .
                                        c

                                                                                                   13
Since b̃yt = ˜yt + op (1), b̃
                             η = η̃ + op (1) and A
                                                 c̃ = Ã + o (1), we obtain
                                                   0    0   p


                                    e00 = MY F−1 Bf0 + MY y + op (1).
                                 η̃ A

Since MY y = y + op (1), we can write
                                                        −1                    −1
                          η̃ =   MY F−1 Bf0       Ã00         + y       Ã00         + op (1),

  13
    This holds for each element of the matrix Ã0 . The expression op (1) means that this term converges in
probability to zero



                                                               13
where F−1 is a T × q matrix containing the lagged values of the factors. Using the linear
relation between the canonical residuals and the structural shocks, this finally yields
                                      −1       −1
                      η̃ = MY F−1 Bf0 Ã00 + ηA0 Ã00 + op (1).

   Now suppose for the sake of exposition that we are interested in one specific structural
shock ηit . Using above expression, one gets

                      η̃it = e0i η̃t ≡ e0i Ã−1   ˆ       0 −1
                                             0 By ft−1 + ei Ã0 A0 ηt + op (1),                (2)

with ei a selecting vector that is composed of zeros and one at the ith element. The variable
fˆt−1 is obtained from

                                                  T
                                                                     !−1   T
                                                  X                        X
                         fˆt−1
                           0      0
                               = ft−1     0
                                      − Yt−1                    0
                                                         Yt−1 Yt−1                     0
                                                                                 Yt−1 ft−1 .
                                                   t=2                     t=2

We can rewrite equation (2) under the form

                            η̃it = e0i η̃t = δi0 fˆt−1 + e0i Ã−1

We now define vit = e0i Ã−1
                          0 A0 ηt . In a matrix form, equation (3) rewrites:


                                    η̃i = MY F−1 δi + vi + op (1).

3.4    Testing for nonfundamentalness

Testing for nonfundamentalness can be achieved by regressing the structural shock of interest
η̃i on the lags of the factors and then perform a Granger causality test on equation (3), as
proposed by Forni and Gambetti [2014]. As Y−1 is correlated with the factors F−1 (a natural
result, because factors are extracted from macroeconomic variables in yt ), this does not yield
a consistent estimator of δi . Therefore, we regress the structural shocks η̃i on the lags of the
factors orthogonal to Yt−1 , namely MY F−1 .
   The corresponding Wald statistic WT for the Granger Causality test is:

                                    δ̂i0 F−1
                                          0

                          , we obtain the following proposition:

Proposition 1 For a given sample size T , the following relation holds between the Wald
statistics WT and the R2 of the projection of the (misspecified) structural shocks η̃i on the
lags of the factors orthogonal to Yt−1 :
                                                            Ri2
                                              WT = T                .
                                                         (1 − Ri2 )
       The Wald statistic is composed of two terms. The first term T (the size of the sample)
refers to the precision of the estimation, since the covariance matrix of the factors has been
normalized to identity. As the sample size increases, the precision of the estimate, i.e. the
inverse of its variance, becomes larger. The second term R2 accounts for the explanatory
power of the factors.

Corollary 1 Suppose that the Wald statistics is above its critical value, so that the test
rejects the fundamentalness of the residuals (or of identified structural shocks from the wrong
model). Such a a rejection is compatible with arbitrarily low level of the R2 , and therefore
with little quantitative importance on the nonfundamentalness problem, as long as the sample
size T is large enough.

       Let us illustrate Corollary 1. Consider a single factor (q = 1) in the regression and
a sample of size T = 200, as very usual in applied time series macroeconomics. In this
case, the limiting distribution of the Wald statistic under the hypothesis Bf = 0 is a chi-
square statistic with one degree of freedom. Its critical value at 5% is 3.84. This implies
an associated critical R2 equals to 0.0192. In words, it is possible to reject fundamentalness
                                    14
even though the factor F−1                explain only less than 2% of the variance of the identified
structural shock.

       Proposition 2 formalizes the relationship between the R2 of the projection of (misspeci-
                                                                            15
fied) structural residuals and the distance to the true model.

Proposition 2 The R2 statistics we have constructed is :
       (i) a consistent estimator of the distance between the misspecified impact matrix of struc-
tural shocks Ã0 and the true one A0 . Indeed, when R2 is small, Ã0 is close to A0 and at the
limit when R2 → 0, Ã0 tends to the true one A0 .
       (ii) a consistent estimator of the distance between the misspecified variance decomposition
on impact and the true one.

       The meaning of Proposition 2 is that if R2 is small, the distance between the two models
is small even if the Wald test rejects fundamentalness.

3.5        Characterization of biases in the canonical bivariate model of
           Beaudry and Portier [2006]

Consider the identification of technological news shocks in the bivariate model with Total
Factor Productivity (T F P ) and a measure of Stock Prices (SP ). Following Beaudry and
Portier [2006], the technological news η2,t is the shock that is orthogonal to current T F P .
The true model is M0 with Y = (T F P, SP )0 , while the econometrician is estimating M1 .
According to the structural assumption, A0 is lower triangular and given by
                                                   
                                        a0,11   0
                                A0 =                  .
                                        a0,21 a0,22
Under the misspecified model M1 , we maintain the same identifying restriction, such that
the misspecified impact matrix Ã0 is given by
                                                       
                                          ã0,11   0
                                 Ã0 =                    .
                                          ã0,21 ã0,22
       Using the same logic than before, we can derive proposition 3.

Proposition 3 The two identified structural shocks in the misspecified model M1 are given
by
                                                   a0,11
                                η̃1t = δ10 fˆt−1 +        η1t + op (1),
                                                   ã0,11
                                                             a0,22
                                η̃2t = δ20 fˆt−1 + Θη1t +           η2t + op (1),
                                                             ã0,22
  15
       Proofs are gathered in an appendix

with Θ =         ã0,22
                          −   ã0,11 ã0,22
                                                  The identification of the true structural shocks therefore depends
on the relative biases of the three elements of the matrix Ã0 . Those relative biases satisfy,
when R12 and R22 are small:

                                                     a0,11 − a0,11

                                                                   '   R ,
                                                         a0,11       2 1
                                                     a0,22 − a0,22
                                                     b̃              1 2
                                                                   ≤   R ,
                                                         a0,22       2 2
                                                                Θb ≤ (1 − R22 )1/2 .

Therefore, the relative bias impact response to a news shock is smaller than half of the R2 .

       This proposition makes explicit that from a quantitative point of view, it is not the
value of the Wald statistics but the size of the R2 that matters for the bias caused by
nonfundamentalness.


4        Application to the identification of TFP news shocks
         in U.S. data
In this section, we show that the results of Beaudry and Portier [2006] and [2014] are robust
to the nonfundamentalness critique.

4.1       Baseline results

In the following, we use the same sample as used by Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014] and
use the data described in Beaudry and Portier [2014].16 TFP is corrected for utilisation,
consumption is total consumption (including durable) and investment is total investment
(see the data appendix).
       We first consider the basic Beaudry and Portier’s [2006] VAR 2. Whereas the small
dimension of the VAR might be a weakness, this VAR has the advantage of being simple
and, as discussed in Beaudry and Portier [2014], gives results that are robust to various
extensions. The two variables in the system are TFP and Stock Prices. The single identifying
restriction is that the identified news has no impact effect on TFP, which correspond to a
  16
    Note that the results of our VARs are robust to a longer sample (1946-2013), but the factors are only
available on the shorter sample.

                                                                   17
Choleski decomposition in which TFP is the first variable and the news shock the second
shock. Figure 4 shows that we indeed identify a diffusion news. TFP does not increase for
                           17
about 10 quarters               , but does in the long run.

Data are described in the appendix and the sample period in 1960Q1-2012Q2. The news shock is the one
that does not affect TFP on impact. The VAR is estimated in levels and with 4 lags. The unit of the vertical
axis is percentage deviation from the situation without shock. Grey areas correspond to the 66% confidence
band. The distribution of IRF is the Bayesian simulated distribution obtained by Monte-Carlo integration
with 10,000 replications, using the approach for just-identified systems discussed in Doan [1992].


       We now extend the VAR to add three extra variables: consumption, investment and
hours. To identify a TFP news shock, we follow the identification strategy set out in Beaudry
and Portier [2014] which is a natural extension to that introduced in Beaudry and Portier
[2006]. This identification strategy only identifies a and an unrestricted technology shock,
while the other shocks remain unnamed. The identifying restrictions are the following: (i)
all the shocks but the unrestricted technology shock have zero impact effect on TFP, (ii)
the news and the unrestricted technology shock are the only permanent shocks to TFP. In
Beaudry and Portier [2014] it is shown that this identification gives robust results when one
varies either the information set, the sample period and the specification.
       Impulse responses are presented in Figure 5. The plain line shows the point estimates.
We observe all the characteristic of a news driven economic expansion. TFP does not move in
the short run, the stock market reacts instantaneously to the news, consumption, investment
  17
       TFP actually decreases, which might be the consequence of an excessive correction for utilization.


                                                              18
and hours do increase on impact and subsequently, before any sizable increase in TFP. In
panels (a) and (b), we also represent the responses of TFP and SP obtained from the VAR 2
(dashed-dotted gray line). Note that the response of TFP is very similar, while the response
of SP is now purged from some non-news related variations.
   These results suggest that there are indeed news in the business cycle, but it might be
the case, as pointed out by Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014], that the estimation suffers
from nonfundamentalness. This is what we check now.

4.2    The quantitative unimportance of nonfundamentalness

In order to test for nonfundamentalness, we follow Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014]. The
authors use a dataset composed of 107 US quarterly macroeconomic series, and estimate
the principal components of this data set. They show that essentially all the information is
contained in the first three factors. We therefore use these first three factors. We project
the estimated news shock of the VAR 2 and of the VAR 5 on one lag or four lags of the
first three factors, and test for the orthogonality of our news shocks to the factors. The
test is a F-test, and the p-values are reported in Table 1. In all cases, the p-value is less
that 5%. We therefore do agree with Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014] that our identified
strategy is likely subject to the nonfundamentalness problem. However, does it matter for
the estimation of the impulse response functions to a news shock? The answer we find is
no, or at least not very much. A first element suggestive of this negative answer comes
from the inspection of the R2 s associated with specification test. These are displayed in
Table 1. The R2 s are never larger than .2: even though our estimated news shocks are not
orthogonal to the factors, those factors explain less than 20% of the variance of the news.
The simulation and theoretical results of the previous section suggest that in such a case,
the nonfundamentalness should not be much of a quantitative problem.

   We then re-estimate our VAR 5 by adding the three factors, so that we end up estimating
a VAR 8. We use the same identification strategy, that is, : (i) all the shocks but the unre-
stricted technology shock have zero impact effect on TFP, (ii) the news and the unrestricted
technology shock are the only permanent shocks to TFP. The estimated responses to the
newly identified news shock are the black dashed lines of Figure 5. Except for the Stock

Data are described in the appendix and the sample period is 1960Q1-2012Q2. In the VAR 5 (the plain line),
the news shock is restricted to have no impact effect on TFP but is not restricted in the long run. The
dotted lines correspond to the VAR 8, that is the VAR 5 augmented with the first three factors of Forni,
Gambetti, and Sala [2014]. The dashed-dotted gray lines of panels (a) and (b) are the responses to a news
shock in the VAR 2 of Figure 4. The VARs are estimated in levels and with 4 lags. The unit of the vertical
axis is percentage deviation from the situation without shock. Grey areas correspond to the 66% confidence
band of the VAR 5. The distribution of IRF is the Bayesian simulated distribution obtained by Monte-Carlo
integration with 10,000 replications, using the approach for just-identified systems discussed in Doan [1992].

This Table presents the results of the sufficient information test proposed by Forni and Gambetti [2014]. For
each VAR, the news shock is projected on one or four lags of the first three factors of Forni, Gambetti, and
Sala [2014]. Table includes the p-value for the orthogonality test, as well as the R2 of those regressions. Data
are described in the appendix and the sample period in 1960Q1-2012Q2. In the VAR 2, the news shock is the
one that does not affect TFP on impact.In the VAR 5 , the news shock is only restricted to have no impact
effect on TFP but is not restricted in the long run. The VARs are estimated in levels and with 4 lags.



Price whose response has a similar shape but is divided by a factor two, the responses of
TFP, consumption, investment and hours are all very similar to that obtained in the ab-
sence of including the factors. This contrasts with Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014] finding
that is based on the identification strategy of Barsky and Sims [2011], which itself is not
very supportive of the news shocks view of business cycles. Hence, these results suggests
that our chosen means of identifying news shocks generate impulse responses with proper-
ties that are robust to the nonfundamentalness critique. There may remain debate about
how best to identify new shocks, but that is an issue entirely different form the issue of
nonfundamentalness emphasized in Forni, Gambetti, and Sala [2014].18 We therefore infer
that nonfundamentalness is not likely an important factor in evaluating whether or not news
shocks are relevant for business cycles.


5       Conclusion
In this paper we began be showing, using a simple Lucas’ tree model with news, that one
needs to separate the very existence of nonfundamentalness from its quantitative importance.
In particular, we have shown that the relative bias in recovering the true structural shocks is
of the order of half the R2 of the projection of the misspecified structural shocks on the true
ones. We have then shown that when estimating the effects of technological news shocks with
an identification scheme previously known to be robust, we found that nonfundamentalness is
  18
       See Beaudry, Nam, and Wang [2011] for some answers to that question.

present, but that it does not appear to matter quantitatively. This is not of course a general
result that would apply to all SVARs exercises. In fact, the test proposed by Forni and
Gambetti [2014] is a useful one that macro-econometricians should systematically perform
when nonfundamentalness may be present. However, this tests should not only be used to
detect nonfundamentalness, but the R2 associated with the test should also be used to help
assess whether nonfundamentalness is likely to be quantitative important. For technological
news shocks, our findings suggest that nonfundamentalness is not likely to be a first order
issue.

is then a consistent empirical measure of the discrepancy between the misspecified variance
on the impact attributable to a particular shock and its true one. QED
