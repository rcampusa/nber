                                           ABSTRACT


We study the impact of the introduction of one of the major pillars of the social insurance system
in the United States: the introduction of Medicare in 1965. Our results suggest that, in its first 10
years, the establishment of universal health insurance for the elderly had no discernible impact on
their mortality. However, we find that the introduction of Medicare was associated with a substantial
reduction in the elderly’s exposure to out of pocket medical expenditure risk. Specifically, we
estimate that Medicare’s introduction is associated with a forty percent decline in out of pocket
spending for the top quartile of the out of pocket spending distribution. A stylized expected utility
framework suggests that the welfare gains from such reductions in risk exposure alone may be
sufficient to cover between half and three-quarters of the costs of the Medicare program. These
findings underscore the importance of considering the direct insurance benefits from public health
insurance programs, in addition to any indirect benefits from an effect on health.

    A major economic rationale for social insurance is its potential to redress the consequences of market

imperfections in private insurance markets. Public health insurance offers two potential benefits: direct

risk-reduction benefits and indirect health benefits. As the above quotation highlights, both of these

potential benefits figured prominently in the motivation for the establishment of the U.S. Medicare

program.

    Analysis of the impact of health insurance has focused primarily on only one of these potential

benefits – the impact of insurance on health outcomes. In general, for the non-infant population, the

evidence points strongly to no or only very modest health benefits (see e.g. Levy and Meltzer 2004 for a

review of this literature). By contrast, the risk-reducing properties of health insurance, while at the core of

any theoretical analysis of the benefits from insurance, have received comparatively little empirical

attention.

    In this paper, we demonstrate empirically that even in the apparent absence of health benefits, public

health insurance can have important benefits from reducing risk exposure. These results suggest that the

near-exclusive focus on health benefits in empirical analyses of the impact of health insurance can

substantially understate the total benefits from health insurance provision.

    We study the impact of the introduction of Medicare, which provides nearly universal public health

insurance coverage to the elderly. The introduction of Medicare in 1965 was, and remains to date, the

single largest change in health insurance coverage in U.S. history. Its introduction was followed by a

substantial and prolonged decline in elderly mortality (see Figure 1). Nevertheless, using several different

empirical strategies, we find no compelling evidence that, in its first 10 years, Medicare reduced overall

elderly mortality. Our evidence suggests the explanation for this finding is that, prior to Medicare, elderly




                                                      1
individuals with life-threatening, treatable health conditions sought care even if they lacked insurance, as

long as they had legal access to hospitals.

    However, although we detect no impact of the introduction of Medicare on overall elderly mortality,

we estimate that its introduction is responsible for a striking and substantial decline in the large right-tail

of the distribution of out of pocket medical expenditures for the elderly. Specifically, we estimate that

Medicare is associated with a forty percent decline in out of pocket spending for the top quartile of the out

of pocket medical expenditure distribution; for the top decile of this distribution, the decline associated

with Medicare is close to fifty percent.

    Within a stylized expected utility framework, we simulate the welfare gains associated with this

change in risk bearing and compare it to the costs associated with Medicare (both the moral hazard costs

and the marginal cost of public funds). The results suggest that the magnitude of the welfare benefits from

Medicare’s impact on consumption-smoothing may be considerable relative to the costs of the Medicare

program; we estimate that the consumption-smoothing benefits may cover between one half and three

quarters of Medicare’s cost. This finding underscores the importance of considering risk reducing effects

in any evaluation of the impact of health insurance.

    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides some brief background on Medicare.

Section 2 analyzes the 10-year impact of Medicare on elderly mortality. Section 3 investigates the impact

of Medicare on the distribution out of pocket expenditures. Section 4 uses these estimates to perform a

cost-benefit analysis. The last section concludes.

Section 1: Background on Medicare

    The U.S. Medicare program is one of the largest public health insurance programs in the world. With

annual spending of $260 billion per year, it constitutes about 17 percent of all U.S. health expenditures,

one-eighth of the federal budget, and 2 percent of GDP (National Center for Health Statistics 2002,

Newhouse 2002, US Congress 2000).

    Medicare was enacted in July 1965 and implemented essentially nationwide in July 1966. It provided




                                                       2
virtually universal public health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older (coverage for the disabled was

added in 1973). Individuals aged 65 and over are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A, which covers

up to 90 days of inpatient hospital expenses after an initial deductible and a 25 percent co-payment for

days 61 – 90; it is funded by a payroll tax. The elderly can choose to enroll in Medicare Part B, which

covers physician costs after an initial deductible and 20 percent (uncapped) co-pay; it is funded partly by

general revenues and partly by individual premiums which were designed to cover 50 percent of the

program costs (Somers and Somers, 1967). Medicare’s cost-sharing provisions and uncapped potential

out of pocket spending make the extent of its consumption smoothing properties a priori uncertain.

    Medicare’s impact on health insurance coverage for the elderly was enormous, increasing by 75

percentage points the proportion of the elderly with any meaningful health insurance (Finkelstein 2005).

Recent empirical work has shown that the introduction of Medicare was associated with a substantial

increase in health care utilization (Dow 2002, Cook et al. 2002, Finkelstein 2005) and spending

(Finkelstein 2005). In more recent times, Medicare coverage is also associated with a substantial increase

in health care utilization (Lichtenberg 2002, Decker and Rappaport 2002, McWilliams et al., 2003, Card

et al., 2004.)

Section 2: Medicare and Mortality

    In this section, we examine the impact of the introduction of Medicare on elderly mortality through

1975. Mortality is, of course, only one measure of health. Our focus on mortality is motivated both by its

importance and by the striking decline in elderly mortality rates that began shortly after the introduction

of Medicare (see Figure 1). From a practical standpoint, mortality is also one of the few objective, well-

measured health outcomes; as a result, it is the focus of many of the studies examining the impact of

health insurance on health (Levy and Meltzer, 2004).

    We use annual age- and state-specific mortality data from 1952 – 1975. Data from 1959 to 1975 are

from the NCHS Multiple Causes of Death micro-data, which include the universe of death certificates;

prior to that, we use aggregate published death statistics (Vital Statistics, various years). Alaska and

Hawaii are excluded from the analysis since they do not enter the data until 1959. We look up to 10 years


                                                      3
after Medicare’s introduction for any impact of Medicare on mortality; since health is a stock, the impact

of a change in health insurance coverage on mortality might occur only with a lag.

    Previous work on the impact of Medicare on health outcomes has used the age-variation in Medicare

coverage to identify its effect, exploiting the fact that Medicare covers individuals over 65 but not under

65. This work points to, at best, very modest health benefits from Medicare, both at the time of its

introduction (Dow 2002, Cook et al., 2002) and in more recent times (Card et al., 2004). Using the same

age-based identification strategy, we also find no compelling evidence of an impact of the introduction of

Medicare on elderly mortality (section 2.1). We explore two alternative sources of variation to further

investigate Medicare’s impact. In Section 2.2, we exploit geographic variation in the increase in insurance

coverage associated with Medicare’s introduction. In Section 2.3, we exploit variation in the timing of

Medicare’s implementation in certain Southern counties.

    These additional empirical strategies serve two purposes. First, each of the three approaches has its

own strengths and weaknesses, which we discuss below. Our finding of similar results from the three

different empirical strategies therefore increases our confidence in the conclusion that Medicare appears

to have had no impact on overall elderly mortality in its first 10 years. Second, the combined evidence

from the three strategies helps shed light on why Medicare appears to have had only modest health

benefits at best; we discuss this in more detail in section 2.3 below.

2.1 Mortality estimates based on Medicare’s coverage by age

    Figure 2 shows trends in mortality rate for the “young elderly” (aged 65-74) who become covered by

Medicare in 1966 and the “near-elderly” (aged 55-64), who do not. The mortality decline for the young

elderly begins several years before Medicare’s introduction, while that for the near-elderly begins slightly

after. Not surprisingly, therefore, formal regression analysis does not indicate any impact of the

introduction of Medicare on the mortality rate of the young elderly relative to the near elderly.

Specifically, we estimate:




                                                      4
ln(deaths) ast = β1 ln(pop'n) ast + β2 elderlya +α s *1(states ) +δ t *1(Yeart )
                   t =1975                                                                                (1)
               +    ∑λ (elderly )*1(Year) + X
                   t =1952
                             t   a          t      st   β + ε ast

Our dependent variable is the log of the number of deaths in state s and year t in age group a. For the right

hand side population variable, we construct annual, state- and age-group-specific population estimates by

fitting separate cubics to the 1950 through 1980 census data for each state-age group cell. In practice, the

results are not sensitive to using the log of the death rate or the death rate as the left hand side variable.

We include an indicator variable ( elderly a ) for whether the deaths are for the young-elderly rather than

the near-elderly, and a series of state and year fixed effects (1(States ) and 1(Yeart ) respectively).

    The key variables of interest are the series of year fixed effects interacted with the elderly indicator

variable ( (elderly a ) * 1(Yeart ) ). The pattern of coefficients on these variables (the λt ' s ) show the

flexibly estimated trend in ln(deaths) over time for the Medicare-eligible elderly population relative to the

non-eligible non-elderly. Under the assumption that changes in the time pattern of mortality for the young

elderly relative to the near elderly around 1966 reflect the effect of Medicare, the change in the pattern of

λt ' s after the introduction of Medicare should provide an estimate of the effect of Medicare on

ln(deaths).

    Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the indigent was, like Medicare, also enacted in

July of 1965. However, the timing of Medicaid implementation – unlike that of Medicare – was left up to

the individual states (see Gruber, forthcoming for details). We control for any impact of Medicaid on

health outcomes by including a series of indicator variables ( X st ) for the number of years since (or

before) the implementation of a Medicaid program in state s. In practice, the results are not sensitive to

these controls, which is not surprising given that the relative impact of Medicaid (compared to Medicare)

on the elderly was quite small (National Center for Health Statistics 2002 and Holahan 1975).

    We report results from weighted estimation of equation (1) by OLS. The weights are the square root

of the population of age group a in state s and year t. Unweighted estimates (not reported) are very



                                                                    5
similar. We calculate robust standard errors, allowing for an arbitrary variance-covariance matrix within

each state. Our empirical framework is quite similar to that of Dow (2002); we differ mainly in our

adoption of a substantially more flexible functional form, and our controls for Medicaid implementation.

    Figure 3 shows the λt ' s from estimating equation (1). The level of the graph is arbitrary; we set it at

0 in 1966, the omitted year. It indicates that although mortality for the young elderly is declining relative

to that of the near-elderly after Medicare, this decline begins in 1962, four years before Medicare is

implemented; moreover, this relative mortality decline for the young elderly reverses in the mid 1970s.

The visual impression of no compelling evidence of an impact of Medicare on young elderly mortality

relative to near elderly is confirmed by statistical tests (not shown). We also found no evidence of an

impact of Medicare for specific diseases – such as cardiovascular disease – or for sub-populations where

we might expect a bigger impact of Medicare on health: non-whites – who are among the most vulnerable

in the population – and individuals in urban areas – where availability and access to medical care is much

greater than in rural areas (not shown).

2.2 Mortality estimates based on geographic variation in insurance prior to Medicare

    The age-based identification strategy is not well-suited to examining the impact of Medicare on

mortality for the oldest of the elderly, for whom Medicare might conceivably have a larger mortality

impact. In addition, the age-based strategy will be biased against finding an impact of Medicare if the

treatment of individuals just under age 65 is affected by the insurance coverage Medicare provides to all

individuals over age 65. Physician practice norms, concerns about malpractice liability, or joint costs of

the production of health care could all contribute to “health insurance spillovers”; Baker (1997),

Hellerstein (1998) and Glied and Zivin (2002) present evidence consistent with such spillovers.

    We therefore employ an alternative strategy based on the substantial geographic variation in private

health insurance coverage among the elderly prior to the introduction of Medicare. Table 1 shows the

variation across sub-regions in the percent of the elderly without any hospital insurance or the percent




                                                      6
without Blue Cross hospital insurance. The data are from the 1963 National Health Survey.1 Using the

Blue Cross measure, the increase in insurance coverage for the elderly associated with the introduction of

Medicare ranged from a high of 88 percentage points in the East South Central United States to a low of

49 percentage points in New England.

    Elderly insurance coverage rates are clearly not randomly assigned and are in fact highly correlated

with socio-economic status. Our empirical approach is therefore to look for a break in any pre-existing

level or trend differences in mortality rates at the time of Medicare’s introduction in areas where

Medicare had more of an effect on insurance coverage relative to areas where it has less of an effect.

Using this same identification strategy, Finkelstein (2005) demonstrates a substantial impact of Medicare

on hospital spending and utilization.

          The basic estimating equation is:

ln(deaths) st = β 1 ln( pop' n st ) + α s * 1( State s ) + δ t * 1(Yeart )
          t =1975                                                                            (2)
      +    ∑ λ ( pctuninsured )
          t =1952
                    t               z   * 1(Yeart ) + X st β + ε st


The variables are defined as in equation (1), except that the key coefficients of interest – the λt ' s -- are

now the coefficients on the variable ( pctuninsured ) z * 1(Yeart ) , the interaction between year effects

and the percentage of the elderly population in sub-region z without private health insurance in 1963. We

estimate equation (2) by OLS using the square root of the population in state s and year t for weights.

Unweighted estimates (not reported) are very similar. We adjust our standard errors to allow for an

arbitrary covariance matrix within each state over time.

    We present results using the Blue Cross measure since, unlike most other forms of health insurance

for the elderly, Blue Cross insurance provided meaningful coverage. In addition, Medicare benefits were




1
  For more information on the data, see National Center for Health Statistics, 1964.The survey also contains
information on coverage by surgical insurance. Surgical and hospital insurance coverage are highly correlated
(correlation = 0.92); for simplicity, we focus on hospital insurance, since hospitals constitute the largest portion of
expenditures.


                                                             7
explicitly modeled after these plans (Anderson et al. 1963, Ball 1995, Newhouse 2002). In practice the

results are not sensitive to the choice of health insurance measure (not shown).2

    Figure 4 shows the λt ' s from estimating equation (2). Panel A shows that, for individuals aged 65

and over, mortality rates were rising in areas with less insurance relative to the areas with more insurance

prior to the introduction of Medicare; this is not surprising since areas with less insurance are also poorer.

The identifying (or, counterfactual) assumption is that, absent Medicare, the differential trend in mortality

improvements would have continued. Any systematic divergence from this differential trend after 1966

would suggest an impact of Medicare. However, there is no indication of any divergence. In results not

reported, we implemented statistical tests that confirm this visual impression. Again, we also found no

evidence of an impact of Medicare for specific diseases – such as cardiovascular disease – or for two sub-

populations where health insurance might have been expected to have more of an impact on health: non-

whites or individuals living in urban areas (not shown). 3

    One of the advantages of using the geography-based identification strategy instead of the age-based

identification strategy is the ability to look at the effect of Medicare separately for different age groups.

Panels B and C of Figure 4 therefore report results separately for, respectively, individuals aged 65-74

and individuals aged 75 and over. For neither age group is there evidence of any differential decline in

mortality rates in areas where insurance coverage increased more as a result of Medicare’s introduction.

Indeed, the results for individuals aged 65-74 suggest that Medicare is associated with an increase in

mortality rates, while results for individuals aged 75+ indicate no impact of Medicare in either direction.

Statistical tests (not reported) confirm this visual impression.

    A concern with using geographic variation in private insurance coverage to identify the impact of

Medicare is that the mid-1960s through early 1970s were a period of innovation in the treatment of


2
  In principle, the impact of Medicare varies not only according to the percent of the elderly without insurance but
also the percent of the elderly in the area. In practice however, there is very little variation even across counties in
the percent elderly.
3
  The results are also robust to a number of other specifications such as a linear rather than log-linear model,
estimating the model separately by gender, excluding one subregion at a time, excluding all four Southern sub-
regions at once, and excluding the Medicaid control variables (not shown).


                                                            8
cardiovascular disease, including new information about the risks of smoking and the development of

anti-hypertensives (Cutler and Kadiyala 2003). If individuals in richer areas were more likely to adopt

these health care innovations, this would bias our estimates of the mortality benefits of Medicare

downward, since richer areas also had higher pre-Medicare insurance rates and thus a lower estimated

impact of Medicare. To address this issue, we performed a triple-difference analysis by combining the

age-based variation in the previous subsection with the geographic identification strategy used in this sub-

section. This analysis also yields no statistical or substantive impact of Medicare on mortality (results not

shown).

2.3 Why did Medicare have no overall effect on mortality in its first 10 years? Evidence from the

segregated South

    The above evidence suggests that – at least in its first 10 years – Medicare played essentially no role

in the dramatic decline in mortality rates for the elderly that began in the late 1960s. Since Medicare was

associated with a substantial increase in the elderly’s use of hospital care (Dow 2002, Cook et al. 2002,

Finkelstein 2005), this implies that the Medicare-induced increase in health care consumption was

ineffective, at least for mortality. Our third empirical approach sheds some light on why this was the case.

    This third approach is based on the fact that for a hospital to be eligible to receive Medicare funding,

it had to be racially desegregated. As a result, the implementation of Medicare increased non-whites’

access to hospitals in segregated parts of the South (Smith, 1999; Almond et al., 2003). It also resulted in

some staggered timing in the introduction of Medicare in parts of the South that had not desegregated

their hospitals by the start of Medicare. Using the American Hospital Association’s Annual Survey of

Hospitals, we estimate that only three-quarters of counties in the entire South – and only one quarter of

counties in the Mississippi Delta – had a Medicare certified hospital by the end of 1966.

    Using this variation in timing of Medicare implementation, Almond et al. (2003) show that, in the

Mississippi Delta, counties that had a Medicare-certified hospital by February 1969 – and had therefore

desegregated by that point – experienced dramatic declines in non-white post-neonatal mortality from

diarrhea and pneumonia in the late 1960s relative to counties that did not have Medicare-certified


                                                      9
hospitals. We follow Almond et al.’s (2003) empirical strategy and estimate the impact of Medicare on

elderly mortality in the Mississippi Delta:

y ct = α c * 1(county c ) + δ t * 1( yeart ) + λCertified ct + ε ct                           (3)

The dependent variable is a measure of deaths in county c and year t. The regression includes a series of

county fixed effects and year fixed effects ( 1(county c ) and 1( yeart ) respectively). The key coefficient

of interest is λ , which represents the change in elderly mortality associated with having at least one

Medicare-certified hospital in county c at time t. We adjust our standard errors to allow for an arbitrary

covariance matrix within each county over time.

    We estimate equation (3) separately by race, and within race by disease. As a result of this fine

cutting of the data, a reasonably high proportion of counties has no deaths in a given year. We therefore

report results in which the death rate (in levels) is the dependent variable as well as results in which

ln(deaths) is the dependent variable and ln(population) is included on the right hand side.

    Table 2 reports the results. The first two columns indicate that the introduction of Medicare had no

discernible impact on overall elderly mortality in the Mississippi delta, either for non-whites (Panel A) or

whites (Panel B). However, the next two columns suggest that the introduction of Medicare is associated

with a statistically significant decline in non-white elderly pneumonia mortality rates. There is no

evidence of comparable effects for whites, or for other diseases. For example, the last two columns

indicate no impact of Medicare on a decline in mortality from cardiovascular disease, which accounted

for two-thirds of elderly deaths in 1965; improvements in cardiovascular disease mortality were also the

primary cause of the decline in elderly mortality starting in the late 1960s (Cutler and Kadiyala 2003).

    Although statistically significant, the impact of Medicare on non-white elderly pneumonia mortality

is substantively small. The point estimates suggest that Medicare is associated with a 35 percent (log-

linear specification) or 0.1 percentage point (linear specification) decline in non-white elderly pneumonia

deaths. Only 3.3% of elderly deaths in 1965 were from pneumonia; therefore even the larger estimate

suggests that Medicare reduced non-white elderly overall mortality in these counties by only 1 percent.



                                                         10
By contrast, pneumonia-related deaths were over one-quarter of infant deaths. This explains why Almond

et al. (2003) estimate a substantially larger impact of Medicare on non-white post-neonatal mortality than

we do for non-white elderly mortality, even though Medicare provided insurance coverage to the non-

white elderly in addition to the access to hospitals it provided to non-whites of all ages.

    More generally, these findings help explain our estimates that Medicare appears to have had little or

no effect on overall elderly mortality. At the time of Medicare’s introduction, hospitals were primarily

effective at treating short-term acute illness, rather than chronic disease (Somers and Somers 1961). Our

findings suggest that – apart from non-whites who were denied access to hospital care in some places

prior to Medicare – individuals with pneumonia and other infectious diseases that hospitals could treat

effectively at the time were likely to seek medical care regardless of insurance status. This explains why

we find evidence of an impact of Medicare’s introduction on the elderly non-white pneumonia mortality

rate in the segregated South – where the introduction of Medicare opened up access to hospitals for these

individuals – but not for whites in the same areas (despite their low insurance coverage prior to

Medicare), since whites already had legal access to these hospitals. It also explains why we find no

discernable impact of Medicare’s introduction on the elderly pneumonia mortality rate for either race

using either the age-based or geography-based identification strategy (not shown).

    If, prior to Medicare, individuals sought hospital care where it was likely to be effective regardless of

insurance coverage, they must have paid out of pocket and/or relied on charity care. Consistent with this,

the next section documents a large amount of out of pocket medical spending by the elderly prior to

Medicare.

Section 3: Medicare and Exposure to Out-Of-Pocket Medical Expenditure Risk

    To examine the impact of Medicare on out of pocket expenditure risk, we use data on health care

expenditures from the 1963 and 1970 Surveys of Health Service Utilization and Expenditures. These data

contain information on health care expenditures for 7,802 individuals in 1963, and 11,619 in 1970. For




                                                      11
much of the analysis, we limit the sample to the 3,030 individuals aged 55-74 in either year.4 The data

contain detailed information on medical spending both by type of spending (e.g. hospital, physician, drug)

and by source of payment (out of pocket, private insurance, public insurance, and total).5

    Table 3 provides some descriptive statistics on the medical spending by the elderly in 1963, prior to

the introduction of Medicare. All dollar estimates in this and subsequent tables are converted to 2000

dollars using the CPI-U. At $844, average annual per capita medical spending by the elderly in 1963

represented over 10 percent of income. Over 90 percent of this spending was paid out of pocket, and 60

percent of these out of pocket expenditures were for medical services that subsequently became covered

by Medicare (i.e. doctor and hospital expenditures); the rest were for drugs, primarily prescription drugs.6

Figure 5 indicates that there was a substantial right tail to the distribution of elderly out of pocket medical

expenditures in 1963 that would subsequently be covered by Medicare, a finding that to our knowledge

has not been previously demonstrated. This right tail also persists when we examine the distribution of

out of pocket medical spending as a percentage of income (not shown).

    Our empirical strategy is to compare changes in spending for individuals over age 65 to changes in

spending for individuals under age 65 between 1963 and 1970. To increase the plausibility of the

identifying assumption that, absent Medicare, changes in various types of spending for individuals above

and below age 65 would have been the same, we focus primarily on changes in spending for the young

elderly (ages 65 to 74) relative to that for the near elderly (ages 55 to 64). For all of the spending

categories we examine, mean spending in 1963 is substantively quite similar and statistically

indistinguishable for the two age groups.



4
  The surveys were conducted by the Center for Health Administration Studies and the National Opinion Research
Center. Neither includes usable population weights, so all of our estimates are unweighted. The 1970 survey over-
sampled the elderly, as well as individuals in rural areas and the urban poor. The institutionalized population is not
surveyed in either year.
5
  We construct out of pocket spending as the difference between total spending and total insurance spending. Out of
pocket spending is reported directly only in 1970 (but not in 1963). We compared the reported measure to our
constructed measure in 1970 and found them to be the same in 92 percent of cases.
6
  We have not classified home health care as Medicare-eligible because Medicare covered only a very limited
amount of home health care at that time (Somers and Somers 1967). In practice, given how small home health care
expenditures were, including it in Medicare-covered expenditures has little effect on any of the analysis.


                                                          12
    The confounding effect of the introduction of Medicaid likely biases down our estimates of the

impact of Medicare on increasing total spending and reducing out of pocket spending. Medicaid was also

introduced between 1963 and 1970, and Medicaid spending is higher for the near-elderly (our control

group) than the young-elderly (our treatment group); unlike in the mortality analysis, we do not have

geographic identifiers and therefore cannot exploit the variation across states in the timing of Medicaid

introduction; we also cannot use the geographic variation in Medicare’s impact on insurance to identify

its effects on out of pocket medical expenditure risk.

3.1 Impact of Medicare on mean spending

    Although our primary interest is in the impact of Medicare on the distribution of out of pocket

spending, we begin with a brief analysis of the impact of Medicare on average spending of different

types. Our basic estimating equation is:

spend iat = γX iat + β1elderlya + β 2 year1970t + β 3 (elderlya * year1970t ) + ε iat                (4)

In this standard difference-in-differences framework, the coefficient of interest is β 3 ; it indicates the

differential change in spendiat between 1963 and 1970 for individuals aged 65 to 74 relative to individuals

aged 55 to 64. The covariates (Xiat), consist of age, age squared, and indicator variables for male, married

and education group (6 years of school or less, between 6 and 12 years, or 12 or more years of school); in

practice, the results are virtually identical without these controls (not shown). We estimate equation (4) by

OLS and calculate Huber-White robust standard errors.7

    Table 4 reports the results for various Medicare-eligible spending categories. The first column

indicates that the introduction of Medicare is associated with a decline in mean out of pocket spending of

$117. This represents a one-quarter decline from the out of pocket spending by the young elderly in 1963,

but is not statistically significant. The estimated decline in mean out of pocket spending on physicians

shown in the third row is statistically significant and corresponds to about a one-third decline. These

estimates are somewhat smaller than estimates of the impact of other social insurance programs on risk

7
  In results not reported, we found that the p-values are essentially unaffected if we instead implement the
randomized inference approach of Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004).


                                                          13
reduction. For example, Gruber (1997) estimates that the public unemployment insurance system reduces

the fall in consumption associated with an unemployment spell by about two-thirds. However, we will

show below that these estimates of the impact of Medicare on average out of pocket spending mask

Medicare’s real impact, which is concentrated in the right tail of out of pocket spending.

    The remaining three columns suggest that Medicare is associated with declines in private insurance

spending, and increases in total insurance spending and total spending. Although the increase in total

spending is not statistically significant, the point estimate implies that Medicare was associated with a 28

percent increase in total medical spending. Interestingly, the estimates from the RAND health insurance

experiment would also predict that the introduction of Medicare would be associated with a 28 percent

increase in medical spending (Newhouse 1993, Finkelstein 2005).In results not reported, we also found

no evidence of an impact of Medicare on drug spending, which Medicare does not reimburse.

    The possibility, discussed above, that the introduction of Medicare may have spillover effects on

health spending of the non-elderly could bias downward our estimates of the impact of Medicare on the

increase in total health spending, as the control group of near-elderly could also experience some

increased spending associated with Medicare. Of course, such spillovers could also bias upward our

estimate of the impact of Medicare on reducing out of pocket spending of the elderly if the spillovers

induced increased out of pocket spending by the near-elderly. While we cannot rule out this possibility,

we note that the time series evidence does not seem to suggest such an effect: there is no statistical or

substantive change in mean out of pocket spending for the near elderly. Figure 6 similarly indicates that

the distribution of out of pocket spending did not change for the near elderly between 1963 and 1970.

The difference-in-difference estimates of the impact of Medicare on out of pocket spending by the young

elderly are thus virtually identical to the simple time series difference.

3.2 Effect of Medicare on the out of pocket spending distribution: centile treatment estimates

    Figure 6 also conveys the impact of Medicare on the distribution of out of pocket spending. The

distribution of out of pocket spending for the near elderly in 1963 and 1970 as well as for the young

elderly in 1963 all lie close to each other. By contrast, the distribution of out of pocket spending for the


                                                      14
young elderly in 1970 (i.e. after Medicare) lies substantially below the other three distributions in the top

quartile of the distribution.

    To estimate the impact of Medicare on the distribution of out of pocket spending more formally, we

estimate quantile treatment effects for each centile of the spending distribution, following the approach

outlined in Bitler at al. (2003). The quantile treatment effect for quantile q is estimated as follows:

    ∆ q = {spend q (1970, elderly = 1) - spend q (1963, elderly = 1)}
                                                                                                 (5)
           - {spend q (1970, elderly = 0) - spend q (1963, elderly = 0)}

To adjust for covariates, we replace the centile from the spending distribution with the centile from the

distribution of spending residuals from a linear regression of spending on the covariates described above.

We calculate confidence intervals for our estimates using the empirical standard deviation of 200

bootstrap replications of the quantile treatment estimates.

    The results are shown without covariate adjustment (Figure 7a) and with covariate adjustment (Figure

7b). The results are striking. There is no evidence of an impact of Medicare on out of pocket spending

until the top quartile of the out of pocket spending distribution. For this top quartile, the declines are

dramatic, and increase monotonically throughout the quartile. Table 5 reports the point estimates – and

statistical significance – of the 75th through 99th centiles in columns 3 and 4. They indicate that, on

average, Medicare is associated with a 40 percent decline in out of pocket spending for the top quartile of

the distribution.8 The declines are even larger for the top decile, where Medicare is associated with an

almost 50 percent decline in out of pocket spending, or an average decline of about $1,200 per person.

Figures 7c and 7d show that the quantile treatment estimates look similar if we expand the elderly sample

to include all those aged 65 – 90. Because we will use these estimates from the larger sample for the

welfare analysis below, these point estimates are also reported in columns 5 and 6 of Table 5.

    The quantile treatment estimator in equation (5) uses as a proxy for the change in spending that would

have occurred for spending quantile q in the treatment group absent the introduction of Medicare, the


8
 These estimates are based on the covariate-adjusted specification. The estimates without covariates would suggest
an almost 50 percent decline in out of pocket spending for the top quartile.


                                                        15
change in spending that did occur for the same quantile q in the control group. An alternative estimator

suggested by Athey and Imbens (2003) uses as a proxy for the change in spending that would have

occurred for spending level y in the treatment group absent the introduction of Medicare, the change in

spending that did occur in the control group at the quantile in the control group that corresponds to that

same level y. Given the similarity of the treatment and control distributions in the pre-period (see Figure

6), we find, not surprisingly, that the two approaches yield very similar results (not shown).

    A potential concern with the foregoing analysis is that it assumes that, absent the introduction of

Medicare, out of pocket spending at the top of the distribution would not have declined for the young-

elderly relative to the near-elderly. We provide some indirect support for this identifying assumption.

Figure 8 examines how spending changed between 1963 and 1970 for adjacent age groups who both

experienced the same change in Medicare coverage over this period. Figure 8a shows that out of pocket

spending in the top decile of the distribution actually increased for individuals aged 60-64 relative to

individuals aged 55-59 (neither of whom became covered by Medicare), although the increase is not

statistically significant. Figure 8b indicates a decrease in out of pocket spending at much of the top end of

the distribution for individuals aged 70-74 relative to individuals aged 65-69 (both of whom became

covered by Medicare). However, the decreases are statistically insignificant and are about half the

magnitude of the estimated decreases for individuals aged 65-74 relative to individuals aged 55-64.

These findings suggest that our main analysis comparing 65-74 year olds to 55-64 year olds is not merely

picking up an underlying change in the spending distribution that differs systematically by age.

Section 4: Cost benefit analysis

    We use a stylized expected utility framework to simulate the insurance value of the estimated

reduction in risk exposure associated with Medicare and compare this to the estimated costs of Medicare,

which consist of the moral hazard costs of any induced health care consumption as well as the marginal

cost of public funds for Medicare expenditures.9 Estimation of the insurance value of Medicare requires


9
 Our analysis assumes that the elderly were underinsured prior to Medicare and therefore that reductions in risk
exposure are welfare improving. This was the premise behind the Medicare legislation (Ball 1995). The considerable


                                                       16
that we make a number of modeling assumptions. While we therefore consider our findings here more

speculative than the results in the previous section, we believe they provide a useful way to gauge the

likely magnitude of the welfare benefits associated with Medicare’s reduction in risk exposure.

4.1 The insurance value of Medicare

    Our analysis of the insurance value of Medicare is similar in spirit to McClellan and Skinner (1997),

who analyze the relative insurance value of Medicare for individuals at different parts of the income

distribution. However, while McClellan and Skinner (1997) use the expected utility model and parametric

assumptions about the price and income elasticity of demand for medical care to solve for the optimal

consumption of medical care in the presence and absence of Medicare, we instead use our empirical

estimates of the distribution of medical expenditures before and after Medicare as inputs into the expected

utility framework.

    We assume the individual’s utility u (c) is a function of his non-health consumption (c) . We assume

the individual must satisfy a period-by-period budget constraint:

    c = y−m

where y is his per-period income (such as from Social Security) and m is his out of pocket medical

expenditures. m is a random variable with probability density function f (m) and support [0, m ] . f (m)

depends both on the distribution of random health shocks, and on the nature of any health insurance held.

The individual’s expected utility is given by:

m

∫ u ( y − m) f (m)dm
0


    To calculate the welfare gain associated with increased health insurance coverage, we follow the

general approach used in the existing literature that calculates the welfare gains associated with other

insurance products (e.g. Mitchell et al. 1999, Brown and Finkelstein, 2004 and Feldstein and Gruber,



empirical evidence of adverse selection in private health insurance markets also supports our assumption of under-
insurance (Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000). We do not consider the distributional impact of Medicare, which is
analyzed by McClellan and Skinner (1997) and Bhattacharya and Lakdawalla (2002).


                                                        17
1995). Specifically, we compute the individual’s risk premium under both the pre- and post-Medicare

spending distributions. The risk premium (π) is the maximum amount that a risk averse individual would

be willing to pay to completely insure against the random variable m . The risk premium π is therefore

defined implicitly by:

              m
u ( y − π ) = ∫ u ( y − m) f (m)dm
              0


A decrease in risk exposure in the post-Medicare world relative to the pre-Medicare world will appear as

a decline in the risk premium; this decline provides a measure of the insurance value (and hence welfare

gain) of the Medicare coverage.

     We assume a constant relative risk aversion utility function. For our central estimate, we follow a

long line of simulation literature of the value of social insurance for the elderly and assume a coefficient

of relative risk aversion of 3 (see e.g. Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes 1995, McClellan and Skinner 1997,

Mitchell et al. 1999). However, in recognition of the range of plausible parameters, we also report results

for coefficients of risk aversion of 1 and of 5.

     Our analysis is based on the sample of 658 individuals aged 65 and over in 1963. We construct

individual income by dividing the household income reported in the data by the number of individuals in

the household. For each individual, we make 50 random draws without replacement from his potential out

of pocket spending distribution. Since pre-Medicare out of pocket medical expenditures are strongly

positively correlated with household income, we divide our individuals into income terciles and make the

50 draws for a given individual from the out of pocket expenditure distribution of his income tercile.10

     The first column of Table 6 shows the average risk premium when each individual faces the original

out of pocket expenditure distribution that existed prior to Medicare. For a coefficient of relative risk

10
  Even with tercile-specific draws, it is still possible to get a draw that is very high relative to (or higher than)
income, which is unrealistic relative to actual spending patterns. Empirically, the 95th percentile of the distribution of
out of pocket spending as a share of income for individuals in the bottom tercile of the income distribution is 80%,
so we cap out of pocket spending as a fraction of income for each draw at 80%. Using this approach, roughly one-
third of individuals have at least one draw capped. As a result, the mean out of pocket Medicare-eligible
expenditures as a percent of income in our simulation is somewhat lower than in the actual distribution (0.06
compared to 0.08), which suggests that we may underestimate the risk reduction associated with Medicare.


                                                           18
aversion of 3, the risk premium is $953, indicating that this individual would be willing to pay up to $953

to avoid any future out of pocket medical expenditure risk. This willingness to pay is more than double

the reduction in average out of pocket spending ($412).11

     The second column shows the decrease in risk premium associated with moving from the original,

pre-Medicare distribution to the out of pocket spending distribution the individual faces once the quantile

treatment estimates of Medicare’s impact are applied. We make this adjustment based on our quantile

treatment estimates of the reduction in out of pocket medical spending associated with Medicare for

individuals aged 65 and over (see Figure 7c). For a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3, the results

indicate a welfare gain of $411 from facing the post-Medicare spending distribution instead of the pre-

Medicare spending distribution.

     Of course, Medicare coverage reduces not only the variance but also the mean of the out of pocket

spending distribution. For the first generation of Medicare recipients, the decline in mean out of pocket

spending was an almost complete windfall gain, since Medicare hospital expenditures are funded out of

payroll taxes paid by working individuals, and Medicare Part B premiums were subsidized 50 percent.

To separate out the insurance value from the windfall intergenerational transfer, we recalculate the post-

Medicare risk premium under the assumption that individuals must “pay for” the actuarial expected value

of Medicare. Specifically, we subtract from the individual’s income the average difference in out of

pocket expenditures between his 50 draws for the original pre-Medicare distribution and his 50 draws

from the post-Medicare distribution. Column 3 shows the change in risk premium associated with moving

from the pre-Medicare distribution to the post-Medicare distribution when this insurance is “actuarially

fair”; for a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3, the results in column 3 indicate a welfare gain of

$236 per person, or just over half the welfare gain without accounting for the windfall (column 2).

     These results understate the decline in risk exposure associated with Medicare coverage because they

incorporate the behavioral response to Medicare. Both the income and substitution effect from Medicare


11
  The $412 reduction in out of pocket spending is slightly less than the $448 in Medicare-eligible out of pocket
spending in Table 3 because of the capping procedure described above.


                                                         19
lead to increased consumption of health care and hence out of pocket spending. This increased out of

pocket risk reflects individual optimization decisions, and therefore should not be counted against the

welfare gain. (Of course, the behavioral response does contribute to the costs of the program, and we

therefore account for these moral hazard costs in the cost-benefit analysis below.)

     To abstract from the behavioral response to Medicare in calculating the insurance value, we estimate

the post-Medicare out of pocket spending distribution by mechanically adjusting the pre-Medicare 1963

distribution to account for what Medicare would have covered had Medicare existed in 1963. 12 Figure 9

shows this mechanically adjusted distribution; for comparison, it also shows the pre-Medicare distribution

and the pre-Medicare distribution adjusted using the quantile treatment estimates. As expected, the

mechanical adjustment produces a distribution that lies below that from the quantile treatment adjustment.

     Columns 4 and 5 of Table 6 report the welfare benefits using the mechanical adjustment to estimate

the post-Medicare out of pocket spending distribution. Column 4 shows the change in risk premium when

individuals are given Medicare “for free” while column 5 reports the results under the assumption that

individuals must “pay for” the actuarial expected cost of Medicare. In both cases, the decline in risk

premium associated with Medicare is larger than that estimated using the quantile treatment adjustment.

     For a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3, the results in column 5 indicate that the mechanical

introduction of Medicare (at actuarially fair rates) is associated with a welfare gain of $519 per person.

There were about 19 million people aged 65 and over in 1965. This implies that Medicare’s reduction in

risk exposure was associated with $9.9 billion per year in welfare gains.

     For several reasons, the estimates in Table 6 may be underestimates of the consumption smoothing

benefits associated with Medicare. The stylized model treats medical expenditures as affecting the budget

constraint only and does not allow for any utility from increased medical expenditures. While some of the

increased spending associated with Medicare may have been socially inefficient, the cost-sharing

provisions ensure that its social marginal benefit was not zero. In addition, to the extent that some of the

12
  The details of the Medicare benefits at the time of its introduction are taken from Somers and Somers (1967).
Since the part A co-payment depends on the length of the hospital stay, we draw on the data on the individual’s
length of hospital stay in calculating the part A cost sharing requirements for the individual.


                                                        20
elderly’s medical expenditures were paid for by their adult children in the pre-Medicare era, Medicare

may have had additional consumption smoothing benefits for this other group of individuals. Finally, out

of pocket medical expenditures are likely to be positively serially correlated, suggesting that the lifetime

distribution of out of pocket spending for those aged 65 and over may be even more right-skewed than the

annual distribution shown in Figure 5; as a result, Medicare’s reduction in risk exposure may be even

greater when estimated from on a lifetime rather than annual basis.

     In one important respect, however, the estimates in Table 6 may overestimate the value of Medicare.

Our analysis assumes that the individual cannot borrow or save across periods but must consume each

period their net-of-medical expenditures income. This may be a reasonable assumption for many elderly

households, since many enter retirement with relatively little financial assets. Indeed, our calculations

from the 1962 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) suggest that almost one-third of elderly households

had no liquid assets whatsoever, and many of those who do have liquid assets have relatively small

amounts. However, at the high end of the wealth distribution, savings might be an important form of

consumption smoothing and failure to account for them will result in an overstatement of the insurance

value of Medicare for these individuals. Nonetheless, we believe that our per-person welfare estimate is

likely to be a reasonable approximation for much of the wealth distribution.13

4.2 Comparison to estimated costs

     Medicare imposes two types of costs. First, there is the cost of raising the revenue to pay for the

public program. In 1970, Medicare spending was (in 2000 dollars) $34 billion. The consensus estimate of

0.3 for the marginal cost of public funds in the US (Poterba, 1996) implies that the annual revenue raising

costs associated with Medicare were $10.2 billion. Second, there are the efficiency costs from the

increased health spending due to the moral hazard associated with health insurance. By treating all of the

increase as a cost, we provide an upper bound on the efficiency costs of Medicare, since part of the moral

13
 We re-calculated welfare gains separately for each income tercile to confirm that our estimate of the average per-
person welfare gain is not driven by disproportionate gains at the top of the distribution where we are likely to be
over-estimating the gain. Indeed, per-person welfare gains were slightly higher for individuals in the lower portions
of the distribution; for example, we estimated a welfare gain of $482 for the top income tercile for “actuarially fair”
Medicare with risk aversion of 3, compared to a welfare gain of $523 for the bottom tercile.


                                                          21
hazard effect comes from the income effect of health insurance, which does not have efficiency costs. The

moral hazard estimates in section 3.1 – which suggest that Medicare is associated with a 28 percent

increase in the elderly’s health spending –imply that Medicare is associated with a moral hazard cost of

$2.8 billion.14 The four-fold larger moral hazard estimates in Finkelstein (2005) imply that Medicare is

associated with a moral hazard cost of $11.2 billion.15

     Combining the moral hazard and public funds costs suggests that the annual cost of Medicare was

$13 to $21.4 billion. Using a risk aversion coefficient of 3, we estimated above that the consumption

smoothing benefits from Medicare were worth roughly $9.9 billion annually. Thus, the direct insurance

benefits cover between forty-five and seventy-five percent of the costs of the program. 16

Section 5: Conclusion

     This paper has examined the impact of the introduction of Medicare, the single largest change in

health insurance coverage in U.S. history. Using several different empirical approaches, we find no

evidence that the introduction of nearly universal health insurance for the elderly had an impact on overall

elderly mortality in its first 10 years. These results are particularly surprising in light of the fact that the

introduction of Medicare was followed by a period of prolonged and substantial declines in elderly

mortality. The evidence suggests that insurance coverage provided by Medicare did not contribute to this

mortality decline because prior to Medicare lack of legal access, rather than lack of insurance, was the

main barrier to receiving hospital care when individuals had life-threatening, treatable conditions.

     We also find that, although Medicare did not produce measurable mortality benefits, it did provide

considerable risk reduction benefits. We estimate that the introduction of Medicare was responsible for a

striking and substantial decline in the right-tail of the out of pocket medical expenditure distribution for

the elderly. For the top quartile of out of pocket medical spending, we estimate that the introduction of

14
   There were about 19 million people aged 65 and over in 1965 and their average per capita Medicare-eligible
health spending in 1963 was $518 (see Table 3).
15
   One reason for the larger estimates is that estimates – such as those in this paper – based on the age variation in
Medicare coverage will be biased downward if Medicare affects health spending among the “control group” of
individuals aged 55 to 64. See Finkelstein (2005) for a more detailed discussion of this issue.
16
   Using data from the Health and Retirement Survey in the 1990s, Khwaja (2005) also estimates substantial risk-
reducing benefits from Medicare relative to the costs of the program.


                                                           22
Medicare is associated with a forty percent decline in out of pocket spending relative to pre-Medicare

levels. A stylized expected utility framework suggests that the welfare gains associated with this

reduction in risk bearing are substantial, and may be sufficient to cover between half and three quarters of

the costs associated with the Medicare program.

    Our empirical findings underscore the importance of considering the direct consumption smoothing

benefits of health insurance, in addition to any indirect benefits from the effect of insurance on health.

Relatedly, they suggest that the extensive empirical literature devoted to estimating the health benefits of

health insurance – which has tended to find no or only modest benefits for adults – may be substantially

underestimating the total benefits from health insurance.

    The analysis of this paper is done in a static environment in which medical technology is taken as

given. However, Finkelstein (2005) presents evidence that Medicare may have played an important role in

the adoption of new medical technologies. The increase in life expectancy from these new technologies is

extremely large (Cutler, 2003). This raises the interesting and important possibility that, although we

found no compelling evidence of an impact of Medicare on mortality in its first 10-years, the longer-run

impact of Medicare on mortality via induced technological change may be substantially larger. A critical

issue, however, is how the marginal benefits of any new technology use induced by Medicare compare to

the average benefits discussed by Cutler (2003). We consider this an important area for further research.

Note: Graph shows the all-cause mortality rate (deaths per person) for individuals aged 65+. Figure is reproduced
from Cutler and Meara, 2003, Figure 9.4. The mortality rate in each year is the weighted sum of mortality rates for
65-74, 74-85, and 85+ age groups in that year, with weights reflecting the age distribution of the 65+ population in
1990. We are grateful to Ellen Meara for providing us with the data underlying their figure. Vertical line indicates
1966, the year Medicare is first in effect.

Note: Data on individual’s health insurance are from the 1963 National Health Survey, and national, random sample
of households conducted from July 1962 through June 1963. Through a special request to the government, we
obtained a version of the survey that identifies which of 11 sub-regions the individual is in. We limited the sample to
the 12,757 individuals aged 65 and over. Minimum sample size for a sub-region is 377.

parentheses; we allow for an arbitrary covariance matrix within each county over time. Data are from 1959 – 1975
only, since data before 1959 are not available at the county level by race. *, **, *** denotes significance at,
respectively, the 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent level.

Table reports mean spending in year 2000 dollars for individuals aged 65 and over in 1963. N=658. Individual
income is calculated as household income divided by number of individuals in the household. We measures total
insurance spending as private insurance spending in 1963, and as private insurance spending plus Medicare and
Medicaid spending in 1970. The 1963 survey does not collect information on public insurance spending; however,
we know that public assistance for medical spending prior to 1965 was virtually non-existent (Stevens and Stevens,
1974, United States Senate 1963).
