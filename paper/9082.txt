                                               ABSTRACT

           This paper investigates the impact of stock markets and banks on economic growth using a panel
data set for the period 1976-98 and applying recent GMM techniques developed for dynamic panels. On
balance, we find that stock markets and banks positively influence economic growth and these findings
are not due to potential biases induced by simultaneity, omitted variables or unobserved country-specific
effects.

1. Introduction

       Theory provides conflicting predictions about both the impact of overall financial

development on growth and about the separate effects of stock markets on growth and banks on

economic growth. Many models emphasize that well-functioning financial intermediaries and

markets ameliorate information and transactions costs and thereby foster efficient resource allocation

and hence faster long-run growth [Bencivenga and Smith, 1991; Bencivenga, Smith, and Starr, 1995;

King and Levine, 1993a]. These models, however, also show that financial development can hurt

growth. Specifically, financial development, by enhancing resource allocation and hence the returns

to saving, may lower saving rates. If there are sufficiently large externalities associated with saving

and investment, then financial development slows long-run growth. Theory also provides conflicting

predictions about whether stock markets and banks are substitutes, compliments, or whether one is

more conducive to growth than the other. For instance, Boyd and Prescott (1986) model the critical

role that banks play in easing information frictions and therefore in improving resource allocation,

while Stiglitz (1985) and Bhide (1993) stress that stock markets will not produce the same

improvement in resource allocation and corporate governance as banks. On the other hand, some

models emphasize that markets mitigate the inefficient monopoly power exercised by banks and

stress that the competitive nature of markets encourages innovative, growth-enhancing activities as

opposed to the excessively conservative approach taken by banks [Allen and Gale, 2000]. Finally,

some theories stress that it is not banks or markets, it is banks and markets; these different

components of the financial system ameliorate different information and transaction costs.1

       Although a burgeoning empirical literature suggests that well-functioning banks accelerate

economic growth, these studies generally do not simultaneously examine stock market development.

King and Levine (1993a,b) show that bank development – as measured by the total liquid liabilities




                                                    1
of financial intermediaries (e.g., M3) divided by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) -- helps explain

economic growth in a sample of more than 80 countries. Levine (1998, 1999) and Levine, Loayza,

and Beck (2000) confirm this finding but improve upon King and Levine (1993a,b) by (1) using

measures of bank development that include only credit to private firms and therefore exclude credit to

the public sector and by (2) using instrumental variable procedures to control for simultaneity bias.2

This literature, however, omits measures of stock market development because measures of stock

market development for a twenty-year period are only available for about 40 countries.

          Omitting stock market development makes it difficult to assess whether (a) the positive

relationship between bank development and growth holds when controlling for stock market

development, (b) banks and markets each have an independent impact on economic growth, or (c)

overall financial development matters for growth but it is difficult to identify the separate impact of

stock markets and banks on economic success.

          Levine and Zervos (1998) empirically assess the relationship between growth and both stock

markets and banks, but their study suffers from an assortment of econometric weaknesses. Levine

and Zervos (1998) find that initial measures of stock market liquidity and banking sector

development are both strong predictors of economic growth over the next 18 years. To measure bank

development, they use bank credit to the private sector as a share of GDP. They use an assortment of

stock market development measures, including the overall size of the market (market capitalization

relative to GDP), stock market activity (the value of trades relative to GDP), and market liquidity (the

value of trades relative to market capitalization). The ordinary least squares (OLS) approach taken

by Levine and Zervos (1998), however, does not account formally for potential simultaneity bias, nor

does it control explicitly for country fixed effects or the routine use of lagged dependent variables in

growth regressions.3 Further, while theory stresses the potential relationship between economic

growth and the contemporaneous level of financial development, Levine and Zervos (1998) use

initial values of stock market and bank development. This not only implies an informational loss vis-

à-vis using average values, but also a potential consistency loss.

        While recent work has attempted to resolve some of the statistical weaknesses in the Levine

and Zervos (1998) study, statistical and conceptual problems remain. For instance, Arestis,

Demetriades and Luintel (2000) use quarterly data and apply time series methods to five developed

economies and show that while both banking sector and stock market development explain

subsequent growth, the effect of banking sector development is substantially larger than that of stock

market development. The sample size, however, is very limited and it is not clear whether the use of

quarterly data and Johansen’s (1988) vector error correction model fully abstracts from high

frequency factors influencing the stock market, bank, and growth nexus to focus on long-run

economic growth.

        Rousseau and Wachtel (2000) make an important contribution to the literature by using panel

techniques with annual data to assess the relationship between stock markets, banks, and growth.

They use M3/GDP to measure bank development and the Levine and Zervos (1998) measures of

stock market size and activity, which they deflate by the price index of the national stock exchange to

eliminate price changes from their measure of how well the stock market functions. Rousseau and

Wachtel (2000) use the difference panel estimator -- developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and

Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1990) -- that (a) differences the growth regression equation to

remove any bias created by unobserved country-specific effects, and then (b) instruments the right-

hand-side variables (the differenced values of the original regressors) using lagged values of the

original regressors to eliminate potential parameter inconsistency arising from simultaneity bias.

Rousseau and Wachtel (2000) show that both banking and stock market development explain

subsequent growth.

        Nevertheless, problems remain. First, the goal is to assess the relationship between stock

markets, banks, and economic growth. The use of annual data, however, does not abstract from

business cycle phenomena. Second, Alonso-Borrego and Arellano (1996) show that the instruments

in the difference panel estimator are frequently weak, which induces biases in finite samples and poor

precision asymptotically. Recent econometric developments, however, permit the use of statistical

procedures that control for these problems.

        This paper uses new panel econometric techniques that reduce statistical shortcomings with

existing growth studies along with new data to re-examine the relationship between stock markets,

banks, and economic growth. More specifically, we examine whether measures of stock market and

bank development each have a positive relationship with economic growth after (i) controlling for

simultaneity bias, omitted variable bias, and the routine inclusion of lagged dependent variables in

growth regressions, (ii) moving to data averaged over five-years, instead of quarterly or annual data,

to abstract from business-cycle influences, (iii) using a new system, panel estimator that eliminates

the biases associated with the difference panel estimator, (iv) assessing the robustness of the results

using several variants of the system estimator, and (v) controlling for many other growth

determinants. We also assess whether the stock market and bank indicators jointly enter the growth

regression significantly. In terms of data, we use the same basic measures of bank and stock market

 Also, see Atje and Jovanovic (1993), Harris (1997), Levine (2001), and especially Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad
(2002) for additional evidence on the stock market, bank, and growth relationship. These studies, however, do not use
panel econometric procedures that control for simultaneity bias.

development as in Levine and Zervos (1998), but we improve on previous efforts by more carefully

deflating the data. Indicators of financial development are frequently measured at the end of the

period. These financial development indicators, however, are frequently divided by the GDP, which

is measured over the period. We rectify this problem since it may create substantial mis-

measurement in high-inflation countries.

       Methodologically, we (1) construct a panel with data averaged over five-year intervals from

1976 to 1998 to abstract from business cycle relationships and (2) employ the system panel estimator

developed by Arrellano and Bover (1995) since Blundell and Bond (1998) show that a system panel

estimator that simultaneously uses both the difference panel data and the data from the original levels

specification produces dramatic increases in both consistency and efficiency. We use different

variants of the system panel estimator. As discussed in Arellano and Bond (1998), the one-step

system estimator assumes homoskedastic errors, while the two-step estimator uses the first-step errors

to construct heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors (e.g., White, 1982). Due to the large

number of instruments that are employed in the system estimator, however, the asymptotic standard

errors from the two-step panel estimator may be a poor guide for hypothesis testing in small samples

where over-fitting becomes a problem. This is not a problem in the one-step estimator.

Consequently, we use the one-step panel estimator, the two-step estimator, and a novel, alternative

procedure developed by Calderon, Chong and Loayza (2000). This alternative system estimator

reduces the dimensionality of the instruments to avoid the over-fitting problem but still permits the

construction of heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors. The shortcoming of this alternative

procedure is that we lose a period from the sample.

       Thus, besides assessing the impact of stock markets and banks on economic growth, this

paper contributes to the literature on panel estimation procedures. While Arellano and Bond (1991)




                                                   5
and Blundell and Bond (1998) note the potential biases associated with standard errors emerging

from the two-step estimator in small samples and while they recognize that these potential biases

must be balanced against advantages of using heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors, this paper

exemplifies the differences that emerge from these two procedures. Moreover, we use Calderon,

Chong, and Loayza (2000)’s modification that limits the over-fitting problem and thereby reduces

potential biases associated with the two-step estimator. We provide evidence using all three

approaches. The results suggest that it is indeed important to use all three estimates in drawing

economic inferences.

       This paper finds that markets and banks are important for economic growth. Bank and stock

market development always enter jointly significant in all the system panel estimators that we

employ. These findings are strongly consistent with models that predict that well-functioning

financial systems ease information and transaction costs and thereby enhance resource allocation and

economic growth. Further, the measure of stock market development and the measure of bank

development frequently both enter the growth regression significantly after controlling for other

growth determinants, country specific effects, and potential simultaneity bias. This suggests that both

banks and markets are important for growth. This conclusion, however, must be qualified. The two-

step indicator always indicates that both stock markets and banks independently boost growth. There

are, however, a few combinations of control variables -- government size, inflation, trade openness

and the black market premium – when using the one-step and alternative panel estimators in which

only bank development or stock market liquidity enters with a p-value below 0.05. While we read

the bulk of the results as suggesting that both markets and banks independently spur economic

growth, the fact that the results are not fully consistent across all econometric methods and

specifications may lead some to conclude that overall financial development matters for growth but it




                                                   6
is difficult to identify the specific components of the financial system most closely associated with

economic success.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and simple

OLS regressions. Section 3 introduces the econometric methodology. Section 4 presents the main

results and section 5 concludes.



2. The Data and Preliminary Regressions

        A. Data

        We analyze the link between stock market and bank development and economic growth in a

panel of 40 countries and 146 observations. Data are averaged over five 5-year periods between 1976

and 1998.4 Moving to a panel from pure cross-sectional data allows us to exploit the time-series

dimension of the data and deal rigorously with simultaneity. The theories we are evaluating focus on

the long-run relationships between stock markets, banks, and economic growth. Thus, we use five-

year averages rather than annual (or quarterly) data to focus on longer-run (as opposed to higher

frequency) relationships. Nevertheless, there are important weaknesses with the measures. Theory

focuses on the role that stock markets and banks may play in reducing informational asymmetries and

lowering transactions costs. We do not, however, have direct measures of the degree to which

markets and banks in a broad cross-section of countries ameliorate information and transactions

costs. Consequently, while recognizing the absence of a direct link between theory and

measurement, we use proxy measures of banking system size and stock market activity to gauge

cross-country differences in stock market and bank development. This section describes the

indicators of stock market and bank development, the conditioning information set, presents

 Thus, the first period covers the years 1976-1980; the second period covers the years 1981-1985, and so on. The last
period only comprises the years 1996-98. Financial data are from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2000).

descriptive statistics, and provides OLS regression results of stock markets, banks, and economic

growth.

       To measure stock market development, we use the Turnover Ratio measure of market

liquidity, which equals the value of the trades of shares on domestic exchanges divided by total value

of listed shares. It indicates the trading volume of the stock market relative to its size. Some models

predict countries with illiquid markets will create disincentives to long-run investments because it is

comparatively difficult to sell one's stake in the firm. In contrast, more liquid stock markets reduce

disincentives to long-run investment, since liquid markets provide a ready exit-option for investors.

This can foster more efficient resource allocation and faster growth [Levine, 1991; Bencivenga,

Smith, and Starr, 1995].

       We experimented with other measures of stock market development that were used by Levine

and Zervos (1998) and Rousseau and Wachtel (2000). Value Traded equals the value of the trades of

domestic shares on domestic exchanges divided by GDP. Value Traded has two potential pitfalls.

First, it does not measure the liquidity of the market. It measures trading relative to the size of the

economy. Second, since markets are forward looking, they will anticipate higher economic growth

by higher share prices. Since Value Traded is the product of quantity and price, this indicator can rise

without an increase in the number of transactions. Turnover Ratio does not suffer from this

shortcoming since both numerator and denominator contain the price. We also considered Market

Capitalization, which equals the value of listed shares divided by GDP. Its main shortcoming is that

theory does not suggest the mere listing of shares will influence resource allocation and growth.

Levine and Zervos (1998) show that Market Capitalization is not a good predictor of economic

growth. Finally, as noted in the introduction, we deflate the market capitalization ratio, which is

measured at the end-of-period by end of period price deflators and the flow variables (GDP and




                                                    8
trading variables) by a deflator for the whole period. This eliminates the potential mis-measurement

induced by inflation.

       To measure bank development, we follow Levine and Zervos (1998) and use Bank Credit,

which equals bank claims on the private sector by deposit money banks divided by GDP. Although

Bank Credit does not directly measure the degree to which banks ease information and transaction

costs, Bank Credit improves upon alternative measures. First, unlike many studies of finance and

growth that use the ratio of M3 to GDP as an empirical proxy of financial development, the Bank

Credit variable isolates bank credit to the private sector and therefore excludes credits by

development banks and loans to the government and public enterprises. Second, as noted, we deflate

the end-of-period credit variables by end-of-period deflators and the GDP flow variables by a deflator

for the whole period. Then we take the average of the real credit variable in period t and period t-1

and relate it to the real flow variable for period t. This reduces mis-measurement that is common in

past studies of stock markets, banks, and growth.

       To assess the strength of the independent link between both stock markets and growth and

bank development and economic growth, we control for other potential determinants of economic

growth in our regressions. In the simple conditioning information set we include the initial real GDP

per capita to control for convergence and the average years of schooling to control for human capital

accumulation. In the policy conditioning information set, we use the simple conditioning information

set plus either (i) the black market premium, (ii) the share of exports and imports to GDP, (iii) the

inflation rate or (iv) the ratio of government expenditures to GDP.

       Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations. There is a wide variation of bank and

stock market development across the sample. While Taiwan had a Turnover Ratio of 340% of GDP

in 1986-90, Bangladesh had a Turnover Ratio of only 1.3% in 1986-90. While Taiwan’s banks lent




                                                    9
124% of GDP to the private sector in 1991-1995, Peru’s financial intermediaries lent only 4% during

1981-85. We note that while Economic Growth is correlated significantly with the Turnover Ratio, it

is not significantly correlated with Bank Credit. Turnover is significantly correlated with bank

development.

       B. OLS Regressions

       Table 2 presents OLS regression of economic growth averaged over the 1976-98 period with

one observation per country. There are 40 countries in the sample. The dependent variable is real

per capita GDP growth. Each of the five reported regressions control for the logarithm of initial

income and the logarithm of average years of schooling. The regressions include Bank Credit and the

Turnover Ratio. The regressions also control sequentially for government consumption, trade

openness, inflation, and the black market exchange rate premium. The p-values of the coefficient

estimates are reported in parentheses.

       The OLS regressions demonstrate a strong positive association between stock market

development, bank development, and economic growth. Both bank development (Bank Credit) and

stock market development (Turnover Ratio) enter each of the five regressions significantly at the 0.05

significance level. Table 2 also indicates that the Bank Credit and the Turnover ratio enter jointly

significantly as indicated by the p-value of less 0.01 on the Wald test for joint significance.

Interestingly, the sizes of the coefficients are economically large. According to the lowest coefficient

estimates, an improvement of Egypt's level of Bank Credit from the actual value of 24% to the

sample mean of 44% would have been associated with 0.7 percentage points higher annual growth

over the period 1975-98. Similarly, if Egypt’s Turnover Ratio had been the sample mean of 37%

instead of its actual value of 10%, Egypt would have enjoyed nearly one percentage point higher

annual growth. While these counterfactual examples should not be viewed as exploitable elasticities,




                                                    10
they do suggest an economically meaningful relationship between financial development and

economic growth. As we will see, the sizes of the coefficients in the simple OLS regressions are very

similar to the results we obtain using more sophisticated dynamic panel estimators.

3. The Methodology

       While Levine and Zervos (1998) show that stock market development and banking sector

development are robust predictors of growth, their results do not imply a causal link between the

financial sector and economic growth. To control for possible simultaneity, they use initial values of

stock market and bank development. Using initial values of the explanatory variables, however,

implies not only an efficiency (informational) loss but also a potential consistency loss. If the

contemporaneous behavior of the explanatory variables matters for current growth, we run the risk of

grossly mis-measuring the “true” explanatory variables by using initial values, which could bias the

coefficient estimates. Using proper instruments for the contemporaneous values of the explanatory

variables is therefore preferable to using initial values.

       To assess the relationship between stock market development, bank development and

economic growth in a panel, we use the Generalized-Method-of Moments (GMM) estimators

developed for dynamic panel models by Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen (1990), Arrellano and Bond

(1991) and Arrellano and Bover (1995). We can write the traditional cross-country growth regression

as follows.

                yi ,t − yi ,t −1 = αyi ,t −1 + β ' X i ,t + η i + ε i ,t                     (1)

where y is the logarithm of real per capita GDP, X represents the set of explanatory variables, other

than lagged per capita GDP and including our indicators of stock market and bank development, η is

an unobserved country-specific effect, ε is the error term, and the subscripts i and t represent country

and time period, respectively. We also include time dummies to account for time-specific effects.



                                                                       11
        Arrellano and Bond (1991) propose to difference equation (1):

        ( yi ,t − yi ,t −1 ) − ( yi ,t −1 − yi ,t −2 ) = α ( yi ,t −1 − yi ,t − 2 ) + β ' ( X i ,t − X i ,t −1 ) + (ε i ,t − ε i ,t −1 )   (2)

While differencing eliminates the country-specific effect, it introduces a new bias; by construction

the new error term, ε i ,t − ε i ,t − 1 is correlated with the lagged dependent variable, yi ,t − 1 − yi ,t − 2 .

Under the assumptions that (a) the error term, ε , is not serially correlated, and (b) the explanatory

variables, X, are weakly exogenous (i.e., the explanatory variables are assumed to be uncorrelated

with future realizations of the error term), Arrellano and Bond propose the following moment

conditions.

           [             (
         E y i , t − s ⋅ ε i , t − ε i , t −1   )]   = 0   for s ≥ 2; t = 3, ..., T                                                        (3)


           [              (
         E X i , t − s ⋅ ε i , t − ε i , t −1   )]   = 0   for s ≥ 2; t = 3, ..., T                                                        (4)

Using these moment conditions, Arellano and Bond (1991) propose a two-step GMM estimator. In

the first step the error terms are assumed to be independent and homoskedastic across countries and

over time. In the second step, the residuals obtained in the first step are used to construct a consistent

estimate of the variance-covariance matrix, thus relaxing the assumptions of independence and

homoskedasticity. The two-step estimator is thus asymptotically more efficient relative to the first-

step estimator. We refer to the GMM estimator based on these conditions as the difference estimator.

This is the estimator that Rousseau and Wachtel (2000) use with annual data to examine the

relationship between stock markets, banks, and economic growth.

        There are, however, conceptual and statistical shortcomings with this difference estimator.

Conceptually, we would also like to study the cross-country relationship between financial sector

development and economic growth, which is eliminated in the difference estimator. Statistically,

Alonso-Borrego and Arellano (1996) and Blundell and Bond (1998) show that in the case of



                                                                             12
persistent explanatory variables, lagged levels of these variables are weak instruments for the

regression equation in differences. This influences the asymptotic and small-sample performance of

the difference estimator. Asymptotically, the variance of the coefficients rises. In small samples,

Monte Carlo experiments show that the weakness of the instruments can produce biased coefficients.

Finally, differencing may exacerbate the bias due to measurement errors in variables by decreasing

the signal-to-noise ratio (see Griliches and Hausman, 1986).

       To reduce the potential biases and imprecision associated with the difference estimator, we

use an estimator that combines in a system the regression in differences with the regression in levels

[Arellano and Bover, 1995 and Blundell and Bond, 1998]. The instruments for the regression in

differences are the same as above. The instruments for the regression in levels are the lagged

differences of the corresponding variables. These are appropriate instruments under the following

additional assumption: although there may be correlation between the levels of the right-hand side

variables and the country-specific effect in equation (1), there is no correlation between the

differences of these variables and the country-specific effect. Given that lagged levels are used as

instruments in the regression in differences, only the most recent difference is used as an instrument

in the regression in levels. Using additional lagged differences would result in redundant moment

conditions (Arellano and Bover, 1995). Thus, additional moment conditions for the second part of

the system (the regression in levels) are:

          [                                          ]
        E ( yi ,t − s − yi ,t − s − 1 ) ⋅ (η i + ε i ,t ) = 0     for s = 1          (5)


          [                                              ]
        E ( X i ,t − s − X i ,t − s − 1 ) ⋅ (η i + ε i ,t ) = 0      for s = 1       (6)

Thus, we use the moment conditions presented in equations (3) – (6) and employ the system panel

estimator to generate consistent and efficient parameter estimates.




                                                                13
       The consistency of the GMM estimator depends on the validity of the assumption that the

error terms do not exhibit serial correlation and on the validity of the instruments. To address these

issues we use two specification tests suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover

(1995), and Blundell and Bond (1998). The first is a Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions,

which tests the overall validity of the instruments by analyzing the sample analog of the moment

conditions used in the estimation process. The second test examines the hypothesis that the error

term ε i ,t is not serially correlated. We test whether the differenced error term is second-order

serially correlated (by construction, the differenced error term is probably first-order serially

correlated even if the original error term is not). Failure to reject the null hypotheses of both tests

gives support to our model.

       Both the difference and the system estimator present certain problems when applied to

samples with a small number of cross-sectional units. As shown by Arrellano and Bond (1991) and

Blundell and Bond (1998), the asymptotic standard errors for the two-step estimators are biased

downwards. The one-step estimator, however, is asymptotically inefficient relative to the two-step

estimator, even in the case of homoskedastic error terms. Thus, while the coefficient estimates of the

two-step estimator are asymptotically more efficient, the asymptotic inference from the one-step

standard errors might be more reliable. This problem is exacerbated when the number of instruments

is equal to or larger than the number of cross-sectional units. This biases both the standard errors and

the Sargan test downwards and might result in biased asymptotic inference.

       We address this problem threefold. First, we consider the first-stage results. While the

coefficient estimates are less efficient, the asymptotic standard errors are unbiased. Second, we

include a limited number of control variables at a time. Specifically, for the policy conditioning

information set, we only include one additional policy variable at the time, rather than including them



                                                     14
all at once, as in the usual cross-country growth regressions. This reduces the number of instruments

to less than the number of cross-sectional observations. By keeping the instrument set small, we

minimize the over-fitting problem and maximize the confidence that one has in the more efficient

two-step system estimator.

       Third, we use an alternative specification of the instruments employed in the two-step system

estimator. Typically, users of the difference and system estimator treat the moment conditions as

applying to a particular time period. This provides for a more flexible variance-covariance structure

of the moment conditions (Ahn and Schmidt, 1995) because the variance for a given moment

condition is not assumed to be the same across time. This approach has the drawback that the

number of overidentifying conditions increases dramatically as the number of time periods increases.

Consequently, this typical two-step estimator tends to induce over-fitting and potentially biased

standard errors. To limit the number of overidentifying conditions, we follow Calderon, Chong and

Loayza (2000) and apply each moment condition to all available periods. This reduces the over-

fitting bias of the two-step estimator. However, applying this modified estimator reduces the number

of periods in our sample by one. While in the standard DPD estimator time dummies and the

constant are used as instruments for the second period, this modified estimator does not allow the use

of the first and second period. While losing a period, the Calderon, Chong, and Loayza (2000)

specification reduces the over-fitting bias and therefore permits the use of a heteroskedasticity-

consistent system estimator.




                                                   15
4. The Results

           A. System Estimator: One- and Two-Step Results

           The results in Table 3 show that (i) the development of stock markets and of banks have both

a statistically and economically large positive impact on economic growth, and (ii) these results are

not due to simultaneity bias, omitted variables or country-specific effects. The p-values in

parentheses are from the two-step estimator. The stars in Table 3 indicate the significance of the

coefficients on the stock market and bank variables based on the one-step standard errors. Thus,

Table 3 indicates the significance of stock market and bank development for both the two-step and

one-step estimators.5

           The Turnover Ratio and Bank Credit both enter significantly (at the one-percent level) and

positively in all five regressions using the two-step estimator. The one-step estimator, however,

indicates that Bank Credit does not always enter with a p-value below 0.10. Specifically, Bank Credit

does not enter significantly when controlling for either trade openness or inflation.6 However, even

with the one-step estimator, the financial indicators always enter jointly significantly. Our

specification tests indicate that we cannot reject the null-hypothesis of no second-order serial

correlation in the differenced error-term and that our instruments are adequate.

           As noted earlier, we use the system estimator because the more commonly used difference

estimator (i) eliminates the cross-country relationship and focuses only on across time differences,

(ii) suffers from imprecision and potentially biased estimates in small samples (Alonso-Borrego and

Arellano, 1996; and Blundell and Bond, 1998), and (iii) may exacerbate biases by decreasing the

signal-to-noise ratio (Griliches and Hausman, 1986). Thus, econometric theory suggests that the

system estimator offers gains in both consistency and efficiency. Our results support this contention.

5
    None of the other explanatory variables enters significantly in the first-step regressions.




                                                                16
The system results in Table 3 produce sharper results than the difference estimator and the level

estimator results, which are given in Appendix Tables A2 and A3 respectively. Thus, using the

system estimator makes a difference in terms for the inferences that one draws concerning the

relationship between stock markets, banks, and economic growth.

         The two-step results in Table 3 are not only statistically, but also economically significant. If

Mexico’s Turnover Ratio had been at the average of the OECD countries (68%) instead of the actual

36% during the period 1996-98, it would have grown 0.6 percentage points faster per year. Similarly,

if its Bank Credit had been at the average of all OECD countries (71%) instead of the actual 16%, it

would have grown 0.8 percentage points faster per year.7 These results suggest that both bank and

stock market development have an economically large impact on economic growth.

         B. Alternative System Estimator

         We also examine the Calderon, Chong, and Loayza (2000) alternative system estimator that

reduces the over-fitting problem of the two-step estimator while obtaining heteroskedasticity-

consistent standard errors. Unlike in Table 3 we only report the significance levels of the two-step

estimator in Table 4 because we do not have an over-fitting problem.

         Stock market liquidity and bank development each enter the growth regressions significantly

in Table 4, except when controlling for trade openness. In the regression controlling for trade

openness, Bank Credit enters with a p-value below 0.05, but Turnover is insignificant. Even in this

regression, however, they enter jointly significantly. Both bank development and stock market

development, however, enter individually significantly in the other four regressions. Overall, these

results suggest an independent link between growth and both stock market liquidity (Turnover) and


6
  These results are consistent with the findings by Boyd, Levine, and Smith (2000) that inflation exerts a negative impact
on financial development.
7
  We calculate this by taking the lowest coefficients across the five columns, 0.958 in the case of Turnover Ratio and
0.538 in the case of Bank Credit.


                                                            17
bank development (Bank Credit). The Calderon, Chong and Loayza (2000) adjustment to the

standard two-step system estimator produces both consistent coefficients and heteroskedasticity

consistent standard errors in the Table 4 results. It does this at the cost of reducing the size the

instrumental variable matrix. Since the regressions in Table 4 pass the Sargan and serial correlation

tests, this adjusted two-step system estimator seems to offer a particularly useful assessment of the

stock market, bank and growth relationship.

        We also examined the importance of the frequency of the data for our results by using annual

data. The system panel estimator using data averaged over five-year periods and the pure cross-

country regressions using data averaged over the entire 1975-98 period produce very consistent

results. However, the system panel results using annual data are different. As shown in Appendix

Table A4, while both financial development indicators enter jointly significantly, only Turnover

enters individually significantly. The relationship between Bank Credit and growth breaks down

when moving to annual data.8 Given recent work, however, this result is not surprising. Loayza and

Ranciere (2002) find that short-run surges in Bank Credit are good predictors of banking crises and

slow growth, while high levels of Bank Credit over the long-run are associated with economic

growth. These results emphasize the significance of using sufficiently low-frequency data to abstract

from crises and business cycles and focus on economic growth.



8
  These results are not fully consistent with Rousseau and Wachtel’s (2001) findings because they find that both bank and
stock market development enter individually significantly, not just jointly significantly. Their empirical model differs
from ours along several dimensions. First, they use different financial development indicators: M3/GDP to measure
financial intermediary development, and stock market capitalization and trading relative to GDP (deflated by market price
indices) to proxy for stock market development. In contrast, for reasons discussed above, we use credit to the private
sector as a share of GDP to measure bank development, and we use trading relative to market size to measure stock
market activity while simultaneously controlling for market price changes. For both of these measures, we carefully
deflate the financial variables. Second, our sample period is different. Rousseau and Wachtel (2001) estimate their
model over the 1980-1995 period, which does not comprise the East Asian crisis. We are able to extend the sample
period back to 1976 and forward to 1998. Overall, although our annual results do not fully confirm Rousseau and
Wachtel’s (2001) findings, our results using both 5-year averages and data averaged over the entire period are consistent
with Rousseau and Wachtel’s results. This underlines the importance of controlling for business cycle effects when
examining the stock market, bank, and long-run growth nexus.


                                                           18
5. Conclusions

       In sum, the results strongly reject the notion that overall financial development is unimportant

or harmful for economic growth. Using three alternative panel specifications, the data reject the

hypothesis that financial development is unrelated to growth. Stock market development and bank

development jointly enter all of the system panel growth regressions significantly using alternative

conditioning information sets and alternative panel estimators. Thus, after controlling for country-

specific effects and potential endogeneity, the data are consistent with theories that emphasize an

important positive role for financial development in the process of economic growth.

       This paper also assessed the independent impact of both stock market development and bank

development on economic growth. In general, we find across different estimation procedures and

across different control variables that both stock markets and banks enter the growth regression

significantly. For instance, with the traditional two-step system estimator, both stock market liquidity

and bank development each enter the growth regressions significantly regardless of the control

variables. Similarly, with the Calderon, Chong, and Loayza (2000) two-step alternative estimator

that reduces the over-fitting problem of the two-step estimator but obtains heteroskedasticity-

consistent standard errors, we find that both stock market liquidity and bank development enter all of

the growth regressions significantly except for one. These findings suggest that stock markets

provide different financial services from banks, or else multicollinearity would produce jointly

significant results but would not produce results where stock market and bank indicators each enter

the growth regression significantly. However, the one-step system estimator provides a more

cautious assessment. In two out of the five specifications, only one financial development indicator

enters individually significantly. While we interpret the bulk of the results as suggesting that both

markets and banks independently spur economic growth, the one-step results may lead some readers




                                                   19
to conclude that overall financial development matters for growth but it is difficult to identify the

specific financial institutions associated with economic success.

        Econometrically, this paper’s techniques improve significantly over existing studies on the

link between banks, stock markets and economic growth. By using average values and using

instrumental variables to extract the exogenous component of bank and stock market development,

we control for biases induced by simultaneity, reverse causation and unobserved country-specific

effects, while at the same time avoiding the informational and consistency loss implied by using

initial values. Furthermore, this paper’s findings suggest that it is important to use alternative

specifications of the system panel estimator in drawing inferences. The two-step estimator produces

heteroskedasticity-consistent coefficients, but may produce standard errors that are biased downwards

in small samples. The one-step estimator produces consistent standard errors, but does not yield

heteroskedasticity-consistent coefficients, which is important in economic growth regressions. The

Calderon, Chong and Loayza (2000) adjustment to the standard two-step system estimator produces

both consistent standard errors and heteroskedasticity consistent coefficients, but it does this by

reducing the information content of the instrumental variable matrix. In small samples, this adjusted

measure seems to offer a reasonable compromise, especially if the system passes the Sargan- and

serial correlation tests.
