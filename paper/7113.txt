I. Introduction

        Syndicated bank lending is the Chevy Cavalier of international financial markets.

For the same reasons that Motor Trend devotes little space to basic transportation,

academics pay little attention to international bank lending, preferring to concentrate on

rapidly growing market segments like the sport-utility vehicle and the international bond

market, or exotic products like high-performance sports cars and derivative credit

instruments. What is relevant to the vast majority of consumers thus receives relatively

little attention.

        In this paper we argue that more attention to international bank lending is

warranted for three reasons. First, the syndicated bank loan remains one of the

workhorses of international capital markets. As Table 1 shows, loan commitments have

been every bit as important as bonds in the first half of the 1990s. While new bond issues

rose from negligible levels at the beginning of the 1990s to more than $100 billion in

calendar year 1996 and $128 billion in 1997 before falling back in the wake of the Asian

crisis, loan commitments have also trended steadily upward, actually exceeding bond

issues in every year through 1995 but one (1993) and nipping at the heels of new bond

issues in both 1996 and 1997.

        Second, international bank lending is particularly important for the private-sector

borrowers whose participation is the distinctive feature of international capital markets in

the 1990s and who are likely to dominate the market to an even greater extent in the

future as the privatization of state enterprise and the liberalization of capital markets

proceed. Already one of the striking contrasts between bond and bank lending is the

extent to which sovereigns and other governmental borrowers continue to rely on the

bond market, while private borrowers are disproportionately important to the market in

international bank loans. This is what we should expect, of course, to the extent that
                                                       2

private-sector borrowers about whom information is least complete establish long-term

relationships with banks as a way of resolving information problems. But it means that

the emerging-market bond spreads on which most recent analysis focuses are likely to

provide little, and for that matter potentially misleading, information about what is going

on in this market segment (as Figure 1 suggests).1

          A third reason for focussing on loans is the controversy that has swirled around

the behavior of international bank lending in the wake of the Asian crisis. Spreads on

syndicated bank loans show relatively little variation compared to spreads on

international bonds, raising questions about whether bank lenders are properly pricing

country and credit risk. Low interest rates in Tokyo are said to have encouraged Japanese

banks to develop an excessive appetite for emerging-market debt. Growing competition

in Europe as a result of the Single Market is said to have eroded domestic margins and to

have encouraged second-tier European banks to scramble into Asian markets in search of

yield.2 Moreover, with banks enjoying deposit insurance, lender-of-last-resort services,

and in some cases implicit and explicit guarantees—along with the expectation that they

will be able to withdraw their funds on demand insofar as the IMF injects offsetting

resources in response to a crisis—it has been suggested that spread compression on

    Figure 1 plots average spreads on all new loan commitments and new bond issues in the 1990s. In only
    half the quarters do average spreads on loans and bonds move in the same direction. Note that average
    loan spreads are much smaller than those for bonds and move in a smaller band. A clue to the reason lies
    in the contrasting reactions to the Mexican and Asian crisis. Following the devaluation of the Mexican
    peso in December 1994, bond and bank loan spreads in the primary market diverge. The decline in bond
    market spreads reflects a sharp change in the composition of the pool of borrowers: only the best quality
    issuers were able to tap the bond markets, leaving high-risk borrowers, from Latin America in particular,
    effectively rationed out of the market. In comparison, the commercial loan market, dominated by Asian
    borrowers, was less affected. By contrast, following the onset of the Asian crisis in the last quarter of
    1997, new bank loan commitments fell sharply and spreads increased (to their highest quarterly level
    since the start of the time period under consideration). The response of primary bond market spreads was
    muted by comparison.

    Indeed, one of the striking features of bank lending to emerging markets, as we shall see, is the extent to
    which it is dominated by Asian borrowers.
                                               3

syndicated bank loans to developing countries is an indication of the extent of moral

hazard.

          All these are reasons why bank lending to emerging markets is deserving of study.

Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no systematic study of the determinants of the pricing

of international bank loans in the 1990s that can be used to shed light on these issues.

This paper takes a first step in that direction. It analyzes the pricing of over 4500

international loan commitments to developing countries between 1991 and 1997, years

which span the recent period of heavy lending to emerging markets. This is, in principle,

the entire population of bank loans to emerging markets. We pay special attention to

problems of sample selection, since there are good reasons to suspect that borrowers that

rely on loan commitments for external finance differ in important respects from other

debtors. We analyze both the borrowing decision of enterprises and governments and the

pricing decisions of their bank underwriters, addressing problems of selectivity bias by

treating the two decisions jointly.

          Section II reviews the theoretical literature on bank lending to emerging markets

with the goal of identifying what is special about bank loan commitments as opposed to

other forms of international borrowing and lending. Section III introduces our data set

and describes its features. (More details appear in Appendix A.). Subsequent sections

then consider the roles of short-term debt and domestic bank credit (Section IV), the

determinants of access to international bank loans (Section V), and the implications of

analyzing the commitment and pricing decisions jointly, with a focus on differences in

pricing across regions and over time (Section VI). The bond market providing the

obvious benchmark for assessing our results, we summarize our parallel analysis of the
                                              4

bond issuance decision and launch spreads on emerging market bonds (Eichengreen and

Mody 1998a,b) in Appendix B.



II. Thinking About Loan Commitments

         While international bank lending is no new phenomenon, in the century preceding

World War II the role of banks was limited to underwriting bond issues and to extending

trade credits and making interbank deposits. This changed in the 1970s with the rise of

intermediate term, floating rate, general obligation syndicated bank loans to developing

countries. Syndicated bank lending exploded from less than $50 billion in 1972 to more

than $300 billion in 1982, when it was interrupted by Mexico’s debt moratorium. Net

capital flows then reversed direction. Only at the end of the 1980s, with the completion

of the major Brady Plan reschedulings, did the volume of bank lending to developing

countries recover significantly in tandem with the growth of the bond market.

         The rise of syndicated bank lending is typically understood in terms of three

factors: information asymmetries, contract enforcement, and moral hazard. In turn,

changes in these factors are invoked to explain the growth of the bond market in the

1990s.

         Information Asymmetries

         Bond and equity issues have the advantage of speed and low transactions costs.

An infrastructure project needs only to be given a credit rating by a rating agency, at

which point it can be brought to the market. A syndicated bank loan, in contrast, must go

through a lengthy process of approval by a series of internal loan committees. It is thus

striking that relatively few infrastructure projects in emerging markets have secured

financing through securities markets. Bank loans must have other advantages.
                                             5

       An obvious explanation is that banks have sunk the costs of investing in a

technology for monitoring borrowers. The same theories of delegated monitoring that

emphasize the informational role of banks vis-à-vis smaller, less reputable domestic

borrowers similarly suggest a role for banks in providing external finance for precisely

those foreign borrowers about whom market information is least complete. These

“pecking order theories” of finance suggest that emerging market borrowers seeking

external finance graduate from bank finance to bond finance and finally to equity finance

as information about their credit worthiness becomes more complete.

       One of the earliest formalizations of this notion, by Kletzer (1984), emphasized

asymmetric information about the level of the debtor’s external obligations. Kletzer

pointed out that it can be important for creditors to know the aggregate amount loaned to

a debtor (since that debtor may otherwise borrow in excess of its credit ceiling, at which

point it will have an incentive to renege on its commitments) and similarly to know the

terms of earlier loans. The role of the bank syndicate is to provide a mechanism through

which lenders can pool information. Kletzer shows that when creditors can only observe

their own loans they will lend larger amounts at higher interest rates than when there is

common information. Under relatively general conditions the borrower is better off with

observability, since the reduction in interest rates more than compensates it for the

reduction in credit availability. Hence, where information is least complete, bank loan

contracts will be incentive compatible.

       This formulation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that developing countries

often appear to be able to borrow more freely from banks than bond markets (Allen

1990). This suggests that the emphasis should be placed not on the difficulty of verifying

the level of indebtedness per se, but rather on the difficulty of obtaining and evaluating
                                             6

information about other borrower characteristics affecting the willingness and ability to

repay. While it may be difficult for bondholders to evaluate the likely construction costs

and prospective revenue stream associated with an infrastructure or manufacturing

project, commercial and investment banks have the project-evaluation capability and the

long-term relationship with the borrower needed to obtain the relevant information and

carry out this evaluation.

       Note that these theories of delegated monitoring, while they can explain the

preference for bank over bond finance, cannot by themselves explain the preference for

syndicated bank lending. To this one must add another consideration, like the

assumption that individual emerging market loans are too large for individual banks to

finance given capital requirements, restrictions on loan concentrations, and prudent risk-

management practices. Thus, syndicated bank lending provides both delegated

monitoring and portfolio diversification services. The fact that even direct syndicates (in

which there is no lead bank) usually appoint a manager or agent to act as the conduit for

information between the syndicate and borrower is consistent with this interpretation.

       It is then straightforward to explain the recent rise of the bond market in terms of

improvements in the information environment. Emerging markets having strengthened

auditing, accounting and disclosure requirements for their banks and corporates, the

informational advantages of the banks eroded. But as the Asian crisis serves to remind,

there remains a significant gap in auditing, accounting and disclosure standards between

emerging and advanced-industrial countries. It is not surprising that there remains a

significant role for the banks.
                                             7

       Contracting and Recontracting

       Because the banks comprising a syndicate form a cohesive group (relative to

bondholders who tend to be more numerous and heterogeneous), banks should be better

positioned to enforce debt contracts (Edwards, 1986). If concerted lending is required to

maximize the value of existing claims, a bank syndicate will be in a better position to

undertake it than a large number of disbursed bondholders. Sachs and Cohen (1982)

were among the first to argue that the cohesiveness of bank syndicates opens up

opportunities for renegotiating defaulted debts. In their model, spreads on bank loans are

lower than spreads on bonds, other things equal, since in the event of debt-servicing

difficulties bank loans can be rescheduled, while in the case of bonds there is only the

option of default. The fact that the syndicated loan sector generally allows borrowers to

raise larger sums than they would be able to obtain through the bond market is consistent

with this view. So is evidence provided by Preece and Mullineaux (1996), who show that

the response on capital markets to announcements of private financings declines with the

number of lenders in the syndicate, as if rising numbers imply rising recontracting costs,

consistent with the assumption that a role of bank syndicates is to lend where

renegotiation is likely to be important.

       Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) invert the argument, pointing out that default can be

devastating for the borrower as well as the lender, so that the possibility of rescheduling

bank loans encourages borrowers to engage in brinkmanship, which renders bank loans

riskier than bonds. Bonds may be preferred to bank loans, in other words, because the

absence of sharing, majority voting and collective representation clauses heightens the

cost of default and therefore provides a precommitment technology.
                                             8

       The obvious reconciliation is that both ex ante bonding and ex post recontracting

have value. Debtors who value bonding will go through the bond market (the repetition

in this sentence is purposeful), while debtors who place a high shadow price on the ability

to recontract will borrow from banks.

       Moral Hazard

       Finally, there is the possibility that lending to emerging markets is undertaken by

banks because they are sheltered from the associated risks by the financial safety net.

Among the first to emphasize moral hazard in international lending were Folkerts-Landau

(1985) and Gutentag and Herring (1985), who argued that the risk premia charged on

international bank loans were likely to be smaller than those on international bonds

insofar as central banks and governments provide implicit or explicit insurance against

the risks of international bank lending. This explanation has received considerable

attention in the wake of the Asian crisis, academics and officials having argued that

banks were inclined to lend (and debtors to borrow) because they enjoyed implicit and/or

explicit guarantees.


III. Data

       To shed further light on these interpretations, we consider the pricing of

syndicated bank loans to emerging markets in the 1990s. We limit our attention to loans

priced off the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR). Thus, the interest paid by the

borrower is LIBOR plus a spread, which reflects the risk premium. Over the life of the

loan, the spread stays fixed but the interest rate paid moves with LIBOR. Between 1991

and 1997, just over 5000 LIBOR-based loans were made to emerging markets. We are

able to analyze the spreads on about 4500 loans, the subset of the population for which

complete loan and country characteristics are available.
                                                     9

          The Loans: Numbers, Spreads, and Issuers

        East Asian borrowers have dominated the international loan market. Of the 5,115

loans issued between 1991 and 1997, 3,373 were to East Asia, followed by Latin

America and the Caribbean with 543, and Eastern Europe, Middle East and North Africa,

and South Asia each with about 350 loans.3

        Table 2 shows that international loans have been made largely to private borrowers

(especially in manufacturing and finance). Public sector borrowers (as distinct from

sovereigns) have also borrowed in significant numbers, especially for infrastructure and

other services (the category “Government” in Table 2 refers to borrowings supported by

local or national governments without an identified sectoral use of proceeds).

          The average spread above LIBOR is 112 basis points. For emerging market

bonds issued during the same period, spreads were significantly larger, averaging 256

basis points (Table 3). The average spread on loans remained relatively steady, ranging

from a low of 98 basis points in 1991 to a high of 117 basis points in 1994. Thus, bond

spreads are larger on average and more variable. Interestingly, the ratio of bond to loan

spreads declined over the period, from more than three between 1991 and 1993 to about

two between 1994 and 1997, perhaps indicating some maturing of the bond market. The

higher bond spreads do not simply reflect the regional composition of loans and bonds: in

fact, loan spreads are lower than bond spreads within each individual region. Loans also

have significantly shorter maturities than bonds (3-4 years verses 8-10 years on average).

        Private borrowers typically pay higher spreads than public borrowers (Table 4), and

spreads are lower for loans contracted by financial institutions. Except where contracted

directly by sovereigns, loans for infrastructure and utilities command higher spreads than

3
    East Asia has also been the most prominent floating-rate bond market issuer, although Latin America has
                                                       10

loans for investment in other sectors, a somewhat surprising finding in view of the

generally assumed stability of earnings in this sector. (The longer tenor of the loans in

this sector (Table 5) may partly explain the higher spreads, as we show below.)

          Explanatory Variables

          We used a variety of macroeconomic and financial indicators to study the loan

commitment and pricing decisions. Throughout, our goal was to keep the empirical

specification as comparable as possible to that used in our previous work on international

bonds. Thus, we regressed the loan spread (including fees) on standard macroeconomic

characteristics of the country of the borrower using data assembled principally from the

World Bank’s World Debt Tables and Global Development Finance and the IMF’s World

Economic Outlook data base and International Financial Statistics, although where

necessary we used national sources to supplement these data. As in our previous work,

we included the ratio of debt to GNP, whether the country had rescheduled in the

preceding year, the ratio of debt service to exports (the lagged rate of GDP growth in

1990 prices, denominated in domestic currency), and the variance of export growth. To

proxy for other more-difficult-to-quantify characteristics of country credit worthiness we

included the residual from a first stage regression of the most recent sovereign credit

rating (gathered from Institutional Investor Magazine and published each March and

September) on a vector of standard economic and financial determinants.4 We also

considered the share of short term debt in total commercial bank debt (provided by the




    a significant presence in the fixed-rate bond market.
4
    We included only the residual component of the credit rating since the raw credit rating is highly
    correlated with a number of the other economic and financial indicators in the equation; indeed, it is well
    known that the rating agencies rely on those indicators when doing the rating exercise. In identifying
    explanatory variables for the first-stage regression we followed the literature on the standard
    determinants of sovereign credit ratings (e.g. Cantor and Packer 1996 and Haque et al. 1996).
                                             11

Bank of International Settlements) and the ratio of domestic credit to GDP, two variables

that turn out to be important in what follows.

       As characteristics of the issuer we considered whether it was a private entity,

whether it was a supranational, and whether it had borrowed previously on the syndicated

loan market. As a measure of global credit conditions we included the log of the 3-year

U.S. treasury rate (the average maturity for loans being between 3 and 4 years). As

characteristics of the loan we included its amount, maturity, and currency of

denomination. Finally, we included the industrial classification of the borrower

(manufacturing, financial services, infrastructure and other utilities, other services, and

government).



IV. Basic Results

       We use ordinary least squares regressions to highlight some of the basic

relationships in the data. The first column in Table 6 shows that loan spreads decline

with the amount loaned (reflecting economies of scale) and rise with loan maturity

(reflecting greater risk as maturity increases and suggesting that lenders value the

liquidity of short-term loans and their ability to discipline borrowers). Private loans and

Latin American borrowers pay higher spreads.

       The second column introduces a variable designed to capture the importance of

relationship banking. The first time a borrower appears during the 1991 to 1997 time

frame, the variable takes the value 1; it is then incremented each time the borrower

reappears. Repeated borrowings (the number of times the borrower has come to the bank

loan market previously) have a very strong negative effect consistent with the notion that
                                                       12

relationship banking is used to overcome information asymmetries.5 Though many

borrowers came to the market only once during this period (of the 5115 borrowings, 2173

were from one-time borrowers), several borrowed on multiple occasions.6 The point

estimate in the second column of Table 6 suggests that an additional loan commitment

reduces the spread by 2.4 percent, other things equal. Note that the coefficient on the

“private” dummy becomes less significant when the relationship variable is introduced,

reflecting the higher incidence of multiple borrowing by private borrowers.7

          Table 6 also indicates that borrowings in yen, and to a lesser extent deutsche

marks, carry lower spreads, other things equal. This is consistent with the presumption

that supply-side conditions (low Japanese funding costs, declining margins in Europe)

helped to fuel lending to emerging markets.8 Financial institutions also pay lower

spreads on their borrowings, consistent with the emphasis some observers have placed on

the influence of implicit and explicit guarantees. When sectoral dummies are added, the

significance of the maturity variable declines since, as noted, maturities vary between

sectors. Note that the longer maturity of lending for infrastructure projects can help

explain the unusually high spreads on such loans (referred to above), although spreads on

loans for infrastructure (the omitted sectoral control) still remain unusually high.

5
    This interpretation should be held cautiously, for a number of reasons. For one, we have only been able
    to construct a variable for repeated bank borrowings, not repeated borrowings from a syndicate headed
    by the same loan arranger. And second, there is the possibility that those who are repeatedly able to
    borrow from the banks differ in other ways that are not readily observed by the econometrician but are
    well known to all participants in financial markets, and not just to bank lenders.
6
    Over a thousand borrowings represented between the fourth and 10th borrowings and about 500 were for
    borrowers who were entering into a loan contract on more than the tenth occasion.
7
    However, the significance on the private dummy reappears when country characteristics are introduced.
8
    We were also able to identify for about 3500 borrowers the nationality of the lead loan arranger. These
    results are not presented at this time because many observations are lost. However, the results for a
    subset of loans do tend to show, contrary to suggestions, that the existence of cross-default clauses and
    proportional sharing rules have rendered bank loans to LDCs homogeneous—in other words, that the
    value and pricing of a loan is not affected by the identity of the lender—that there is strong evidence here
    that the identity of the arranger affects the level of the spread. Consistent with the low cost of funds in
                                                   13

        In Table 7, we introduce a number of country characteristics to further explain the

spreads charged. The majority of these carry over from our earlier analysis of bond

spreads (Eichengreen and Mody 1998 a,b). The three debt variables (the debt/GNP ratio,

a dummy for debt rescheduling if one occurred in the previous year, and the debt

service/export ratio) show that, as for bonds, spreads rise with debt levels, a history of

rescheduling, and higher debt service in relation to exports. High country growth rates

enhance the ability to repay and reduce spreads; highly variable export growth, on the

other hand, raises the risk of non-payment and increases the spread. The credit rating

residual, which measures the effect of country credit rating factors not explicitly included

in our analysis, always gives a strong negative sign: a larger residual implies a better

rating and a lower spread. The directional influence of these variables is robust across

subsamples (as discussed below), although their relative importance and statistical

significance varies.9

        To get closer to some hypotheses that have featured in the recent debate over

Asian crisis, we added measures of the country’s short-term indebtedness and the ratio of

domestic bank credit to GDP. Some observers have argued that, prior to the crisis,

neither bank lenders nor other markets participants appreciated the risks associated with

short-term debt. Our findings cast some doubt on this assumption: for the full set of

loans, a low ratio of international reserves to short-term debt significantly raises spreads,

while a larger share of short-term debt in country’s total outstanding bank debt has a

strong, significant, positive impact on spreads. This is a robust result that holds across

regions, with the noteworthy exception of East Asia in recent years (as we discuss


  Japan and the urgency of Japanese banks’ search for yield, spreads on loans originated by Japanese banks
  consistently display the smallest spreads.
                                                    14

below). Overall, however, banks appear to have attached a higher risk premium to

borrowers in countries with large amounts of short-term debt even before the factor was

highlighted in the recent crisis.10

       A high ratio of domestic bank credit to GNP is a proxy for the existence of deep

domestic financial markets. Other things equal, the presence of deep markets should

reduce spreads on international bank borrowing by implying a more stable financial

environment and more local competition for foreign lenders (Levine and Zervos 1998).

While our findings confirm this presumption, the effect is small and statistically

insignificant (see Column 3 of Table 7). To further examine the relationship between

international bank spreads and domestic bank credit, we therefore added to the regression

the interaction of the growth rate with the bank credit stock/GDP ratio (and its square). It

appears that where rapid growth and high levels of bank credit are both present, spreads

are higher (Columns 4 and 5). An interpretation is that high GNP growth rates fueled by

the expansion of domestic credit (domestic credit booms) were viewed by the market

with concern. Note that with the addition of the non-linear terms, the bank credit

stock/GDP ratio now has a negative and significant sign while the squared term is

positive and significant. In other words, at low levels of financial development and low

growth rates, policy measures to improve financial intermediation bring value and reduce

the costs of external borrowing, but when they spill over into unsustainable credit booms,

they are regarded by the markets with alarm and worsen the terms of access to external

funds.


9
   Relative to Edwards (1986), we find the same signs on the coefficients for loan size, loan maturity, GDP
   growth, debt/GDP ratio, and the debt-service-to-export ratio but generally stronger and more robust
   effects.
10
   The coefficient on the interaction of short-term debt with the “relationship” variable shows that high
   short-term debt lowers the value of familiarity to the market. High growth reduces the risk premium
   associated with high-short term debt, although here too regional variations are important.
                                               15

       Comparing these findings with our earlier results for the bond market

(reproduced in the Appendix B), one is struck by the similarity of the determinants of

spreads. The debt variables, the growth of GDP, and the variance of export growth all

enter with the same signs and significance in equations for the full set of bank loans and

bonds. At the same time, some of the differences between the two data sets are consistent

with the notion that borrowers and lenders resort to bank intermediation to attenuate

information problems. The coefficient for private borrowers is smaller in the bank-loan

equations, as if banks are better able to overcome the special information obstacles to

lending to private entities. The effect of the country credit rating residual is smaller for

bonds than bank loans, as if characteristics that are readily observable by the credit-rating

agencies play a smaller role in this market.



V. Determinants of Loan Commitments

       Since the (unobserved) characteristics of those who borrow from international

banks are likely to be different from those that do not, we also estimate the spreads

equation after correcting for selectivity bias. The procedure requires estimating a probit

equation which distinguishes borrowers from non-borrowers. To estimate the probit, we

created a set of observations for which the dependent variable took the value “zero” when

a loan commitment did not materialize. If no loan was made to a specific type of issuer

(private, public, or sovereign) in a particular country in a particular quarter, then a zero

was recorded; where a loan commitment was made, we recorded a one.
                                                       16

           Results are reported in Table 8.11 We see that a rise in the U.S. treasury rate

significantly increases the probability of observing a new loan commitment. This is very

different from the finding for the bond market, where the treasury rate (for 10-year

maturity, in keeping with the tenor of bonds issued) showed a strong negative sign. In

Eichengreen and Mody (1998b), we noted that the primary effect of a rise in U.S. interest

rates was through a decline in the issuance of bonds. Some have interpreted this

phenomenon as a flight to quality: high interest rates lead bondholders to shun risky

investments; in addition, risky borrowers may prefer to wait for better market conditions.

For bank loans, in contrast, borrowers appear to be willing to pay higher rates in order to

retain access to the market, which is plausible insofar as these are floating rate

instruments (so that borrowing in periods of tight global credit conditions does not lock

them into high interest rate).

             The regional variation here is of some importance. For the East Asian

subsample, the coefficient on the U.S. treasury rate, though positive, is not statistically

different from zero; and, in some specifications, a higher interest rate lowers the

probability of a bank loan commitment in East Asia, as in our analysis of the bond

market, though the effect is rarely significant. An interpretation is that East Asian

borrowers had relatively favorable access to the market (prior to the recent crisis) and

were better able to wait for global credit conditions to improve. The East Asian

coefficient contrasts with that for Latin America and South Asia, where higher interest

rates increase the probability of new loan commitments. Our spreads equation with the

correction for selectivity confirms that there is little significant impact of U.S. Treasury

rates on spreads, in contrast to the selectivity corrected results for the bond market. The

credit rating residual, the debt-to-GDP ratio, and the absence of recent debt rescheduling

appear to act as screening variables in all regions, with favorable values increasing the

probability of a loan.12 In regions other than East Asia, a higher debt-to-export ratio is

associated with a higher probability of borrowing. Strikingly, higher domestic bank

credit appears to be more strongly associated with foreign borrowing in East Asia than in

other regions. As discussed in IMF (1998), this may reflect the extensive reliance of East

Asian domestic financial systems on international credit, ironically for economies with

such high savings rates.

         In light of the recent attention paid to the level of international reserves (Feldstein,

1999), we examine their role from two perspectives. The ratio of reserves to short-term

debt relates the adequacy of reserves to short-term obligations on capital account, while

the ratio of reserves to imports measures reserve adequacy for trade-related obligations.13

The two reserve ratios turn out to be important in different ways. The lower is the level

of reserves in relation to imports, the more limited is access to international loans, as if

countries in more fragile payment positions find it more difficult to borrow. While this is

a significant effect in the full sample and for each region, the differences across regions

are noteworthy. Low reserves reduce access most dramatically in the relatively closed

economies of South Asia and least in highly export-oriented East Asia. But when

reserves are viewed in relation to short-term external debts, the opposite seems to be true.




12
   The exception is a recent debt rescheduling in Eastern Europe, which appears to be associated with a
   higher rather than a lower probability of observing subsequent loan commitments. South Asia did not
   reschedule debt in the period analyzed.
13
   As Fischer (1999) notes, “countries need to set their reserve holdings on the basis of capital, as well as
   current, account variables.”
                                                     18

More short-term debt does not screen out borrowers; rather, borrowers in countries with

relatively low reserves relative to short-term debt are more likely to borrow again.14

         Overall, then, the results for bank borrowing are similar to those for the bond

market. The greater tendency for a heavy debt burden to ration borrowers out of the

market in Latin America than East Asia is the same as we previously obtained using an

entirely different data set for the bond market. Similarly, the ratio of debt service to

exports strongly increases the probability of observing new loan commitments and new

bond issues for Latin America but has a more modest effect in East Asia.



VI. Results with Selectivity Correction: Differences Across Regions and Over Time

         Following Heckman (1979), we assume that the error terms in the two equations

are bivariate normal with standard deviations s1 and s2 and covariance s122 (where p2 =

s122/s1s2). The model can then be identified by the nonlinearity of the fitted probability in

the selection equation and by the inclusion of independent variables in the selection

equation that are not also included in the pricing equation. We estimated the system

using maximum likelihood. Table 9 reports the same pricing equation as before, this time

with the selectivity correction. The coefficients are reasonably robust to the selectivity

correction. And by the standards of the bond market, syndicated bank lending exhibits

little interregional instability.15




14
   Fischer (1999) points out that the demand for reserves will increase as capital accounts become more
   open. Our finding cautions that some part of the build-up in reserves may be unstable if it occurs
   through increases in private external short-term obligations.
15
   It will be noted, though, that the coefficients for Latin America are estimated imprecisely and that some
   of the South Asian coefficients are counterintuitive (e.g., that on the growth rate). Multicollinearity
   appears to be responsible for these problems. In the next section, we show that a pared down
   specification produces plausible results.
                                                       19

           The t-statistic of the coefficient on lambda, the Inverse Mills Ratio, summarizes

the importance of selectivity. An insignificant lambda implies that the error terms in the

probit and spreads equations are not correlated and that there is little selection bias. This

appears to be the case when the full loan set is considered: lambda is small and

statistically insignificant (the correlation between the error terms in two equations is

negative 0.06). However, evidence of selectivity is stronger when we disaggregate

regions. While the East Asian lambda is negative, that for the other regions is positive

(which explains the absence of an effect in the full sample). The normal presumption

would be a positive coefficient: entities with characteristics that make them unlikely

borrowers but who come to the market anyway will be charged higher spreads. This is

what we find for Latin American, Eastern Europe and South Asia. In East Asia,

however, borrowers who are not expected to come to the market but do so anyway are

paradoxically charged unusually low spreads.16

           The bottom panel of Table 9 shows the point estimates at the regional mean

values for GDP growth, short-term debt ratio, and the bank credit stock, all of which are

entered interactively. For the full set of loans, we find the same signs on these variables

as when there are no interaction terms: faster GDP growth and a higher bank credit stock

reduce spreads, other things equal, while a higher ratio of short-term debt raises spreads.

These results have plausible explanations, as discussed earlier. For East Asia, the high

GDP growth rate has a double pay-off: not only does it have the direct effect of reducing

spreads, but it mitigates the effect of short-term debt. Thus, while East Asia has the

highest ratio of short-term debt of all regions (0.65 compared to 0.55 in Latin America


16
     This may reflect hard-to-measure characteristics of these countries associated with unusually favorable
     growth prospects (“Asian values”), implicit guarantees, or some other factor. Note, however, that the
     statistical significance of this coefficient is marginal.
                                                       20

and 0.43 in Eastern Europe), the impact on spreads is (on the margin) smaller in Latin

America or Eastern Europe. However, the high domestic-bank-credit-to-GDP ratio (2.9

compared to 1.1 in Latin America and 0.7 in Eastern Europe) coupled with high growth

carries a penalty in terms of raising spreads.17

         Considering the probit and spreads equations together allows us to interpret the

impact of variables entering both equations in terms of supply and demand. Henceforth

we use “demand” to refer to the demand by commercial banks for emerging market

exposure and the term “supply,” in keeping with our bond market terminology (“supply

of bonds”), to refer to the willingness by emerging market borrowers to contract for

international loans. The credit rating residual, the debt/GDP ratio and the debt

rescheduling variable all affect the demand by commercial banks for exposure to

emerging markets. Better credita larger credit rating residual, a smaller debt/GDP ratio,

and absence of recent debt reschedulingincreases the probability of observing a new

loan commitment while lowering the spread. This result parallels that for bonds.

         For the full set of loans, the U.S. treasury rate appears to shift the demand

curvea rise in U.S. interest rates increases the probability of loans while lowering the

spreads, suggesting that when interest rates rise banks are willing to lend more at lower

spreads.18 However, regional differences are significant. For East Asia, the supply effect

seems to predominate in the market for loans (as in the market for bonds): while a rise in

the U.S. treasury rate narrows spreads, the change in the number of new loans is

statistically insignificant, suggesting that the East Asians are able to move along a


17
   The signs for Latin America and Eastern Europe are the same as for the full set of loans. The within-
   South-Asia results are harder to interpret: the signs on all three variables are the opposite of those for the
   full loan set.
18
   Note, of course, that though the spreads decline, the overall interest rate charged to emerging markets
   borrower rises.
                                                      21

relatively inelastic commercial bank demand curve. For Latin America the supply shift

dominates as well, although it works in the opposite direction. With a rise in interest

rates, the Latin American supply curve shifts out, increasing the number of loans while

also requiring borrowers to pay higher spreads. The result for Latin American loans is

thus in contrast to that for bonds, where a rise in interest rates was associated with lower

issuance and higher spreads, indicating a fall in demand. The results suggest that, in

periods of high interest rates, high quality borrowers (traditionally from East Asia and

non-emerging-market countries) withdraw from the syndicated bank loan market

temporarily, but Latin American issuers seek to retain access, for which they are willing

to pay a higher price.

           Another variable that mainly shifts the supply curve (as for bonds) is the ratio of

debt service to exports: a higher ratio typically raises the number of new loans while

increasing spreads. A variable that was not included in our earlier bond analysis, the

ratio of reserves to short-term debt, also serves to shift supply: when reserves fall in

relation to short-term debt, the number of new loans increases along with spreads. For

East Asia, the increases in stock of domestic bank credit in relationship to GDP are

associated with shifts in supply for international loans.

           Finally, we consider changes over time in an attempt to see if the data throws

some light on recent events. We estimate the same model as in Table 9 for East Asian

loan commitments for different time periods. For each of these periods, we then calculate

the marginal effect of the variables of interest. (Table 10).19 Consider, for example, the

impact of the ratio of short-term bank debt, which we can relate to total bank debt or to

the level of reserves. The marginal effect is to raise the spreads in the early years, but


19
     Variables whose coefficients we do not report tended to show no significant changes over time over time.
                                                        22

this effect falls after 1994 and turns negative in 1995-97, due to high growth in the region

(see the bottom panel of Table 10). An interpretation is that international bankers, while

typically cautious of high short-term debt, appear to have been taking an optimistic view

in East Asia on account of the ability of borrowers in the region to service the debt

through rapid growth. Ultimately, of course, growth expectations declined, and the high

short-term debt ratios suddenly came to be seen as unsustainable.20

           These results make it easier to understand why investors should have become so

concerned about the level of short-term debt in various East Asian countries in the mid-

1990s. While high levels of short-term debt had been characteristic of East Asia for some

time, there was a certain knife-edge quality to their sustainability. Rapidly growing firms

value the flexibility of short-term loans, while lenders for their part are comforted by the

relationship built through rolling over the loans and by the growth prospects for servicing

them in the future. But if doubt is cast on the ability to service these loans and their

supply is summarily cut off, growth can fall sharply, further depressing confidence in the

ability to repay.



VII. Extensions and Sensitivity Analyses

         We explored the robustness of our results in several ways. Our finding that bank

lending increases with a rise in the relevant U.S. treasury rates led us to examine the

influence of the yield curve. We then focussed on alternative measures of the adequacy of

reserves. Finally, for two regions, Latin America and South Asia, where the full set of

variables gave somewhat imprecise results, we examined more parsimonious models.

20
     This unsustainability is also evident in the behavior over time of reserves to short-term debt. Both the
     mean and the coefficient on the ratio of reserves to short-term debt move to raise spreads: reserves
                                                     23

       Yield curve. An important difference between our results for bank loans and

bonds is the different response to U.S. interest rates. While bond issuance appears to fall

with the U.S. treasury rate (for ten-year maturity), bank lending appears to rise with the

treasury rate (the relevant maturity in this case being three years). The possibility that

our different results reflect the use of different interest rates led us to add a measure of

the yield curve, the difference between the ten-year and one-year treasury rates. Note

from Table 11 that the sign on the yield curve is negative and highly significant, while

the sign on the three-year treasury rate now becomes negative (though not significant).

In other words, bank lending now appears to increase when three-year treasury rates fall

or when the yield curve becomes flatter.21 This result points to the possibility that when

the yield curve is compressed, expectations of future interest rate increases are dampened,

thus increasing the propensity to borrow. The second column of Table 11 suggests that

the yield curve shifts do not significantly influence the spreads charged.

       Influence of reserves on spreads. The third and fourth columns of Table 11 add

the reserves/imports ratio to the spreads equation. The reserves/imports ratio now enters

positively, the reserves/short-term debt ratio negatively. The coefficients are almost the

same in magnitude, as if when short-term debt increases to finance imports and reserves

remain unchanged, then there is no impact on spreads, but that when short-term debt rises

for reasons unrelated to a trade transaction, then it raises spreads.

       Alternative Latin American and South Asian models. For both Latin America

and South Asia, the interaction terms included in the spreads equation were a source of

multicollinearity. Moreover, the correlation among the country variables is high. The


  decline in relation to short-term debt and the penalty for low reserves in relation to short-term debt
  increases.
                                                      24

fifth and sixth columns of Table 11 therefore present more parsimonious versions of the

Latin American and South Asian spread equations. The results are now consistent with

the pattern observed for the full sample and other regions. The coefficients for Latin

America also display greater statistical significance. For South Asia, the “wrong” sign on

GDP growth disappears and higher growth is seen to produce a statistically significant

and quantitatively large reduction in spreads. Thus, the more parsimonious specification,

by reducing multicollinearity, eliminates some of the anomalous results reported above.22



VIII. Conclusion

         Our analysis of spreads charged by international banks to emerging-market

borrowers reveals a market that reacts to macroeconomic and financial information in

much the same manner as the bond market. The close correspondence between the two

sets of empirical results for capital flows intermediated by different institutions is

surprising, even striking. Institutional connections between the two markets may help to

explain this finding. Banks are sometimes the main subscribers to emerging market

bonds, while traditional bond market investors, such as insurance companies and pension

funds, increasingly participate in what are misleadingly referred to as bank syndicates.

Such convergence will only increase over time as financial mergers bring “bond” and

“bank” market participants under one corporate roof.




21
   Since a rise in the three-year rate is typically accompanied by compression of the yield curve, the two
   different channels of influence are not easy to distinguish.
22
    An alternative approach to identifying the cases of non-lending is to consider for each country and each
   quarter the different industrial sectors as issuers. We grouped the data into five industrial categories, as
   described above. Thus, each country in each quarter has five potential borrowers. If a loan is observed
   for any of these borrowers, a “one” is generated; otherwise a “zero” is recorded. This then becomes the
   basis for the probit and the joint estimation of the probit and the spreads equation. The results remain
   virtually unchanged.
                                             25

       That said, the relationship between macroeconomic and financial variables on the

one hand and pricing behavior on the other is more stable over time for bank loans than

bonds. It is tempting to interpret this in terms of the relatively long period for which

bank lending has been underway and the greater maturity of that segment of the capital

market.

       The large number of small bank loans issued in the 1990s, in comparison with the

smaller number of larger bond issues, highlights the role of international bankers in

dealing with the ongoing production and trade financing requirements of small borrowers

in particular. In other words, international banks continue to play an important role in

meeting the external financing needs of their borrowers in ways that the bond market

cannot duplicate.

       East Asia’s special relationship with the international banking system is evident

from the raw numbers and from the statistical relationships alike. The evidence points to

East Asia’s greater historical ability to time its entry and exit from the market. Where

borrower heterogeneity is important, East Asian borrowers are seen to benefit from their

unobserved credit characteristics.

       Is there evidence of growing moral hazard affecting international bank lending?

We do see evidence of growing bullishness in the first half of the 1990s by bank lenders

to East Asia, which may reflect moral hazard. But on this issue it is fair to say that the

jury remains out.

       Finally, our results point to the riskiness of high levels of domestic debt. High

short-term debt can coexist for extended periods with rapid growth but is liable to unravel

if perceptions of sustainability shift. The results thus caution once again excessive

dependence on short-term debt.

              APPENDIX A: Data sources and construction of variables

Loan characteristics
      The loan data set, obtained from Capital Data Loanware and further processed by
the Emerging Markets Division of the International Monetary Fund, covers the period
1991 to 1997 and includes: (a) average weighted margins plus fees (in basis points, where
one basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point) (b) the amount of the issue
(millions of US$); (c) the maturity in years; (d) whether the borrower was a sovereign,
other public sector entity, or private debtor; (e) number of borrowings by an entity during
the period under consideration; (f) currency of issue; (g) borrower’s industrial sector:
manufacturing, financial services, utility or infrastructure, other services, or government
(where government, in this case, refers to subsovereign entities and central banks, which
could not be classified in the other four industrial sectors); (h) the country and regional
identity of the borrower.
