                                            ABSTRACT

With the decline of the traditional hukou system, migrants in China have a broad set of cities to choose
from. Within an open system of cities, compensating differentials theory predicts that local real estate
prices will reflect the marginal valuation of non-market local public goods. More polluted cities will
feature lower real estate prices. But, local pollution may be caused by booming local industries. To
address such endogeneity concerns, we estimate hedonic regressions using an instrumental variable
strategy based on “imports” of pollution from nearby sources. By documenting the importance of spatial
emissions patterns, our study highlights how real estate prices in one city are affected by Pigouvian
externalities originating in another location. On average, a 10% decrease in imported neighbor pollution
is associated with a 1.8% increase in local home prices.

Introduction


        Many cities in China have extremely high air pollution levels. Based on ambient

particulate concentration criteria of PM10, twelve of the twenty most polluted cities in

                                                                                 1
the world are located in China (World Bank 2007b).                                   In 2003, 53% of the 341

monitored cities – accounting for 58 percent of the country’s urban population –

reported annual average PM10 levels above 100 μg/m3 , and 21% of cities reported

PM10 levels above 150 μg/m3. Only one percent of China’s urban population lives in

cities that meet the European Union’s air quality standard of 40 μg/m3 (World Bank

2007a).

        Air pollution has caused severe health damage in China (Wang and Mauzerall

2006). The World Bank (2007a, 2009) estimates that 13% of all urban premature

deaths may be due to ambient air pollution. The overall health damage due to air

pollution is roughly 3.8% of GDP in China. (World Bank 2007a, 2009). Exposure to

outdoor air pollutants increases the incidence of lung cancer, cardiorespiratory diseases

and possibly low birth weight (Pope et al., 2002; Dockery et al., 1993; Almond et al.,

2009).

        With the recent decline of the traditional Chinese hukou system, falling cross-city

migration costs means that urbanites in China can migrate to areas that offer higher

quality of life (Zheng, et. al. 2009). The urban population is enjoying increased

income and the average urbanite is increasingly well educated. Such households will

be increasingly willing to pay more to protect their health and thus willing to pay more

to avoid urban air pollution.

    Hedonic pricing methods can be used to measure marginal valuations of location

specific attributes such as air pollution. Based on compensating differentials logic,

numerous U.S based studies have estimates the implicit prices of non-market goods

ranging from climate, to pollution, to proximity to public transit (see Rosen 2002).

Cross-city hedonic studies (see Berger, Blomquist and Hoen 1988, Gyourko and Tracy

1991) have ranked which U.S studies have the highest quality of life. Recent research

has used similar techniques for 30 major cities to document that air pollution is

capitalized into Chinese real estate prices (Zheng, Liu and Kahn 2010).

    These past hedonic studies have used ordinary least squares to estimate the hedonic

gradient. Such an estimation strategy is based on the assumption that the hedonic

price equation’s error term is uncorrelated with the regression’s explanatory variables.

But, environmental economists have argued that both local business cycles and the

intensity of enforcement of local regulation would both lead to cases in which a city’s

pollution level is correlated with the hedonic regression’s error term (Zabel and Kiel

2000).

    Recent work in environmental economics based on U.S data has offered a credible

instrumental variables strategy. Bayer, Keohane and Timmins (2009) instrument for a

city’s air pollution levels using nearby “origin” pollution that blows over to the

“destination” city. Such emissions raise the destination’s local ambient air pollution

levels but are unlikely to be correlated with the hedonic pricing equation’s error term.

Other studies also find cross-border emission transport may contribute substantially to

                                                                                       3
both source and downwind regions, therefore one city or region’s air quality depends

upon its own emissions and is affected by emissions from surrounding cities and

regions (Tong and Mauzerall 2008, Liu et. al 2008).

    In this paper, we use the Bayer, Keohane and Timmins (2009)’s instrumental

variables strategy and argue that their logic is even more important in the case of China.

We consider two main types of imported air pollution in Chinese cities: dust and smoke

emissions from neighbor cities’ manufacturing activities, and sandstorm emissions

imported from the sandstorm origin in Inner Mongolia. Our calculations indicate that in

a typical city, about 15% of air pollution in terms of PM10 blows in from neighbors and

the sandstorm origin.

    This paper’s main empirical contribution is to provide new hedonic estimates of

the implicit price of air pollution in 2006, 2007 and 2008 across 85 major Chinese cities.

We find that the implicit real estate capitalization for exposure to air pollution is

growing over time across China’s cities and the estimates are larger when we

instrument as compared to our OLS estimates. Such revealed preference evidence is

useful for policy makers considering the benefits of specific public policies for

reducing ambient air pollution.

    The popular media has written in depth about the pollution challenges that Hong

Kong faces.     Much of this pollution has been imported from nearby Chinese

manufacturing cities such as Zhaoqing, Qingyuan and Heyuan. Such cross-boundary

Pigouvian externalities can have significant real estate market implications for those

who live in the “importing” area. The extent of the pollution damage will depend on

                                                                                         4
how many people live in the destination area and what is their marginal willingness to

pay to avoid pollution is higher. We use our estimates to provide a rough guide to the

potential size of these effects.




Empirical Framework



    In this paper, we will estimate a cross-city hedonic pricing equation and an air

pollution production function. This latter equation will be used as the first stage of two

stage least squares. We begin by discussing the air pollution production function.




The Air Pollution Production Function




We will estimate a simple city level air pollution production function as reported in

equation (1):

lnPMit   a0  a1  X it   2  ln(NEIGHBORit )   3  ln(SANDSTORMi )   4  NORTHi
  5  NORTH _ BORDERi   it



                                                                             (1)

    Where PMit is the PM10 concentration in city i in year t, Xit is a vector of city

attributes that affect the city’s PM10 concentration. This equation embodies standard

measures of the scale of economic activity, climate conditions and industrial

composition (output’s share of manufacturing industry).       In particular, the X vector

includes such attributes such as city population (POP), the output share of
                                                                                         5
manufacturing industry (MANU), rainfall (RAIN), January temperature (JAN) and July

temperature (JULY). Such reduced form estimates have been reported in U.S studies

such as Kahn (1999).

         The more novel feature of equation (1) is the last four explanatory variables. These

will be our instrumental variables in our hedonic pricing equation we report below.

The vector of instruments includes; NEIGHBOR, SANDSTORM, NORTH and

NORTH_BORDER. We construct the NEIGHBOR variable to measure how city i’s time

t emissions is affected by nearby emissions from the j sources. 2 Specifically,

NEIGHBOR is defined as:




NEIGHBORit   smoke emission jt  e
                                                        d ij
                                                                , d ij  120km
                           j                                                                    (2)




Where smoke emissionjt is city j’s smoke emission in year t (in 106 tons).3dij is the

    Recent atmospheric chemistry studies have documented the extent of cross-boundary pollution exports. Tong and
Mauzerall (2008) highlight the importance of interstate emission transfer on local air quality, they use the CMAQ
model simulate and construct a source-receptor matrix for all continental states of U.S. They found out over 80% of
the contiguous states, interstate transport of NOx emissions is more important than local emissions for summertime
peak ozone concentrations. Liu et al. (2008) conduct a similar source-receptor matrix of sulfur emissions focusing
on East Asian emissions on other continental regions, they find that present-day East Asian SO2 emissions account
for at least 20% of total sulfate concentrations over the North Pacific at the surface, and East Asian SO2 emissions
account for approximately 30-50% and 10-20% of background sulfate at the surface over the Western and Eastern
US. Saikawa et al. (2009) also apply MOZART-2 model, and find out China’s aerosol emissions contribute
significantly over neighboring regions by applying global models of chemical transport (MOZART-2) model. They
estimate that, in the Korean peninsula and Japan, an annual average concentration of 1.4μg/m3 of PM2.5 results from
China’s aerosol emissions.

    To better measure the imported pollution from all neighbor cities, we use the smoke emission information of all 286
prefecture-level (or above) cities to construct this NEIGHBOR variable.

                                                                                                                     6

continuous and exponential decreasing function, so the weight declines as the distance

between origin j and destination i increases. 4                            To minimize the likelihood that

instrument is correlated with local city i’s economic activity, we exclude all the

neighbor cities within 120 km from local city i in the above IV equation (i.e., dij>120

km). This variable’s correlation with city j’s GDP per capita is extremely low (-0.04).

         “Sandstorms” represents a unique inter-regional long-distance transported

pollutant. “Sandstorm” is mainly composed of fine sediments originating in arid and

semi-arid regions, and transported by strong winds to about 17 provinces in China.

Similar impacts are also detected in Korea, Japan and even the west coast of the

United States and the southern British Columbia, Canada (Chun 2000; McKendry et al.,

2001). There have been growing concerns about the health damages caused by Asian

sandstorms. Based on a case study in Beijing, Ai (2003) estimates the economic costs

of sandstorm are greater than 2.9% of Beijing’s GDP in 2000. In our model,

SANDSTORM is the distance to the sandstorm origin (Inner Mongolia). We use a

logarithmic specification so the sandstorm’s impact on a city’s air quality also

diminishes when the city moves further from the sandstorm origin.

         The cities north of the Huai River and Qinling Mountains receive subsidized

heating in winter months, while the southern cities are not entitled to centralized

heating. This sector creates high emissions levels because heating’s main energy

    It is worth noting that the wind direction may influence such inter-city pollution diffusion processes, so it should be
included in Equation (2) as an adjustment for the weight matrix. We have not obtained reliable wind direction data at
this stage, so we make a simple assumption that each direction has the same weight.

                                                                                                                           7

to the north        of    the   Huai-River-and-Qinling-Mountains        heating   line,   and

NORTH_BORDER for a subgroup of northern cities adjacent to the line (within 400 km

from the line).




The Hedonic Home Price Equation




    To estimate a cross-city hedonic pricing gradient implicitly assumes that migration

costs are low. Before the 1980s, cross-city labor migration had been strictly regulated

by the hukou system. In the wake of transition to a market economy in 1980s, the

regulation on population mobility was relaxed. Population mobility has substantially

increased since then. During our sampling period (2006-2008), anyone with or without

hukou can freely purchase houses in any cities, so the low migration cost assumption is

plausible.

    We estimate a series of pooled cross-sectional home price regressions. The

equation is presented in equation (3).




lnHPit   0  1  ln(POPit )   2  Ait  3  log(PM it )  it   (3)




Where HPit is home price in city i in year t. Ait are a vector of amenities in city i in year

t, which may include number of hospital beds per capita (SICKBED), number of school

teachers per pupil (TEA_STU), and PM10 concentration (PM), and the temperature

                                                                                            8
discomfort index (TEMP_INDEX, see Zheng, et. al. (2010) for definition). This

regression allows us to test for the size and statistical significance of amenity effectsand

the city’s population scale effect.

    OLS estimates of equation (3) may yield inconsistent results of  3 for at least two

different reasons.   First, air pollution is likely to be higher in those cities experiencing

an industrial boom. Such cities will have more economic activity taking place (a scale

effect) and for many of such cities the active industries will include high polluting

industries (such as steel production).        The environmental regulation “J-curve”

hypothesis offers a second explanation for why it may be a mistake to treat air pollution

as an exogenous attribute. In a cross-national model, Selden and Song (1995) argued

that richer nations are more likely to enact more stringent environmental regulation. If

regulation is effective at lowering air pollution, then air pollution will be low in those

areas that have effective, wealthy government. It would not be surprising that home

prices will be high in such areas.

    We will report both OLS and IV (for PM and POP) hedonic estimates of the

hedonic pricing equation. We are concerned about possible endogeneity of PM10 for

two different reasons. If booming cities (due to dirty industry) have high home prices,

then this will tend to bias the OLS estimates of PM10 towards zero and in fact we could

find that high pollution cities have higher real estate prices (because PM10 proxies for

industrial activity). Alternatively, if good governance cities have low PM10 then we

may overstate the direct effect of PM10 because it proxies in part for good governance

along a variety of dimensions (such as garbage pick-up and general “greenness”).

                                                                                           9
    We instrument for log(PM) using the pollution production function (Equation (1)).

The key identifying assumption is that the exogenous variables such as NEIGHBOR,

SANDSTORM, NORTH and NORTH_BORDER will act as our set of instruments for

PM10. For these to be valid instruments they must determine a city’s PM10 level (due

to the spillover effect) but that are uncorrelated with the error term in equation (2).

    We are also concerned about the endogeneity of city population size (POP). As

documented in the U.S literature, the population is likely to migrate to those cities that

are highly productive and that have high amenities. The error term in equation (3) will

capture the unobserved location specific attributes and the urban population may be

correlated with this. To address this concern, we use the city’s population twenty years

ago (year 1985) and the above exogenous variables to instrument for current city

population. The year 1985 is the earliest year for which we have access to accurate city

population statistics. In addition, year 1985 was the very beginning of China’s market

economy so before that year there had been very little cross-city/rural-to-urban

migration.




The Wage Equation




    We will also estimate a wage regression to see if urban workers in polluted cities

are compensated by earning higher wage. Our wage equation is similar to the hedonic

pricing equation:




                                                                                          10
lnWAGEit    0   1  ln(POPit )   2  Ait   3  log(PM it )   it   (4)




Where WAGEit is the city wage rate for city i in year t.

     We will estimate equations (1) to (4) in each calendar year from 2006 to 2008.

This allows for a simple test of whether the pollution capitalization effect is growing

over time. China’s booming growth and rising educational attainment both suggest

that this capitalization should be growing over time.




Data and Empirical Results



     We restrict our empirical analysis to 85 mainland cities (we do not include Hong

Kong due to a data inconsistency problem). We obtain our city-level data from two

main sources. City population, average home price and most of the amenity variables

come from the China Statistic Yearbooks, China Urban Statistic Yearbooks and the

China Regional Statistic Yearbooks. PM10 concentration data comes from the Data

Center of PRC’s Ministry of Environmental Protection (http://datacenter.mep.gov.cn/),

which is estimated from the official Air Pollution Index (API) based on the MEP API

calculation formula. Since the PM10 data only cover the years 2006 to 2009, while the

home price data covers the years 2005 to 2008 for 85 cities, we restrict our analysis to

the 2006-2008 period. Variable definitions and summary statistics are listed in Table

1.




                                                                                      11
                                   *** Insert Table 1 about here ***




        The home price represents the average sales price of newly-built commodity

housing units. Commodity housing sales account for the majority of the housing

transactions (more than 70%) in Chinese cities. There is no reliable price data for

second-handed housing unit sales so we rely on this commodity housing price measure.

The average annualized home price growth rate was 17% for this time period. In 2008,

the most expensive city is Shenzhen (12,823 RMB per square meter), and the cheapest

city is Kelamayi (1,431 RMB per square meter).6 This large cross-city price variation

is due to productivity and amenity differentials.

        Air quality in Chinese cities has been improving over time. The average PM10

concentration was 0.098, 0.092 and 0.088 mg/m3 for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008,

respectively. Beijing experienced a great air quality improvement in these three years

(0.162, 0.149, 0.124 mg/m3 for 2006, 2007, 2008 respectively) due to factory

shutdowns and short-term traffic control policies introduced before the 2008 Olympic

Game. PM10 concentrations vary significantly across cities. In 2008, the dirtiest city

(Wulumuqi) had a PM10 concentration level (0.149 mg/m3) four times higher than the

cleanest city (Liuzhou, 0.037 mg/m3).7

6
     The exchange rate is roughly 7 RMB per U.S dollar.
7
    China’s API data has been debated regarding its data quality. For instance, Wang et al. (2009) found his
self-measured PM level in Beijing during Olympic period is correlated with official API, but 30% higher. Andrews
(2008) pointed out a likely systematic downward-bias around the “Blue Sky” standard (API less or equal to 100), and
also highlighted a sampling downward bias for dropping monitoring stations in more pollution concentrated traffic
areas in Beijing. These studies triggered some concerns on the measurement errors using Chinese official API data.

Empirical results

      Table 2 reports a series of air pollution production regressions. We run this

regression (Equation (1)) by year. Column (1), (3) and (5) are simple regressions

without our IV variables for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. First, the city

size/ambient pollution elasticity equals roughly .11. The manufacturing share only

has an insignificant effect on PM10 concentration. Rainfall is good for mitigating air

pollution. This simple equation can explain 25% to 35% of the cross-city PM10

variation. In Column (2), (4) and (6) our four cross-boundary variables are included in

the regressions. We find that these IVs are jointly significant at 1% level in the PM

production function and improve the explanation power (R2) by about 0.15 to 0.20.

Imported pollution from neighbor cities has a very significant effect (at the 1% level)

on a local city’s air pollution. In 2008, a 10% decrease of the NEIGHBOR variable

reduces the PM10 concentration by 2.6%. Holding other variables constant, the further

away from Inner Mongolian (sandstorm origin), the better air quality a city has.


Later studies suggest that Wang’s measurement gap between the self-measured data and official API data is mainly
due to sampling and methodological differences (Tang et.al, 2009; Yao et.al, 2009, Simorich, 2009). A recent paper
by Chen et al. (2011) use both API and AOD data to analyze the changes before and after Beijing Olympic, and their
studies suggest two different data sources provide similar evidences. In our studies, we converted API index back to
PM concentration data using the SEPA API formula. Even if there may be a downward bias around the standard
( API = 100), its bias is only less than 5% in the Beijing sample (Andrews, 2008, table 3), it only slightly change the
API level at the margin. In addition, for the second reason addressed by Andrews, it is not likely all the cities are
relocating monitoring stations for data manipulation purpose. So we believe our data based on the API converted PM
concentrations would be reliable, the likely measurement errors would be small for our econometric analysis.
Furthermore, if indeed there is a systematically bias for all the Chinese cities, such an error will not affect the
regression analysis based on the relative changes across the cities at given time period.

      Figure One shows the spatial distribution of NEIGHBOR, thus we can see which

cities are suffering the most from surrounding smoke emissions. Table 3 list the top ten

cities based on imports of surrounding cities’ emissions. We can see that the most

suffered cities are located in the Central region because they are surrounded by other

cities in all directions.

      Table 4 presents the hedonic real estate pricing regression results by year. In each

year we run an OLS regression and two IV regressions. We discuss the OLS regressions

first (Column (1), (4) and (7)). The first fact we learn from the home price regressions is

that bigger cities have higher home prices. The cross-sectional elasticity is about 0.35 to

0.40. We only find very weak and insignificant capitalization effects of a city’s climate

in home prices. The school teacher proxy also has a weak capitalization effect which


8
   While this result stands in contrast to Almond et. al.’s (2009) finding of a pollution jump just north of the border, it
is important to note that we estimate a very different specification. They include a cubic in the geographical area’s
latitude while we include a vector of city specific attributes related to the scale and economic activity taking place
within the city.
                                                                                                                       14
may be due to that this is only a quantity rather than a quality measure. Number of

hospital beds per capita has a significant positive effect on home prices. Cities in the

East Region have a 40%~50% higher price on average than cities in the Central and

Western Regions. We acknowledge that we have a relatively “short” list of city

attributes comparing to the U.S quality of life literature due to data availability problem.

For example, we are unable to find city-level crime information.

    Holding these other factors constant, we find consistent evidence that ambient

particulate matter (PM) is negatively correlated with home prices. Based on the OLS

results, we estimate a pollution elasticity of between -.25 and -.37.




                           *** Insert Table 4 about here ***




    As mentioned above, the OLS regressions may yield biased coefficient estimates

of the PM effect due to possible endogeneity issues. To address this, we report

instrumental variables estimates of equation (3) using equation (1) as our first stage.

Our IV results are reported in Table Four’s columns (2), (5), and (8). The IV estimates

yield more negative PM10 elasticity estimates than the OLS results. This means that

the cross-boundary externality has a significant impact on home prices. We also find

clear evidence that Chinese urban residents’ willingness-to-pay for clean air is

increasing over time. In 2006, we estimate a PM10 elasticity of -.31 (see column (2))

and this grows sharply to -.76 in 2008 (see column (8)). We recognize that this is a

huge growth in a marginal price coefficient in short period of time.     The steepness of

                                                                                           15
this trend merits further research.    In 2008, we estimate that a 10% increase in a

city’s pollution is associated with a 7.1% reduction in local real estate prices.

    To address the endogeneity of city population, in the second set of IV regressions

we also instruct current city population using 1985 city population and other exogenous

variables (Column (3), (6), (9)). We can see that the coefficients of log(POP) become

smaller. The coefficients of log(PM) are similar but a little bit smaller than those in the

first set of IV regressions. In 2006 this coefficient is marginally significant, while in

2007 and 2008 it is significant at 5% and 1% level, respectively.

    Wage regression estimates of equation (4) are reported in Table 5. They show that

the workers in polluted cities are not receiving higher wages. Population size is the

dominant determinant of city wage rate.




The Real Estate Market Consequences of Cross-Boundary Externalities



    Our results documenting both that pollution is “exported” across China and that

pollution is capitalized in cross-city real estate prices highlights the importance of

considering cross-boundary Pigouvian externalities and their consequences for a city’s

quality of life.

    Based on our estimates of equation (1) and (3), we find that a 10% increase in the

NEIGHBOR variable may trigger a 1.8% drop of local home prices. Similarly, a 10%

increase of the city’s distance to the sandstorm origin will contribute to a 2.3% increase

of home price.

                                                                                            16
        If a major city’s quality of life is threatened because it is downwind from major

pollution sources than real estate prices will suffer. The extent of this Pigouvian

externality hinges on several factors. Imagine a case in which there is significant cross

boundary spillovers of pollution from location i to location j but that very few people

live in location j and these people are poor. The total damage caused by the pollution

will be small as compared to an alternative case in which many wealthy people with a

high willingness to pay to avoid pollution are exposed to downwind pollution.

        Hong Kong represents a salient example.9 Hong Kong has been facing two air

pollution issues. One is local street-level pollution mainly from auto-emissions from

diesel vehicles. The other is the smog problem, caused by a combination of pollutants

from motor vehicles, industry, and power plants both in Hong Kong and in the Pearl

River Delta region. Much of this pollution has been imported from nearby Chinese

manufacturing cities such as Zhaoqing, Qingyuan and Heyuan. Annual premature

deaths attributed to the air pollution in 2008 are estimated at 1,200 in Hong Kong, and

associated premature mortality losses amounts to 140 US$ a year (Edgilis, 2009).




Conclusion



9
    Some scholars have examined the relationship between the air quality and housing price in Hong Kong. Almost all
of the hedonic property literature all focuses on the local air quality. For example, Chau, Wong and Lam (2006) find
air pollution has a significant negative impact on property prices, based on their semi-log regression, roughly an
increase of 0.1μg/m3 in the air pollution level (suspended particulates) lowers property prices by 1.28%. Edgilis
(2009) conduct a conservative estimate in the west and central area of Hong Kong, and find that a 10% drop in the
level of SO2 emissions can raise property value by 3.2-3.9%, and a 20% drop in SO2 emission can raise housing
price by 6.5-7.9%.

                                                                                                                 17
     China’s cities suffer from very high pollution levels. With ongoing urbanization

taking place in China, households are growing richer and more educated, and there are

more people being exposed to these high levels of local public bads. Real estate prices

are likely to reflect both of these facts. We find that real estate prices are lower in high

pollution areas and this discount is growing over time. Given that ambient air quality

has recently improved in several of China’s cities, this rising capitalization evidence

suggests that demand for clean air is rising in China.

    We have generated these facts using traditional hedonic methods but exploiting an

important, plausibly exogenous source of variation in local air pollution. Building on

recent work in environmental economics by Bayer, Keohane and Timmins (2009), we

have exploited cross-boundary flows in pollution from origin to destination to provide

new hedonic estimates of the value of avoiding air pollution. Our calculations show that

on average, a 10% decrease of the imported pollution from neighbors is associated with

a 1.8% increase in home prices.

    Future research could use similar methods to study quality of life impacts in other

regional affected areas including Japan’s and South Korea’s cities.             If China’s

emissions significantly affect other nearby nations, then this social damage is unlikely

to be internalized as various air pollution policies are considered for adoption (Sigman

2002).
