                                            ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the impact thus far that the termination of trade restrictions under the Multi Fibre
Arrangement (MFA) which up to the end of 2004 applied to exports of clothing and textiles in key
OECD markets has had on Asian suppliers. The speculation prior to MFA termination had been that
large increases of Chinese exports would ensue, and at the expense of other Asian suppliers. Using
data from US, EU Chinese and other sources, the picture that emerges is only small impacts on
aggregate US and EU imports of clothing and textiles, and equally only small impacts on aggregate
Chinese exports of clothing and textiles. There are, however, large changes in the country pattern
of trade, and also within more narrowly defined product categories. There are large increases in
shipments from China to both the US and the EU, and for the US proportionally more so in textiles
than in clothing. But the US accounts for only 20% of China's exports of clothing and textiles, and
exports to Japan (comparable in size to the US) hardly change, and to Hong Kong fall sharply. There
are also large price falls for shipments to the US and to certain EU countries (Germany). The shares
of other Asian suppliers in US markets generally hold up well, with the largest falls occurring in
preferentially treated non Asian suppliers such as Mexico. In EU markets, with the exception of
India, all non Chinese Asian suppliers experience falls in their market share.

1. Introduction and Summary

  January 2005 saw the termination of the global system of trade restraints on exports

of textiles and clothing that had operated first under the original GATT from 1974,

and then later under the WTO from 1994. This system, known as the Multi Fibre

Agreement (MFA), was of particular significance to the Asian economies and its

prospective demise had prompted much speculation prior to January 2005 of what the

possible effects could be. These economies had seen large increases of exports of

textiles and clothing prior to the removal of the MFA, and especially of clothing, as

they had moved up the ladder of industrialization from largely agricultural to modern

manufacturing and service based economies over a thirty to forty year period.

  Typically, the first major export good in the early high growth experiences in Asia

had been clothing since it involved relatively simple labour intensive production

methods and small amounts of capital equipment. Early in Asian growth Japan in

1930s and 50’s, and subsequently Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in 1960’s and

1970’s, all saw sharp increases in exports of clothing as they grew. In the Korean case

clothing exports grew rapidly from the early 1960’s to account for over 50% of

exports, with this share then progressively falling back as exports of steel, electronics,

chemicals and other products grew later and production of manufactures moved away

from clothing. The textile and clothing sectors were thus critical for these economies

in providing an intitial platform for growth of manufacturing value added,

employment and trade beyond their immediate contribution to GDP.

  Later it was the lower wage Asian economies of China, India, Indonesia, Cambodia,

Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and others who experienced rapid trade growth in




                                            2
clothing 2 . The larger and more diversified of these economies (China, India and

Indonesia) had the larger share of this trade and this is still the case today. But the

smaller and lower wage exporters (Cambodia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal)

continue to expand production and like Korea earlier also now have well over 50% of

their total exports in the clothing sector (over 80% for Cambodia and Nepal).

    Today, one year on from January 2005, evaluating the impacts of removal of the

MFA system of trade restraints on the suppliers from developing Asia is the task set

for this piece, and any analysis needs to take into account both their complexity and

changing circumstances over time. MFA trade restraints reflected mutually agreed

bilateral (country to country) limits on growth rates of exports on a product by

product basis which were renegotiated every 5 years after 1974. The larger export

markets under restraint were those of the United States and the European Union, but

others including Canada were similarly restrained. But when the Uruguay Round of

Global Trade Negotiations was concluded in 1994, and which also lead to the creation

of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the same year, a commitment was entered

into by both importing and exporting countries to progressively phase out the MFA

system of restraints over 10 years. This was to be completed by the end of 2004, but

most of the adjustments involved were delayed until the end of the ten-year

implementation process.

    Also when the resulting Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) was negotiated

in 1994 China was outside the WTO/GATT and still had a long road to travel to

become a WTO member (accomplished in December 2001, 7 years after the ATC was

agreed). Expectations among larger Asian suppliers such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan,

Bangladesh and others were initially high for the post MFA period, but had to be

 See also the discussion of the relative competitiveness of different supplying countries and their wage
costs in USITC (2004). Table 3-1 (p. 3 – 7) provides data on hourly compensation separately for textile
and clothing industries for 2002 for these Asian suppliers (with the exception of Nepal and Cambodia).

revised once China’s accession to the WTO was at hand. In addition, other trade

restraints not included in the MFA system (such as tariff and anti dumping duties)

remained in place; and key importers such as the US and EU had entered into

preferential arrangements with regional suppliers as part of regional trade agreements,

quite separate from the MFA. This included Mexico for the US and Turkey for the EU,

both of whom had seen sharp growth in exports under these arrangements.

  A further effect of the MFA had been its generation of quota hopping foreign

investment; moving production away from newly constrained to temporarily

unconstrained countries and inefficiently proliferating clothing industries in more

countries than would have been the case in the absence of the MFA. It was believed

that MFA elimination would be a major negative for the more marginal infrastructure

and distance constrained suppliers (such as Nepal) that this process had spawned as

global production became more concentrated in a smaller number of core supplying

countries.

  Prior to January 2005 there had also been much speculation as to what the impacts

of MFA termination would be on the dynamic and more rapidly growing Asian

exporters, and especially of clothing. Much of this focused on China as the largest

shipper, and India as the second largest; but also included Pakistan, Philippines,

Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam

and others. It was widely believed that production in and exports from Asia would

grow significantly post MFA, but that production in and exports from China would

increase even more rapidly, since China was believed the most efficient Asian

supplier of clothing items. MFA abolition was also seen as a further positive for

Asian suppliers in that it would significantly weaken the effects of the trade

preferences extended by the US and EU, mainly in the 1990’s, to non Asian suppliers



                                          4
including Mexico (by the US) and Turkey (by the EU) under regional trade

agreements. The import shares of these preferential suppliers had been growing

significantly prior to MFA removal.

  Asian exporters, as a broadly defined group, were expected to gain market share in

the US and the EU both from MFA abolition and with it the weakening of preferences

to non Asian suppliers, but individual country effects were anticipated to vary. These

impacts were thought likely to reflect a series of country specific factors. One was the

relative importance of the quota constrained US and EU markets for individual

countries. China, for instance, was shipping more clothing to Japan which was already

free of restraint than to the US and the EU, but this feature was special to China who

accounted for around 80% of Japan’s imports. Other countries, such as India, shipped

more heavily to the US and the EU and so quota removal would impact a larger

fraction of exports.

  Special country situations also entered. Bangladesh was already free of restraint in

EU markets prior to MFA abolition and was thought likely to lose EU market share to

newly quota free imports from elsewhere. Vietnam remained under restraint post

MFA as a non WTO member. Where countries stood in their industrialization process

was yet another factor. Cambodia, for instance, was a rapidly growing supplier but at

an early stage of industrialization. Their growth rate was thought probably to fall a

little under MFA elimination but likely be little affected. In contrast, the Philippines

as a long standing MFA participant with established MFA quota and higher cost

structure was thought likely to see acceleration in the relative decline they had

experienced over the 3 – 4 year prior to January 2005. Some countries, including

Bangladesh and Pakistan, benefited from GSP tariffs and the weakening of these




                                           5
preferences was a further factor. Impacts on fibre producers (cotton exporters such as

Pakistan and others) also entered.

     Over 12 months on from January 2005 China’s textile and clothing exports have

increased, as expected 3, but only at a modest rate of 7% for clothing (see Table 5).

Also aggregate imports of textiles and clothing by both the US and the EU have

increased at modest rates (6% for US clothing imports). But there have been sharp

increases in China’s exports to the US and the EU; 56% for US clothing imports from

China. The increases are several hundreds of percent in some categories of clothing,

and export prices for Chinese clothing sold in these markets have fallen sharply.

These have been accompanied by sharp falls in Chinese exports to Hong Kong, and

close to flat exports to Japan (which are of roughly equalize to China’s exports to the

US). Increases in China’s exports to the US and the EU occur most dramatically in the

few months immediately following MFA abolition, and in part reflect expectations by

Chinese shippers of subsequent pressure from the US and the EU for new export

restraints, which were introduced in the form of bilaterally negotiated restraint

agreements in the summer and fall of 2005. There is thus substantial volatility in

monthly Chinese trade data following the removal of the MFA. Data for the month of

October 2005, for instance, show Chinese clothing exports falling by 18% from

month earlier figures, while data for January 2006 show large increases in exports in

some key product categories.

      Exports from Asian suppliers other than China to the US (India, Pakistan,

Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia) have held up reasonably well to the

termination of the MFA and most have increased, although at more modest rates than




3
    Also see the recent discussion of the impacts of MFA removal in James (2005).


                                                    6
has been true for China 4 . The Philippines, whose industry was already in relative

decline, and Sri Lanka has witnessed declines in exports along with suppliers with

remote locations and weak infrastructure (Nepal). All non Chinese Asian suppliers

except India experience falls in their market share in the EU. There are clear negative

effects on consumer prices in previous quota constrained OECD markets (the US and

the EU), and employment in clothing in OECD countries continues to fall (it was also

falling prior to 2005).

     Several factors seem to account for this overall picture of country impact. One is

that new restraints on China introduced in 2005 in US and EU markets (after the MFA

was terminated) have mitigated the effects of quota abolition on further Chinese

increases in exports. Suppliers outside of China also seem to have been successful in

exploiting niches in apparel export items (knitwear for Bangladesh, carpets for

Pakistan) and this has made their exports correspondingly less vulnerable to

competition from other suppliers. Furthermore, China is now emerging as a slightly

higher cost source of supply in some clothing categories compared to lower wage

countries elsewhere such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Pakistan.

     These initial indications of impact of MFA removal naturally lead to discussion of

what are some possible medium to longer term scenarios’ for the Asian economies for

their clothing and textile exports which might follow the initial period analyzed here.

The central element in such scenarios seems to be a continuing growth of both

clothing production in and exports from Asia as higher cost OECD production and

inter OECD trade (which has had the protection of MFA quotas) is displaced by

substantially lower cost Asia supply. This process is seen as likely to be accelerated




4
    This is similar to the conclusion reached by James (2005).


                                                     7
by a weakening of the effects of preferences for non Asian suppliers (Mexico (US),

Turkey (EU)) as MFA quotas disappear.

   The country composition within Asia of these growing exports remains uncertain,

but extreme gravitation to China and India as the two large low cost suppliers with

economies of scale would seem unlikely. If China and India follow their current high

growth trajectories for several years (or decades), they will likely follow growth

profiles similar to Korea and Taiwan from the 1960s to today of initially high export

shares in clothing which progressively decline as wages rise and other higher

technology exports come on stream. If other Asian low-wage suppliers (Vietnam,

Cambodia) grow at lower rates than China and India they will have an increasing cost

advantage relative to China, and their export shares will likely increase more rapidly.

And if the infrastructure weak and geographically more remote suppliers, such as

Nepal, see further reductions in export shares, the prospect is for a smaller number of

Asia’s suppliers to dominate clothing exports and each with sharply higher exports

than today.

2. Asian Development and Textiles and Clothing Trade

    To assess the potential effects on Asian supplying countries of the termination of

the MFA, it is helpful to also have background on both the global industry and its

links to Asian growth performance5. The global textile and clothing industry reflects a

supply chain involving production of raw fibres through to final stage retailing which

spans both countries and different stages of processing. In this, three broad types of

raw fibres (cotton, wool and synthetics), along with more niche fibres such as silk,

provide the raw input for the industry. There are then a series of distinct production

processes which involve first preparing the fibres for spinning, then spinning the

fibres, processing these into fabrics, and finally cutting and making fabrics into

finished items (which include both clothing and textile products for the home).

Distribution of final product proceeds through middle men and/or larger retailers with

integrated purchasing units who deal directly with producers of finished items. Other

elements of the production process, such as dyeing and finishing, also partly

determine the final product quality and price.

    The growth of a globally based textile and clothing industry in Asia began four

decades ago when Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea first became large exporters of low

cost clothing. In the early 1980’s, these three suppliers accounted for around 30% of

world clothing exports. But by 2000, their share had fallen to around 8%, and a new

generation of low cost suppliers had emerged; lead by China, India, Pakistan,

Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. Today, China is the largest exporter of clothing

in Asia, followed by India.

 Also see the discussion of the global industrial and trade structure in textiles and clothing in both
Nordas (2004), and USITC (2004).


                                                     9
  To place global trade in textiles and clothing today in context, textiles and clothing

are around 7% of world exports, with clothing accounting for around 57% of the total

(ILO (2005)). On the import side, the US, Japan and the EU provide the largest

markets, with Canada, Australia and Norway providing smaller markets. By the end

of 2004 only the US, the EU and Canada maintained MFA quotas and these were of

uneven country coverage (importantly the EU excluded Bangladesh from quota

restraint). The precise commodity classification and coding used in each country for

MFA quotas varied, but a small number of key MFA categories comprised most trade

in clothing. Shirts, pants, blouses and coats accounted for nearly 50% of US clothing

imports in 2004.

  The textile and clothing industries in the various Asian countries differ significantly

from one another, and also from other related product areas such as footwear where

production and retailing tend to be integrated and occur more frequently within the

same global firm. Early stages of textile and clothing industry activity are relatively

capital intensive and involve significant machinery and typically occur in

consolidated large firms. It is the stage of cutting and making fabrics into finished

items which is highly labour intensive and which low wage Asian suppliers have been

able to enter so successfully over the last four decades. In most countries the number

of firms involved is larger than at earlier stages, and many of the firms involved are

small or medium sized.

  The structure of the textile and clothing industry also varies significantly by

country. China tends to import fabrics and concentrate on cutting and finishing, while

India imports relatively little fabric. China’s clothing industry, through large inward

FDI, is heavily integrated into global distribution systems and has direct involvement

of OECD retailers. India’s industry, in contrast, has less direct involvement with



                                          10
retailers. As Tewari (2005) argues, the competitive edge of Chinese suppliers involves

much more than low wage costs. China’s producers are integrated into the marketing,

distribution, and supply management networks of locally based Hong Kong,

Taiwanese, and Korean manufactures who have long experience of industrial markets

and the need for timely high quality delivery of product.

  It has been ever growing imports in the OECD, and primary from Asia that, have

been the source for substantial pressures over the years to slow the adjustment of

impacted domestic industry. OECD production of both fabrics and clothing has been

highly regionally concentrated and had relatively low wage and higher average age

employees, making redeployment of labour displaced by imports more difficult than

has been the case for other industries. Both employment and output of industries in

the OECD competing with Asian suppliers has declined consistently over the last 3

decades, although these adjustments have been substantially slowed by trade restraints.

  These restraints had their origins in a 1962 short term (one year) agreement

between the US and a small number of Asian suppliers of cotton textiles to restrain

export growth to provide domestic industry a breathing space for adjustments to occur.

But this initial agreement, after renewal, then grew into a series of longer term (5

yearly) agreements covering ever more exporters and products and was in turn, to lead

to a wider Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in the then GATT in 1974 which covered

most major OECD importers as well as the US (and importantly, the EU). The MFA

itself then underwent a series of 5 year renewals and extensions which also

progressively involved more countries and products. And from the mid 1980’s on,

these arrangements became further complicated with a growing series of preferential

arrangements negotiated by the large importers (the US and the EU) with key

supplying countries.



                                          11
  These latter agreements have typically covered much more than just textile and

clothing exports, but they have contained special preferential arrangements in textiles

and clothing exempting specific countries from MFA quotas (or weakening their

application). In the last 10 years these have lead to a large growth in supply from

preferential suppliers outside of Asia. Mexico under its NAFTA preference today

accounts for nearly 15% of US clothing imports (second only to China), and Turkey

under its partnership agreement with the EU accounts for 10% of EU imports. The

removal of the MFA weakens these margins of preference, which now will only apply

to non MFA trade restraints such as tariffs.

  The potential global impacts of MFA abolition have been the subject of a number

of quantitative model based analyses which are summarized in a recent survey paper

by Walkenhorst (2005), who reviews 27 assessments of potential impact drawn from

14 different studies. In these, estimates of global benefits of MFA removal range from

0.02% - 1.49% of world GDP. Some studies show MFA removal accounting for up to

2/3 of the total global benefits from the WTO Uruguay Round; others put these gains

more modestly at 5% of the total. Some show developing countries as the major

beneficiaries of MFA removal; others show developing countries as losing in

aggregate. Walkenhorst attributes this wide variation in model based results to

different modeling assumptions, parameter values, use of base year, and other model

features. But the theme which emerges in all model results is that substantial welfare

benefits have been expected to accrue to the large importing countries (the US and

EU), the initiators of the MFA system of restraints, and with accompanying

significant increases in imports. These model results thus emphasize the sectoral

interest driving OECD policy (the concern being to slow adjustment costs) more so

than overall national interest.



                                           12
3. The Asian Trade Response Post MFA

  Data on complete bilateral global trade flows (by product and by pair of countries)

for the months immediately following the termination of the MFA are not yet

available. What is available are individual country data for certain importing and

exporting countries. Much of the existing literature on the effects of MFA trade

restrictions draws on US data from the Office of Textiles and Apparel. Such analyses

are usually only supplemented by data on the EU, but can be deceptive for certain

countries where non US/ non EU markets are important for exports. For China, for

instance, Japan currently represents a larger export market than either the US or the

EU (see Emerging Textiles (2005)) and the Japanese market was not under restraint

from MFA quotas. But China also accounts for around 80% of Japan’s imports of

clothing, and post MFA shipments to Japan will likely increase little. China’s

shipments to Hong Kong are also substantial. For other exporters, the EU and the US

are the dominant export market and analysis based on data from EU and US sources is

more indicative of overall trends.

  Aggregate data on trade flows of textiles and clothing over the period following

MFA abolition are also difficult to interpret for a number of reasons. One is that the

trade response varies substantially across MFA product categories. Another is that the

period following MFA abolition is characterized by sharp product specific export

increases from China to the US and the EU in the months immediately after the 2005

abolition, while in subsequent months embargoes applied to certain products and trade

in some commodities between some countries effectively ceased (in the summer of

2005 in certain products). Precisely which month’s data is used to assess the impacts

of MFA abolition can thus make a large difference. For instance, a recent and widely



                                         13
cited ILO (2005) study on the impacts of MFA abolition only used data for the 4

month period January – April 2005. Now more recent data for more months is

available which is used here. Another problem is conflicting data from exporting and

importing countries. Chinese government data on China’s clothing exports, for

instance, differ from US government import data.

    Tables 1 and 2 report US import data in total and by country of source for 2002,

2003, 2004 and 2005 both in value and volume terms and for the two separate

categories of clothing and textiles (Table 1 for clothing, Table 2 for textiles)6. These

data are most recent available7. They show that US imports of clothing grew post

MFA at an annual rate of 6% in value terms and 10% in volume terms, while imports

of textiles grew at an annual rate 1% in value terms and 3% in volume terms. While

these growth rates for clothing in both value and volume terms exceed 2004, they are

below those for 2003 for clothing in value terms. Growth rates for US textiles imports

in both volume and value terms are sharply below those for 2004. This thus suggests a

small aggregate effect on US imports of clothing and textile imports in the immediate

post MFA period.

    But beneath this aggregate picture there is a substantial amount of change by

supplying country. Table 1 shows the changing percentage composition of US

clothing imports by supplying country. China’s value share increases by 8.2

percentage points (from 13.8% to 22%), with China, Hong Kong, and Macao in

combination (with transshipment though the latter two) increasing their value share by


6
 This builds on and further develops data previously reported in James (2005).
7
 However, preliminary US data for the month of January 2006 and reported in Emerging Textiles.com
(Feb 6th 2006) show how quickly things can change. Emerging Textiles report that increases in January
US apparel and textiles imports are as high as several thousand percent for women’s cotton knit
blouses and cotton shirts, 132% in women’s cotton coat, 339% in other cotton coats, 128% in
nightwear, and 507% for men’s wool suits. They also report “astonishing” growth in several textile
categories. Some of these import increases reflect shipments which were held up in 2005 that could
now enter without being charged to the 2006 quota under the bilateral US – China restraint agreement.

slightly less, 6.9 percentage points. Volume shares for China increase considerably

more, by 11.8%, and China, Hong Kong, and Macao by 9.9%. The larger volume than

value share increases reflect price falls for China’s exports to US markets as quota

restraints are eliminated. These increases in US market shares for China reflect not

only the removal of MFA restraints and production increases in the larger and more

efficient supplying country, but also the general increase in Chinese exports across the

board which occurred in 2005 in a wider range of products than textiles and clothing.

  Shares of non Chinese suppliers (also reported in Table 1) show increases in both

value and volume for India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Cambodia (value share

increase only) steady value shares for Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Pakistan and falls in value

shares for Korea, Philippines, and Taiwan. A striking feature of Table 1 is that no

share of any non Asian supplier increases. Value shares for Mexico, CAFTA

(Honduras, Guatemala), CBI countries (Dominican Republic), and Turkey all fall.

The Asian value share of US imports of textiles and clothing increases from 55.3% to

61.7%, but this is less than the increase in China’s share. The fall in the share of the

non Asian suppliers exceeds the fall in share of non Chinese Asian suppliers.

  These data thus suggest that an increased share of the US market for clothing (in

value terms) has accrued to China in the post MFA period, but this has occured more

at the expense of non Asian suppliers (and especially Mexico) than at the expense of

Asian suppliers. The larger change in share for non Asian suppliers also occurs

relative to a smaller initial base than is true for Asian suppliers.

  The picture in textiles in Table 2 is different from that in clothing. The share of

China in US imports shows a much larger proportional increase (and especially in

volume terms) while the shares of all Asian suppliers shows smaller increases in

proportional terms than is the case for clothing. The fall in the share of non Asian

suppliers is smaller in proportional terms. This suggests larger inter country

substitution effects between China and other Asian suppliers for textile exports than

for clothing.

    Tables 3 and 4 report more detail on growth rates of US imports of textiles and

clothing combined in both value and volume terms and for various products by

country categories for 2005 relative to 2004. These show substantial variation across

product categories for each country, and large increases in several categories for

China; more so in volume than in value terms. Countries with falls in value and

volume shares, such as Philippines and Thailand, show negative growth rates for more

categories than for countries with expanding shares such as Cambodia.

    Table 5 presents import data for the EU combined across clothing and textiles for

2003, 2004, and 2005 (data for 11 months projected onto a 12 month basis). For the

EU, the growth rate of imports for 2005 is 6.1%, above that for 2004 (4.8%) and even

more so compared to the period 2000 – 2003 (3.4% over 3 years). This thus suggests

more impact of MFA abolition on EU imports, but the import growth rate remains at

levels comparable to the US8.

    The EU value share of imports from China increases by 7.7 percentage points in

2005, a slightly larger increase in proportional penetration of EU markets by China

post MFA than for US. As Table 5 indicates, the import share from China had been

growing in the EU prior to MFA removal, with a 5.5% share increase between 2000

and 2004. The removal of the MFA thus accelerates an existing trend.

    The impact on both Asian and non Asian suppliers to the EU differs from that of

the US case. Only for India is there an increases in market share in 2004. In all other

cases shares either fall or hold steady. In some cases, such as Bangladesh, the contrast

to the US situation is pronounced with an increase in US market share accompanied

by a fall in EU market share. This case reflects the feature that Bangladesh shipped to

the EU free of restraint under the MFA.

 These data relate only to the first 11 months of 2005, and the total imports for the year have been
projected onto a 12 months basis.


                                                   27
  The total share of Asian suppliers to the EU market increases from 53.8% to 57.9%,

an increase of 4.1 percentage points and as with the US less than the increase in

China’s share. In contrast to the US case, the shares all non Asian suppliers fall, and

significantly so for Romania, Tunisia and Morocco, but the aggregate impact on non

Asian suppliers is smaller than in the US case. The broad picture is thus similar to that

for the US of a reduction in import share for both non Chinese Asian suppliers and

non Asian suppliers to the EU accompanying the increased market share of China.

  The increase in import share in both the EU and US markets for China reflects not

only the abolition of MFA quotas. It also reflects an across the board increase in

Chinese exports to the US and the EU during this period. As Table 6 reports China’s

growth rates of exports of all commodities were 35% in both 2003 and 2004, and

between 2003 and 2004 exports of textiles and clothing to the US grew at 22.1%,

below the average growth rate of Chinese exports, while data for 2005 show a growth

rate of 67.6%. The growth rate of EU textiles and clothing imports from China for

2004 – 2005 data is 39.7%. Table 6 therefore suggests a significant incremental effect

of MFA abolition on China’s share of imports by the US and the EU, but the general

across the board increase in China’s exports also accounts for a significant fraction of

China’s increased share in US and EU markets in 2005.

  Table 7 provides data from Chinese sources on changes in China’s overall exports

of clothing to all markets for the period January – September 2005. These data show a

modest 6.7% increase in total Chinese exports, accompanied by a 189% increase in

exports to the US (larger than in US data) and a 79% increase in exports to EU (and

158% increase to Germany). Exports to Japan (which in 2005 exceeded those to the




                                           28
US) rise only 4.5% and exports to Hong Kong fall by 43%. There are also sharp falls

in unit values for exports to the US and Germany (but not for the EU). More extreme

versions of this pattern also occur in data for knit ware exports and women’s clothing.

These data thus emphasize the point that the post MFA increase in China’s exports of

textiles and clothing is concentrated on US and EU markets, and most heavily the US.

These large import increases are also accompanied by sharp price falls as quota

restraints are eliminated. However, China is unusual among Asian suppliers in having

a more significant share of exports of textiles and clothing going to non US – non EU

markets.

  Finally, Table 8 shows some of the sharp variations across product categories in

trade changes between the US and China following the removal of the MFA. In this


                                          29
table, trade in product categories is reported for a sample of MFA code lines which

report both large positive and negative changes in imports. Some categories show

increases of over 1000% in US imports from China. Other products, in contrast, show

trade falls of over 40%. Sub aggregate data thus show considerable variation around

the broad trends discussed above.

4. Country Impacts of MFA abolition

  Because the circumstances of each Asian supplier differ, to gauge the impact of

MFA abolition on individual countries the special situation of each needs to be taken

into account. Some have come under separate restraint (such as China), some are not

WTO members (Vietnam) and had special arrangements in place prior to MFA

abolition and can be restrained by WTO members in the post MFA regime, some had

special preferential arrangements for trade in products covered by the MFA

(Bangladesh), some had rapidly expanding domestic industries (Cambodia), in other

cases the sector was in relative decline (Philippines) prior to the termination of the

MFA. Here the situation in each country is briefly summarized.

China

  China’s exports to US and EU markets perform differently across various product

categories. China’s exports to US markets increase by 214% in 2005 for cotton

clothing products, 140% for clothing using man made fibre, and 301% for wool

clothing. Cotton baby ware exports to the US, however, only increase by 5%. Exports

to the EU of T-shirts increase in 2005 by 108%, sweaters and pullovers increase by

187%, while exports of women’s suits fall by 34%.

  The ILO report (2005) discusses Chinese data on textile exports between January

and April 2005 in more detail and compares them to data for the same period in the

prior years, as well as providing similar analysis for the EU. They argue that growth

rates of trade decline month by month over this period because exporters anticipated

that quotas would be abolished and postponed shipments from the final quarters of

2004 to the first quarter of 2005. This was in part because the carry over flexibility



                                         32
provisions that were part of the MFA did not apply for the last year of the MFA. Also

the anticipation that transitional safeguards might be invoked by the US and EU

against China under China’s WTO accession provisions prompted accelerated

shipments in early 2005.

  The ILO report (2005) also suggests that competition among China’s exporters has

been a factor in trade performance immediately upon MFA termination. They report,

by way of example, that the quota utilization rate in the EU for Chinese imports for

the MFA category covering parkas and anoraks was nearly 100% in contrast to only

20% for Korea. They suggest that extremely high quota utilization rates for China

prompted an initial post MFA surge as constrained domestic suppliers began to

compete in foreign markets, a phenomenon missing for countries with low utilization

rates.

  They also note that China is not only a major exporter of textiles and clothing prior

to MFA abolition but also a major importer of fibres (3rd world wide), principally of

wool, and cotton and also of equipment for textile and clothing production. They also

suggest that wage rates had been rising in the sector prior to MFA abolition, while

hours worked had been falling which would also affect post MFA performance.

  India

  Growth rates of India’s exports to the US for 2005 also vary among product

categories, but not to the same extent as for China. Cotton clothing exports to the US

increase by 44%, wool clothing exports fall slightly by 2%, baby ware exports

increase by 15%. ILO (2005) data for early 2005 show an increase in India’s textile

exports between January and March 2005 alongside a fall in exports of clothing and

ready made garments.




                                         33
  During the first two month of 2005 data from the US Office of Textiles and

Apparel (quoted by both Ghosh and Ray (2005)) and ILO (2005) allow a comparison

between Indian and Chinese imports and show sharply higher market shares in the US

for both India and China for men’s cotton shirts (4.9% for Jan – Feb 2004 increasing

to 7.4% for India, and 1.7% increasing to 5.7% for China), alongside other market

share data changes where China sharply outperforms India.

  In cotton fibre dresses, for instance, China’s share increases to 18.2% from 10.8%

while India’s share is flat at 13.7% from 13.6% in 2004. In men’s cotton trousers,

China’s share increases sharply from 1.5% to 12.2% while India’s share is flat at

2.2%. In women’s cotton trousers, India’s share falls to 1.4% from 1.8% while

China’s share increases sharply to 13.3% from 1.9%.

  India differs from China in both having much smaller imports of fabrics and

equipment, and also has significant shipments to non MFA quota restrained countries,

but these are to different markets from China. Bharat Textile (2005) report, for

instance, that the United Arab Emirates accounted for 7% of India’s textile exports

and 10% of clothing exports in 2003 – 2004.

  Pakistan

  Pakistan is a case where the positive effects of the removal of MFA restraints were

offset by other factors, and overall Pakistan’s share of US and EU markets falls little.

Pakistan, like other non Chinese Asian suppliers exhibits less volatility in import

shares in the US for individual product categories then is the case for China. ILO

(2005) report increases in textile and clothing exports for the first four months of 2005,

but also report that a 13.4% EU antidumping duty on bed wear and the reintroduction

of a 12% tariff on textile exports restrained export growth.




                                           34
  Indonesia

  Indonesia represents a case where their post MFA import share of clothing in US

markets rises but in the EU their share falls. Exports of cotton clothing to the US

increase by 54%, wool clothing by 30%, while silk and baby ware both fall.

  The increase in share in the US is consistent with the initial enthusiasm found in

Indonesia in the first 3 month period after MFA elimination for export prospects. The

Trade/ Investment Reports series from the US Embassy in Jakarta (2005) reports on a

meeting of garment and textile manufacturers, academics and Indonesian government

officials held in April 2005 which concluded that as of April Indonesia’s textile and

garment sector was holding up well, and American and European mid-end garment

buyers were continuing to place orders in Indonesia. There were reports of orders

being stepped up by importers in the US and the EU as a hedge against safeguards

against China. Indonesia’s mid-high end textiles (especially synthetics) were reported

as remaining competitive. One US buyer at the meeting claimed that Indonesian

garment producers dominated other suppliers (including China) for price, quality,

compliance and service.

  Bangladesh

  The impact of MFA removal on Bangladesh’s export performance in textiles and

clothing is discussed in Khondker et al (2005) who also report data for the first four

month period after MFA elimination, along with preliminary data for May of 2005.

Their data show clothing exports by Bangladesh from the first four month period after

January 2005 that were lower, but an export increase in May 2005 resulted in an

export growth rate of 8.7% over the same 2004 period. They highlight the rapid

growth of knitwear products in the EU and US markets (also stressed by Leiema

(2005)). Although sales to the US are small, exports to the EU by Bangladesh are



                                         35
large. An issue in US markets for Bangladesh was lack of GSP treatment since the

domestic content of exports is low. Rules of origin in the EU market were also a

factor in determining GSP treatment.

  Cambodia

  Cambodia is a case where strong growth rates of exports before MFA abolition

continued after MFA removal. ILO (2005) report that clothing exports account for

80% of export earnings in Cambodia, with two thirds going to the US and one third to

the EU. The value of these exports had increased sharply from US $ 26 million in

1995 to US $ 1.9 billion in 2004 reflecting low cost production in Cambodia and

steadily improving quality accounting for this growth. This growth momentum has

remained in 2005 despite MFA elimination.

  Vietnam

  Vietnam clothing exports to the US remain flat in the post MFA period. Cotton

clothing exports to the US increase by 15%, wool clothing exports increase by 23%,

while silk products increase by 9%. A major factor underlying restrained export

growth is that Vietnam is not yet a WTO member and US quotas remain in place

against Vietnam under the 2001 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) with the US.

Vietnamese exports increased rapidly under this agreement from $47 million of US

clothing imports from Vietnam in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 2003. But the growth rate of

US imports of clothing from Vietnam fell from 65% in 2003 to 6% in 2004 and 6% in

2005.

  Although the EU eliminated its quotas against Vietnam under an earlier bilateral

agreement, exports remained subject to a 14% tariff and special incentives for imports

from Tsunami affected countries affected Vietnamese exports to the EU in the post




                                         36
MFA adjustment period. Despite these developments Vietnam’s share in EU market

has been stable.

  Philippines

  For the Philippines there has been a significant reduction in import shares of both

textiles and clothing after MFA removal. Wool clothing exports to the US decline by

19% in 2005, and silk product exports decline by 40% and in both the US and EU

markets. The Philippines is a case of an early MFA entrant with large amounts of

quota acquired from its exports in the early years of the MFA (1970 – 2000) suffering

reduced exports shares as the MFA is terminated. Philippine exports of clothing had

already fallen from $3 billion in 2000 to $2.9 billion in 2001, and to $2.6 – 2.7 billion

between 2002 and 2004 as other lower cost suppliers began to increase exports.

Philippine exports were thus already under pressure from lower cost suppliers, and the

removal of the MFA seems only to have served to accelerate this trend.

  Nepal

  Nepal is a case where import shares in the US and EU markets fall significantly

post MFA somewhat reflecting several dire predictions made for the effects to follow

MFA elimination. Cotton based clothing exports to the US fall by 45%, and wool

clothing exports by 15%. With geographical remoteness, poor infrastructure, and

quota driven outsourcing from India, Nepal had been seen as a country likely to see

significant negative impacts from MFA removal. Saakha (2005) suggested that post

MFA only 20% of production units in Nepal’s clothing industry would remain open in

the longer run.




                                           37
5. Impacts on Employment and Wage Rates

  The elimination of the MFA in January 2005 was also widely anticipated to have

significant employment effects. Employment in the US, the EU and other importers

which had been steadily falling for some years under ever growing import pressures

was thought likely to continue to decline (especially for clothing), and at a faster rate

after MFA removal. Employment was though likely to rise in export expanding

countries (especially China), but fall in other Asian countries losing market share to

China.

   These potential employment losses were viewed with great apprehension in the

lower income countries, including Cambodia, Nepal and Vietnam, since textiles and

clothing constituted a large portion of manufacturing (and urban) employment. For

these countries, at early stages of labour intensive manufactured production, clothing

represents the dominant employment opportunity in urban areas for many workers. In

addition, in many countries the majority of workers in the clothing industry are female

(90% in Cambodia), and alternative opportunities for employment for these workers

are even more restricted, and the potential pressure on female wage rates was also

thought likely to be large.

  Table 9 reports employment data for the US and the EU spanning both the period

prior to the abolition of the MFA and the months following its removal. They show an

ongoing process of adjustment in both textiles and clothing that prior to the

termination of the MFA was strong and progressive, and considerably more so in

clothing than in textiles. Between 1995 and the end of 2004 employment in the US

clothing industry fell by nearly 60%; while falls in the EU were somewhat smaller.

Table 9 also shows a monthly time trend for post MFA employment in both textiles



                                           38
and clothing industries which approximately mirrors the pre MFA removal period.

Employment in both the US and the EU continue to fall and in both textile and

clothing, and at about the same rate as prior to the removal of the MFA. No

acceleration of adjustment due to MFA removal appears discernable in either case.

removal on textile and clothing industries in Asian exporting countries. In China,

where the textile and clothing industry directly employs around 9 million workers

(around 22% of formal employment in manufacturing) and another 80 million

workers are indirectly dependent on the textile and clothing industry (ILO (2005)) the

abolition of the MFA and the resulting increase in exports was thought likely to

generate increased employment. However, around 80% of production of textile and

clothing in China is still for the domestic market, and export increases are

concentrated on trade with the EU and US, with the overall trade increase smaller.

According to the ILO (2005) the trade restrictions imposed by the US in late May

2005 affected $2 billion of exports and 140,000 jobs, and so trade effects on

employment should be more clearly discernable when better data becomes available.

  Elsewhere, Khondker et al (2005) report on a UNDP survey covering 35 firms

producing ready-made garments in 4 areas in Bangladesh. None of the firms report a

reduction in employment after MFA abolition, and 19 of the 35 firms hired more

workers after MFA abolition. They claim no reports of factory closures in Bangladesh

following MFA removal. The textile and clothing sector is central to the Bangladesh

economy accounting for 75% of export earnings, and after agriculture is the largest

employer; 80% of employees are female.

  The Philippines represents a case of reduced employment post MFA, but as noted

earlier this trend was in place prior to MFA abolition. ILO (2005) reports that textile

and clothing employment was around 700,000 in 2002 and had declined to 215,000

by 2004. They also report that between January and May 2005 28 establishments

reduced production, and 12 permanently closed, but these numbers were smaller than

for 2004.

     In Cambodia, in contrast, these had been significant increases in employment prior

to MFA abolition as Cambodia’s exports of textile and clothing products grew. The

ILO (2005) report that over 270,000 workers are employed in over 200 clothing

factories and around 90% are female. In 2005 16 new large plants were scheduled to

begin production10.

     In India, growth in both clothing and textile exports to both the US and the EU

provides a positive post MFA employment picture. Vietnam shows a small reduction

in employment with declining trade share, and Pakistan a significant increase with the

stronger trade performance.

     6. Other Considerations and Concluding Remarks

     Besides the immediate short term impacts of MFA removal on trade flows and

employment, there are also a number of other broader considerations to be factored in

when evaluating the possible impacts of MFA abolition on the Asian economies in the

medium to longer term.

     One issue involves the welfare impacts on Asian countries of removing MFA quota

restrictions as against the impacts on trade, since while these restrictions lower export

volumes they also have the effect of raising prices. It is possible therefore that the

export growth of Asian shippers post MFA may be accompanied by welfare losses for

Asian countries due to accompanying price falls. These price effects were evaluated

by Trela and Whalley (1990) in their general equilibrium evaluation of the effects of

MFA restrictions on developing countries, who concluded that the net effect on

developing countries remained positive since volume increases in exports more that

compensated for price falls11. The sharp falls in prices of Chinese exports in the US

and the EU markets in the data above, however, suggest that this issue may merit

further investigation. Pure price effects and quality downgrading as quotas terminate

are comingled.

     Another issue relates to additional indirect effects on Asian suppliers associated

with removal of the MFA quota regime, and how these are to be taken into account

when evaluating the effects of MFA removal on Asian shippers. One of these is the

impact of removal of internal quota allocation schemes in Asian countries, especially

for clothing exports. Trela and Whalley (1995) pointed out that these schemes


11
  Although see Krishna and Tan (1999) who argue that some of the returns from quota under the MFA
(quota rents) accrued to concentrated retailers and middle men. Under MFA abolition these effects
would be mitigated, and the suggested impacts on developing countries changed.


                                               42
typically involve yearly reallocation of most quota to established firms and effectively

either prevent or discourage the entry of new dynamic (and smaller) firms into

exporting activities. Trela and Whalley provide some general equilibrium calculations

that suggest which these quota allocation schemes can have a more detrimental effect

on exporting countries than the MFA quota themselves. To the extent this is the case,

the removal of these internal effects for exporters could provide a larger source of

gain for Asian exporters than the more direct trade impacts of the removal of the

MFA quotas.

  Yet another issue relates to developments on the tariff front. In addition to MFA

quota restriction, clothing has been subject to relatively high tariffs in both US and

EU markets (and higher in the US than the EU). MFA abolition does not directly

affect these tariff levels, but the WTO Doha Round negotiations may have a

significant impact on Asia exporters if formula based multilateral tariff liberalization

occurs at the end of the Round. At the time of writing, a formula based negotiated

reduction seemed the likely outcome, which would benefit significantly Asian

clothing suppliers.

  Finally come the effects of MFA removal on the medium term growth performance

of the Asian economies. The earlier discussion in this paper is largely of the impacts

on trade, but rapidly increasing exports of labour intensive clothing also characterize

the first stages of industrialization and rapid growth for lower income developing

economies. In establishing growth rate quotas for exports, the MFA put in place a

regime where new entrants to clothing exports had to slowly cumulate sufficient quota

to allow export growth to occur. As MFA quotas disappear, the prospect is for more

rapid growth by the lower wage countries in the region and a compression in the time

needed to grow income per capita rapidly. In the medium term this may yield larger

impacts on the lower wage Asian suppliers, but data to confirm these trends will have

to await the outcome.
