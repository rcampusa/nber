       We present the first nation wide value of life estimates for the United States at more than one

point in time. Our estimates are for every ten years between 1940 and 1980, a period when declines

in fatal accident rates were historically unprecedented. Our estimated elasticity of value of life with

respect to per capita GNP is 1.5 to 1.7. We illustrate the importance of rising value of life for policy

evaluation by examining the benefits of improved longevity since 1900, showing that the current

marginal increase in longevity is more valuable than the large increase in the first half of the

twentieth century.

1    Introduction

Job safety improved sharply after World War II. Between 1940 and 1980 fatal workplace accidents

declined by 0.08 per million hours worked, with roughly 90 percent of the decline occurring prior

to 1960. By historical standards this decline was unprecedented. Fishback (1992: 103) reports

that in coal mining fatality rates were constant between 1904 and 1930. The 1930s experienced

a slight downward trend in fatality rates in the mineral industries, but nothing as pronounced as

the 1940-1980 decline that we document (Minerals Yearbook). Although railroad fatality rates

fell during the 1910s and 1920s, they were roughly constant between 1894 and 1911 and during

the 1930s and 1940s (Fishback and Kim 1993). But, even though the largest changes in fatality

rates occurred in the first two decades after World War II, most researchers measuring the value

of life have generally focused on the 1970s onwards (see Viscusi (1993) for a review).

          This paper presents the first nationwide value of life estimates for the United States at

more than one point in time. We estimate value of life in 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980

using census micro-data and BLS fatality data by industry to recover the trend in the value of life.

These years provide us with consistent data series and, more importantly, shed light on a little

studied but important period for job safety.

          Our hedonic regressions estimated at five points in time yield information on how

compensation for job risk has changed as job safety has risen. We document that as the quantity

of safety has increased over time, the compensating differential has also increased. This is strong

evidence that the demand for safety has increased.

          Repeat hedonic regressions are also useful for establishing the incidence of safety

improvements over time. We document which socioeconomic and demographic groups have had

the greatest reduction in risk exposure over time and we decompose reductions in average job risk

into composition effects versus within industry risk progress.



                                                 1
           Our findings have implications for the use of value of life estimates by government

agencies for prospective policy evaluation and by academics for retrospective policy evaluation.

A rising value of life suggests that marginal improvements in safety and in longevity are becoming

more valuable. Most analysts and researchers, however, use value of life estimates derived from

1970s and 1980s data on compensating wage differentials for job risk, commonly measuring

the value of life as between 3 to 6 million 1990 dollars. Government agencies, such as the

Environmental Protection Agency in assessing the costs and benefits of radon in drinking water or

of particulates in air, treat the value of life as a constant, adjusting only for inflation. Researchers

who have estimated the benefits of increased longevity and health over several decades or even

over a whole century have also treated the value of life as a constant (e.g. Nordhaus 2002; Murphy

and Topel 2002; Cutler and Richardson 1997).



2       Empirical Framework

There is no reason to think hat willingness to pay for risk reduction has remained constant when

incomes have risen and the risk of death from other causes has fallen. On theoretical grounds we

would expect that the value of life has increased because incomes have increased. Rosen’s (1988)

model shows that the value of life can be expressed as the marginal rate of substitution between

wealth and the probability of survival. Unless people pay to increase risk, as wealth increases so

does the value of life. For a working person, as the wage increases so does the value of life.

           The value of life will also increase with improvements in elderly health, longevity, and

well-being.1 Suppose that individuals live for two periods, working when young and then, if they


    1
     Dow, Philipson, and Sala-i-Martin (1999) show that a decline in the probability of death from other causes will
increase value of life.




                                                         2
survive, retiring. An individual will maximize


                                 U (w (r ))   + (1     ;   r )(   1 ; s)V                              (1)


where r is the probability of dying on the job, w(r) is the wage give risk r,      U   is utility, s is the

probability of dying from disease, and        V   is discounted utility from retirement. In the United

States the one year mortality rate at age 65 fell from 0.04 in 1900 to 0.03 in 1940 and then to
                                                   0
0.02 in 1980. As s falls, the risk premium, w (r), will increase as the young value living more. If

V   increases because elderly health improves or because retirement becomes more enjoyable (as

Costa (1998) suggests has happened historically) then the risk premium increases. A low risk job

guarantees individuals their “old” utility. If expected utility when retired is high, individuals will

need more compensation to take a gamble when young.

            We estimate value of life from measured labor market compensating differentials for

risk taking using the 1940-1980 censuses and fatality data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

(see the Data Appendix for details). For every year, i we estimate hedonic wage regressions of

the form,


                                      wij     =        i Xij   + i fij + uij                         (2)

                                 ln(wij )     =        i Xij   + i fij + uij                         (3)


where j indexes the individual, w is the hourly wage, f is the industry fatality risk, u is the error

term, and the vector X consists of age dummies indicating race, foreign birth, marital status,

education, blue collar status, and residence in a metropolitan area, and state fixed effects. We

restrict the sample to full-time male workers age 18 to 45 because the young are more likely to

be in the riskier jobs within an industry. We restrict to men because we do not have fatality rates

for women by industry. We excluded workers in agriculture, telecommunications, transportation,

                                                         3
and utilities and do not analyze data for 1990 or later because of non-comparability across years.2

The wage is trimmed in each decade by dropping the bottom and top one percent of wages. Our

state fixed effects will capture the effects of such variablees as state workers’ compensation rates.

Unlike previous studies, we cluster our standard errors by the 3 digit 1950 industry classification,

because we are adjusting the standard errors for unobserved industry attributes (Moulton 1990).

We do not control for injury rates because the data are not comparable over the years that we

examine.

           Figure 1 shows that in each decade and for every broad industry category job safety has

been rising. Differences in job fatality risk between mining, construction, manufacturing, and

other industries (mainly trade) narrowed since 1940, with most of the decline occurring before

1970. In 1940 fatality rates in the two most dangerous industries, mining and construction were 6

and 10 times, respectively, greater than those in manufacturing. By 1980 fatality rates in mining

and construction were only 2 and 3 times, respectively, as high as those in manufacturing.

           Estimating the hedonic wage regression at five points in time yields five estimates of the

marginal valuation of risk. A hedonic identification issue arises as to how to interpret changes in

these compensating differentials over time. Given that job safety is rising over time, if we observe

that compensating differentials are rising then this is evidence that the demand for job safety must

be rising. If workers experienced diminishing returns from job safety then safety improvements

could have led to declining compensating differentials over time.

           Our cross-sectional hedonic wage regressions will recover the value of life provided that

labor markets are perfectly competitive, that observables control for differences in productivity,

and that all workers have the same preferences over money and risk and are informed about

actuarial risk probabilities. A recent literature has examined how relaxing these conditions


   2
   As discussed in the Data Appendix, the BLS changed its survey methodology in 1992 and no longer provide
comparable data by industry for 1990.


                                                    4
affects the interpretation of hedonic wage regression estimates. Within each year several factors

will lead us to underestimate the true value of life. Because we observe those with the lowest

value of life in risky jobs, we will underestimate willingness to pay for safety. If workers are

heterogeneous in their abilities and if the econometrician can only partially observe workers’

skills, then we will underestimate the value of life in any given year. According to Hwang, Reed,

and Hubbard’s (1992) derivation, in the limit the ratio of the estimated fatal injury coefficient, ˆ ,

to the true fatal injury coefficient,  , is


                                         ˆ

where    !   is the average share of renumeration taken in the form of wages instead of benefits

or ameneties,          is the proportion of wage dispersion due to workers’ differing tastes, and      


is the degree of unobserved productivity heterogeneity which is equal to zero when workers’

productivity is perfectly observed. In this case the bias is equal to zero. When  is big enough,

i.e.    >  !=(1 ;  )(1 ; ! )], then the estimated coefficient on fatality rates will have an incorrect

positive sign. If all renumeration were taken in the form of wages then the bias would be zero. It

would also be zero if all of wage dispersion were due to workers’ differing tastes, rather than to

their productivity.

             Other factors will bias our estimates of the value of life upwards. Shogren and Stamland

(2002) argue that once one accounts for both risk preference and the personal ability to reduce

risk or death or injury, then value of life estimates are biased upwards even if workers self-select

their jobs on the basis of their value of life and their skill. A second reason why our estimates

of value of life may be biased upwards in each year is because the BLS data over-sample large

firms and therefore underestimate risk. In addition, because we cannot control for injury rates,

this biases our estimates of the value of life upwards.



                                                                5
            We view our trend as yielding a lower bound estimate of changes in the value of life.

According to the Hwang, Reed, and Hubbard (1992) bias formula (Equation 4), the downward

bias will be greater in 1980 than in 1940 even if there were no change in workers’ unobserved

productivity because benefits have become a bigger share of renumeration. We suspect that the

proportion of wage dispersion due to tastes has always been low. The degree of unobserved

worker productivity was probably high in both 1940 and 1980, but it is most likely to be higher in

recent data, so again the bias in 1940 will be lower than in 1980. Under Shogren and Stamland’s

(2002) conditions, our estimate of the trend in the value of life will be a lower bound if in the

past the marginal worker was more likely to be low skilled in reducing his personal fatality

rate, perhaps because knowledge was less likely to diffuse to marginal workers.3 If the omitted

variables bias from excluding injury rates was greater in 1940 then in 1980 because injury rates

were higher in 1940, then we will underestimate the increase in the value of life. Because jobs

have become safer, then if worker utility is concave with respect to safety, our linear specification

will yield a declining estimate of the value of life. If the proportion of risk lovers is constant over

time in the working population, then given that the share of jobs in risky occupations has shrunk,

the marginal worker would require a lower risk premium. Therefore these factors will impart a

downward bias to our estimate of trends in the value of life.



3       Trends

Average risk can fall either because of composition shifts of workers into less dangerous industries

or because of within industry risk declines. Table 1 shows that declines in industry specific fatality


    3
     Our estimate of the trend in value of life will be an upper bound if today the marginal worker is more likely to
be relatively low skilled in coping with job risk, a plausible scenario only if the high skill workers have been able to
process increases in knowledge.




                                                           6
risk, not the shift of workers into less dangerous industries are the main cause for the decline in

overall job risk. Eighty-two to 100 percent of the decline in deaths per million hours worked is

due to within industry declines, with declines in construction and in manufacturing accounting

for the majority of the change. Given that rising globalization has permitted the export of the

more dangerous jobs abroad, it is striking that declining fatality rates within industry and not the

shift of workers out of industries has lowered overall fatality rates.

          Several factors probably accounted for the decline in fatality rates. These include

exogeneous upgrading of the capital stock, firms’ profit maximizing response to compensating

differentials, union emphasis on job safety and high unionization rates in the 1940s and 1950s,

increases in state workmens’ compensation payments in the 1940s and 1950s, workers’ greater

safety precautions as firms moved away from piece rates, and government regulation. Until 1960

regulation was primarily on the state level, although the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created

the Division of Labor Standards to help state governments improve their job safety laws and their

administration. In 1960 the Labor Department imposed federal standards on the states using

its powers under the Walsh-Healey Act of 1936 to bar employment under hazardous conditions.

Federal oversight increased with the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Using

longitudinal firm data, Gray and Jones (1991) report that OSHA health inspections increased

compliance with safety legislation. We are not aware of any studies that investigate the impact of

earlier legislation.

          How have the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of who works in risky

industries changed? Average risk exposure between men and women narrowed (see Figure 2). In

1940 men’s average risk exposure was almost 4 times greater than that of women and in 1980 it

was twice as high. Because we do not have industry fatality data by sex, this trend represents a

composition shift.

          Table 2 illustrates changes in risk incidence with results from regressions for men in


                                                  7

where    f   is the fatality rate in individual j’s industry (deaths per million hours worked),        X   is a

vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, of broad industry dummies, and of state

fixed effects, and u is an error term. Controlling for broad industry group (mining, construction,

manufacturing, trade, and other), risk exposure by race, education, and age has become much

more equal over time. The difference in fatality rates faced by non-whites and whites controlling

for other characteristics was 0.041 in 1940 and zero in 1980. The difference in fatality rates faced

by those with less than a high school education compared to those with a high school education

was 0.014 in 1940 and 0.003 in 1980. Differences in fatality rates between those with less than

a high school education and the college educated are similar. Each year of age added roughly

0.004 to the fatality rate in 1940 but nothing thereafter. Interestingly, the foreign-born were not

exposed to more risk.



4       Results

4.1 Hedonic Regressions

Figure 3 presents non-parametric regressions illustrating that the wage (adjusted for mean state

wage) increased with industry risk in both 1940 and 1980 among men with some high school

education.4 The continuous increase in wages as fatality rates rise implies that our results do not


    4
    We adjusted the wage by subtracting mean wage within the state from workers’ wages. Our non-parametric
regressions use a Gaussian kernel and Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoother with a bandwith of 0.4 (Härdle 1991: 25,
147-89).



                                                         8
depend upon one or two high risk and high wage industries and that our identification does not

come from extreme risk. This figure also shows that in 1980 the relationship between wage and

risk was steeper than in 1940, suggesting that risk compensation has increased over time. To

control for other characteristics that may affect the wage-risk relationship we turn to the ordinary

least squares regressions specified in Equations 2 and 3.

              Tables 3 and 4 present results from our linear and log-linear hedonic regressions,

respectively, controlling for race, foreign-birth, marital status, education, blue collar status,

residence in a metropolitan area, and state fixed effects. In both cases we stratify by ages 18-30

and 31-45. We believe that the risk premium will be more pronounced for younger workers to

entice them to enter dangerous jobs. We present results for all educational levels and also for

some high school or high school graduates, groups that are likely to be exposed to job risk within

an industry.

              Our linear wage specification shows a clear secular increase in the job risk premium.

For those with some high school or high school graduates, the coefficient on the fatality rate is

significantly different from zero in all years except for 1960 in both the linear and the log-linear

specifications. Although we lose significance in other stratifications of the data, particularly in

1970, the magnitude of the coefficients suggests an upward trend. (Because, unlike previous

researchers, we are clustering our standard errors by industry, we are reducing the statistical

significance of our fatality rate coefficients. Moulton (1990) shows that t-statistics fall dramatically

with clustering.) We also find that compensation for job risk is generally greater for our younger

workers.5 A behavioral explanation would be that workers need to be offered a large initial salary

to enter the field, but then have flat experience profiles on the job as they become inured to danger.

              We ran several robustness checks in which we examined other sample restrictions


   5
       As noted above, this may reflect measurement error.



                                                             9
and additional controls. When we restricted to the college-educated, a group unlikely to be

in dangerous jobs even controllling for industry, none of our coefficients on injury rates were

statistically significantly different from zero, as expected. We pooled the data and included

state and industry fixed effects. This yielded coefficients of similar magnitude, but only the

coefficients on the year dummies for 1950 and 1980 were statistically significantly different

from the coefficient on the year 1940 dummy. We ran our regressions without miners, a group

that Figure 1 showed experienced the most dramatic declines in injury rates. For high school

or high school graduates age 18-30, this left the 1940 coefficient virtually unchanged, the 1950

coefficient smaller and no longer statistically significant, the 1960 and 1970 coefficients larger and

the latter statistically significant, and the 1980 coefficient smaller but still statistically significant.

We ran our specifications controlling for such industry characteristics as average age, percent

high school, some college, and college-educated, percent female, percent non-white, and percent

foreign-born. The magnitude of our coefficients was smaller and significance fell, but the trend

was still there. We investigated using industry pollution (as proxied by energy intensity) as a

control for job amenities. Our coefficient on energy intensity was not statistically significant

and our other coefficients were unaffected. We also directly controlled for expected workers

compensation benefits based upon individual earnings and state formulas and for state union

rates, but this yielded very similar results to those presented in our tables because our state fixed

effects controlled for these differences.

          We investigated using wife’s earnings as an instrument for the fatality risk faced by

married men because men whose families have greater earnings capacity are likely to choose

safer jobs (Garen 1988). Our instrument was only weakly correlated with industry fatality rates

and the coefficients on our instrumented fatality rate were many orders of magnitude larger than

those on our uninstrumented fatality rate.

          We recognize that discrete choice methods such as those presented in Berry, Levinsohn,


                                                    10
and Pakes (1995) could be used be used to more directly estimate whether marginal valuations

for safety have increased over time. A discrete choice demand study would face at least two

challenges. Because there are 48 states and over 100 industries, the dimensionality of this

problem would be cumbersome. In addition, as documented in industrial organization studies

such as Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and Petrin (2002), a discrete choice model of risky

industry choice would face the extra challenge of instrumenting for wages. The industry wage

would be an explanatory variable in a discrete choice model. It is likely to be correlated with

observed industry attributes embedded in the error term. In a hedonic model, industry wage is a

dependent variable and ordinary least squares will yield consistent implicit price estimates if the

industry risk level is uncorrelated with the error term.



4.2 Value of Life

Table 5 shows that value of life has increased by 300 to 400 percent between 1940 and 1980, rising

from roughly 1 million 1990 dollars in 1940 to 4 to 5 million 1990 dollars in 1980. 6 Using our

value of life estimates for workers with some high school and regressing the logarithm of value

of life on the logarithm of per capita GNP we found that the elasticity of value of life with respect

to per capita GNP was 1.5 using the log-linear specification and 1.7 using the linear specification.

           How do our estimates of value of life compare with those of other researchers? Table 6

lists results from other studies in 1990 dollars. Our estimates for 1970 of 3 to 5 million 1990

dollars are on the low end of Viscusi’s (1978) estimates of 3 to 8 million dollars for 1969-1970.

Our estimates for 1980 of 4 to 5 million dollars are within the range of 3 to 6 million found by

Viscusi (1993) for data from the 1980s. Our 1940 estimate of 1 million 1990 dollars is similar to


   6
    For our linear specification, value of life is     106 and for our log-linear specification it is   w   10 6 where
 is the coefficient on fatality risk and w is the hourly wage.

that observed in Taiwan in 1987 and to Hong Kong in 1991 (Hammitt et al. 2000; Siebert and Wei

1998). Our elasticity of value of life with respect to per capita GNP of 1.5 to 1.7 is on the low

end of the range of 1.5 to 2.5 found by Hammitt et al. (2000) for Taiwan. Using our elasticity of

per capita GNP with respect to per capita GNP of either 1.5 or 1.7 we estimate that the value of

life in 1900 was 0.3 million dollars and in 1920 was 0.6 million dollars. Our estimated value of

life in 1900 is therefore greater than that found by Fishback and Kim (1993) within railroads in

the United States circa 1900 and our estimated value of life in 1920 is within Fishback’s (1992)

estimate of 0.2 to 0.8 million for coal mining in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s. We

predict that in 2000 the value of life was 6.1 to 8.7 million 1990 dollars or 8.5 to 12.1 2002 dollars.



5    Implications for Mortality Declines

One of the implications of rising value of life is that evaluations of the benefits of mortality

reductions or health improvements over the entire twentieth century underestimate the value of

current improvements in health or mortality relative to the dramatic improvements of the past.

Table 7 illustrates. The largest age-adjusted mortality declines occurred prior to 1960 when infant

mortality fell sharply. In 1900 the probability of a child dying before age 1 was 0.15 and his

life expectancy at birth was 48. By 1960 the probability of death before age 1 was 0.03 and life

expectancy at birth was 70. Applying our estimated values of life for 1980 to all years, we would

conclude that the biggest gains were indeed prior to 1960 when the biggest change in quantities

occurred. If we assumed that the income elasticity of value of life was equal to one and used the

ratio of 1980 value of life to 1980 GNP to calculate values of life, then we would conclude that the

value of mortality declines was lower between 1980 and 2000 than between 1940 and 1960. Using

our calculated and predicted value of life estimates from our specifications demonstrates that the

largest gains occurred after 1960 when mortality gains were relatively marginal and that gains


                                                  12
between 1980 and 2000 were substantial.7 After 1960, the largest increases in life expectancy

came in older age mortality. Life expectancy at age 65 increased by 3 years over the 60 years

between 1900 and 1960, but by another 3 years over the shorter time span between 1960 and

2000. Under the constant, income elasicity of one, and income elasticity greater than one value

of life scenarios, per capita national health care expenditures are increasing faster than the value

of mortality declines, but when we do not allow for actual changes in the value of life, our health

care sector seems much less productive.



6       Conclusion

Studies from the United States past and from developing countries suggest that value of life

increases with economic development, but because these studies are not comparable in either

their sample selection or their specifications, calculating an income elasticity from these value of

life estimates is problematic. Estimating comparable regressions from 1940 to 1980, this paper

found that value of life in the United States has indeed been rising and that the estimated elasticity

of value of life with respect to per capita GNP was 1.5 to 1.7. The growing premium that workers

have been receiving for working in unsafe jobs and the simultaneous increase in job safety implies

that workers are not paying for increases in job safety.

            Our findings on rising value of life have implications for evaluating current health and

safety regulations. For investments where the benefits accrue for several decades, using current

value of life estimates will underestimate the economic gains. This will be particularly true for

developing countries that are growing rapidly.

            Our findings also bear on prospective evaluations of the benefits of mortality reductions


    7
     For simplicity, we value life at all points in the life-cycle equally. However, we would expect value of life to first
rise and then decrease with age (Rosen 1988), though at what ages and at what rate is an unanswered empirical issue.


                                                           13
or health improvements over the entire twentieth century. Using a constant value of life will

underestimate the value of current improvements in health or mortality relative to the dramatic

improvements of the past. Assuming an income elasticity of value of life that is equal to one

will underestimate the value of the most recent improvements in mortality and paint our health

care sector as less productive than it really is. We showed that accurately allowing for changes in

prices, the largest benefits of improved mortality occur after 1960 and are substantial even during

the last twenty years when mortality gains were relatively marginal compared to those of the first

half of the twentieth century.



Data Appendix

We use the 1940-1980 censuses of population and housing.8 We link by 3 digit industry codes to

fatality data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We restrict our sample to full-time

male workers age 18 to 45.


   1. Industry fatality rates. Fatality rates are per million hours worked. Rates for 1940

         are from Industrial-Injury Statistics by States, BLS Bulletin No. 700 and for mining from

         Minerals Yearbook, 1941, those for 1950 from Work Injuries in the United States During

         1950, BLS Bulletin No. 1098, those for 1960 are from Injury Rates By Industry, 1963, BLS

         Report No. 295 (earlier years do not report fatality rates), for 1970 from Injury Rates By

         Industry, 1970, BLS Report No. 406, and for 1980 from Appendix E in Leigh (1995). The

         data provided by Leigh (1995) are from unpublished BLS tabulations. They are per 100,000

         workers. All rates were converted to million hours worked using data from Hours, Wages,

         and Earnings in the United States. We were not able to obtain fatality data by industry


   8
       We use the integrated public use micro samples available at http://www.ipums.umn.edu/.


                                                         14
  for 1990 because the BLS no longer provide these data and, although they could be re-

  estimated from their records, the cost was prohibitive. In 1992, the BLS changed its survey

  methodology, including smaller establishments, workers on small farms, the self-employed

  and family workers, and public sector workers. Reported fatality rates rose.

  The BLS obtained fatality rates by surveying firms. Because large firms are over-sampled

  in 1940-1980, accident rates are underestimated. Firms faced fines for non-reporting only

  beginning in 1972. The BLS also reported injury rates. These are for injuries resulting

  in permanent partial disability and temporary total disability. After 1971 the definition of

  an injury changed to those established under the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and

  Health Act of 1970. This change expanded the definition of an injury. For details see the

  reports cited above and also various issues of Handbook of Labor Statistics.

  We do not have fatality information for agricultural workers and we excluded fatality

  information for workers in telecommunications, transportation, and utilities. When we

  examined the fatality data for workers in telecommunications, transportation, and utilities,

  we found considerable swings across decades. We suspect that this was due both to changes

  in industry definitions and to relatively few of these types of firms reporting. After these

  exclusions we were left with 163 industries in the census microsamples and we were able to

  link 110 of these industries to fatality data. We do not limit ourselves to a balanced panel of

  industries. When we do the magnitude of our coefficients on fatality risk remains unchanged

  but the standard error increases. The percentage of 18-45 year-old men in manufacturing in

  our decade samples ranges from 47 to 55 percent. Our next largest category is “other than

  manufacturing, mining, or construction,” ranging from 39 to 26 percent of our sample.

2. Wage. Our hourly wage variable is constructed from annual wage and salary divided by

  annual hours worked (current weekly hours multiplied by weeks worked in the past year).


                                            15
    For 1960 and 1970, where we only have intervalled hours and weeks data, we take the

    midpoint. We adjust all wages to 1990 dollars. We multiply the topcode by 1.45. In 1980 a

    larger proportion of the population was covered by topcoding than in 1970. However, our

    results remain unchanged when we impose a new topcode in 1970. We trim the bottom and

    top one percent of wages.

 3. Race. Our race variable is a dummy equal to one if the worker was not white.

 4. Foreign birth. Our foreign birth variable is a dummy equal to one if the worker was born

    abroad.

 5. Marital status. Our marital status variable is a dummy equal to one if the worker was

    married.

 6. Education. We create four dummy variables for education – less than high school, some

    high school or high school graduate, some college, and college graduate.

 7. Blue collar. Our blue collar variable is a dummy equal to one if the

 8. Metropolitan area resident. This is a dummy variable equal to one if the worker lived in a

    metropolitan area, as defined by that year’s census. Definitions vary across years.

  Note: Estimated from the Integrated Public Use Census Samples and BLS death rates. The dependent
  variable is the industry fatality rate per million hours worked. See Equation 5 in the text. Other industry does
  not include agriculture, communications, transportation, and utilities. The sample is restricted to full-time
  workers age 18 to 45. All regressions include state fixed effects. Robust standard errors in parentheses. The
  symbols y and z indicate that the coefficient is significantly different from 0 at the 5 and 1 percent level,
  respectively.

Source: Estimated from the Integrated Public Use Census Samples and BLS death rates. Results are from a kernel
regression with Gaussian kernel and the Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoother with a bandwidth of 0.4 (Härdle 1991:
25, 147-89). The sample is restricted to full-time male workers age 18-45 with some high school education and
excludes workers in agriculture, telecommunications, transportation, and utilities. Mean wage within the state was
substracted from workers’ wages.

Sources: Age-adjusted death rates are standardized using year 2000 standard population and are from series
Hist 293, CDC/NCHS. Value of life estimates based upon an income elasticity of one calculate value of life
using the ratio of 1980 value of life to 1980 GNP. Value of life estimates from columns 3 and 4 in Table 5
are from the linear (Equation 4) and log-linear (Equation 5) specifications, respectively. For 1900, 1920,
and 2000 we used these specifications to predict value of life in those years, obtaining 309, 647, and 8,718
thousand dollars for these respective years using the linear specification and 317, 612, and 6,179 for these
respective years using the log-linear specification. Per capita national health care expenditures are from Series
B 221-235 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975:73) and from U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
Health Accounts. Per capita expenditures are only available beginning in 1929. The annual increase between
1920 and 1929 was interpolated upon 1929-1940 trends.
