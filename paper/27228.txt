The Macroeconomics of a Pandemic: A Minimalist Model
Luis Felipe Céspedes, Roberto Chang, and Andrés Velasco
NBER Working Paper No. 27228

JEL No. E6,F4,H8

                                            ABSTRACT

We build a minimalist model of the macroeconomics of a pandemic, with two essential
components. The first is productivity-related: if the virus forces firms to shed labor beyond a
certain threshold, productivity suffers. The second component is a credit market imperfection:
because lenders cannot be sure a borrower will repay, they only lend against collateral. Expected
productivity determines collateral value; in turn, collateral value can limit borrowing and
productivity. As a result, adverse shocks have large magnification effects, in an unemployment
and asset price deflation doom loop. There may be multiple equilibria, so that pessimistic
expectations can push the economy to a bad equilibrium with limited borrowing and low
employment and productivity. The model helps identify policies to fight the effects of the
pandemic. Traditional expansionary fiscal policy has no beneficial effects, while cutting interest
rates has a limited effect if the initial real interest rate is low. By contrast, several unconventional
policies, including wage subsidies, helicopter drops of liquid assets, equity injections, and loan
guarantees, can keep the economy in a full-employment, high-productivity equilibrium. Such
policies can be fiscally expensive, so their implementation is feasible only with ample fiscal
space or emergency financing from abroad.

I.      Introduction

Imagine an entrepreneur who runs a consultancy that lost all of its customers because of the
coronavirus emergency. Or a restaurant, forced to close its doors because of the government-
mandated lockdown. Or a small manufacturing firm, also shuttered today.

Because she is an optimist, the entrepreneur expects the crisis will be temporary. That is, in some
future period (3 months, 6 months?) she will be able to open up again, regain customers and
operate normally. But in the meantime, the firm has no revenues. And remember that bank loan
to buy new computer equipment? Well, it is coming due next month.

The entrepreneur is proud of what she has built. In her line of business, employees make the
difference between success and failure. It has taken her years to find the right people and train
them. If she lets them go now, the business will never be the same.

So she would like to retain most of them. But the cash reserve the firm has built is not enough to
finance the wage bill for three months —much less for six months! And there is that loan coming
due. To keep employees and stay current on debt service, the firm will have to borrow even more.

A bank will be happy to lend the money —if the firm has enough collateral. But smaller firms
often do not have assets they can pledge. And larger firms find that at a time of great uncertainty
the value of the physical and financial assets they hold is severely depressed, so those assets are
not much good as collateral. The upshot is that many firms may be unable to borrow. And if credit
does not flow, millions of jobs will be lost and massive amounts of entrepreneurial capital will be
destroyed. That is the central economic challenge of the Covid-19 crisis.

To help sort out how it all works (or fails to), and what the alternatives for policy are, in this paper
we build a minimalist model of the macroeconomics of a pandemic.1 The story we tell has two
essential components. The first has to do with productivity. We assume that that once the virus
hits, firms can shed a few employees without much of an impact on productivity, but if forced to
shed labor beyond a certain threshold, productivity will suffer.

The other key component is an imperfection in the credit markets. Because lenders cannot be
sure of repayment, borrowers are subject to a constraint, with the amount they can borrow
limited by the assets they can provide as guarantee or the future income they can credibly pledge.

The two components of the model interact: low expected productivity causes low collateral
value, and low collateral value means limited borrowing and low productivity. These links are
intuitive and simple, yet have noteworthy implications. One is that the economy responds to
adverse shocks with large magnification effects, in what one might call an unemployment and

Rebelo and Trabandt (2020), Faria e Castro (2020) and Kaplan, Moll and Violante (2020).

asset price deflation doom loop (Fornaro and Wolf, 2020). For instance, if the firm starts out with
one fewer dollar of initial net worth, its capacity to hire workers and pay wages goes down by
more than one dollar, with the multiplier reflecting reduced access to outside finance through an
drop in the value of the firm.

For some parameter values the model also displays multiple equilibria, so that pessimistic
expectations can push the economy to a bad equilibrium. Suppose that lenders expect a low price
for the assets the firm uses as collateral. Then lenders will be willing to lend little, which in turn
will force the firm to shed many workers, with the resulting hit to productivity, which confirms
lenders´ initial expectations about asset valuation. The opposite can also occur if lenders expect
high asset values and strong productivity: those expectations can also be rational and self-
fulfilling.

The model casts useful light on policy alternatives. Traditional expansionary fiscal policy has no
beneficial effects. Cutting interest rates has an indirect effect via asset prices —firms are
constrained not by the price of loans, but by the available quantity of loans— but that effect may
be small if the initial real interest rate is low. By contrast, there are several unconventional
policies —wage subsidies, helicopter drops of liquid assets, equity injections, and loan
guarantees— that, if sufficiently large, can keep the economy in a full-employment, high-
productivity equilibrium in the aftermath of a pandemic.

All of these policies can restore efficiency. But because they entail channeling resources to firms
beyond what incentive-compatible borrowing limits would permit, entrepreneurs may be
tempted to misbehave, leaving taxes unpaid (in the case of a wage subsidy or a helicopter drop),
absconding with profits instead of distributing them as dividends (in the case of equity injections),
or defaulting on debts (in the case of loan guarantees). So the policies will be feasible insofar as
government is willing and able to do what private agents cannot: deploy the power of the state
to make sure all relevant financial obligations are fulfilled.

Most of the unconventional policies require the government to spend resources upfront, at a
time of crisis when revenues are down. So to fight the economic consequences of the pandemic
governments will need to run deficits (albeit for reasons that are different from the traditional
Keynesian reasons). And private sector firms, which have to keep paying wages while their sales
and productivity are sharply down, will also be running deficits. So unless households are big
savers, a country that adopts anti-virus policies will probably be running a current account deficit.

The upshot is simple: the capacity to borrow, for both the government and the nation as a whole,
is critical. Emerging market economies that are rationed out of capital markets may find they
cannot afford anti-crisis policies unless the international community channels fresh resources to
them.

The paper is structured as follows. In section II we present our minimalist model. Section III
analyzes feasible equilibria, while section IV sorts through policy alternatives. Section V provides
a summary and discussion of the policy analysis. Section VI concludes.

II.     The model

The economy is small and open. There is a single tradable good and an internationally-traded
bond denominated in units of the good. Households and entrepreneurs live side by side.
Households work, save and may lend resources to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs produce and
may borrow to finance operations.

The economy lasts two periods. In the first period a pandemic strikes, drastically hurting
productivity. The pandemic subsides in the second period, however, allowing productivity to
recover. Because of adjustment costs, to be made precise below, it is beneficial not to fire labor
in the first period. But this is only possible if firms overcome a financing problem.

Households

Begin with the households. To keep things very simple we suppose they have a linear utility
function. If 𝜌 is the subjective discount rate (and also the world rate of interest) and 𝜃 the
marginal disutility of labor supply, households maximize

                                                     𝑐( − 𝜃𝑛(
                                        𝑐$ − 𝜃𝑛$ +
                                                       1+𝜌

with respect to consumptions 𝑐$ and 𝑐( and labor supplies 𝑛$ and 𝑛( , subject to the constraint

                                         𝑐(               𝑤( 𝑛(
                                 𝑐$ +       ≤ 𝑓 + 𝑤$ 𝑛$ +
                                        1+𝑟               1+𝑟

where 𝑟 is the domestic real interest rate and 𝑓 is initial holdings of the bond by households.
Because of linearity, the household supplies any nonnegative amount of labor if

                                           𝑤$ = 𝑤( = 𝜃

That is, if the real wage in each period is equal to the marginal disutility of labor supply. This is
necessary in any equilibrium. Likewise, in equilibrium the real interest rate is pinned down by the
world interest rate:
                                               𝑟=𝜌

Firms

Output is produced using labor only. The pandemic shock means that labor productivity collapses
in period 1 so that, in the absence of adjustment costs, firms would reduce labor employment in
that period. But we assume that finding the right workers and hiring them takes time and is costly,
so that if an entrepreneur fires them today she will not be able to resize the firm´s labor force to
a different optimal level in the future. The extreme version of this assumption, which we adopt,
is that labor input, denoted by 𝑛, is set in period 1 and cannot be changed in period 2.


3
In the first period, because of the virus, labor produces no output. In the second period the virus
subsides, and output is 𝑎𝑛, where labor productivity 𝑎 is given by

                                            𝑎ℓ if 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛6
                                      𝑎 = 1 𝑎7 if 𝑛6 < 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛9
                                            0 otherwise

where 𝑎7 > 𝑎ℓ > 𝜃 > 0 and 𝑛6 < 𝑛9. So firms have a maximum scale of operation given by 𝑛9;
they also have a minimum efficient scale, 𝑛6. If in response to a shock the firm is forced to shed
crucial employees and take employment to 𝑛6 or below, productivity will drop.

Like households, entrepreneurs have a utility function that is linear in consumption and a
subjective rate of discount that is equal to the world interest rate. There is no loss of generality,
therefore, in treating them as though they consume in the second period only. That level of
consumption is

                                       𝑎𝑛 − 𝜃𝑛 − (1 + 𝜌)𝑑

where 𝑑 is the amount the firm borrows in period 1, given by

                                            𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏

where 𝑏 denotes the entrepreneurs initial liquidity (i.e. an inherited stock 𝑏 of bonds). Combining
the last two equations we have

                                   𝑎𝑛 − 𝜃𝑛 − (1 + 𝜌)(𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏)
Clearly, if

                                        𝑎ℓ − 𝜃 > (1 + 𝜌)𝜃

which we assume holds, then the entrepreneur will prefer to make the employment level as large
as possible. So in the absence of additional frictions, the economy would have a unique
equilibrium with firms operating at maximum scale: 𝑛 = 𝑛9. Firms would retain 𝑛9 workers during
the pandemic, even if they produce nothing, because labor will be sufficiently productive once
the virus disappears. This justifies paying wages in the first period just to retain workers.


Financial markets and frictions

A frictionless, maximum-employment equilibrium requires that firms be able to finance the initial
wage bill 𝜃𝑛9. This may be problematic in the presence of borrowing constraints.

Such constraints arise from an incentive problem: the entrepreneur can seize a share 1 − 𝜆 of
output net of wage payments in period 2, default on any accumulated debts and abscond. To


4
prevent this from happening, lenders will demand the firm´s own shares as collateral. Suppose
there is an equity market in which firms can sell their shares. At the start of the pandemic, each
entrepreneur owns a firm, the value of which determines the amount she can borrow. Shares are
claims to a portion 𝜆 of earnings before interest in period 2 —selling a bigger claim is not credible,
given the risk that the entrepreneur might abscond.

The details of the incentive problem are peripheral to our main discussion and therefore we
relegate them to Appendix 1. Here we summarize the key results. Let 𝑣 be the period-1 value of
the firm in the stock exchange, which must equal the discounted value of pledged firm profits:

                                               𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛
                                          𝑣=
                                                 1+𝜌

Future profits are discounted by 1 + 𝜌, which is the relevant rate for both the firm and the
households that could be the buyers of these shares. It is important that 𝑣 is market-determined,
and therefore a variable that entrepreneurs take as given in making their borrowing and hiring
choices. Also important is that 𝑣 is increasing in 𝑎, the expected marginal product of labor in
period 2. Intuitively, when the firm is expected to be more productive and earn more, its market
value goes up. (Recall that 𝑎 can be 𝑎7 or 𝑎ℓ , depending on 𝑛.)

Individual firms face a borrowing constraint given by

                                               𝑑≤𝑣

Using the definition of 𝑣, the previous inequality reduces in equilibrium to

                            𝑎𝑛 − 𝜃𝑛 − (1 + 𝜌)𝑑 ≥ (1 − 𝜆)(𝑎𝑛 − 𝜃𝑛)

On the LHS is the value of firm profits —and therefore of entrepreneur consumption— in period
2. On the RHS is the amount entrepreneurs could consume if they defaulted and absconded. So
the borrowing constraint ensures that an entrepreneur will never have incentives to misbehave.
Alternatively, the borrowing constraint can also be written as

                                      (1 + 𝜌)𝑑 ≤ 𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛

which has an intuitive interpretation: lenders will never lend more than they can recover.

We will also assume that

                                   (1 − 𝜆)(𝑎ℓ − 𝜃) ≥ (1 + 𝜌)𝜃

As Appendix 1 shows, this ensures that entrepreneurs will wish to keep employment at 𝑛9.




5
But they may not be able to finance the wage bill 𝜃𝑛9 if the borrowing constraint binds. In that
case, using 𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏 we have

                                                (1 + 𝜌)𝑏
                                    𝑛=                        .
                                          (1 + 𝜌)𝜃 − 𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)

So the labor a firm can hire is a multiple of its initial net worth 𝑏. From now we assume that 𝜆 is
sufficiently small so that the denominator is positive, regardless of the value of 𝑎. Notice 𝑛 is
increasing in 𝜆, which is intuitive: when 𝜆 is large, the incentive problem is less acute.


III.   Constrained and unconstrained equilibria

We are now ready to examine the possible implications of the pandemic. Can the pandemic have
no impact on the economy, in the sense that employment remains at its maximum level and
financial constraints do not bind? It is straightforward to check that this is the case if under full
employment the borrowing constraint 𝑑 ≤ 𝑣 does not bind, a condition that reduces to

                                 (𝜃𝑛9 − 𝑏)(1 + 𝜌) ≤ 𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃)𝑛9

The inequality reveals that an equilibrium in which financial constraints do not bind is more likely
to occur if 𝜆 and 𝑏 are large. A large 𝜆 means that firms can credibly pledge more of their expected
profits in the stock market, and hence that financial frictions are less severe. And a large 𝑏 means
that entrepreneurs have ample liquidity when the virus hits. Their initial liquidity allows them to
cover more of the initial wage bill without having to find outside finance.

Next consider financially-constrained equilibria, where entrepreneurs borrow up to the stock
market value of their firms, so that 𝑑 = 𝑣. But that market value, and hence the financial capacity
of the firms, depends on anticipated profits and therefore on the level of employment, which
itself depends on how much entrepreneurs borrow.

It helps to define two important employment levels. If the financial constraint is binding and
productivity is high, the level of employment must be:

                                                (1 + 𝜌)𝑏
                                   𝑛7 ≡
                                          (1 + 𝜌)𝜃 − 𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃)

This is the maximum employment level lenders will finance if the value of firms is high, reflecting
expectations of high productivity.

It is easy to check that a financially-constrained equilibrium with high productivity exists if

                                            𝑛6 < 𝑛7 < 𝑛9



6
Symmetrically, suppose the financial constraint is binding and markets expect productivity to be
low. Then the stock price is low, the constraint becomes more stringent, and employment is

                                                 (1 + 𝜌)𝑏
                                    𝑛ℓ ≡
                                           (1 + 𝜌)𝜃 − 𝜆(𝑎ℓ − 𝜃)

This is an equilibrium if
                                             0 < 𝑛ℓ ≤ 𝑛6

With financial constraints expectations become paramount, and this opens the door to multiple
equilibria. Financially-constrained equilibria with high and low productivity coexist if

                                      0 < 𝑛ℓ < 𝑛6 < 𝑛7 < 𝑛9.

Suppose that lenders expect asset values caused by low productivity. Then, the most they will be
willing to lend allows the firm to retain 𝑛ℓ workers. If 𝑛ℓ ≤ 𝑛6, then this is an equilibrium: lenders
lend little and as a result the firm has to shed key personnel and loses productivity. That confirms
lenders´ initial expectations. The same can occur if lenders expect high asset values and high
productivity and 𝑛6 < 𝑛7 : those expectation are also rational and self-fulfilling.

One can show that a constrained equilibrium with low productivity can also coexist with an
unconstrained equilibrium. In this case, if market participants expect high productivity, firms´
shares go up in value, which leaves them financially unconstrained and able to pay a sufficient
number of workers to keep productivity high. Conversely, if financial market participants are
pessimistic, firms cannot borrow enough, must therefore fire workers, and productivity drops.

These multiple equilibria occur because of a pecuniary externality. Lenders not take into the
account the effect their actions have on asset prices. And those asset prices in turn affect
borrowing limits, employment and productivity.


A graphical representation

It helps to visualize equilibria using two simple curves in 𝑑, 𝑛 space. A firm’s debt is given by

                                             𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏

Call this the CD schedule, for credit demand. The financial constraint, if it holds with equality, is

                                                𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛
                                           𝑑=
                                                  1+𝜌

Call this the FC curve. It is piecewise linear in 𝑛, because 𝑎 can be high or low depending on the
level of employment.


7
For the CD schedule to be steeper than FC requires

                                       𝜃(1 + 𝜌) > 𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃).

which we assumed already. It was the condition necessary to guarantee that in any constrained
equilibrium, feasible employment levels are a positive multiple of the firm´s initial net worth.

Figure 1 depicts the case of a single unconstrained equilibrium at 𝑛9. To check that this is in fact
an equilibrium, note that in the figure the firm´s debt acquired in period 1 is 𝑑̅ , which is the height
of the credit demand schedule CD at 𝑛9. In turn, the value of firms is 𝑣̅ , which is the height of the
financial constraint schedule FC at 𝑛9. In the figure 𝑣M > 𝑑̅ , which confirms that the firm is
financially unconstrained.

The figure reveals what conditions are conducive to an unconstrained equilibrium. Given FC, the
unconstrained equilibrium is more likely if CD is lower, which would happen if the firm´s initial
net worth (its holding 𝑏 of international bonds) is sufficiently large. The intuition is that the firm
can then afford to borrow relatively little and still not shed labor when the virus hits.

Likewise, given CD an unconstrained equilibrium is more likely if the FC schedule is steeper, which
is the case the higher 𝑎7 is. Then at full employment the value of firms is especially elevated,
further relaxing the firms’ borrowing constraint. Because an unconstrained equilibrium involves
full employment, productivity is high as well. In fact, efficiency requires full employment, a fact
that we prove formally in Appendix 2. So if an unconstrained equilibrium exists and is unique, it
is an optimal outcome and there is no efficiency case for policy intervention.

because that would require more collateral than they have: at 𝑛9 the CD schedule is above FC,
so 𝑑̅ > 𝑣̅ . Firms must cut employment to 𝑛7 , the highest level they can finance given the value
of the firm. This involves an inefficiency, since at 𝑛7 the productivity of labor exceeds its cost.2

Because both the CD and the FC have positive slopes, shocks are magnified by the interaction of
collateral values and leverage, in what Fornaro and Wolf (2020) term a doom loop. This is most
clearly seen by writing the wage bill in any constrained equilibrium as:

                                                        (1 + 𝜌)𝜃
                                         𝜃𝑛 ≡ O                       P𝑏
                                                  (1 + 𝜌)𝜃 − 𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)

On the RHS 𝑏 is multiplied by a coefficient that is larger than one, which is intuitive given that
firms can “leverage up” their net worth. So if the firm starts out with one fewer dollar of initial
net worth, its capacity to hire workers goes down by more than one dollar, because the drop in
the value of the firm reduces access to outside finance.

The case in Figure 3 involves two borrowing-constrained equilibria, with employment at 𝑛ℓ and
𝑛7 . Equilibrium is pinned down by self-fulfilling expectations. If potential share buyers are
optimistic, the market capitalization of firms is high. High collateral values enable firms to borrow
and raise employment above the threshold level 𝑛6. So productivity is high, making optimism self-
fulfilling. Conversely, pessimism results in low share prices, which reduce firms’ access to finance.
Employment falls to 𝑛R and expectations of low productivity are then justified.

    Given that 𝑎7 − 𝜃 > (1 − 𝜆)S𝑎ℓ − 𝜃T ≥ 𝜃(1 + 𝜌), the constrained equilibrium in Figure 2 is inefficient.

Figure 4 depicts the case of a single constrained equilibrium with low employment and low
productivity. This outcome could occur if, for instance, initial firm net worth is very low.
Productivity could be much higher if the firm could retain more workers after the virus hits, but
financial constraints keep it from doing so. This is a highly inefficient case.

Finally, Figure 5 depicts a case in which an efficient, unconstrained equilibrium coexists with a
low-productivity, financially-constrained equilibrium. This is a tricky case in which expectations
are crucial: optimistic expectations result in the optimal outcome and there is no need for any
policy measures, but adverse expectations can lead to the worst type of outcome.

IV.    Policy alternatives

What are policy alternatives in response to the crisis? Let us begin with what does not work.
Conventional expansionary fiscal policy does not work. Imagine the government borrows in
period 1 —either from households or from the rest of the world— and finances the operation
with a lump-sum tax in period 2. If the government immediately rebates the borrowed amount
to households, then the operation is neutral. If it chooses to store the resources and rebate them
back to households in period 2, that is again neutral.

The problem arising from the virus is one of supply, and so it cannot be cured by conventional
demand management policies. Demanding more goods from the representative firm has no
impact if the firm is constrained from producing them.

What about interest rate cuts? We have assumed households can borrow or lend freely from the
rest of the world at a real interest rate ρ. If households also lend to firms and are allowed to hold
shares, arbitrage opportunities will arise unless the households earn the same return. So
whenever borrowing occurs domestically it must also carry the real interest rate 𝜌.

But the government could reduce the costs of borrowing for firms by subsidizing the interest they
pay on loans. In period 2, when loans came due, firms would only pay a fraction of the market
rate and the government would pay the rest —financed by a tax on households or firms.


11
It is easy to see this policy has an effect via asset prices. The price of the firm is given by future
(pledged) profits discounted back to the present using the interest rate that firms effectively face.
Since this rate is now less than ρ, share prices go up.3 Then the value of collateral goes up,
allowing firms to raise employment if before they were financially constrained.

This situation is depicted in Figure 6, which assumes a unique laissez faire equilibrium with
employment at 𝑛7 < 𝑛9. Subsidizing interest costs for entrepreneurs makes the FC schedule
rotate counter-clockwise to FC’. Therefore employment goes up with the interest subsidy.

In Figure 6 a large enough interest rate subsidy raises share prices, relaxes borrowing constraints
and brings about full employment. In practice, however, this policy can be of limited use. If the
starting world interest rate 𝜌 is close to zero, there is little room to subsidize interest costs. And
in an environment of great uncertainty, asset prices are unlikely to be very responsive to interest
rate subsidies. Last but not least, it may be politically touchy to subsidize firms’ borrowing costs.

If multiple equilibria occur there is a further difficulty. Interest rate cuts in a situation such as that
in Figure 3 could rotate the FC schedule counter-clockwise by just enough to eliminate the 𝑛7
equilibrium but still allow for the 𝑛ℓ equilibrium. In that case the economy would remain
vulnerable to sudden bouts of pessimism, which could take the economy from 𝑛7 to 𝑛ℓ , with an
accompanying loss of employment and output. To ensure that the 𝑛ℓ equilibrium is also
eliminated, the interest rate subsidy would have to be even larger, which may be infeasible –
whether because of practical, fiscal or political reasons.

 We assume here that short selling in the stock market is not allowed or, alternatively, that market segmentation
prevents households from participating in the stock market. Otherwise households would enjoy an arbitrage
opportunity.


12
Given these difficulties, are there other policies with a higher chance of being effective? The
model suggests that the crucial issue is to enable firms to survive the initial contagion period
without shedding too many jobs. Could unorthodox policies work by temporarily helping firms
finance wage costs and retain workers?

The simplest such policy is to have the government pay the firms´ wage bill, so that employment
can remain at the optimal level 𝑛9.4 Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK are doing that. Start
from a constrained equilibrium with employment at 𝑛7 and assume that the government
provides a subsidy 𝑠 per unit of labor. In this case, the demand for loans by the firm is

                                                   𝑑 = (𝜃 − 𝑠)𝑛 − 𝑏

The CD curve shifts right and becomes flatter, as in Figure 7. Employment goes up, reflecting that
the wage subsidy reduces the firm’s financing requirements and therefore also makes it less
necessary to shed workers in period 1.

In Figure 7, the wage subsidy is large enough to bring about full employment 𝑛9 . This requires

                                                   𝑏 𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃)
                                               𝑠=𝜃− −
                                                   𝑛9  1+𝜌

Of course, such a policy requires the government to have enough fiscal space to borrow and fund
the operation, repaying the additional debt via higher taxes in period 2.

    See Appendix 2 for a proof that 𝑛9 is the efficient level for the economy.


13
Who should pay for this operation? The obvious alternative is to tax entrepreneurs, who are the
main beneficiaries of the scheme. To cover the cost for the government, tax revenues would have
to increase by (1 + 𝜌)𝑠𝑛9 in period 2. If this amount could be raised via lump sum taxes on
entrepreneurs all agents would benefit, as can be easily checked. But that requires that the
government have the capacity to enforce the payment of the extra taxes by entrepreneurs.5

An alternative is to tax households in period 2 and get them to pay for the wage subsidies in
period 1. This is not entirely unfounded, since it was the workers who received those wage
subsidies, which also allowed employment to remain at a level higher than would have been the
case without policy intervention. One can easily show that the period-1 value of labor income of
households´ labor income, net of taxes, increases by

                                      𝑛9 − 𝑛7
                                     X        Y [𝜃(1 − 𝜆) + 𝜆𝑎7 ] > 0
                                       1+𝜌

However, this amount is just the compensation to households for the disutility of their additional
labor. Hence, in this case, the wage subsidy policy restores full employment (and hence Pareto
efficiency), but it does not provide workers with a welfare gain.6

  In the context of the model the requirement is that the amount that the entrepreneur can seize is a share 1 − 𝜆
of output net of wage and taxes.
6
  This statement is accurate if in period 1 workers are experiencing disutility of labor (for which they are being
compensated) even though the output they produce is zero. One can imagine alternative assumptions, in which
workers only experience partial disutility if they stay home instead of going to the workplace.


14
Again, the possibility of multiple equilibria makes the policy problem more delicate. If the initial
situation is one with two constrained equilibria, as in Figure 8, a wage subsidy may take the
economy to an equilibrium with employment at 𝑛9, but it may not if expectations are adverse:
depending on the minimum efficient scale and other parameters, the subsidy may not be enough
to eliminate the multiplicity of equilibria.

In that case the government would be spending fiscal resources but could not guarantee that the
economy would settle on the full employment outcome. In order to achieve this outcome, the
subsidy 𝑠 would have to be higher, so as to shift the CD curve clockwise even further. Of course,
the larger subsidy to eliminate the possibility of the bad equilibrium would require even more
fiscal space and a larger tax in period 2.

A policy equivalent to wage subsidies is the proverbial helicopter drop of liquid government
assets. The government could supplement the firm’s initial net worth of 𝑏 by sending out to firms
the required amounts of government bonds bearing the market rate of interest and maturing in
period 2. In turn, firms could sell the bonds to pay the wage bill or —even easier— could simply
pay workers in government bonds.

Because there are no imperfections other than the borrowing constraint and the pecuniary
externality that gives rise to multiple equilibria, in this model the issuance of liquidity through
government bonds does not create net wealth. So this policy is not very different to the one in
which the government pays the firms’ wage bill. And all the same issues as to who pays the tax
bill and what incentives this provides apply here.

Wage subsidies and helicopter drops help protect employment by providing firms with liquid
resources they can use to bypass binding finance constraints. But they do not attempt to alleviate
the severity of those borrowing constraints. Other policies go further in that direction. One
alternative is an equity injection, by which we mean that government temporarily acquires
ownership and control of firms in exchange for initial liquidity provision.

In order to illustrate how equity injections might work, imagine that without government
intervention the economy would settle on a low-productivity unique equilibrium like the one
described in Figure 4. The value of the firm in that equilibrium would be

                                               𝜆S𝑎ℓ − 𝜃T𝑛ℓ
                                        𝑣ℓ =               ,
                                                  1+𝜌

implying a debt limit that would restrict to the firm to hire just 𝑛ℓ workers:

                                        𝑣 ℓ = 𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛ℓ − 𝑏




15
In this equilibrium entrepreneurs would like to raise employment to 𝑛9, but they cannot borrow
the 𝜃S𝑛9 − 𝑛ℓ T they would need to finance the additional wage costs.

To correct this situation, the government may be able to send 𝑒 dollars to the firm, and as a result
acquire control rights. These control rights imply, in particular, that in period 2 the government
can secure repayment of (1 + 𝜌)𝑒 dollars out of the firm’s final profits.

Suppose that, in fact, the equity injection is large enough to allow the firm to hire 𝑛9 workers. An
interesting fact is that 𝑒 does not need to be as large as 𝜃S𝑛9 − 𝑛ℓ T. Why? Because the increase
in employment leads to higher share prices, allowing the firm to borrow more. In fact, the value
of the firm would increase to

                                                     𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃)𝑛9
                                                𝑣̅ =
                                                        1+𝜌

reflecting increased profits due to larger scale and higher productivity.

This implies that the minimum value of the equity injection that restores full employment would
be given by 𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛9 − 𝑏 − 𝑒 = 𝑣̅ , that is,

                                                           𝜆(𝑎7 − 𝜃)𝑛9
                                         𝑒 = 𝜃𝑛9 − 𝑏 −
                                                             (1 + 𝜌)

which is less than 𝜃S𝑛9 − 𝑛ℓ T, as one can easily check.

In terms of Figure 4, the equity injection would move CD to the right until it intersects FC at the
full employment level 𝑛9. This policy is particularly effective since government resources are
leveraged up, in the sense that the 𝑒 dollars allow the firm to finance an increase in the wage bill
of more than 𝑒, the difference reflecting better access to outside finance through an increase in
the value of the firm.

So equity injections can be powerful tools. This is so, however, on the assumption that they give
the government the power to seize a fraction of the firm’s profits that cannot be pledged to other
outside investors, perhaps because it has acquired control (seats on the board of the company)
in exchange for the equity injection. In the absence of formal board appointments, the
government could impose conditions regarding dividend payments, stock buybacks and
executive compensation, so as to ensure that the resources from the equity injection are first
used to hire 𝑛9 workers and raise productivity, and then in period 2 to pay the corresponding
dividends and debt service.7


7
 Another obvious caveat is that equity injections, coupled with temporary government control, make sense for firms
above a certain size. It would make little senses for government to inject equity and attempt to run the corner shop
or the restaurant down the street.


16
Similar observations apply to credit guarantees. Suppose that the government promises lenders
to pay a fraction 0 < 𝛾 ≤ 1 of their loans outstanding in case of default by the firm. This would
effectively change the collateral constraint to

                                                            𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛
                                        𝑑(1 − 𝛾) ≤ 𝑣 =
                                                              1+𝜌

In terms of the previous figures, the credit guarantee would move the FC schedule
counterclockwise from the origin. A large enough guarantee would be able to raise employment
to 𝑛9. So this policy might seem like a win-win: it would deliver the full-employment, high-
productivity equilibria without requiring fiscal resources in period 1. Unfortunately, the
guarantee may expose the government to moral hazard. From the perspective of the
entrepreneur it would be optimal to default in period 2 and abscond, as any reader can check.

So we conclude that credit guarantees, like equity injections, may not sufficient by themselves.
In order to make the guarantees incentive-compatible, the government would have to combine
them with a strengthening of the incentives for the entrepreneur to repay. In the context of the
model, that means reducing the fraction 1 − 𝜆 of profits the entrepreneur can seize before
absconding. That is exactly what some European governments have done, excluding from loan
guarantees those companies that operate out of tax havens. Alternatively, the government could
again condition the provision of a guarantee to the suspension of dividend payments or the
limiting of executive compensation.


V.      Policy discussion

So several unconventional policies —wage subsidies, liquidity injections, equity injections, and
loan guarantees— if sufficiently large, can keep the economy in a full-employment, high-
productivity equilibrium in the aftermath of a pandemic.

What these policies all have in common is that government provides entrepreneurs with
resources in excess of what borrowing constraints, which are really incentive constraints, would
have allowed. The policies differ in terms of the implied enforcement requirements in period 2,
when the entrepreneur has an incentive to abscond with a share of the profits, leaving taxes
unpaid (in the case of a wage subsidy or a liquidity injection), dividends unpaid (in the case of
equity injections), or debts unpaid (in the case of loan guarantees).8 This point is crucial, because
it reveals that the policies will be feasible insofar as government is able to do what private agents
cannot: compel entrepreneurs to play by the rules.

 Potentially, there is a period-1 incentive problem as well. The entrepreneur could take the resources provided by
the government, plus his own liquid resources, and abscond without hiring any workers or paying any wages. This
potential problem would bias the policy choice toward alternatives in which government pays workers directly (wage
subsidies) or controls the actions of management (equity injections).


17
In some cases, such as tax collection, this means appealing to the coercive powers of the state.
In other cases, such as equity injections, it means that government can either limit ex ante certain
actions by the firm (like pay large bonuses to management and deplete a firm´s cash reserves),
or become a large enough shareholder to prevent the company board from approving such
actions. The argument is weakest in the case of loan guarantees, but even here government can
do things private lender cannot, like seizing tax returns (or even assets) in case of non-payment.9

All these policies become more complex in the presence of multiple equilibria. The size of the
intervention necessary to make full employment feasible is not necessarily one that will rule out
other less attractive equilibria with lower employment and potentially lower productivity. A
larger intervention may rule out the bad equilibria, but it will necessarily be a more expensive
intervention, which may not be affordable for governments with limited fiscal space.

Alternatively, governments may choose to stick to the smaller of the two interventions (the one
that leaves open the possibility of a bad equilibrium) but try actively to coordinate expectations
on the good outcome. Optimistic talk alone may not do the trick, because lenders will lend more
if and only if they expect other lenders will lend more. One possibility is to rely on large state-
owned lenders who internalize the pecuniary externality and lend enough to coordinate
expectations on the good outcome. A few countries did exactly that during the great recession
of 2007-09, and some of those countries are doing it again today.10

Fiscal space is also an issue. In all of our exercises above we assumed that the government could
levy lump-sum taxes in period 2 to finance whatever additional expenditures it undertook in
period 1. This might be unrealistic, of course, in that political constraints might limit any future
tax increases, and/or taxes that are politically feasible could be highly distortionary.

The sequence of events in which government spends in period 1 and taxes in period 2 also
assumes implicitly that the government can borrow more or run down assets in period 1. That is
not problematic for most advanced economies, but could be a difficult issue for many emerging
market governments, whose ability to borrow large amounts may be severely limited, particularly
during a pandemic-driven crisis.

Moreover, constraints on international borrowing could also be an obstacle to the
implementation of unconventional policies. In all scenarios above, the policies involve inducing
the firm to run a deficit (it keeps paying wages even though it has no revenue) and also prompting
the government to run a deficit (spend today and raise taxes tomorrow to pay the bill). So unless
private households are big savers in period 1, the country as a whole is likely to be running a
current account deficit.

  Someone could ask why a large enough private agent could not itself carry out the equity injection and seek control
of actions by the firm. One possible answer is that this is imaginable in individual cases, but it is more difficult to
envision if many firms across the economy require equity injections. Another answer is that at a time of generalized
crisis (like a pandemic) private agents themselves are likely to be liquidity-constrained and unable to invest.

Who will finance the current account gap? In the model, households have initial assets 𝑓 and
firms have initial assets 𝑏, both presumably holdings of the internationally tradable bond.
Government could also be holding liquid international assets, perhaps in a sovereign wealth fund
or as central bank reserves. But only a few countries are short-term net creditors, in the sense of
holding more short-term claims on the rest of the world than the rest of the world holds on them.
For all other countries, the only way out in the event of a pandemic is to borrow abroad, as we
implicitly assumed in the policy exercises carried out above.

But it could well be that the country is rationed out from international private capital markets.
Or that international capital markets effectively freeze for a period of time, as it happened in
2008-09. Then the country as a whole (the private and public sectors) would not have access to
the necessary resources to finance the interventions required to guarantee the full-employment,
high-productivity outcome.

Official lending, whether on a bilateral basis or through multilateral lenders such as the IMF or
the World Bank, could in theory make up the difference. But one thing this crisis has confirmed
is that multilateral lenders have nowhere near the volume of resources required, and their main
shareholders (the large advanced countries plus China) are reluctant to provide more capital.
Large shareholders like the US have also refused to provide more short-term international
liquidity via an extraordinary and sizeable issue of SDRs. So for many countries living through this
pandemic, welfare-improving policy interventions may be unattainable simply because of lack of
resources from abroad.

A last and important caveat has to do with the length of the shock. In the model of this paper we
assumed that if unconstrained, the firm always wishes to stay at the pre-crisis, full-employment
level. For our purposes that assumption makes sense. But one can easily imagine scenarios in
which the productivity shock lasts many periods, so that it does not make sense from an
economic point of view for the firm to keep everyone employed. That could happen, for instance,
if there are second, third or fourth waves of infection. Or in a number of sectors —air transport,
tourism, other services— the pandemic itself could trigger either changes in demand or
technological innovations (the rise of Zoom and Teams?) that render firms insolvent or
unprofitable over the long run. In those scenarios, the policy discussion would need to have a
different focus: how to help firms reduce their scale or wind down operations.



VI.    Conclusions

The world has seen many banking crises, debt crises, exchange rate crises, inflation crises and
recessionary crises. But never before did it witness a crisis triggered by government orders telling
firms to suspend operations and workers to stay home. It is a negative supply shock or negative
productivity shock of unprecedented size.




19
A firm holds much of its productive capital in the workers it has recruited, hired and trained. If
the Covid-19 crisis forces an entrepreneur to fire those workers, the firm´s productivity will
suffer. But to keep paying the wage bill while sales and revenue are close to zero, the
entrepreneur needs credit. And credit flows are notorious for being available at all times except
when you really need credit —in a crisis.

The social and economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic is tremendous. But capital market
failures have the potential to make it even larger still. To prevent toxic multiplier effects from
kicking in, conventional fiscal policy is useless, and conventional monetary policy faces severe
limitations. Unconventional fiscal and financial policies are imperative. This is not the time for
governments to be timid.

In this paper we have shown which unconventional measures work, when it is they work and why
they work. The catch is that they can be fiscally expensive. In a world of near-zero or negative
real interest rates, that is not a problem for advanced countries, which have the fiscal space to
issue huge quantities of bonds and money (which in turn a near-perfect substitutes as long as
interest rates remain very low).

It is a problem, however, for many emerging and developing countries, which have very limited
fiscal space. The macroeconomic vaccine to deal with the employment fallout from Covid-19
exists. It will be a tragedy if that vaccine is not used because patients cannot afford it and no
friend steps forward to help pay the bill.

Appendix 1: Financial constraints and the value of firms

In the main text we mentioned that the equilibrium equations in the model of financial frictions
can be derived from a setting with a stock market that determines the value of firms, which in
turn determines the borrowing constraint. In this appendix we develop that.

As mentioned in the text, shares in a firm are claims to a fraction λ of the firm’s profits in period
𝑡 = 2. Each entrepreneur starts period 𝑡 = 1 owning one share in her firm. She buys or sells
𝜙 shares in the stock market at price 𝑣. Of course, in equilibrium 𝜙 = 1, but we need to allow for
arbitrary 𝜙 to analyze the entrepreneur’s decision problem.

The entrepreneur´s budget constraint in period 1 is

                                        𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏 + (𝜙 − 1)𝑣
and her final consumption is

                             𝑐 b = (1 − 𝜆)(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛 − (1 + 𝜌)𝑑 + 𝛾Δ

where Δ denotes dividends per share.

Finally, the entrepreneur is subject to the borrowing constraint

                                                  𝑑≤𝑣

Note that the RHS is given by the value of the entrepreneur’s initial share holdings (of one).

Combining the first two equations, we see that the entrepreneur´s consumption level is

                  𝑐 b = (1 − 𝜆)(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛 − (1 + 𝜌)[𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏 + (𝜙 − 1)𝑣] + 𝛾Δ

It follows that the entrepreneur will choose the highest affordable 𝑛 if

                                      (1 − 𝜆)(𝑎ℓ − 𝜃) ≥ 𝜃(1 + 𝜌)

which is the condition in the text.

Now, naturally dividends per share are given by ∆= 𝜆(𝑎 − 𝜃)𝑛. Absence of arbitrage requires

                                                        Δ
                                                1+𝜌 =
                                                        𝑣
                        e(fgh)i
which means that 𝑣 =      $jk
                                  , as in the text.




22
The borrowing constraint 𝑑 ≤ 𝑣 then reduces to

                                     (1 + 𝜌)𝑑 ≤ 𝜆(𝑎𝑛 − 𝜃𝑛)

And, finally, in equilibrium 𝜙 = 1, so that the budget constraint becomes

                                           𝑑 = 𝜃𝑛 − 𝑏

The last two equations are the ones we exploit in the text.


Appendix 2: Efficiency

Consider the standard problem of maximizing a social welfare function 𝑊(𝑢7 , 𝑢b ), where 𝑊 is
strictly increasing in the welfare of households:

                                                      𝑐( − 𝜃𝑛(
                                    𝑢7 = 𝑐$ − 𝜃𝑛$ +
                                                        1+𝜌

and the welfare of entrepreneurs

                                                  𝑐b
                                            𝑢b =
                                                 1+𝜌

The choice set must respect the labor adjustment constraint

                                           𝑛$ = 𝑛( = 𝑛

and the intertemporal resource constraint

                                       𝑐( + 𝑐 b        𝑎𝑛(
                                  𝑐$ +          = 𝑏+𝑓+
                                        1+𝜌            1+𝜌

where
                                            𝑎ℓ if 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛6
                                      𝑎 = 1 𝑎7 if 𝑛6 < 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛9
                                            0 otherwise

The resource constraint is the appropriate one for the economy as a whole, assuming that it can
borrow or lend at the world interest rate ρ.

As usual, for given 𝑊, a solution to this problem identifies a Pareto optimal allocation. By varying
𝑊 one can then trace the Pareto frontier.



23
Combining the previous expressions, the resource constraint can be rewritten as

                                               𝑎𝑛           1
                         𝑢7 + 𝑢b = 𝑏 + 𝑓 +        − 𝜃 n1 +     o𝑛
                                              1+𝜌          1+𝜌

The assumption that (𝑎R − 𝜃) > (1 + 𝜌)𝜃 implies that full employment 𝑛 = 𝑛9 maximizes the
right hand side. Since this is independent of the choice of 𝑊, it follows that any Pareto optimal
allocation must feature full employment. Conversely, under that condition, any equilibrium with
less than full employment is socially inefficient.

Hence the set of all Pareto efficient allocations is given by full employment 𝑛 = 𝑛9 and by any
consumption distribution that satisfies the resulting resource constraint:

                                        𝑐( + 𝑐 b         𝑎𝑛9
                                 𝑐$ +            = 𝑏+𝑓+
                                         1+𝜌            1+𝜌
