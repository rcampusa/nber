Evolving Choice Inconsistencies in Choice of Prescription Drug Insurance

                                            ABSTRACT

We study choice over prescription insurance plans by the elderly using government administrative
data to evaluate how these choices are made and evolve over time. We find that there is large "foregone
savings" from not choosing the lowest cost plan that has grown over time. We develop a structural
framework that allows us to exactly decompose the changes in "foregone welfare" from inconsistent
choices into supply and demand side factors. We find that foregone welfare increases over time due
primarily to supply-side factors such as premiums and out-of-pocket costs; we estimate little learning
at either the individual or cohort level.

        The past five years has seen a sea change in the way that publicly provided
health insurance benefits are delivered to the U.S. population. From the
introduction of the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 1965, expansions in
public health insurance entitlements came through the extension of these
monopoly government-run insurance plans. But beginning with the introduction
of the Medicare Part D Prescription drug program in 2006, and continuing
through the exchanges that are at the center of the Affordable Care Act that was
passed in 2010, the U.S. has been moving to a different model: insurance
exchanges where the publicly insured choose from a host of subsidized private
insurance options.
        This privatization of the delivery of public insurance raises a host of
interesting policy and research questions. Primary among these is the ability of
individuals to make consistent choices across a potentially large array of choices
with meaningful differences. In Abaluck and Gruber (2011), we explored this
issue in the context of the Part D program. We considered in particular whether
elders appeared to be properly weighing the premium and out of pocket spending
implications of their plan choices. We concluded that they were not, with the
typical elder able to save about 30 percent of total costs (premiums plus out of
pocket costs) through a more appropriate choice of plan.
        A subsequent paper by Ketcham et al. (2012), however, argues that these
choice inconsistencies are largely initial errors made by those newly enrolling in
Part D and that they are mostly corrected through plan switching from 2006 to
2007. This is an important contention. If in fact choice inconsistency was simply
a feature of the initial year of the program, it suggests that this is not a major issue
for the long run welfare evaluation of this new insurance model.
        In this paper we revisit the question of evolving choice inconsistencies
over time. We do so using newly available data on a 20% sample of Part D
claims data recently made available by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid




                                           2
Services (CMS).     These data have information on the full set of prescription drug
claims under Part D for every senior enrolled in the program, as well as
information on the characteristics of the plans that they chose.
       Using these improved data, we continue to find that seniors are making
inconsistent plan choices in the first year of Part D (2006). We find a similar
level of foregone savings and overweighting of premiums relative to expected out
of pocket costs as in our previous work. However, in contrast to Ketcham et al.,
we find that choices do not improve over time in aggregate. Rather, the amount
of “foregone savings” available to consumers choosing Part D plans grows over
time, and is larger by 2009 than it was at the start of the Part D program in 2006.
       This fact motivates us to develop a structural framework in which to study
plan choices over time. This framework allows us to mathematically decompose
the “foregone welfare” from inconsistent plan choices into components due to
demand side factors, supply side factors, and changes in preferences over time.
On the demand side, we can use data on choices by movers and stayers, as well as
by new cohorts over time, to separately identify the effects of inertia, learning
from experience, and calendar year or “cohort” learning effects on the quality of
choices. On the supply side, we can use the structural parameters of our model to
decompose the total supply effect into factors such as the change in premiums, the
change in out of pocket costs, and the set of plan choices available.
       Overall, we find that the welfare cost of choice inconsistencies increases
over time. These net changes reflect a number of moving pieces and different
factors appear to be driving the changes in different years. But the key general
conclusion of our analysis is that there is little improvement in the ability of
consumers to choose plans over time; we identify and estimate little learning at
either the individual or cohort level over the years of our analysis. Inertia does
reduce welfare, but even in a world with no inertia we estimate that substantial
welfare losses would remain. We conclude that the increased choice




                                          3
inconsistencies over time are driven by changes on the supply side that are not
offset both because of inertia and because non-inertial consumers still make
inconsistent choices.
           Our welfare analyses are sensitive to the assumptions we make about
brand preferences; should we regard these as reflecting omitted but desirable
features of brands (meaning only within brand errors are possible) or should we
regard preferences for particular brands as heuristics which have no actual value
to consumers after conditioning on coverage characteristics and quality? To help
answer these questions, we estimate several random coefficients models to better
understand the structure of brand preferences. We find little correlation in
preferences for particular brands over time (after conditioning on inertia), but we
do find evidence that some beneficiaries consistently prefer more popular brands.
           Our paper proceeds as follows. In Part I, we review the Medicare Part D
program and related previous literature. In Part II, we discuss at length the new
CMS Part D data. Part III presents the basic facts on plan choice and plan
switching. Part IV describes our empirical strategy for more rigorously modeling
choice inconsistencies as well as the reasons for changes in welfare over time, and
Part V presents the results of our analysis. Part VI concludes.


                                     Part I: Background1
The Medicare Part D Program
           Medicare, which provides universal health insurance coverage to those
over age 65 and to those on the disability insurance program, did not include
coverage of outpatient prescription drugs when it was established in 1965; this
coverage was added through the Part D program that passed in 2003 and became
active in 2006. The most noticeable innovation of the Part D plan is that this new

                                                 4
Medicare benefit is not delivered by the government, but rather by private
insurers under contract with the government. Beneficiaries can choose from
stand-alone plans called Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) (a plan that just
offers prescription drug benefits), Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that provide
all Medicare benefits, or existing employer/union plans, so long as coverage is
“creditable” or at least as generous (i.e. actuarially equivalent) as the standard Part
D plan, for which they would receive a subsidy from the government.
       Under Part D, recipients are entitled to basic coverage of prescription
drugs by a plan with a structure actuarially equivalent to a standard plan. In 2006
the standard plan offered the following coverage: none of the first $250 in drug
costs each year; 75 percent of costs for the next $2,250 of drug spending (up to
$2,500 total); 0 percent of costs for the next $3,600 of drug spending (up to
$5,100 total, the “donut hole”); and 95 percent of costs above $5,100 of drug
spending (McClellan, 2006). Over 90 percent of beneficiaries in 2006, however,
were not enrolled in the standard benefit design, but rather are in plans with low
or no deductibles, flat payments for covered drugs following a tiered system, or
some form of coverage in the donut hole (McClellan, 2006). The main
requirement for plans is that they must have equal or greater actuarial value than
the standard benefit.
       Enrollment in Part D plans was voluntary for Medicare eligible citizens,
although Medicare recipients not signing up by May 15, 2006 were subject to a
financial penalty if they eventually joined the program (to mitigate adverse
selection in the choice of joining the program). One group, however, was
automatically enrolled: low income elders who had been receiving their
prescription drug coverage through state Medicaid programs (the “dual
eligibles”). These dual eligible were enrolled in Part D plans by default if they
did not choose one on their own, and copayments were lowered. There were also
special subsidies for lower income elders slightly above Medicaid eligibility.




                                          5
        Despite reluctance voiced before the legislation passed, there was
enormous interest from insurers in participating in the Part D program. By
November 2006, 3,032 plans were being offered to potential Part D enrollees.
Every county in the nation had at least 27 plans available; the typical county had
48 plans, while some counties featured more than 70 choices, primarily due to
high number of MA plans.2         As of June 2006, there were 10.4 million people
enrolled in stand-alone PDP plans, 5.5 million people enrolled in MA plans and
about 6 million dual eligibles.3 Yet 73 percent of people over 65 felt that the
Medicare prescription drug benefit was too complicated, while 91 percent of
pharmacists and 92 percent of doctors expressed this concern. When asked if they
agree with the statement “Medicare should select a handful of plans that meet
certain standards so seniors have an easier time choosing,” 60 percent of seniors
answered “Yes.”4
        Despite these reservations, there were no signs of diminished plan choice
in subsequent years. The number of PDPs increased by about 30 percent in 2007,
from 1,429 to 1,875 and remained at this level in 2008.5 By 2012, there were
1603 PDPs available.
        The presentation of options for Part D depends very much on the context
in which individuals choose plans. Medicare.gov lays out plan choices in a very
clear way and includes a calculator on which our simulator is based.
Unfortunately, data in Kling et al. (2012) suggests that only a very small share of
enrollees, at least at the time of their survey, use this resource. There is no default

Issues of Elder Choice in Part D
        Standard economic theory would suggest that Medicare beneficiaries are
better off choosing from a wide variety of plans that meet their needs, rather than
constraining them to a limited set of choices being made by the government. But,
as reviewed in detail in Iyengar and Kamenica (2006), and summarized in AG,
there are a large number of behavioral economics models which suggest that in
fact agents may be better off with more restrictive choice sets. Other recent
literature has shown that the nature of how choices are presented can have
important impacts on choice. And work by Agarwal et al. (2007) shows that
issues may be magnified for the elderly.
        Our work builds on a small existing literature on elder choice in Part D.
Most relevant for the current paper is our previous paper (AG) and the work of
Ketcham et al. (KLMR, 2011).6 In AG, we use data from Wolters Kluwer (WK),
the largest “switch” operator in the prescription drug market that collects the
electronic claims from pharmacies and pass them on to the Pharmacy Benefit
Managers (PBMs) and insurance companies that will pay the claims. We find in
that paper that only about 12 percent of elders choose the cost minimizing plan
(the plan which minimizes the sum of premiums plus expected out of pocket

6
  Other important studies in this area include Heisset. al. (2006) and Winter et. al. (2006), who
survey a set of elders about their plans for enrolling in Part D programs, and evaluate whether
enrollment intentions in the plan were “rational” given the penalties for delay. They find that,
the decision over whether to enroll seems to be made rationally for most enrollees, but that only
a minority of enrollees facing a hypothetical plan choice chose the cost-minimizing plan.
Another important study is by Kling et al. (2012), who examine how providing people with
information about the relative costs of each of the available plans in 2007 computed using their
2006 claims impacts their choices. They find that individuals who receive this intervention are
more likely to switch plans, and more likely to end up with lower predicted and realized costs.
Most recently, Ericson (forthcoming) documents the importance of inertia in plan choice and
how it impacts dynamic firm pricing decisions.




                                                7
costs), and that the average elder could save about 30 percent by choosing the cost
minimizing plan. We also estimate plan choice models that document key choice
inconsistencies. We conclude with a partial equilibrium welfare analysis which
implies that welfare would have been 27 percent higher if patients had all chosen
rationally.
        KLMR focus on plan switching decisions, highlighting the fact that a
number of studies document the amelioration of choice biases through repeated
market interactions. They turn to data from CVS Caremark, a Pharmacy Benefit
Manager (PBM) for a number of PDPs (9 in 2006 and 18 in 2007).KLMR find
large choice inconsistencies in 2006, with most individuals in their sample
choosing plans that were significantly more expensive than the cost minimizing
option. But they find that these inconsistencies are substantially reduced by plan
switching in 2007, with the median amount of “Foregone Savings” relative to the
cost minimizing choice falling by more than $200, and the number of individuals
foregoing savings by less than $100 rises from zero to one-third of the sample.
        Our work significantly improves on both of these studies along two
dimensions. First, we use administrative data sampled from the full universe of
Part D enrollees and claims. AG’s data captured by the WK system represent only
31 percent of all 3rd party prescription claims filled in the U.S, and there is a
sizeable rate of attrition from the data (about one-third of the sample per year),
which potentially arises from individuals using pharmacies outside of the WK
network. KLMR are only able to follow individuals who stay within their small
set of PDPs, and their limited set of plans do not include any plans with donut
hole coverage (which AG highlight as a major source of choice inconsistency) so
that they may as a result understate inconsistencies.
        Our results confirm the findings of both AG and KLMR that there are
sizeable choice inconsistencies in 2006. But unlike KLMR, we find that choice
inconsistencies worsen over time, with a large growth in foregone savings from




                                           8
2006 to 2009. We are unable to replicate KLMR’s results in our data so we
cannot say for sure what drives this inconsistency. But we suspect that it arises
from the limited nature of the plans in their subsample. In particular, they
find that most of this reduction comes from switchers moving to more cost
effective plans, but their estimated switching rate of 54% is much higher than is
reported in virtually every other health insurance study.7,8 Further, while we do
replicate the finding that foregone savings declined from 2006 to 2007, we find
that in fact, this is explained by consumers choosing cheaper plans with lower
quality ratings and our more comprehensive measure which includes these quality
ratings suggests that choices did not improve from 2006 to 2007 and grew
substantially worse thereafter. We also find that the large foregone savings in
2006 are driven largely by a single low-cost plan; if we compute foregone savings
relative to the 2nd lowest cost plan, we see a monotonic increase over time.
         The second major contribution of our approach is the use of a structural
model which decomposes the reasons for changes in the nature of choice over
time. This allows us to not only document these growing choice inconsistencies,
but to explain their sources – and in particular to contrast the (limited) role of
learning against the (significant) role of supply side changes.

7
  The classic reference on this topic is Neipp and Zeckhauser (1985), who estimate an annual
switching rate among health insurance plans of 3% in the mid-1980s.
8Two studies written in parallel with ours also use the new CMS Part D data to examine the
optimality of Part D plan choice. Heiss et al. (2012) finds significant "overspending" in Part D
using these data, replicating the earlier work of AG. Heiss et al. do not emphasize changes over
time; they find that by some measures choices improve over time and by others they get worse.
A second study by Jonathan Ketchem, Claudio Lucarelli, and Christopher Powers argues that
more experienced consumers are more likely to switch plans and save money conditional on
switching. Neither article puts their findings in a welfare analytic framework that allows them to
incorporate the impacts of variance or plan quality. And neither decomposes their findings into
supply and demand side factors in order to understand why the quality of chosen plans is
changing relative to the best available plan. Ketcham et al. in particular focuses on the
determinants of switching behavior; our analysis suggests that inertia accounts for only 1/3 of
foregone welfare.




                                                 9
                                        Part II: Data
        The main source of data for our analysis is a 20% sample of the newly
released universe of claims for Medicare Part D enrollees; we study the subset of
claims for beneficiaries enrolled in stand-alone prescription drug plans not
receiving any low income subsidies. These claims are linked to encrypted plan
IDs which are linked to a plan characteristics file containing information on
premiums, deductibles, and donut hole coverage. Information on plan formularies
is inferred from copayment costs.
Construction of Out of Pocket Cost Variables
        The total enrollee costs of Part D can be decomposed into premiums,
which are known for certain at the time of plan choice, and the distribution of out
of pocket costs given the information available at the time when plans are chosen.
Our focus is on estimating the distribution of costs given all of the information
potentially available to individuals at the time when they make their choice.
However, we only observe realized out of pocket costs for the plan in which an
individual is enrolled. We therefore assume that the set of claims is fixed and
would remain constant had the individual in question chosen a different plan.9
        We consider two alternative models of out of pocket costs: the first is a
“realized cost” model in which we construct out of pocket costs using the claims
incurred by individuals during that year. This amounts to assuming that
individuals chose their Part D plans with perfect foresight as to what their claims
would be, which is clearly not fully accurate. The second model we consider is a
“rational expectations” model in which we compute expected spending in that
year based on either prior year claims or claims in the first month of enrollment.
9
 This assumption of no moral hazard allows us to use the calculator to determine what each
individual’s realized costs would be for each plan in their choice set. See Appendix B for a
discussion of why this should not materially impact our results.




                                               10
We use this model in our regression analysis because it allows us to quantify in a
natural way the riskiness of alternative plans. In AG, we show that our main
conclusions regarding choice inconsistencies are not sensitive to the choice of
model, and are further robust to allowing consumers to have private information
so that they know more than we would predict using the previous year’s claims
but have less than perfect foresight.
       Both models rely on the calculator we construct to determine what out of
pocket costs would be for a fixed set of claims in each of the plans in a
beneficiary’s choice set. We can check the accuracy of our calculator by
comparing simulated out of pocket costs using the calculator to actual out of
pocket costs in the plan in which beneficiaries were actually enrolled. We find a
very high correlation of 0.992. The mean difference is $11.6 with a mean
absolute deviation of $33 on a mean of $890 (using our baseline sample of full
year enrollees). This is an order of magnitude smaller than the cost savings we
find, so we do not believe these errors could be driving our results.
       Another issue that must be addressed is that we observe only a single
realization of out of pocket costs for each individual, so we do not observe the
variance in spending across choices. We construct this variance in our rational
expectation measure based on the distribution of realized costs among individuals
who look ex ante identical. In AG, we defined 1000 cells based on deciles of total
expenditure, days supply of branded drugs and days supply of generic drugs in the
prior year and called individuals ex ante identical if they were in the same cell.
Because we do not observe prior year spending in 2006, in our main
specifications we define 10 cells based on expenditures in the first month of
enrollment and construct the distribution of realized costs among individuals who
enrolled in the same month and were in the same cell. We show in Appendix




                                         11
Table 1 that our results do not depend on whether we use the 10 cell or 1000 cell
model in 2007 when both models are feasible.10
Sample Selection
        We begin with a 20 percent sample of all Medicare Part D beneficiaries in
2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. This includes 7,213,755 beneficiaries. We then drop
all beneficiaries with employer coverage or who are eligible to receive low
income subsidies; in the former case, we lack sufficient information to
characterize their plans and in the latter case, there is little variation in cost-
sharing given available subsidies. The omission of those with low income
subsidies does not much limit the broader application of our results, say to ACA
exchanges, since everyone in this market is receiving some subsidies; the low
income population simply receives extra subsidies.
        We additionally drop beneficiaries who change location during the year,
who have claims from multiple plans or are enrolled in plans with brands with
fewer than 100 enrollees in a state (this last has little impact on the sample but
reduces the number of fixed effects in our model). In the primary sample
considered in the text, we also restrict to individuals who were enrolled in a Part
D plan for the full year. This restriction makes costs more comparable across
years (since more consumers enrolled late in 2006) and leaves 1,762,059
beneficiaries. We show in Appendix Table 2 that the trends we observe in
foregone savings over time are not sensitive to this restriction.
        In our structural models, we consider two samples. The first, which we
refer to as the “Full Sample”, includes a 20 percent sample of our data in all years,
or a 4% sample of Part D enrollees because our data is itself a 20% sample (we
impose this further restriction because it is computationally more convenient and
10
  This is consistent with our findings in AG, in which the variance measures did not much impact
plan choice, and our basic findings based on means were not much impacted by conditioning on
the variance of spending across plans as well.




                                               12
more than adequate for statistical significance in all of our analysis). The second,
which we refer to as the “Panel Sample”, restricts to a 20 percent sample of
beneficiaries who are present in our data in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, or a 4%
sample of all such Part D beneficiaries. Our structural model is estimated using
the full sample (new enrollees entering in each year help identify several
parameters), but we report simulation results using the panel sample so that
changes over time are not confounded by individuals entering and leaving the
sample.
       Appendix Tables 3 and 4 analyze the reasons why beneficiaries enter and
exit the sample in each year for our “full sample”. The most common reasons for
entering the sample are having enrolled after January in the previous year, having
claims from multiple plans in the previous year, or being enrolled in a non-PDP
plan the previous year (either an MA plan or a plan through one’s employer). The
most common reasons for exiting are switching from a non-PDP plan, death or
having claims from multiple plans, or - in 2009 – simply disappearing from the
data entirely. Some identification in our analysis below comes from comparing
new entrants with returning beneficiaries; new entrants are defined based on their
first appearance in the beneficiary file, not based on their year of entry into our
sample. For example, a beneficiary who turned 65 in 2007 would count as a new
entrant; a beneficiary who entered our final sample in 2007 because they enrolled
in a month after January in 2006 would count as a returning beneficiary.


                Part III: Plan Choices and Switching: The Facts
       We begin our analysis by presenting the basic facts on plan choice in
Figure 1. For each individual in the data, we estimate the total cost of enrolling in
each PDP plan in their county, adding both premiums and expected out of pocket
costs. We then estimate the difference in total costs between the plan chosen by
that individual and the lowest cost plan in their county, which we call “foregone




                                          13
savings”. This corresponds to KLMR’s concept of “overspending”. Figure 1
conducts this exercise using the perfect foresight model of expectations, while
Figure 2 reports the results with our rational expectations model.
       As Figure 1 shows, fewer than 15% percent of individuals choose the
lowest realized cost plan in their choice set in 2006. On average, individuals
could save 26-33 percent of their total Part D spending by choosing the lowest
cost plan rather than the plan they chose. We find that half of beneficiaries could
have saved more than $330 by enrolling in a different plan. These findings are
very similar to those in AG, although they appear smaller than for KLMR for
2006, where mean foregone savings is $550. Figure 2 replicates Figure 1 using
our “ex ante” predicted cost measure. Potential savings are smaller according to
this measure (as one would expect, since this measure mechanically reduces the
variation in out of pocket cost across plans) but nonetheless remain substantial
with more than half having foregone savings of $230 or more.
       The first major difference between our findings and those of KLMR is in
the degree of inertia. In KLMR’s sample, 54% of returning beneficiaries switch
plans in each year. We find that fewer than 10% of returning consumers switch
plans in each year, and the rate of switching remains remarkably stable, between
9.61% and 9.69% in all years. This suggests that KLMR’s sample – focusing on a
limited subset of plans – is not representative of the larger Part D population.
       Unlike KLMR, the CMS data show that the share of individuals making
cost minimizing choices does not improve over time. We further find that an
ever-falling share of individuals choose the cost minimizing plan. On net, we find
that 11 percent of individuals in 2006, 8 percent in 2007, 9 percent in 2008 and
just 2 percent in 2009 chose the low-cost plan according to our predicted costs
measure.
       One reason consumers might not choose the cost minimizing plan is
because they are willing to pay more for plans with better risk protection. To deal




                                         14
with this issue, we use an “efficient frontier” measure: we ask what cost savings
are possible if consumers are restricted to choosing a plan with weakly better risk
protection, as measured by a weakly lower variance of costs. If a plan lies on the
efficient frontier, it implies that no alternative plan is both lower in expected costs
and better in terms of the risk protection it provides. While plans are required to
be actuarially equivalent to the standard plan, for any given individual, a plan
might lie off the efficient frontier because it offers financial characteristics which
are not valuable to that individual. For healthy individuals, a plan with poor
coverage in the initial coverage range and high premiums due to donut hole
coverage may be dominated in an efficient frontier sense by a plan with lower
premiums, no donut hole coverage, but more generous coverage prior to the donut
hole. This point is depicted graphically in Figure 3 where we show the average
mean and standard deviation of costs for each plan in the CA choice set. Because
we are averaging across all consumers, this does not literally show the efficient
frontier for any given beneficiary. Nonetheless, one can see that the majority of
plans lie off the frontier demarcated by the lower-left envelope of the scatter plot.
       The results from this efficient frontier measure are summarized in Table 1.
We report these results using our predicted cost measure because the variance of
costs as a measure of risk only makes sense in that model (in the perfect foresight
model, there is no uncertainty and thus no risk). Because we are restricting the set
of plans to which one can move to save money, efficient frontier savings are
smaller but most beneficiaries could still have saved several hundred dollars in all
years without sacrificing risk protection.
       Table 1 also reports foregone savings and the efficient frontier measure as
a percentage of total costs. The change in this measure overtime is confounded
by the fact that better choices reduce both the numerator (foregone savings) and
denominator (realized costs). Nonetheless, the magnitude gives a sense of the
stakes involved, between 10 percent and 21 percent of total costs for the efficient




                                          15
frontier measure and between 25 and 33 percent for the perfect foresight measure.
It is therefore clear that choices did not materially improve over the first three
years of the Part D program, and clearly worsened substantially in 2008 and 2009.
        We also investigate whether the apparent foregone savings arise because
individuals are failing to find a single best plan by comparing choices to the cost
of the second least cost plan. We find that in 2006, the foregone savings from the
single best plan are almost twice as large as the foregone savings from the 2nd best
plan. In subsequent years, savings from the 2nd best plan are 70-85% as large as
the best plan. These results suggest that there are substantial returns to choosing
the best available plan, but also that the results are not driven by a particular low
cost plan.11 Measured relative to the 2nd best plan, foregone savings is
monotonically increasing over time and nearly doubling from 2006 to 2009. The
drop in foregone savings relative to the best plan is due to a single very low cost
plan which was available in 2006 but exited the market in 2007.
        These reduced form facts are compelling – but limited. In particular, we
have no way of accounting for strong brand preferences. What appear to be
choices off the “efficient frontier” could just be preferences for other aspects of
brands that are incorporated into premiums or out of pocket costs. This
motivates our move toward structural estimation in the next section.


                   Part IV: Modeling Plan Choice and Switching
Restrictions on Preferences
        To move from foregone savings to a more comprehensive welfare metric,
we consider a structural model of plan choice. We begin by specifying a CARA
utility model with a normally distributed cost distribution:
11
  Another important issue is whether there is demographic heterogeneity in foregone savings.
The small amount of demographic information available in Medicare claims limits our analysis
here. We have examined heterogeneity by age, and we find that foregone savings are fairly
similar in percentage terms by age.




                                              16
         U(C) = − exp(−γ(W − C)) where C~N(μ, σ2 )                                  (1)
We show in our earlier paper that this specification leads to a conditional logit
model of plan choice where the utility of individual i from choosing plan j in year
t is given by:
                            ∗           2
         𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝜋𝑗𝑡 𝛽0𝑖𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛽1𝑖𝑡 + 𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛽2𝑖𝑡 + 𝒙𝒋𝒕 𝜸𝒊𝒕 + 𝝃𝒃(𝒋)𝒕
                                                                                    (2)
                         + 𝜉𝑖𝑗=𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡−1) (𝑥𝑖 ) + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡

In this equation, 𝜋𝑗𝑡 gives the annual premium of plan j, 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡
                                                           ∗
                                                               gives expected out of
pocket costs, 𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑡
               2
                   gives the variance of costs, 𝒙𝒋𝒕 represents any financial plan
characteristics which impact choice, 𝝃𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 represents brand fixed effects,
𝜉𝑖𝑗=𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡−1) is a dummy variable which is 1 if and only if plan 𝑗 was chosen by

consumer 𝑖 during the previous year, and ϵijt are i.i.d. type I extreme value
random variables. We allow the inertia dummy to depend on plan characteristics
𝑥𝑖 in two ways: first, the dummy is interacted with the change in characteristics of
the previously chosen plan and second, the dummy is interacted with the change
in characteristics of the minimum cost plan.
        The financial plan characteristics include the deductible of the plan; a
dummy for whether the plan covers all donut hole expenditures; a dummy for
whether the plan covers generic expenditures in the donut hole only; and a cost-
sharing index. The cost sharing index is calculated for each plan as the average
percentage of expenditures covered by the plan between the deductible and the
donut hole. This variable differs from expected out of pocket costs in that it has
the same value for everyone in the sample for each plan, and because it is not
directly impacted by whether plans have deductibles or donut hole coverage. To
control for other aspects of plan quality, we include a full set of brand dummies.
This will capture the many features of plans that are common within brand, such
as consumer support and pharmacy access.




                                           17
       Identification is a natural concern in this context. All of the plan
characteristics included in our model may be endogenous due to unobserved
demand factors, and they may be biased by correlation with unobserved plan
characteristics. To address this concern, we observe and include in our model
much of the publicly available information that might be used by individuals to
make their choices – premiums, deductible information, donut hole coverage
dummies, as well as variables capturing formulary completeness and cost sharing.
We also control for a full set of brand dummies, so that we are only comparing
choices of plans with different cost-sharing structure within a given insurer.
       Including brand dummies also raises a normative question regarding
whether these reflect additional value that consumers receive from plans. One
way of interpreting these coefficients is to assume that the brand dummies
represent heuristic shortcuts taken by boundedly rational individuals who cannot
properly evaluate financial comparisons across plans. In this case, given that we
(the econometrician) can directly evaluate the financial consequences, brand
dummies should not count in the normative welfare function. Alternatively, one
might interpret the brand dummies as capturing some omitted feature of brands
which consumers do value, such as familiarity with the logistics of plans from an
earlier experience with a given brand. In this case, brand dummies should count
normatively in our appraisal of plans. We consider both possibilities in our
analysis below. In our baseline model, we do not count brand dummies in the
normative welfare function but we do include a quality rating (which summarizes
features such as customer service) whose normative weight is recovered by an
OLS regression of the brand dummies on the quality variable (that is, we assume
that 𝝃𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 = 𝒒𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 𝜹 + 𝒗𝒋𝒕 where only the 𝒒𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 𝜹 term counts in the normative
welfare function). In an alternative model, we do count brand dummies as part of
normative welfare.




                                         18
        A similar normative question arises regarding the inclusion of the inertia
term in our normative welfare function. Our measured inertia term may reflect
several different underlying phenomena. Actively choosing a plan may be costly,
leading individuals to prefer (all else equal) to just remain in the same plan.
Alternatively, our inertia term could represent an adjustment cost that is incurred
by consumers if they switch plans in order to learn how the new plan functions.
In the adjustment cost story, everything else held equal, consumers may be made
worse off if they are forced to enroll in a new plan. In the setting of prescription
drug insurance we believe that adjustment costs are small (unlike the setting of
health insurance where they might include needing to switch doctors) and so we
omit the inertia term from welfare. Once again we consider an alternative
treatment of the inertia term in the welfare analysis below.
        The model laid out above suggests three natural restrictions on preferences
which extend the efficient frontier concept to the discrete choice setting.
Restriction 1:
        This restriction states that the coefficient on premiums should equal the
coefficient on expected out of pocket costs. Controlling for the risk
characteristics of plans, individuals should be willing to pay exactly one dollar in
additional premiums for coverage which reduces expected out of pocket costs by
one dollar. If this restriction fails to hold, individuals may choose off the efficient
frontier: they could switch to alternative plans with comparable risk
characteristics but lower total costs.12
Restriction 2:

12
  Of course, this condition will not hold if expected out of pocket costs suffer from measurement
error and premiums do not. We consider this concern in detail in Appendix B. In Abaluck and
Gruber (2009), we used our perfect foresight measure of expected out of pocket spending,
instrumented by our rational expectations measure, which is a function only of the category of
previous year spending (tantamount to instrumenting by previous year spending category times
plan dummy). In this paper we simply estimate the reduced form of that equation, which gives
very similar results to the IV due to a first stage coefficient of roughly 1.




                                               19
        This restriction states that financial plan characteristics other than
premiums, expected out of pocket costs and the variance of out of pocket costs do
not impact choices. Individuals should not care about deductibles, donut hole
coverage or copays per se; they should only care about these factors to the extent
that they impact the distribution of out of pocket costs. Once we control for this
distribution, these factors should be redundant.
Restriction 3:
        This restriction states that individuals should be risk averse.
        In this paper, we remain agnostic about the reasons we might observe
violations of these restrictions. Consumers might underweight out of pocket costs
relative to premiums because they construct a mistaken forecast of what their
claims will be in the coming year, because they fail to adequately price these
claims given each plan’s formularies and cost-sharing features, or because they
simply do not consider anything beyond the nominal characteristics of alternative
plans (such as whether a plan has donut hole coverage). In any of these cases, it
may be that consumers are simply erring (for example, not understanding what a
deductible is) or it may be that they are behaving rationally given high search
costs. All of these cases imply that consumers could be made better off were they
enrolled in different plans, and this is the normative judgment we seek to make.
There is a legitimate concern that some of these stories might imply structural
specifications different from the one we estimate. In Abaluck and Gruber (2009)
we consider a model in which out of pocket costs receive less weight than
premiums because there is a component of out of pocket costs which is
observable to the econometrician but not observable to consumers. This leads to a
model quite close to the one we estimate here, but with some additional random
coefficients; in that paper, we find that omitting those random coefficients has
little impact on our results.




                                          20
        Appendix D of AG shows how to evaluate welfare in conditional logit
models when positive and normative utility functions fail to coincide. Unlike the
money metric of foregone savings, the welfare metric we compute takes into
account risk aversion and plan quality. That is, for each plan, we compute:
                   1
         𝑊𝑖𝑗𝑡 =                ∗
                      (𝛽 (𝜋 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡      2
                                   ) + 𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛽2𝑖𝑡 + 𝒒𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 𝜹𝒊𝒕 )                      (3)
                  𝛽0𝑖𝑡 0𝑖𝑡 𝑗𝑡
This is the welfare measure taking into account total costs, risk protection, and
plan quality variables and scaling by the marginal utility of income so that it is
expressed in a money-metric. This metric omits from welfare other plan financial
characteristics, non-financial brand characteristics, the inertia dummy and the
error term. This is the appropriate metric if one believes that the financial
characteristics of plans and the plan quality rating capture everything of
importance about plans and that – if they matter at all – other factors matter only
heuristically because consumers are unable to calculate, or unwilling to spend the
time to calculate, the welfare metric above. As noted above, omitting the inertia
term from our welfare evaluation is consistent with a story in which the true
adjustment costs of switching plans are small. We also consider below models in
which brand characteristics matter for welfare.
        Let 𝑊𝑖𝑡∗ = max𝑗 𝑊𝑖𝑗𝑡 , welfare for the best plan. We define foregone
welfare for individual i at time t in plan j as:
         FWit = Δ𝑊𝑖𝑡 = 𝑊𝑖𝑗𝑡 − 𝑊𝑖𝑡∗                                                   (4)
This is the welfare analogue of our foregone savings measure.
Modeling the Dynamics of Foregone Welfare
        Conceptually, changes in foregone welfare can be driven by demand side
factors (i.e. changes in how people choose), supply side factors (i.e. changes in
the choice set), changes in the underlying claims (which determine the welfare
consequences of choosing a given plan) or changes in the normative parameters
(i.e. how consumers value risk protection and plan quality ratings).




                                           21
       We can further decompose the demand side factors into three effects,
which we label inertia, individual learning, and cohort learning. Inertia is the
tendency of consumers to remain in the same plan regardless of changes in the
plan choice environment. Learning is the tendency for consumer choices to
change as they gain experience in the market, individually or collectively.
Individual learning concerns whether individuals with experience in the market
choose differently conditional on choosing a new plan than individuals with less
experience, while cohort learning reflects “calendar year” effects – given a fixed
choice set, do we see differences in the choice function of each cohort of
individuals over time? (controlling for their individual experience in the market –
so we are comparing across years beneficiaries with a given amount of
experience).We allow nearly all the structural parameters in our model to vary
both by year (cohort learning) and with experience (individual learning) – thus,
our model is capable of capturing a large range of ways in which choice functions
might change as consumers learn. We seek to understand specifically whether
these changes lead consumers to make better choices, so we summarize the
impact of each type of learning by evaluating how the estimated changes in
structural parameters with experience impact foregone welfare given a fixed
choice set.
       It is important to note that given our definition, individuals could save
money by switching plans in every year but this is not necessarily evidence of
learning; that is, learning is not just the complement of inertia. If, for example, all
consumers switched whenever foregone welfare exceeded $400 and chose plans
with foregone welfare of $300 conditional on switching, this would suggest that
they saved money by switching and it would suggest that inertia is making
consumers worse off (assuming that inertial consumers would choose as well as
switchers were they to switch). It would not suggest that consumers who
switched plans were learning – because in every year their behavior is the same –




                                          22
they switch plans and choose plans averaging $300 in foregone welfare if their
current plan becomes sufficiently unsuitable. It would be evidence of learning if
either a) Consumers with more experience in the market systematically chose
better plans so switchers did better than new enrollees (individual learning), or b)
Controlling for choice set differences, consumers in 2007 chose systematically
better than consumers in 2006 (cohort learning).
       Even if there is no change in consumers’ ability to choose over time from
a given choice set, supply side factors may lead to changes in foregone welfare if
the choice set becomes more “dangerous”; for example, suppliers may learn to
better conceal costs and otherwise take advantage of consumers’ biases. We can
decompose the supply-side factors into those driven by choice set changes and
those driven by plan characteristics. Choice set changes include changes in which
plans are available in different years, which we separate into the impact of plans
exiting and entering. We further decompose changes in plan characteristics into
changes in plan premiums and changes in plan characteristics which impact out of
pocket costs.
       Formally, we can define each of these effects in terms of changes in the
parameters of our structural model (equation 1). Above, we allowed the structural
coefficients 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿and 𝜉to vary flexibly from year-to-year for each individual.
                                                                       𝜷      𝜷
We will now place additional structure on this variation. Let 𝜷𝒊𝒕 = 𝜶𝟏𝒕 + 𝜶𝟐 𝐸𝑖𝑡 ,
        𝜸       𝜸
𝜸𝒊𝒕 = 𝜶𝟏𝒕 + 𝜶𝟐 𝐸𝑖𝑡 and 𝜹𝒊𝒕 = 𝜶𝜹𝟏𝒕 + 𝜶𝜹𝟐 𝐸𝑖𝑡 where 𝐸𝑖𝑡 denotes individual 𝑖’s years
of experience in the market in calendar year 𝑡. Cohort learning can then be
identified with changes in the 𝜶𝟏 coefficients or brand fixed effects, individual
learning with changes in the 𝜶𝟐 coefficients, and inertia with the inertial dummy
𝜉. Supply-side changes can be straightforwardly equated with changes in 𝜋𝑗𝑡 ,




                                         23

            , and 𝒙𝒋𝒕 and 𝒒𝒃(𝒋)𝒕 over time.13 Out of pocket costs in a given year are a
function both of an individual’s claims and of the characteristics of the plan in
which they are enrolled. To separately identify the impact of changes in plan
characteristics holding fixed an individual’s claims data, we use our calculator to
simulate how out of pocket costs would have changed if the characteristics of
plans changed from year t to year t+1 but the underlying claims remained fixed at
their year t level. The changes in welfare we attribute to the supply side all hold
fixed these underlying claims.
         We will consider decomposing the change in welfare over time for the
panel sample so that all individuals are present in all years; this is not
substantively important but it simplifies the exposition. Individuals not in this
sample – such as beneficiaries who appear for the first time in 2007 – will
nonetheless be of use in identifying the structural parameters as we describe
below.
         Formally, letΔnm Wsd denote foregone welfare for individual i, evaluated
from the standpoint of the normative preference parameters estimated in year n
using that individual’s claims in year m. The subscript gives the year from which
supply side characteristics are taken, including the plans in the choice set and the
premium and cost-sharing features of those plans. The superscript gives the year
in which demand-side factors are evaluated (i.e. which structural parameters of
the choice function are used); these include cohort effects, experience terms and
the inertial tendency.14 The change in foregone welfare from year t to year t+1 is
given by:

   Note that conditional on the inclusion of brand-fixed effects, changes in the quality variable
impact the normative utility function but not the positive utility function in our baseline
specification.
14
   Note that 𝐼(𝑖, 𝑡) differs from 𝐼(𝑖, 𝑡 − 1) in two ways: first, the plan to which inertia applies may
differ if the beneficiary switched plans (in 2007 inertia would apply to the plan chosen in 2006
while in 2008 inertia would apply to the plan chosen in 2007). Second, the weight attached to

We can decompose this into supply side, demand side, underlying changes in
claims and normative terms.

         ΔFWit = Sit + 𝐷𝑖𝑡 + 𝐶𝑖𝑡 + 𝑁𝑖𝑡
We further decompose the demand side effect into the welfare impacts of cohort
learning, inertia and individual learning. We decompose supply-side welfare
effects into the change in welfare induced by changes in premiums, changes in out
of pocket costs and plan characteristics for a fixed set of claims, and changes in
the choice set itself. The “claims” change in welfare describes how welfare
changes due to changes in the underlying claims observed. This term is not
completely independent of supply side effects – it may for example be driven by
utilization responses to changes in plan characteristics. Nonetheless, we find it
useful to separate out the changes in welfare due to changes in plan characteristics
which impact premiums and out of pocket costs for a fixed set of claims and
changes in the observed claims. The normative change in welfare - Nit – asks
how welfare changes due to the fact that preferences may change overtime (e.g.
individuals may become more risk averse or the revealed preference value placed
on plan quality may change).
        In order to estimate each of the above effects, we need to identify the
associated coefficients in the structural model. We now discuss the intuition for
the identification of each of these effects.


that plan may differ if the tendency to choose the same plan as in the previous year changes
from year to year.




                                               25
       Consider first “individual learning” effects, 𝜶𝟐 . Individual learning is
identified by comparing the choices of returning consumers conditional on
choosing a new plan with the choices of new consumers in a given year. A
confounding factor is that returning consumers who choose a new plan may be a
selected sample of the broader pool of returning consumers – in other words,
those consumers who choose to switch might do so in part because they are better
at choosing plans. To control for this, we also attempt to identify individual
learning by comparing the choices of new beneficiaries and “forced switchers”,
consumers whose choice in the prior year is no longer available meaning they had
no choice but to choose a new plan. This solution is not perfect, however, as
“forced switchers” are not randomly chosen: consumers who choose plans in year
t-1 which are no longer available in year t tend to perform worse than average in
year t-1. The comparison between new beneficiaries and active switchers should
provide an upper bound on the change in foregone welfare from learning (because
active switchers are better than average choosers) and the comparison between
new beneficiaries and forced switchers should provide a lower bound on this
learning effect (because forced switchers are worse than average choosers).
       Consider next inertia, the 𝜉𝑖𝑗=𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡−1) dummies. These are identified by
asking how much more likely beneficiaries are to choose the plan they were
enrolled in last year than we would expect given the characteristics of that plan.
The welfare impact of inertia is identified by comparing the choices of switchers
and non-switchers; it depends on whether non-switchers would have been better
off had they actively chosen a plan. This is not necessarily the case even if they
are not already enrolled in the best plan: the choice set might become “more
dangerous” and active choices might lead them to choose even more poorly than
if they just remained in the same plan. We can assess whether they would be

made better off by switching by assuming that had they switched, they would
have chosen as well as switchers (either active or forced).
         Consider finally the “cohort learning” effects, 𝜶𝟏 . Cohort learning is the
impact of market experience on choice functions controlling for any direct
individual experience with the market. Some channels for this type of learning
might be a greater abundance of tools which help consumers choose better or
increasing knowledge on the part of healthcare providers such as pharmacists and
doctors who consumers turn to for advice. These effects can be identified by
comparing beneficiaries in different years with the same amount of experience:
for example, new beneficiaries in 2006 and 2007 or beneficiaries with a single
year of experience in 2007 and 2008. In the estimates we report here, the model
uses both sources of variation to identify cohort learning.15
         Identification of the supply side factors is straightforward. Given the
estimated structural parameters, we can use the model to simulate how choices
(and ultimately welfare) differ when premiums, out of pocket costs or the
available plans change.16 Intuitively, one can think of the supply-side estimates as
analogous to the usual “area under the demand curve” welfare measures. If
premiums of Plan A increase by $100, welfare does not fall by $100 because
consumers can substitute towards alternative plans: the amount by which welfare
falls depends on the degree of substitution via the price elasticity.


                                 Part V: Structural Results
         We begin by reporting the estimated coefficients in the structural model.
Table 2 reports our baseline specification as described above. The first column
shows our results for 2006, the year studied in AG. The coefficients are the

   Any estimated cohort learning effects could also potentially incorporate differential advertising
to new versus existing Part D enrollees.

   As noted above, this involves using our plan calculator tool to compute how out of pocket
costs would change counterfactually were the underlying claims held fixed.




                                                27
structural coefficients in a conditional logit model and not marginal effects. They
can be roughly interpreted as the impact of a one unit increase in the variable of
interest on the probability that a plan is chosen; a premium coefficient of -0.68
implies that a $100 increase in premiums decreases the probability that a plan is
chosen by 68 percent (this interpretation holds exactly for plans which are a
negligible share of the overall market).
       We find that even with this improved data, the choice inconsistencies
described above and documented in AG persist. First, there is a sizeable gap
between the estimated premium and out of pocket cost coefficients, with the
former often 2-3 times as large as the latter. That is, consumers are substantially
overweighting premiums relative to out of pocket cost exposure in choosing their
insurance plans.
       We also find that there are significant coefficients on several plan
characteristics: the deductible, donut hole coverage variables and formulary
variables all matter even after controlling for out of pocket cost variables. The
magnitude of these coefficients is substantial: we observe that, controlling for out
of pocket cost consequences, individuals are willing to pay $350 to obtain donut
hole coverage in 2006 and substantially more in 2007 (the ratio of the donut hole
coefficient to the premium coefficient).
       The coefficient on the variance is insignificant in most specifications, and
even where significant it is close to zero in magnitude: foregone welfare changes
by less than $6 relative to a world where the variance coefficient is identically
zero. As we saw in our efficient frontier analysis, we cannot rationalize
consumers’ foregone savings as arising because consumers prefer plans with
superior risk protection.
       While these restrictions follow naturally from utility maximization with
full information and standard preferences, the model from which they are derived
makes several important functional form assumptions. Even in models which




                                           28
considerably loosened these assumptions, however, we would still not expect to
see these rejections of consistency. Appendix Table 5 carries out simulations
where we assume that consumers maximize expected utility given CARA or
CRRA utility, the empirically estimated distribution of costs, and different levels
of risk aversion. We then take the simulated choices and estimate our conditional
logit model as if the simulated choices were the true choices observed in the data.
In these simulations, we sometimes see significant coefficients on plan
characteristics, but they are several orders of magnitude smaller. This suggests
that the significant coefficients we find in the data are not due to the linearization
or normality assumptions we make in our theoretical model, but rather due to the
fact that consumers attach special weight to these characteristics beyond their
personalized out of pocket cost consequences.
       Importantly, our findings do not imply that consumers err primarily by
choosing plans with low premiums but poor coverage. When we omit plan
characteristics entirely from our model (Table 3), we find that the resulting
coefficients on out of pocket costs are substantially larger than the coefficients on
premiums. This suggests that if anything, beneficiaries may be choosing plans
whose coverage is too generous (in other words, they are paying higher premiums
to choose plans which provide more generous coverage on average, but not for
their particular mix of drugs). Taken together, the results with and without plan
characteristics imply that enrollees are making two sets of “mistakes”:
overweighting plan characteristics that do not apply to them, while
underweighting relative to premiums more subtle coverage characteristics that do
reduce the cost of the particular drugs they consume.
       Of course, this means that our finding of choice inconsistency in this
respect is generated by the joint finding of a premium-OOP gap in tandem with
the fact that plan characteristics enter the model conditional on OOP costs. This
raises the question of whether our model with plan characteristics included is




                                          29
really separately identified from the simpler model that excludes these
(theoretically irrelevant) broader plan characteristics. Indeed, we do find that the
two models make very different predictions. In Appendix B, we show that 12% of
choices are predicted to change if we drop plan characteristics from our model
and the average change in the probability that a plan is chosen is 20%.
       The remaining columns of Table 2 show that the stylized facts from the
2006 results persist in 2007, 2008 and 2009. We observe that the premium and out
of pocket cost coefficients move closer together. The specifications include a
flexible set of interactions between the inertia dummy and plan characteristics
both in the present year and in the previous year. These interactions allow the
decision of whether to switch to depend flexibly both on the current year choice
set and specifically on changes to the plan in which the consumer was previously
enrolled. With these interactions included, the reported coefficients are identified
only by the choices of switchers conditional on switching. The fact that the
premium-OOP coefficient gap narrows in later years relative to 2006 reflects the
fact that these coefficients are identified only by the 10 percent of individuals who
switched plans.
       Despite the fact that we are focusing on switchers, however, the premium
and out of pocket cost coefficients remain significantly different. Moreover, the
other choice inconsistencies persist: other plan characteristics are highly
significant and the variance term is insignificant or small in magnitude. The
inertia term is extremely large in magnitude, reflecting the fact that the vast
majority of consumers remain in the same plan they chose in the previous year.
The inertia term can be interpreted to mean that consumers are 500-700% more
likely to choose a plan if it is the plan they chose last year; comparing the inertia
term to the premium coefficient, we find that consumers are willing to give up
more than $600 worth of premiums to remain in the same plan.




                                          30
        Table 4 considers the results when we condition on forced switchers. In
this case we obtain slightly higher coefficients on out of pocket costs but the
sizeable gap between the premium and out of pocket cost coefficients remains, as
does the significance of the coefficients on other plan characteristics (note that
forced switchers only exist from 2007 onward because they are defined as Part D
enrollees whose choice in the previous year was discontinued). The similarities
between the choices of switchers and forced switchers suggest that it is not
unreasonable to use the observed choices of switchers to model how inertial
consumers would choose were they forced to switch.
Heterogeneous Preferences
An additional implication of our model is that beneficiaries sacrifice a great deal
of money to choose particular brand names. The range of brand fixed effects
(expressed in dollars of premiums) is more than $1,100. The panel nature of our
data allows us to investigate in some detail the structure of these preferences – are
they persistent over time or are they idiosyncratic, and are they correlated across
similar types of plans? Additionally, by allowing for persistent brand preferences,
we prevent these factors from loading onto our estimated inertial term.
        To address these issues, we estimate an extension of our baseline model in
which brand fixed effects are heterogeneous and normally distributed and can be
decomposed into brand and time components: ξi,b,t = ξ𝐵ib + ξTit where we allow for
arbitrary correlations between ξ𝐵ib and ξ𝐵ib′ and between ξ𝑇it and ξ𝑇it′ . Estimation of
this model is described in more detail in Appendix C. Because it is much more
computationally demanding than our baseline model, we use a 2.5% random
sample and restrict to beneficiaries who chose amongst the 11 most popular
brands; this yields 9,127 beneficiaries. In addition to our usual plan-level inertial
terms, we add inertial terms at the brand level to aid in separate identification of
brand preferences. In the appendix we show the results of estimating our baseline




                                           31
model on this more restricted sample; the results are very similar to the full
sample.
       Table 5 shows the results from estimating this richer model that
incorporates heterogeneity. The stylized facts regarding choice inconsistencies
reported in the previous section continue to hold (in this case, the inertial
coefficients from our original model can be compared to the sum of the plan and
brand coefficients in the more flexible specification). Firstly, we note that –
comparing the inertial coefficients in Table 5 with Appendix Table 6 - the inertial
coefficients are hardly impacted; this suggests that rather than reflecting persistent
unobserved factors of chosen plans, they reflect either adjustment costs or
inattention.
       Table 6A reports the estimation correlation matrix for the time and brand
components of the estimated random effects. In each case, the random effects are
identified relative to an omitted brand (the most popular brand) and an omitted
time (2006). The time random effects show little evidence of either heterogeneity
(the diagonal terms) or persistence (the off-diagonal terms). In other words, any
changes across time in brand preferences are well-captured by shifts in means.
This does not conclusively tell us whether these brand preferences should count
normatively – uncorrelated brand fixed effects could represent some changing
aspect of customer service not captured by our quality rating, or they could
represent changes in advertising that increase demand in some years but not
others. Nonetheless, the lack of correlation across beneficiaries over time does
weigh against the possibility that brands which look bad on observable
dimensions have some persistent compensating factor.
       The across brand random effects show more evidence of both
heterogeneity and correlation. The standard deviation of the brand random effects
ranges from $125 to $181 (this is the square root of the non-normalized
covariance coefficient divided by the premium coefficient); this suggests that




                                          32
beneficiaries vary in the weight they attribute to different plans, but the range of
the variation is substantially less than the $1,100 difference in average valuation
between the most and least desirable plan. We also find some evidence of
correlation amongst brand preferences; while only a few of the off-diagonal terms
are significant, all are positive, implying that beneficiaries are correlated in their
preference for the most popular plan (which is normalized to 0).
        To investigate this correlation further, we estimate a version of the model
which classifies all brands into terciles based on overall popularity across all years
(table 6B). This model suggests both that preferences for popular plans are
correlated (so beneficiaries who prefer brands in the most popular tercile are also
more likely to prefer the 2nd tercile to the least popular brands) and that
preferences for popular brands are persistent, at least in 2008 and 2009. Thus,
while there is little tendency for beneficiaries who idiosyncratically preferred a
given brand to prefer that same brand in later years, we do find that beneficiaries
who idiosyncratically preferred popular brands have a consistent preference for
popular brands over time.
Welfare Implications
        We next use our structural model to move from the results for foregone
savings presented above to a welfare metric which includes not only expected
spending but also risk protection and plan quality based on the revealed
preference weights estimated by the model.
        Table 7 shows the results of this welfare analysis in our baseline model.
For comparison purposes, the first two rows replicate in the panel sample our
earlier results using the predicted spending measure, with foregone savings falling
from 2006 to 2007 but then rising from 2007-2009, even relative to plans with
similar or lower variance (Table 1 reports the analogous results in the full
sample). The third row shows the welfare equivalent in our baseline model:
foregone welfare increases overtime, rising from about $161 in 2006 to $251 in




                                          33
2009. This occurs despite the fact that mean expenditures in our final sample are
lower in 2009 than in 2006 ($2150 in 2006 compared to $2100 in 2009). In
contrast to foregone savings, welfare is increasing monotonically over time
because the one “low cost” plan in 2006 is rated poorly according to the plan
quality measure. We see a similar pattern if we allow brand dummies to enter the
normative utility function; this metric again leads foregone welfare to fall from
2006-2007, but thereafter it increases dramatically. Thus, while we find as in
Ketcham et. al. (2012) that foregone savings fall from 2006 to 2007, our more
comprehensive welfare measure suggests that this arises mainly because some
consumers in 2007 enrolled in cheap, low quality plans; thus, depending on the
specification, foregone welfare is either the same or higher in 2007 than in 2006
and substantially higher in 2008 and 2009.
       The bottom two rows in Table 7 show the contribution of inertia to
foregone welfare from 2007 onwards. In all years and in all models, the
contribution of inertia is less than ¼ of foregone welfare. In 2007, those who
stayed behind in the same plan rather than switching lost only $12 compared
relative to had they switched and chosen as well as switchers. In 2008 and 2009
in the base model, the inertia estimates become more sizeable, but still remain
only a small fraction of the total foregone welfare. This is striking evidence that,
in general, switching never fully offset the choice inconsistencies among Part D
consumers. While switchers did tend to save substantial amounts relative to had
they not switched, our model suggests that this was due to the fact that their
existing plan was particularly unsuitable; comparable savings was not available to
inertial consumers if they had chosen as well as the switchers.
Alternative Normative Assumptions
       There are a number of alternative normative assumptions we consider to
understand better what is driving our welfare results. The results of these
exercises are also reported in Table 8. The 1st row of Table 8 replicates our above




                                         34
computation of foregone welfare in the restricted sample used to estimate the
model with heterogeneous brand effects and subsequent rows consider alternative
normative assumptions in that model. Foregone welfare tends to be slightly lower
in the restricted sample since there are fewer alternative plans from which to
choose the best plan.
       A natural intuition is that the fewer restrictions we impose on the
normative model – in other words, the more factors we allow to matter for welfare
– the more choices we will be able to rationalize and the better choices will look.
Our analysis suggests that this need not be the case - in a 2nd best world in which
there are multiple potential sources of mistakes, allowing additional factors to
matter in the normative utility function can worsen the welfare cost of the
remaining departures from full rationality.
       Firstly, to understand better the role played by omitted plan characteristics,
we compute foregone welfare in a model in which all observable characteristics
(including the deductible and donut hole) are assumed to matter for welfare; this
contrasts with our baseline model in which these characteristics only enter welfare
via the distribution of out of pocket costs. In this model, reported in row 2 of
Table 8, foregone welfare actually tends to be higher than in our baseline model
(row 1). This counterintuitive result arises because, while chosen plans tend to
have high values of desirable plan characteristics, the best among the many
unchosen plans tend to have even higher values of these characteristics.
       One critical driver of our results is the assumption that brand preferences
do not count normatively. The model with heterogeneous brand preferences
(reported in Tables 5 and 6) allows us to explore this assumption further. In
particular, we consider several alternative cases:

i)     Our baseline model – with fixed brand preferences – and in which brand
       preferences are not relevant for welfare (row 1 of Table 8)




                                         35
ii)     The case in which brand preferences are heterogeneous and normally
        distributed with the correlation structure specified in Table 6A above, but
        are not welfare relevant (row 3 of Table 8)
iii)    The case in which brand preferences have the same parametric structure as
        in ii) but are welfare relevant (row 4 of Table 8)
iv)     The case in which brand preferences are unrestricted and fully welfare
        relevant (row 5 of Table 8)

        In case iv), foregone welfare is mechanically much lower because the only
possible mistakes are choosing the wrong plan within the chosen brand (foregone
welfare falls from an average of $168 to $69). We nonetheless find comparable
welfare losses in cases i)-iii). Case iii) would mechanically approach case iv) as
the variance of the preference heterogeneity becomes arbitrarily large. The fact
that case iii) is much closer to case ii) than case iv) reflects the fact that the choice
inconsistencies we estimate are not well explained by (parametric) heterogeneous
brand preferences.
        We can think of this exercise as follows. We observe variation in choices
not explained by observables. This variation could reflect either heterogeneous
brand preferences or noise (the epsilon term). The non-parametric test in iv)
assumes that all of the across brand noise reflects heterogeneous brand
preferences. The parametric test attempts to separately identify brand preferences
from noise. The identifying assumption is that – so long as brand preferences are
additively separable – more heterogeneity in brand preferences will mean less
sensitivity to plan characteristics (such as premiums) in across brand choices than
within brand choices. If choices are fairly sensitive to premiums within brands
but not sensitive to premiums across brands, this would suggest that the across
brand choices are driven by preferences for particular brands; on the other hand, if




                                           36
choices are as sensitive to premiums across brand as within brand, this suggests
little heterogeneity.
        While we estimate statistically significant heterogeneity, this
heterogeneity explains only a small fraction of the residual variation in choices in
our model. Note that this is not merely a consequence of our parametric
assumption: as the variance of the random coefficients grows larger in the
parametric model, the results converge to the non-parametric model in which only
within brand errors are possible. Our results suggest, however, that there is only a
small amount of heterogeneity in brand preferences. Therefore, foregone welfare
in the 4th row of Table 8 is very close to the first row.
        Moreover, the fourth row of Table 8 shows that allowing brand preference
heterogeneity to count normatively increases foregone welfare. This is a
counterintuitive result: one might expect that allowing brand preferences to matter
for normative welfare would reduce foregone welfare because it would help to
rationalize the observed patterns of choices across brands. To gain some
intuition, it is helpful to imagine a world where there is a single “best” plan and
all consumers have a 10% chance of choosing the best plan and a 90% chance of
choosing randomly from amongst 40 or so other plans in their choice set. Adding
brand fixed effects makes the best plan look even better from a normative
standpoint (a disproportionate share choose it given the fact that people otherwise
choose randomly) but this increases foregone welfare since most people do not
choose the best plan. This contrasts with the world in which preferences are
highly heterogeneous, nearly all choices are driven by brand preferences, and thus
all across brand choices are welfare maximizing. Note that whether choices
reflect idiosyncratic noise or heterogeneous brand preferences, there is a separate
question as to whether these factors should enter the model normatively. Our
finding here is that, to the extent that the two can be distinguished, the former
factors explain a much larger share of choices.




                                          37
        A second important normative driver of our results is the assumption that
inertia is welfare irrelevant – that is, there are no true adjustment costs to
switching plans and no additional unobserved features of plans which make
chosen plans desirable. Fully relaxing this assumption would imply that only
switchers can err. Row 6 of Table 8 reports foregone welfare in this scenario; it is
less than 1/10th as large as all years after 2006 because it is now mechanically
zero for all non-switchers (note that this is distinct from the exercise above where
we simulated a world with no inertia but still allowed inertial consumers to have
welfare loss as they chose only as well as switchers). Once again, we cannot
settle the question of whether inertia represents inattention or true adjustment
costs given the data available, but this is an important question for future work
with large normative implications. Hogan, Ho and Scott-Morton (2015) present
some evidence for the inattention hypothesis in the Part D setting, arguing that
those who switch plans do so in response to shocks to their existing plan as
opposed to just the possibility of savings from switching. This supports the
normative assumption in our baseline specification.
Structural Decomposition
        In this section, we attempt to understand the factors driving changes in
welfare over time. To make the changes over time more transparent, we eliminate
the normative terms and the claims term in the decomposition above and evaluate
welfare in all years using 2006 claims as well as the risk preferences and quality
ratings estimated in 2006. This restriction has little impact on the results but it
makes more transparent the degree to which supply and demand side factors are
impacting welfare. Overall, we find that supply side factors predominate, and that
increasing premiums combined with consumer inertia and the exit of the most
generous plans over time lead foregone welfare to increase and had an even more
dramatic effect on absolute welfare once we control for changes in claims over
time.




                                          38
       The first panel in Table 9 shows the level of foregone welfare in the
previous year, and the second row shows the change due to supply and demand
factors holding fixed 2006 claims. The remainder of the table shows the
contribution of each supply and demand side factor to the overall change in
welfare.
       Our results suggest that demand-side measures were relatively
unimportant. Individual learning, inertia and cohort learning all led welfare to
change relatively little over time. The one exception is a small increase in
foregone welfare due to beneficiaries becoming more inertial in 2008 (while
roughly the same fraction of consumers switched, the potential savings from
switching – and thus the magnitude of the inertia term in our model – were larger
in 2008). But as highlighted above, the problem here is not simply inertia which
accounts for only a small fraction of foregone welfare; it is that even those who
switch do not remove choice inconsistencies when they do so.
       Table 9 also shows that supply side changes substantially increased
foregone welfare over time. We see the same pattern across all years. Foregone
welfare increases both due to changes in premiums and changes in plan
generosity. This was partly but not fully offset by reductions in foregone welfare
due to plan exit.
       We are unable to distinguish from Table 9 whether the effects are due to
changes in the chosen plan or changes in the best foregone plan. To address this,
in Table 10 we present the same supply side decomposition but for absolute, not
foregone, welfare. Absolute welfare is normalized to 0 for a plan with zero
premiums, zero out of pocket costs, mean risk aversion and mean quality rating;
dollar equivalent welfare is then computed for each plan relative to this
normalized plan. In this case more negative numbers mean a larger reduction in
welfare. While absolute welfare is roughly constant over time, this is because
claims are increasing; when we isolate supply and demand-side factors, we see




                                         39
that absolute welfare is falling over time – consumers are being made worse off
for a given set of claims. The demand side impacts are identical to those for
foregone welfare because changes in demand impact only the chosen plan, not the
best available plan. The supply side effects are different because supply side
changes impact both the chosen plan (which would impact both absolute and
foregone welfare) and the best available plan (which only impacts foregone
welfare).
       The absolute welfare results add some nuance to the foregone welfare
results. In all years, we can see that consumers are being made worse off by
premium increases as well as the exit of desirable plans from the market. They
are made better off by increases in plan generosity among existing plans – the fact
that plan generosity changes tended to increase foregone welfare suggests that
generosity increased even more for the best unchosen plan.
       Thus, we find that over time in the Part D program there was an exit of the
most generous plans, with a shift towards higher premiums and more generous
coverage among plans that remain in the program. More generous coverage
tended to increase foregone welfare because the best unchosen plans increased
their coverage even more, and the exit of generous plans tended to reduce
foregone welfare since unchosen plans were even more likely to exit. In 2006,
increases in coverage generosity failed to offset premium increases; in 2007 and
2008 they more than offset premium increases but this effect was outweighed by
the exit of desirable plans. Thus, taken together, these supply side changes
reduced absolute welfare and increased foregone welfare.
       Table 11 replicates the results in Table 9 with normative brand dummies.
The stylized facts noted on the demand side persist. Likewise, in both cases,
supply side changes are predominantly responsible for the increase in foregone
welfare over time.

                                   Part VI: Conclusion
       The bold experiment with consumer choice across health insurance plans
embodied in the Medicare Part D program provides an excellent opportunity to
assess how consumers perform in choosing insurance plans. We find that, using
the best available data, consumers are very inconsistent in their choices,
overweighting premiums relative to out of pocket costs, weighting plan
characteristics above and beyond the effect on that consumer, and ignoring
variance in coverage across plans. Moreover, we find that these choice
inconsistencies persist over time, and that the foregone welfare from choosing
inconsistently rises during the first four years of the Part D program.
       This increase in foregone welfare occurs primarily through supply side
changes. The set of plans available to consumers were changing over time in a
way which heightened the disadvantages of choosing poorly. And this was not
offset by factors on the demand side. Most consumers remain inertial, passively
allowing the changes in the supply side to impact them. Most strikingly, even
those consumers who are not inertial continue to choose inconsistently, so even
the limited amount of switching that takes place does not do much to offset the
welfare losses. Ultimately, we conclude that there was little learning at both the
individual and cohort levels over time within the Part D program.
       Of course, the choice inconsistencies we identify do not necessarily mean
that consumers are behaving in a sub-optimal way given the information and
computational tools available to them. It would be consistent with our results for
consumers to rationally be choosing not to exert the time and effort to choose the
very best plan available, but this still means that consumers could be made better
off were they enrolled in different plans. This suggests the value of continued
improvement in decision support tools available to enrollees in the Part D
program. A recent GAO report highlighted the value of continued CMS oversight




                                         41
of the Planfinder tool on Medicare.gov (on which our calculator is based) (U.S.
GAO, 2014).
       A shortcoming of our analysis is that we do not endogenize the supply
side: we document how the supply side changed over time but we do not examine
the factors driving these changes in equilibrium. If the model developed here
were supplemented by a model of competition between firms for behavioral
consumers, we could simulate how policy changes such as providing additional
information to consumers or new rules governing the types of benefits firms may
offer might impact the premium setting and entry and exit of firms and thereby
consumer welfare. Ericson (2011) shows that some of the changes in premiums
reported here could arise in a model with firms pricing to inertial consumers.
Analyzing the supply side is especially complicated due to the rules governing
assignment of low income subsidy enrollees to plans which seem to play an
important role in determining premiums (Decarolis 2012). A full model should
take into account these rules, as well as two additional supply-side effects:
informing consumers could exacerbate adverse selection (Handel, 2011) but more
information could intensify price competition by eliminating the artificial
differentiation which arises from consumer confusion.

    Notes: Table shows various measures of choice quality from 2006 through 2009,
    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total costs (computed as the sum of
    premiums paid and out of pocket costs) in the “Full Sample” described in the text
    (as opposed to the full panel). “Foregone Savings PF” gives our “perfect
    foresight” measure: realized total costs relative to the plan which minimizes
    realized total costs (ex post). “Foregone Savings Pred” compares predicted costs
    in the chosen plan to predicted costs in the cost minimizing plan, where predicted
    costs are computed as average costs among all individual in the same decile of
    costs in January of that year. “Efficient Frontier Pred” gives the same measure,
    but compares the chosen plan only with plans which have weakly lower variance
    (computed as the variance in simulated out of pocket costs for that plan among
    200 beneficiaries in the same decile of January expenditure). Percentages are
    percentages of total costs in the chosen plan. Savings from the bottom quartile
    are average savings from choosing a plan in the bottom quartile of total costs. The
    number of beneficiaries is lower in 2006 because we restrict to beneficiaries
    enrolled for the entire year and this restriction excludes a larger share of the
    sample in 2006 when open enrollment stretched from January to June.

Notes: Table shows conditional logit results from estimating equation (2) by
maximum likelihood. Standard errors are in parentheses. This Table differs from
Table 2 in that we report the coefficients on each variable interacted with whether
you were a forced switcher (meaning that the plan in which you were enrolled the
previous year is no longer available). In addition to the coefficients reported here,
all specifications include brand fixed effects, interactions between all the reported
coefficients and experience variables, and interactions between the inertia
coefficient and (demeaned) values of the plan characteristics for the minimum

Notes: Table shows coefficients results from estimating equation (2) by
simulated maximum likelihood given the correlational structure specified in
Appendix C. Standard errors are in parentheses. In addition to the coefficients
reported here, all specifications include brand random effects, separate
coefficients for active and forced switchers (only those for active switchers are
reported), interactions between all the reported coefficients and experience
variables, and interactions between the inertia coefficient and (demeaned) values
of the plan characteristics for the minimum cost plan, deciles of expenditure in the
previous year, and characteristics of the chosen plan in the previous year. In
2007-2009, separate inertia dummies are included for the plan one was enrolled in
during each preceding year as well as separately for the brand one was enrolled
in.

Notes: Panel 1 reports the estimated covariance matrix for the time random effects
and Panel 2 reports the estimated covariance matrix for brand random effects, as
specified in Appendix C. The time random effects are defined relative to 2006 –
the diagonal terms are the variance of the difference between time component of
the random effect in the specified year and the time component in 2006. The off-
diagonal terms are the correlation between these time components. The brand
random effects are defined relative to the omitted brand (which is chosen to be the
most popular brand). All coefficients are expressed in dollar terms by dividing
the estimated covariance parameters by the premium coefficient in 2006.

Notes: Table 6B is identical to 6A, but for the model where brand random effects
are replaced with random effects for terciles of brand popularity. Panel 1 reports
the estimated covariance matrix for the time component of these random effects
and Panel 2 reports the estimated covariance matrix for the brand component of
these random effects, as specified in Appendix C. The brand random effects are
defined relative to the omitted tercile (which is chosen to be the least popular
brands). All coefficients are expressed in dollar terms by dividing the estimated
covariance parameters by the premium coefficient in 2006.

Notes: First panel shows various measures of choice quality from 2006 through
2009. The first two rows replicate the corresponding rows of Table 1 in our “Full
Panel” (beneficiaries who appear in the data for a full year in all years from 2006-
2009) and all subsequent rows report results in the “Full Panel” sample.
“Welfare (baseline)” reports our welfare adjusted measure, computed as total
costs plus the dollar equivalent value of risk protection and quality ratings
estimated in our logit model with brand fixed effects as described in equation (3).
The second panel uses the model to simulate the impact of inertia on welfare
relative to a world with no inertia in which inertial consumers choose from among
all plans given the estimated structural coefficients identified primarily from the
choices of switchers. As noted in the text, the model is estimated on the “Full
Sample” but the results are reported in the “Full Panel”. The reported value is the
welfare loss in a world with inertia relative to a world with no inertia (so a
negative number implies a welfare gain from inertia).

Notes: Table shows various measures of choice quality from 2006 through 2009
in conditional logit and random coefficients models. The first row replicates row
3 of Table 7 in the restricted sample; this reports foregone welfare in our
conditional logit model, computed as total costs plus the dollar equivalent value
of risk protection and quality ratings. “Welfare (restricted, normative plan
characteristics)” uses an alternative metric in which financial plan characteristics
are included in the welfare computation. “Welfare (restricted, positive brand
random effects”) uses the same metric as the first row, but in the model with
brand random effects. “Welfare (restricted, normative brand random effects)”
allows these random effects to enter welfare (and computes welfare using
simulated choices). “Welfare (restricted, normative non-parametric brand random
effects” computes foregone welfare relative to the best plan in the same brand as
the chosen plan. “Welfare (restricted, no inertial errors” computes foregone
welfare using only the choices of switchers and averaging in zeros for all inertial
beneficiaries (assuming that all inertial choices are rational).

Panel” with 75,829 beneficiaries per year (the remaining Full Panel beneficiaries
after the model is estimated on a 10% sample of the Full Sample). The first row
is identical to the third row of Table 7 and reports foregone welfare from the
previous year. The next row reports the sum of the changes due to supply and
demand. The first row of the “Demand” and “Supply” panels gives the sum of the
changes due to each of their respective components. The “Inertia” term
represents the change in welfare due to the change in inertia between years which
differs from the exercise in Table 7 where we report the impact of inertia relative
to a world with no inertia.

Notes: Table reports the results of the welfare decomposition exercise described
in equations (3)-(6). Table 11 differs from Table 9 in that all welfare evaluations
use a normative model in which the dollar-equivalent of brand fixed effects is
included. As noted in the text, the model is estimated on the “Full Sample” but
the results are reported in the “Full Panel”. The first row reports foregone welfare
from the previous year. The next row reports the sum of the changes due to
supply and demand. The first row of the “Demand” and “Supply” panels gives
the sum of the changes due to each of their respective components. The “Inertia”
term represents the change in welfare due to the change in inertia between years
which differs from the exercise in Table 7 where we report the impact of inertia
relative to a world with no inertia.

Notes: CA Choice Set in 2006. Each point represents a single plan. Average total
costs are the average of perfect foresight total costs (premiums plus realized out
of pocket costs).


                                            Appendix A: Calculator Construction

                               Our calculator tool determines for a fixed set of claims what out of pocket
costs would have been for that set of claims for each of the plans in an
individual’s choice set. In Abaluck and Gruber (2009), we considered several
different versions of the calculator tool allowing varying degrees of substitution
across drugs if individuals choose different plans. We found that this made little
difference for our final results – here, we make the assumption that individuals
substitute towards the cheapest (lowest tiered) alternative within each
branded/generic class and Generic Code Number (GCN), a classification which
groups together all products with identical ingredients, strength, dosage and route
of administration.




                                                                58
       The first major task is to reconstruct the appropriate formularies for each
plan from the observed claims – the formulary should tell us, for each (plan,
branded/generic ID, GCN) the lowest tier in which a drug with that
branded/generic ID and GCN is available and whether or not the drug is included
in the plan formulary at all. This file is constructed empirically based on the
observed claims of enrollees in each plan. The CMS Part D Events file contains
drugs classified by NDC number; we use a crosswalk provided by First Data
Bank to determine the associated GCN for each of these drugs.
       CMS provides beneficiary cost files linked to encrypted plan IDs which
determine the copays or coinsurances associated with a given days supply of a
drug in a given tier for each coverage range. Given our formulary files, we can
determine the appropriate tier (including no tier) for each drug an individual
consumes and given the beneficiary cost files we can determine the appropriate
copays and coinsurances. We run each beneficiary’s claims through our
calculator in chronological order keeping track of cumulative expenditures to date
(and thus coverage range) in order to compute each beneficiary’s total out of
pocket costs. There are a large number of subtleties omitted in this explanation
(e.g. how we determine copays/coinsurances when days supply is not an exact
multiple of 30, how we order claims if they appear chronologically on the same
day among many others). The source code for our calculator which details all of
these assumptions is available upon request.

                Appendix B: Mismeasured Out of Pocket Costs

       An important concern with the restrictions imposed by our model is that
our out of pocket cost variable may be mismeasured. If this is the case, then what
our model attributes to beneficiaries overweighting salient plan features may




                                         59
actually reflect the true financial value of those characteristics not adequately
captured by our out of pocket cost variables.
       Consider three alternative types of measurement error:
       1) Measurement error due to calculator error
       2) Measurement error due to private information
       3) Measurement error due to moral hazard
In Part II, we note that our calculator is extremely accurate in replicating observed
out of pocket costs and that errors in our calculator do not appear to be correlated
with choice quality. This suggests that the first type of error should be small.
       Measurement error due to private information might arise if beneficiaries
have information about their future expenditures beyond what can be forecast
given our predicted cost model. We can test for this directly (and control for it)
by including in our model the difference between perfect foresight out of pocket
cost and predicted out of pocket costs and checking whether this term explains
choices after conditioning on out of pocket costs. Abaluck and Gruber (2009)
formally derive such a model. If we partial out the other covariates from realized
out of pocket costs, we can also interpret the model as instrumenting for realized
out of pocket costs using our predicted costs measure. The rationale is that
realized costs 𝐶𝑖𝑗 can be written as 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝜂𝑖𝑗 where 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is our
predicted costs measure, 𝑒𝑖𝑗 represents a component of costs observables to
beneficiaries at the time when they choose but not to the econometrician and 𝜂𝑖𝑗
represents a component of realized costs unknown even to beneficiaries at the
time when they choose. We assume that 𝜇𝑖𝑗 and 𝑒𝑖𝑗 are independent of 𝜂𝑖𝑗 . The
coefficient on realized costs in a choice model would be biased towards zero due
to the measurement error from 𝜂𝑖𝑗 , but this problem can be rectified by
instrumenting for 𝐶𝑖𝑗 with 𝜇𝑖𝑗 . This allows us to take into account the possibility
that beneficiaries have some private information and allow for it in our model.




                                         60
Any remaining weight attached to plan characteristics after conditioning on
predicted costs and the control function constructed by regressing realized costs
on predicted costs and covariates should not reflect private information.
Appendix Table 7 shows the estimated coefficients in our model when this
realized cost term is added. While we find evidence of private information,
including this term has little impact on the estimated plan characteristics.
       A third potential source of mismeasurement in our out of pocket cost
variable is moral hazard. We can consider the impact of moral hazard in a
stylized model. Suppose that total drug spending S is a linear function of the
coinsurance rate so that we can write 𝑆 = 𝑎 − 𝑏 ⋅ 𝐶𝐼 and out of pocket costs are a
linear function of total spending, 𝑂𝑂𝑃 = 𝑆 ⋅ 𝐶𝐼. Let 𝐶𝐼0 denote the coinsurance
rate in the plan in which the individual was actually enrolled and let 𝐶𝐼𝑗 denote
the coinsurance rate of an alternative plan 𝑗. Appendix A of Abaluck and Gruber
(2009) shows that with these assumptions, there is an omitted term in our choice
                1                  2
model equal to 𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑗 (𝐶𝐼𝑗 − 𝐶𝐼0 ) which captures the welfare gain from adjusting
                2

one’s consumption if one chooses a plan different from the one which was
actually chosen. A first point to note is that our assumption of no moral hazard
should bias downward our estimates of foregone welfare because we are ignoring
behavioral adjustments which make alternative plans more valuable. Second, we
find that the absolute magnitude of this omitted term given prescription drug
elasticities estimated in the literature is small – the additional value due to moral
hazard of adjusting ones claims after moving from a plan with 25% coinsurances
to 75% coinsurances is just $21 (AG 2009 gives explicit calculations). For these
reasons, we do not believe that moral hazard accounts for the choice
inconsistencies we estimate.
       A final concern with our model is whether it is empirically identified. For
example, does our model yield different predictions relative to a model in which




                                          61
plan characteristics are omitted but premiums and OOP costs are roughly equally
weighted? To see whether it does, we perform a simulation exercise. We
estimate our model with and without plan characteristics included. Assuming
identical i.i.d. error terms across the two simulations (so that none of the
differences are due to noise alone), we then simulate choices in the models with
and without plan characteristics included.
        The results of this exercise strongly suggest that plan characteristics are
identified based on empirical features of choices. In both models, the average
probability that a plan is chosen is .025; the average absolute change in the
probability a plan is chosen is .0049, or about a 20% difference. 7,719 of 64,231
choices are predicted to change in our simulation sample (itself a 10% sample of
the full sample used in the paper). In other words, our model suggests that 12%
of beneficiaries are predicted to choose different plans in the model fit to the data
with plan characteristics omitted (a number greater than the percentage who are
actually observed to switch plans in the data).
                      Appendix C: Random Coefficients Model
        The random coefficients model with heterogeneous brand preferences is
given by equation (2), but, as discussed in the text, we assume that the brand fixed
effects in equation (2) can be replaced by brand random effects. These are
heterogeneous and normally distributed and can be decomposed into brand and
time components: ξi,b,t = ξ𝐵ib + ξTit .where cov(ξBib , ξBib′ ) ≡ σBbb′ and cov(ξTit , ξTit′ ) ≡
σTtt′ are unrestricted but cov(ξBib , ξTit ) ≡ 0 for all b and t. Let B denote the number
of brands included in estimation (excluding the most popular brand which is
omitted) and T the number of time periods.
        Because the model is much more computationally demanding than our
baseline model, we use a 2.5% random sample and restrict to beneficiaries who
chose amongst the 11 most popular brands; this yields 9,127 beneficiaries. In




                                              62
addition to our usual plan-level inertial terms, we add inertial terms at the brand
level to aid in separate identification of brand preferences.
         We estimate this model by maximum simulated likelihood. To improve
the computational efficiency, we use scrambled Halton sequences (following
Train (2003). This approach also means that the likelihood function is
deterministic so that we can analytically compute the gradient to aid in estimation.
To impose appropriate normalizations, we construct Σ, the covariance matrix of
the vector of random effects given by: {ξ𝑇i2 - ξ𝑇i1 ,…, ξ𝑇iT - ξ𝑇i1 , ξBi1 + ξ𝑇i1 , … , ξ𝐵iB + ξ𝑇i1 }.
Note that we can write ξi,b,t in any year as a linear combination of elements of this
vector (the sum of the corresponding brand and time terms). Denote by Σ𝐵 the
covariance matrix of random effects in year 1 and Σ 𝑇 the matrix of time effects
relative to year 1. Σ𝐵 is the bottom-right B x B elements of Σ while ΣT is the top-
right T-1 x T-1 elements. These are the brand and time covariance matrices
reported in the text.
         To ensure that all covariance matrices are symmetric and positive definite,
we cannot directly estimate parameters of these matrices. Instead, we write
       Σ𝑇    Σ𝑐𝑜𝑣
Σ=[               ] where every row of Σ𝑐𝑜𝑣 is identical and is given by:
      Σ𝑐𝑜𝑣 ′ ΣB
                                                                      𝐿𝑇                       0
  𝑇
{𝜎2,1        𝑇
      , … , 𝜎T,1 }. We can Cholesky decompose Σ into 𝐿𝐿′ where L = [ ̃                        ̃𝐿𝐵 ] ,
                                                                    𝐿𝑐𝑜𝑣
𝐿𝑇 𝐿′𝑇 = Σ 𝑇 is the Cholesky decomposition of Σ 𝑇 , 𝐿̃𝑐𝑜𝑣 = (𝐿−1
                                                              𝑇 Σ𝑐𝑜𝑣 )′ where and

𝐿̃𝐵 𝐿̃′𝐵 = Σ𝐵 − 𝐿̃𝑐𝑜𝑣 𝐿̃𝑐𝑜𝑣 ′. The parameters we estimate are the elements of the
lower triangular matrix 𝐿𝑇 , the T-1 elements of each row of Σ𝑐𝑜𝑣 , and the lower
triangular matrix 𝐿̃𝐵 .
         To compute standard errors, we use the negative of the Hessian of the
likelihood function to recover the standard errors of the estimated parameters and
then use the delta method to compute the standard errors of the elements of the
covariance matrices.

Notes: Table replicates the corresponding rows of Table 1 in the text in the final
sample for which reports are resulted in the structural model. In this sample, we
compare the predicted savings measures computed by conditioning on decile of
January expenditures with a model in which we assign each individual to one of
1000 cells based on deciles of prior year expenditures and days supply of branded
and generic drugs (as in AG). The latter model is not feasible in 2006 since we do
not observe prior year data but it is feasible in 2007.

    Notes: Table shows various measures of choice quality from 2006 through 2009,
    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total costs (computed as the sum of
    premiums paid and out of pocket costs) in the “Full Sample” described in the text
    using all enrollees from January-June. “Foregone Savings PF” gives our “perfect
    foresight” measure: realized total costs relative to the plan which minimizes
    realized total costs (ex post). “Foregone Savings Pred” compares predicted costs
    in the chosen plan to predicted costs in the costs minimizing plan, where predicted
    costs are computed as average costs among all individual in the same decile of
    costs in the first month of enrollment in that year. “Efficient Frontier Pred” gives
    the same measure, but compares the chosen plan only with plans which have
    weakly lower variance (computed as the variance in simulated out of pocket costs
    for that plan among 200 beneficiaries in the same decile of expenditure during the
    first month of enrollment).

Notes: Appendix Table 4 decomposes all reasons for entry into our main sample
(which includes only beneficiaries enrolled for the full year). A beneficiary enters
the sample in year t if they were present in year t but not in t-1. Beneficiaries
enter either because they were excluded from the prior year sample for enrolling
after January, because they turned 65, because their geographic location changed
(some territories such as the US Virgin Islands are excluded from the sample),




                                         66
because they were previously excluded for having claims from multiple plans,
because they were previously excluded for receiving low income subsidies,
because they were previously not enrolled in a PDP plan or because there is
simply no record of them having existed in the previous year. Appendix Table 5
details the reasons for exit from the sample. Beneficiaries exit because of death,
because of geographic location changes, because they had claims from multiple
plans in a subsequent year, because they became eligible for low income
subsidies, because they switched to a non-PDP plan or because they disappeared
entirely from the data.

Notes: Table excerpted from Appendix Table 1 in Abaluck and Gruber (2009).
The table shows the results of estimating the model using simulated choices
assuming the utility function and risk parameter listed in a given column. Each
column shows coefficients from a single regression. The coefficients reported are
the parameters of the utility function, not marginal effects. Standard errors are in
parentheses. The sample differs slightly from that in Table 1 because individuals
with greater than 17000 in total costs for any plan are dropped. All simulated
choices are based on the cost distribution generated from the realized costs of 200
individuals in the same decile of 2005 total costs, decile of 2005 total days supply
of branded drugs and decile of 2005 days supply of generic drugs. The first three
columns compute expected utility using a CRRA utility function with wealth of
17000 and the indicated coefficient of relative risk aversion, assuming that
individuals select the choice which maximizes expected utility. The final three
columns compute expected utility using a CARA utility function with the
indicated coefficient of absolute risk aversion.

Notes: Table shows conditional logit results from estimating equation (2) by
maximum likelihood using our restricted sample. Standard errors are in
parentheses. In addition to the coefficients reported here, all specifications
include brand fixed effects, separate coefficients for active and forced switchers
(only those for active switchers are reported), interactions between all the reported
coefficients and experience variables, and interactions between the inertia
coefficient and (demeaned) values of the plan characteristics for the minimum
cost plan, deciles of expenditure in the previous year, and characteristics of the
chosen plan in the previous year. In later years, separate inertia dummies are
included for the plan one was enrolled in during each preceding year.
