Behavioral Decision-Making: An Application to the Setting of Magazine Subscription Prices

                                             ABSTRACT

Using data from American magazines, we explore the relationship between subscription discounts

and magazine characteristics. We focus in particular on those magazine features that might lead

time-inconsistent consumers to wish to engage in commitment behavior. We find that for magazines

whose payoff is in the future and/or that are meritorious for other reasons, subscription discounts

are lower all else equal. This finding suggests that publishers may be able to set subscription prices

in order to extract rents from consumers' willingness to tie their own hands in terms of their future

reading.

        Recent work in behavioral economics argues that consumers have time-inconsistent

preferences. If a desired behavior or product has upfront costs and delayed benefits, at the

moment of action/purchase, the consumer will procrastinate because she weights the

current costs too highly. Thus the future self and the current self may not share the same

view about optimal consumption choices at a particular moment in time. Classic examples

include the current self expecting that the future self will exercise, or save for retirement.

(Della Vigna and Malmandier, 2002; Caplin and Leahy, 2001). When the future arrives, the

person has a tendency to feel the action at hand is costly to undertake, and does not engage

in the behavior she rationally wanted to engage in the day before. In some cases, consumers

may be naïve and not realize that their future self will act differently than their current self

wishes it would. In other cases, consumers may be “sophisticated” (O’Donoghue and Rabin,

1999) in that they are aware the future self will not behave optimally from the present self’s

point of view. The self-control problem leads these sophisticated consumers to take actions

in the present to alter the consumption patterns they adopt in the future. (O’Donoghue and

Rabin, 1999, 2000; Laibson, 1997). For example, a consumer might join a health club or

arrange for automatic direct deposit into a retirement account. Read et al (1999) run an

experiment allowing for pre-commitment to video rentals. They show that consumers who

select movie titles several days in advance choose more “highbrow” films than consumers

choosing a movie for immediate viewing. These examples and experiments illustrate one

important feature of the behavioral model, namely when the current self anticipates that the

future self may go astray, that present self may try to tie the hands of the self- to -come.

        While this characterization of behavior certainly resonates with many of us, empirical

work testing the behavioral model in real markets have been few, with the notable exception



                                                                                                   3
of DellaVigna and Malmandier (2002) and several papers in the marketing literature (e.g.

Wertenbroch (1998)). This paper applies a simple behavioral model of consumer decision-

making to help explain pricing in the magazine industry. In particular, we are interested in

the question of whether there is any evidence that the pricing structure adopted by

publishers reflects the behavioral strategies of consumers trying to alter their own reading

patterns. For example, do consumers “over-pay” for a subscription to the New York Review of

Books to try to induce increased future reading?

        The magazine market provides an exceptionally rich setting in which to explore the

behavioral model. Most magazines are offered at both single newsstand price and at

subscription rates, providing all issues of the magazine for a fixed future time period at a

single fee. The existence of these two price forms means that the potential consumer can

either make a simultaneous purchase/read decision or, by buying a subscription, can

purchase now, for delivery and reading in the future. The availability of the subscription

form clearly would allow a consumer to influence the behavior of his or her future self since

it is a mechanism by which the future self is offered an issue at zero marginal cost. In this

way, the magazine market is similar to the health club market explored by Della Vigna and

Malmandier (2002).

        At the same time, magazines are themselves quite heterogeneous along quality

dimensions that are likely to influence the level of preference inconsistency over time. Some

magazines — for example the New York Review of Books or Foreign Policy -- may be ones for

which a current self wishes to induce future consumption, while other magazines — perhaps

the National Enquirer or Star– may instead be ones for which time inconsistency is not an

issue. We consider several reasons why a consumer might want to read particular magazines.

It may be an investment good in the sense of Della Vigna and Malmandier (2002) with a



                                                                                                4
payoff in the future, as opposed to enjoyment consumed concurrently with reading the

magazine. A magazine may be seen as “meritorious” but perhaps not particularly enjoyable

and thus be potentially subject to self-control issues. Though we distinguish between these

magazine features in the abstract, in practice they are likely to be positively correlated across

magazines. Our empirical strategy is to measure several magazine features that fit with the

theory and show that the general result is present regardless of which is used.

        Our experiment ties the behavioral literature to the field of Industrial Organization

quite explicitly. If publishers recognize differences across magazines in these behavioral

characteristics, one would expect them to set higher subscription prices relative to newsstand

prices for investment good/meritorious magazines, those with a high level of consumer time

inconsistency. Subscriptions to these magazines — because they are offering consumers a

chance to tie their own hands via a subscription — require a lower discount than

subscriptions to less “worthy” magazines to induce purchase of the subscription. The

product heterogeneity in this market allows us to look across magazines to see whether or

not the expected level of consumer time inconsistency is connected to differences in pricing

structures, in particular the extent of a subscription discount.

        One of the advantages of the magazine market over the health club market studied

by DellaVigna and Malmandier is that, in the case of magazines, not only do we observe

both newsstand and subscription prices, but both pricing forms are commonly used. Indeed,

most of us buy magazines both via subscription and via newsstand purchase. However, our

analysis does not rely on the same individual purchasing different magazines using different

modes; our theory also holds if some types of consumers purchase subscriptions and others

purchase from the newsstand. Secondly, there are many magazines on the market, all with




                                                                                                5
different investment good characteristics and different prices, yet all comparable in the

newsstand versus subscription “products” that they offer.

        Using a data set of almost three hundred U.S. magazines, we find strong evidence of

higher subscription prices relative to newsstand prices for magazines for which time-

inconsistency is likely to be an issue. Our results suggest that publishers are taking into

account the desire of consumers to influence their own future reading patterns by charging

higher subscription rates for more investment-type magazines than they can charge for pure

consumption-type goods. Increasing our measure of “investment-ness” one standard

deviation raises the ratio of subscription fees to newsstand prices by 4% on average.

Alternatively, moving from a genre that’s a non-investment genre to one that has investment

characteristics increases the ratio of subscription to newsstand prices by about 12%.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a simple model of

subscription discounts, including a behavioral component. Section 3 describes the data we

have collected on magazine prices and characteristics. In Section 4 we describe our results,

and Section 5 concludes.

2.      A Simple Model

        There are several papers in the literature that focus on the pricing structure of

magazines, particularly on the existence of subscriptions. (Glazer and Hassin, 1982;

Gabszwewicz and Sonnac, 1999). In order to account for the co-existence of subscriptions

and single newsstand prices, it is necessary to introduce some heterogeneity in consumers.

The previous literature introduces heterogeneity in two forms. First, consumers vary in the

shape of their willingness-to-pay curve as a function of number of issues. In this case,

subscription-pricing looks like bundling, and single, relatively high newsstand prices are

offered to consumers with relatively steep demand curves while those with relatively flatter



                                                                                               6
demand curves buy the bundle via subscription. Alternatively, or in addition, consumers may

vary in the transactions costs they face in purchasing single issues, perhaps because of their

location. Consumers in isolated towns may have higher costs of finding a particular

magazine, for example. In this case, publishers can capture part of the benefits of serving

high transactions costs consumers via subscriptions.

        Consider a situation in which a magazine offers consumer j the choice of a

subscription providing n issues of magazine i at a fee Si, or a single issue at a price pi.

Following the prior literature, we recognize that for any consumer to purchase the

subscription, it must be true that

        1.   Si< pinij+cij

Where nij is the number of issues the jth consumer wishes to purchase at price pi and cij are

the costs of acquiring magazines of type i for consumer j. Clearly from the point of view of

the publisher, there are a range of possible combinations of newsstand prices and

subscription prices that satisfy equation 1, and the publishers’ task is to choose the optimal

profit-maximizing combination conditional on the distribution of consumers and conditions

involving production costs. Glazer and Haskin (1982) and Gabszwewicz and Sonnac, (1999)

examine the properties of the equilibrium under some simple assumptions about demand

and costs.

        In the prior work in the literature, the number of issues of a given magazine that

consumers wish to purchase is fixed ex ante for the individual. In particular, the individual

consumer takes as given his or her optimal consumption level of the magazine and then,

given the subscription rates, newsstand prices, and transactions costs, decides whether to

buy the magazine at all and, if so, whether to subscribe or buy at the newsstand. Suppose

alternatively, and in the spirit of the behavioral literature, that individuals have some



                                                                                                 7
preferences about how many issues of a particular magazine they would like themselves to

read in the future. One way to motivate this preference is by reference to the literature on

time-inconsistent preferences. In particular, suppose that individuals have time-inconsistent

preferences for immediate gratification in the spirit of Laibson (1997) or O’Donoghue and

Rabin(2000), a characterization sometimes referred to as the “self-control” problem.

Suppose further that individuals recognize these self-control problems, and act as

behaviorally-sophisticated consumers in their purchases. In the current context, for a

meritorious or investment-type magazine, some subset of consumers recognizes that their

future self would under-consume issues from the perspective of their current self looking-

forward. One way to capture this self-control problem is to posit that there exists an nij* (as

in equation 1 above) representing the number of issues the consumer at time t would like

him or herself to buy and read at time t+1, and that for a meritorious or investment-type

magazine, nij*>nij. , for all pi.. In other words, the consumer will pay more for a subscription

to a meritorious magazine today than he or she expects it will be worth in the future to his or

her future self. But the current self finds it to be worth the price now in the expectation that

the subscription purchase will induce incremental future reading and self-improvement. In

some sense, the current self is buying both a flow of magazines and an enhanced chance of

self-improvement. All else equal, publishers of these meritorious magazines should be able

to extract the incremental consumer surplus associated with this self-improvement demand

via higher subscription rates relative to the newsstand prices. Indeed, in this model it is even

possible for the subscription rate to exceed the full newsstand price of all issues, even absent

any costs of transactions. This can be seen in the formal constraint below (2). It is the same

as in equation 1, plus an additional term which is the net surplus the consumer gains on each

of the additional magazines that she consumes due to having the subscription.



                                                                                                   8
2.      Si< pinij+cij+(nij*- nij)(υij-pi)

Where υ is the value of any individual issue of magazine i to consumer j.

        However, publishers are setting price for a total population of consumers, not all of

whom are time-inconsistent and sophisticated. In the literature (O’Donoghue and Rabin

1999, 2000), there are two other types of consumers, naïve and rational. Both of these types

believe that they will read the optimal (larger) number of magazines in the future. The

rational types are correct, and their decision is represented by equation 1. The naïve types

systematically under-consume but fail to notice that they are doing so. Being sure they will

consume the correct number of issues at the time of the purchase decision, they place the

same value on the subscription as the rational consumers. Returning to the publisher’s

problem, it appears that unless a very large majority of consumers are sophisticated, equation

1 will bind and determine subscription prices; a magazine’s “investment good” nature will be

irrelevant. However, in the magazine industry, advertising is a critical source of revenue and

gives magazines an incentive to increase circulation. Thus subscription discounts are typically

substantial, well below the binding constraint of equation 1. Publishers may therefore have

the ability to charge higher subscription prices when their consumer base contains more

sophisticated consumers without hitting the constraint for the naïve/rational consumers.

        In the discussion thus far, we have focused on the case of the meritorious magazine

that the consumer would like to commit to read. The model can also represent the case of a

consumer who would like to commit not to read a particular magazine; in this case n* will

be less than n. However, we do not know of a market institution that can help the consumer

with this problem by raising the effective marginal cost above the newsstand price. The best

the consumer can do is avoid the lower marginal costs associated with a subscription, or only

purchase a subscription if its price is appropriately low. In the empirical work we will try to


                                                                                                  9
capture the difference between n and n* - including its sign - and relate it to the subscription

price.

         In the motivation up to this point, higher subscription rates are induced by a desire

of sophisticated consumers to increase their own consumption of investment-type

magazines. There is an alternative, related, way of looking at this problem that in our case

yields similar results. As we indicated earlier, in deciding to subscribe to a magazine, the

consumer makes an estimate of expected future use. Suppose some naïve consumers are

systematically biased, in the sense that they over-estimate how much they will wish to

purchase meritorious magazines and how little they will wish to indulge in junk reading.

Referring back to equation 1, under these circumstances consumers will be systematically

over-estimating the number of magazines they wish to purchase: nij*>nij.. Under conditions

where consumers imagine themselves to be “better” than they are, we will find similar results

in terms of the subscription discount, this time driven by the naïve segment of the market.

Consumers will be willing to pay higher-than-ex post-desirable subscription prices, not

because they are trying to influence future behavior but because they systematically over-

estimate how many magazines in the subscription they will read. The implied price per issue

read that such a consumer calculates is systematically too low compared to actual behavior.

Under these conditions, it is also possible for publishers to extract higher subscription prices

as they capture the “imaginary” consumer surplus. Note in this case, however, absent some

transactions costs, the subscription discount will never be negative since consumers will

never imagine themselves to read more issues than exist.

         Either of these two, quite simple, representations of behavioral decision making

suggest that publishers of meritorious and/or investment type magazines can exploit the

desire of consumers to either be better or believe themselves to be better by charging a high



                                                                                               10
subscription rate relative to the newsstand price. Note that the key feature of either model is

that publishers can extract the incremental consumer surplus associated with either the

desire to tie one’s hands or a consumer’s lack of self-awareness only in setting the forward-

looking subscription price for meritorious magazines, not the spot price. In the next section

we describe the data we use to test this hypothesis.



3.      The Data

        In order to test whether or not subscription rates for magazines can be in part

explained by either of these simple behavioral stories, we collected data on almost 300

magazines published within the US. The principal sources of our data on magazine prices

and circulation were ABC, the Audit Bureau of Circulation and the MRI, Mediamark

Research Inc. Both are standard sources for work on magazine pricing (Koschat and Putsis,

2002). ABC collects data on readership and pricing from magazines, audits them for

accuracy and then sells access to the audited data on their web site. The variables collected

from ABC in the fall of 2002 form the core of the dataset. MRI is a standard source for

demographic information on magazine readership. In the case of a few magazines,

subscriptions appeared to require membership (e.g. Audubon, American Legion, VFW

Magazine). We also found one magazine, Mass Transit, that, while it has a subscription and

cover price, is mostly given away to people who work in the industry.1 These were eliminated

from the sample.

         The magazines in the sample vary considerably in terms of the use of subscription

sales. The mean percent of magazines sold on subscription was .81, with a range between .05

and 1. Note, of course, the percent of magazines sold on subscription overstates the number

                                                                                                      11
of unique readers in a given year who are subscribers, given that subscribers by definition

buy all issues of a magazine. Magazines with low use of subscriptions include many in the

categories of weddings, gossip, women’s general interest, and youth.

        In addition to the ABC and MRI sources, we obtained some of the variables used

from the magazines themselves. Using research funds and donations from friends, we

assembled a magazine collection of 118 physical copies. The remaining magazines in the

sample were examined either at major public libraries, large news carriers, or on web sites.

Appendix A contains a listing of the magazines in the data set; the range of magazines is

quite large, including large circulation, well known magazines like Time and Business Week

as well as more esoteric magazines like Quilter’s Digest and Gun Dogs.

        Specification and Variable Construction

Recall that a sophisticated consumer will purchase a subscription if

        Si< pinij+cij+(nij*- nij)(υij-pi)

Magazines can be scaled by creating a characteristic αi≡Σj (nij/nij*) that is an average across

all consumers for a particular magazine. It is then straightforward to show that the constraint

on the ratio of the subscription price per issue to the newsstand price decreases in αi. In

other words, as the number of desired issues diverges from the number of issues that will

actually be consumed (absent a subscription), the subscription price can increase and the

sophisticated consumer will still purchase it. The empirical specification we use therefore

relates the subscription discount to measures of α for each magazine, while controlling for

other features of the magazine that we think may have an impact on subscription ratios.



        The empirical question in the paper centers on the size of the subscription discount.

We do not want to use the absolute level of subscription price in our analysis because


                                                                                                  12
magazines differ greatly in this characteristic. Rather, we use the ratio of the subscription

price per issue and the newsstand, or cover, price. In practice, many magazines have multiple

subscription rates, depending both on duration of the subscription and on special offers. In

this paper, we use a one-year regular subscription rate, as identified in the ABC data. The

dependent variable in the regression Subratio is defined as the subscription rate divided by

the annualized newsstand price. Thus, a higher Subratio denotes a lower discount rate. In the

data, Subratio varies from 0.16 to 1.25.

        As we suggested in the last section, the economics literature on subscription pricing

suggests two sources of variation in subscription price discounts: variation in the

heterogeneity in the consumer willingness to pay function and variation in the transactions

costs of newsstand purchase. We use several measures to capture these effects.

        To proxy the transactions costs of acquiring particular magazines, we construct a

variable called Available. We sent research assistants to six cities across the US: New York

City, Boise, Chicago, LA, Tulsa, and Houston. In each city, the research assistant noted

whether the magazines were available at the largest public library and at a randomly chosen

newsstand. The index runs from 0-12, with a mean of 4.7; the higher the index, the lower

transactions costs of newsstand purchase. A second measure of magazine availability is the

circulation level. All else equal, large circulation magazines will be available in more places.

(As we will argue shortly , there is an offsetting effect on subscription prices from large

circulation on the cost side.) The mean of circulation is 855,910, with a standard deviation of

1,472,923. Because of the large range of the circulation variable, we use ln(circulation) in the

specification as well to capture non-linearities.

        Measuring the underlying heterogeneity of the potential buying population is more

difficult. Here, we look at several features of magazines. NumberOfIssues is the number of



                                                                                                   13
issues of the magazine published in a given year, with a range from 4 to 52. For magazines

with numerous issues all on the same topic, inducing purchase of all issues would be

expected to require a deeper discount. Modifying this effect is the variable NumIssues*Change,

which is the number of issues interacted with an indicator variable for whether the genre

experiences a change in content regularly. We somewhat arbitrarily decided that these genres

are news magazines, sports magazines, gossip magazines, magazines about technology, trade

magazines, and general business magazines, comprising 21% of the total sample. We judged

that the material in, for example, hobby, religion, and women’s and men’s general interest

magazines was more static. For magazines with ample new content, we would expect less

need for discounting as the number of issues rise, as those issues are less substitutable one

for another.

        As we noted earlier, magazines often have introductory offers for subscriptions as

well as standard subscription rates. In cases in which publishers believe their magazines to be

especially prone to habit-formation, low introductory rates, followed by higher subscription

rates may be a preferred strategy. We take the ratio of the introductory offer to the regular

offer, Intro, as a measure of how habit-forming publishers believe their magazine to be. If

this effect is important, low levels of Intro (deep introductory discounts) will be associated

with high levels of regular subscriptions relative to newsstand prices. The introductory offer

was taken from either the paper insert in the physical magazine, or the rate offered on the

website.

           In addition to the demand variables just described, there is a small trade literature

that suggests that publishers of low circulation magazines may offer subscription discounts

to improve product run planning. (Round and Bentick, 1997). The idea is that more

subscriptions generate more certainty about the correct production level. As the circulation



                                                                                                   14
of the magazine grows, demand from newsstands becomes smoother, and the benefit to

having subscription sales for creating smooth demand falls somewhat. This literature

provides a second interpretation of the coefficient on the circulation variable that is the

opposite sign from the availability effect.. To the extent that the constructed variable

Availability already completely captures the effect of transactions costs, we would expect this

production smoothing effect to dominate and subscription prices relative to newsstand

prices to rise with circulation.

        An additional supply –side effect arises due to the two revenue streams, sales and

advertising, that magazines can earn. The publisher has an incentive to increase circulation

by lowering the price of a subscription relative to newsstand price because this distributes

more magazines (even if they are unread) and thus boosts the value of ads in the magazine.

We include the cost of a full page ad, Adrate, in the specification. It is calculated by taking

ABC’s full-page advertising cost measure and dividing by circulation to get a per reader cost.2

As Adrate increases, publishers have more incentive to lower relative subscription prices to

raise circulation.

          We turn now to the variables of most interest, those capturing the magazine

characteristics relevant to the behavioral distinctions we have made. Constructing such a

variable is clearly very difficult; a magazine that seems like consumption to an economist—

say The Economist, may feel like investment to a small businessman. In this work, we have

relied on three separate indices of magazine character.

        Our first variable, Expert, is used to distinguish between magazines by many libraries.

In distinguishing popular magazines from more serious or scholarly magazines, librarians ask

whether the credentials of the author of the feature articles are provided, either in the header

 We do not have data on the number of pages or ad pages in a magazine and so cannot precisely calculate

of the article or in a footnote. For our measure, the listed credentials must be relevant to the

subject at hand, and not simply biographical. For example, in a quilting magazine an expert

footnote would read “Mary Smith has won three national prizes for her quilts,” as compared

to “Mary Smith lives in Connecticut with her husband and three children.” This measure

seems quite close to what behavioral economists might think of as an investment feature: if

readers expect to learn from an article, they may well want to know the credentials of the

source. Expert is an indicator variable, with one denoting the presence of expert content. It

was generated by a research assistant who examined each magazine and applied the criteria

described.

        A second measure of magazine type is its genre. ABC provides extremely specific

genres (e.g. “Golf” “Auto general interest: consumer” “fashion”) We combined these into

more meaningful larger groups (e.g. hobbies, autos, women’s) until we were left with 25

genres (listed in the appendix). During this process, we separated out magazines that

appeared to be geared for members of specific professions. This genre we called “trade.” In

addition, separately from genre, ABC describes a magazine as a trade or consumer

publication. Almost all the business magazines are included in the “trade” definition, which

we did not like for two reasons. First, it makes the category quite large, and second, many

people read general business magazines as recreation or to plan for retirement, etc. So, we

added only the non-business titles from the ABC trade category to our existing trade

category (there was substantial overlap between the two groups). The other genres we

thought ex ante should be investment goods or be meritorious are Religion and Intellectual. All

three of these genres are included in the final specification. All three are again indicator

variables taking the value one if the magazine is designed for a particular career, (government

worker, early childhood education, journalism for example), is about religion/spirituality



                                                                                               16
(Theology Today, US Catholic, Yoga Journal), or is a magazine of ideas (Foreign Policy, Scientific

American). In our sample, 32% of the magazines have Expert content, 5% are Trade

magazines, 4% are religious magazines, and 10% are intellectual magazines.

           The third and fourth variables used, Pride and FutureGain, were constructed from

survey results of expert readers. Three Yale PhD students in the English Department, two

women and one man, were trained by the authors and then asked to inspect all 300

magazines on the list and answer the following two questions:



           1.            Do you think the typical reader of this magazine is proud of his or her
                         readership? That is, does the typical reader think better of him or herself
                         by virtue of being a reader of this magazine? We are concerned with
                         whether the typical reader is likely to be proud and not with the source or
                         legitimacy of that pride. Please mark a 2 for very proud, 1 for somewhat
                         proud and 0 otherwise.
           2.            Some magazines can be thought of as pleasures of the moment, while
                         others teach us something important for the future. Consider for each
                         magazine how much of the value of reading that magazine comes now
                         versus in the future. Please rate the magazine as a 1 if all or most of the
                         benefit of the magazine comes at the point of reading, up to a rating of 5
                         if virtually all of the benefits come in the future.


The second question is intended to get at the issue of impatience or time-inconsistency,

while the first question speaks more to the over-optimistic, self-satisfied consumer model.

We selected male and female readers to avoid any gender bias associated with rating different

genres. In fact the three ratings were relatively highly correlated with each other, at a level of

above 0.5 for all but two combinations of readers and ratings.3 In the empirical work, the

ratings of the three readers were combined to form our rating variable.

           Pride is thus the sum of answers to question 1 and varies from 0 to 6 . The

combined rating variables have a mean of 2.6 for question 1, with a standard deviation of


3
    Reader 3 had a correlation of .34 and .45 with readers 1 and 2 respectively on question 1 (pride).


                                                                                                         17
1.7. FutureGain varies from 3 to 14, with a mean of 7 and a standard deviation of 2.4. Pride

and FutureGain are positively correlated within a reader, as one might expect.4

        Table 1 provides a list of magazines in the upper and lower tails of the rating

distribution using the combined reader variables. Gossip and pornography magazines (e.g.

Cosmopolitan, Playboy, People) are at the bottom of both scales - with principal benefits coming

in the form of current pleasure and little pride of readership. National Geographic and Diver

magazine are both pleasant to read yet contain content that is meritorious or useful in the

future, so they are rated in the middle of both scales. The New York Review of Books, Kiplingers,

and The Nation, all are rated quite high on both scales. On the other hand, there are clearly

some magazines that are high on one level and not on the other. Art and Antiques for

example, is rated high on the Pride scale, but only medium on FutureGain scale.

        Clearly Pride and FutureGain suffer from the same defects as all subjective rating

measures. The reasonably high correlation across readers was comforting, however.5 In

addition, the three measures of investment/merit used in this paper are all positively

correlated: Pride and FutureGain, have correlations of 0.29 and 0.27 respectively with Expert.

        The means of the dependent and independent variables used are provided in Table 1

along with the data sources for each variable. Appendix A provides the full list of magazines

used with their two ratings given.




        4. Results: Does Magazine Quality Matter?

4.1 Basic Results


4
  The correlations are .53, .66, and .72 for readers one, two, and three.
5
  The authors also rated the magazines and found their ratings correlated well (above .6) with the PhD
student results.


                                                                                                         18
          The basic results in this paper are contained in Table 3 below. We include each

  behavioral variable separately in the four columns of the table. The non-behavioral

  variables all behave as we expect. Subscription prices relative to newsstand prices are

  relatively less (i.e. coefficient signs are negative) for magazines that are readily available,

  have small introductory discounts, have a large number of annual issues especially if their

  content does not change frequently, and charge high advertising prices. We combine the

  effects of both circulation variables and find that large circulation magazines, all else

  equal, offer lower discounts as the production-smoothing theory predicts.

          Turn now to the behavioral variables. In all specifications, the behavioral variables

are right-signed and all are significant at the five percent level or better. In particular, the

behavioral effects have relatively large economic impact. In column one, having Expert content

increases relative subscription rates by 0.053, which is a 9.5% increase at the mean of 0.553.

Examining column 2, we see that subscription rates are highest for trade (career-oriented)

magazines (.14), then the religious magazines (.13), then intellectual (.07), and all are positive

relative to the remaining omitted genres. In the case of Pride rating in column 3, if each of the

readers moved the magazine up one standard deviation on the “pride” scale, the subscription

rate would rise by 0.0334 or 6%. In column 4, FutureGain has similar effects; one standard

deviation higher on the FutureGain scale leads to an increase of 4.2% in the subscription ratio

evaluated at the mean.



Some Alternative Explanations

         One objection to the interpretation of the results provided thus far is that the

  behavioral variables may themselves be proxying for various demographic variables that

  might influence subscription rates. For example, suppose high-income people purchase


                                                                                                     19
meritorious magazines and high-income people have a lower response (smaller elasticity) to

subscription discounts. While we have no a priori reason to expect this relationship, it is

possible to let the data speak to the issue. For approximately two-thirds of the magazines in

the data set, we have information and the median income of the readership. (Unfortunately

we do not have any information about the educational level of readers.) In Table 4, we use

this sample to examine whether the effect of the behavioral variables disappears when we

include demographic controls.

        The first columns of Table 4 repeats the specifications in Table 3 with the smaller

sample for comparability. We focus on our subjective ratings measures as we feel these

variables most closely test the hypothesis of interest. Notice that the magnitudes of the

coefficients on Pride and FutureGain fall by about 20% and their significance levels drop

compared to the results with the full sample. The final columns of Table 4 show that median

income level of the readers does not appear to explain subscription discounting. In addition,

the unconditional correlation between income and subratio is not significantly different from

zero. We conclude that income is not driving the relationship between magazine

characteristics and subscription pricing. We do find that median income of a magazine’s

readers is unconditionally correlated with the magazine’s Expert, Pride, and FutureGain ratings.

        We also include the percentage of readers who are female (PctFem) in the regression,

and note that this variable does have an effect on subratio. The more female readers a

magazine has, the higher the subscription rate is relative to the newsstand price. It may be

that women readers are more avid magazine readers than men on average and are therefore

more willing to pay for subscriptions. More importantly from our perspective, including

these demographic variables does not substantially alter the effect of Pride and FutureGain;

statistical significance remains, and the magnitude of FutureGain increases slightly.



                                                                                               20
          Note that in general, we should not be surprised to find that demographic

  characteristics of readers are associated with their patience or self-awareness, and therefore

  possibly with subscription price for the reasons we outline above. Neither income nor

  percent female reader appears to be a demographic that neatly captures impatience, and

  therefore neither substitutes for our behavioral measures. However, in principle, if one had

  better demographics, one could perhaps find a measure that would work in this way.

          The fact that the percent female appears to affect subscription discounting led us to

  think further about the role of gender in this market. Previous work in economics suggests

  that in both experimental settings and in real world investment settings, there may be gender

  differences in personality traits that are relevant to commitment-type behavior. Barber and

  Odeon (2001) , for example find that men are more prone to over-confidence in stock

  market investments than are women. In an experimental setting, Chaudhuri and

  Gangadharan (2003) find that women are less trusting than men. We find the question of

  whether there are any differences in the tendencies of men versus women to try to commit

  themselves to be very interesting. We explore whether commitment to better magazine-

  reading through subscriptions varies by gender below.

          Using the smaller data set for which demographic information is available , we

  created two interaction terms, PctFem*FutureGain and PctFem*Pride, interacting our two

  rating measures with percent female. Table 5 reports the results. In both specifications, the

  coefficient on the interaction term is negative and significant. The coefficient is large enough

  that, when evaluated at the mean of the percent female variable, it wipes out a large part of

  the effect of the behavioral variables.

        It is interesting to speculate on the source of the gender difference we observe. There

is a prior literature in the psychology area that suggests that women may have lower needs to



                                                                                                21
engage in hand-tying behavior. In particular, there are a number of studies indicating that

women have what psychologists call enhanced inhibitory abilities; that is, they are better able to

control their own impulses. (For a review and an evolutionary interpretation of this literature,

see Bjorland and Kipp, 1996). Evolutionary psychologists have argued for a link between the

need for parental investments in children and the development of an enhanced ability to delay

gratification in women. In the economics literature of development, there is also evidence of

differential parental investment by women. (Duflo, 2003). Alternatively, it may be that women

are more naïve about their own need for self-control.

            In the context of our analysis, the gender difference suggests that publishers will be

  less able to charge high subscription rates for meritorious women’s magazines than for

  comparable men’s magazines because women are less likely to pay for this commitment

  device.



  5. Conclusions

            While theories associated with behavioral economics have attracted considerable

  attention from economists the last few years, there has been very little work that tries to take

  these theories to traditional issues in Industrial Organization. In this paper, we apply the

  insights of the behavioral model to a traditional industrial organization problem: the setting

  of prices. Our results suggest that magazine publishers appear to be setting subscription

  prices to take advantage of time-inconsistency on the part of consumers. Magazines for

  which consumers might have a time-consistency problem and meritorious magazines have a

  higher ratio of subscription to newsstand prices than other magazines.
