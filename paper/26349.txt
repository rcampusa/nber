Behavioral Responses to State Income Taxation of High Earners: Evidence from California

NBER Working Paper No. 26349

JEL No. H24,H31,H71,H73,J22,J61,R23

                                                ABSTRACT

Using administrative income tax data, we analyze the response to Proposition 30, a 2012 ballot measure
that increased California marginal tax rates by up to 3 percentage points for high-income households.
Relative to baseline rates of departure for their income levels, an additional 0.8% of the residential
tax base that landed in the top bracket left California in 2013. Using matched out-of-state taxpayers
as controls reveals an income elasticity with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate of 2.5-3.2 for high-earners
who stayed. These responses together eroded 45.2% of state windfall tax revenues within the first
year and 60.9% within two years, with the extensive margin accounting for 9.5% of this total.

          In November 2012, California voters passed increases to state marginal income tax rates of
      1 to 3 percentage points for upper-income households. Drawing on the universe of California
      income tax filings, we present new findings about the effects of personal income taxation on
      household location choice and pre-tax income. First, over and above baseline rates of taxpayer
      departure from California, an additional 0.8% of the California residential tax filing base whose
      2012 income would have been in the new 12.3% top tax bracket were no longer full year residents
      of California in 2013. Second, to identify the impact of the California tax policy shift on the
      pre-tax earnings of high-income California residents, we use as a control group high-earning
      out-of-state taxpayers who persistently file as California non-residents. Using a differences-in-
      differences strategy paired with propensity score matching, we estimate a substantial intensive
      margin response which begins in 2012 amongst California top-bracket taxpayers. Our estimates
      imply an intensive margin elasticity of income with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate of 2.5
      to 3.2. Among top-bracket California taxpayers, outward migration and behavioral responses
      by stayers together eroded 45.2% of the windfall tax revenues from the reform within the first
      year and 60.9% within two years, with the extensive margin accounting for 9.5% of this total
      response.

1.     Introduction
The empirical public finance literature has studied the elasticity of taxable income with respect to
marginal net of tax rates as a measure of the efficiency of a tax system (Saez, Slemrod and Giertz
2012). In the leading approach for examining the elasticity of taxable income for the personal income
tax (Gruber and Saez 2002; Giertz 2007; Kleven and Schultz 2014), the percent change in taxable
income is estimated as a function of the percent change in marginal tax rates and a term designed
to capture income effects, alongside a rich set of controls for base-period income. The literature's
conclusion based on this methodology has generally been that the compensated elasticity of taxable
income with respect to marginal tax rates is in the range of 0.1 to 0.4, while the income effects that
would lead to greater labor supply under higher taxes are essentially negligible. These relatively
modest elasticities have generally translated into calculations of high optimal marginal tax rates
(Saez 2001; Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva 2014), with perhaps the most widely cited calculation
being a top optimal tax rate of 73 percent (Diamond and Saez 2011).
     At the same time, a growing literature documents the rise in tax avoidance and evasion by
wealthy individuals (Zucman 2014). Agrawal and Foremny (2019) and Kleven et al. (2014) doc-
ument a tendency of high earners to relocate in response to changes in the top tax rate in Spain
and Denmark. In the context of inventors, Moretti and Wilson (2017) and Akcigit, Baslandze and
Stantcheva (2016) investigate the influence of taxation on mobility across state lines within the
U.S., and international boundaries, respectively. On the other hand, Varner, Young and Prohofsky
(2018) and Young et al. (2016) use administrative tax data in U.S. states and find relatively small
migration responses to changes in top income tax rates. The quantitative implications of such
behavioral responses remain an active topic of inquiry. Overall, the impact of cross-border mobility
of individuals and capital on the elasticity of the taxable income for states within the U.S. or within
other unions with free labor mobility is an open question.
     In this paper we study the question of the elasticity of the tax base with respect to taxation using
microdata from the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) on the universe of California taxpayers
around the implementation of major 2012 ballot initiative, Proposition 30. California is the largest
U.S. state by GDP, comparable to the economy of the 5th or 6th largest country in the world.
The Proposition 30 ballot initiative increased marginal income tax rates by 1 percentage point
for singles with $250,000-$300,000 in taxable income (married couples with $500,000-$600,000), by
2 percentage points for singles with $300,000-$500,000 in taxable income (married couples with
$600,000-$1 million), and by 3 percentage points for singles with over $500,000 in taxable income
(married couples with over $1 million). These increases came on top of the 9.3% rate that applied
to income over $48,942 for singles and $97,884 for married couples, and also in addition to a 1%
income tax to support mental health expenditures that since 2004 had applied to incomes of over $1
million. The reform therefore brought the top marginal tax rate in California to 13.3% for incomes
of over $1 million, the highest state-level marginal tax rate in the nation. The reform was voted in
November 2012 and applied retroactively to tax year 2012 as well as for future tax years through


                                                    2
2018. California Proposition 55 during the 2016 election year extended these rate increases through
2030.
      We first study the extensive margin response to taxation, and document a substantial one-
time outflow of high-earning taxpayers from California in response to Proposition 30. Defining a
departure as a taxpayer who went from resident to non-resident filing status,1 For those earning
over $5 million, the rate of departures spiked from 1.5% after the 2011 tax year to 2.125% after
the 2012 tax year, with a similar effect among taxpayers earning $2-5 million in 2012. The increase
in departure rate is significant but smaller for taxpayers in the new top bracket earning under $2
million. The fact that the effect increases with income is consistent with the established theory that
average tax rates matter for extensive margin individual location decisions (Moretti and Wilson
2017; Agrawal and Foremny 2019).2 These results highlight the importance of considering the
extensive margin of taxpayer behavior when examining state-level tax changes. On the whole,
relative to the pre-period 2000-10, the income-weighted rate of departure amongst top-bracket
taxpayers was abnormally higher by 0.8% between 2012 and 2013.3
      Gauging the size of the increased incentive to relocate is complicated by the fact that federal
tax policy also changed between 2012 and 2013. The U.S. Congress passed the American Taxpayer
Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012 on January 1, 2013, which increased the top marginal tax rate for single
filers earning $400,000 or more (and couples earning $450,000 or more) from 35% to 39%, except
for those taxpayers whose income and deductions caused their marginal rate to be determined
by the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The federal tax increase reduced the incentive to move
from California for taxpayers not in the AMT, since the full deductibility of state and local taxes
that prevailed at the time became more valuable. We estimate that the treatment on California
households' average tax rates relative to the average tax rates they would have faced in zero-income-
tax states such as Nevada, Texas, and Florida would have been 23-40% higher (depending on their
income level and composition) in the absence of ATRA.
      We combine these results on the extensive margin behavioral response with conclusions of
analysis of the intensive margin response to Proposition 30. Our focus on the California tax reform
on this margin is motivated by the need for a credible counterfactual group to assess the average
treatment effect of Proposition 30 on the pre-tax income of California high earners. Much of the
empirical public finance literature studies population-level reforms (i.e. federal tax reforms) and
thus must use taxpayers of different income levels to impute the potential outcomes of treated
groups, with the aid of regression adjustments.

  1
     Since non-residents of California must file a California return if they have any California-source income, this
procedure captures essentially all tax-compliant movers. The out migration effect is primarily accounted for by
taxpayers who remain non-resident filers in the 2014 tax year; we discuss this mode of out migration at length in
Section 5.a.1. On average, the state loses 83.6% of the adjusted-gross income tax base of top-bracket out-movers within
two years from this mode of migration, with the remaining income continuing to be taxed in 2014 on non-resident
tax returns these individual submit.
   2
     Analogous intuition on the importance of average tax rates for extensive margin decisions is found in the literature
on firm location choices. See for example Devereux and Griffith 1998.
   3
     Of the 66,936 primary taxpayers whom Proposition 30 placed in the to 12.3% bracket in 2012, this implies an
income-weighted increase in departures of 535 top-bracket taxpayers.


                                                           3
      We take a different approach: in particular, we use a differences-in-differences design in which we
compare upper-income California resident taxpayers to a matched sample of non-resident California
filers, for which there is relatively rich data given that any substantive California-source income
requires the filing of a California tax return even by non-residents.4
      Our procedure in particular focuses on the intensive-margin impact of Proposition 30 on those
California taxpayers whose income levels in each of the years 2009, 2010, and 2010 would have
placed them in the Proposition 30 top bracket if that bracket had been in place at the time. The
motivation for using this definition of high-earners is the well known issue in the empirical public
finance literature that top incomes are highly mean reverting. In a recent treatment of this topic,
Weber (2014) shows that using long lags of income to instrument for pre-treatment income increases
estimation credibility. Requiring consistently high pre-Proposition 30 incomes is a simple way to
translate this intuition into the definition of a treatment group in our setting. The counterfactual
control group of non-resident filers is then defined to be those taxpayers who do not reside in
California, but file California non-resident returns, and who if California residents would have filed
in the top California Proposition 30 created bracket from 2009-11.
      While there is no evidence of substantially different pre-trends between our treatment and
control populations, they are imbalanced on covariates. We thus use propensity score matching
as a pre-processing step, matching only on 2009-10 covariates. Following the logic in Imbens
and Wooldridge (2009), the equality of covariate values in 2011 is a testable implication of the
unconfoundedness assumption; we indeed find that this restriction is satisfied, increasing confidence
in the estimation design.
      Our estimates show a substantial intensive margin response to Proposition 30, which appears in
2012 and persists through the last year of our analysis in 2014. Compared to matched nonresident
counterfactuals, California top-earners on average report $522,000 less in taxable income in 2012,
$357,000 less in 2013, and $599,000 less in 2014; this is relative to a baseline mean income of $4.15
million amongst our defined group of California top-earners in 2011. Compared to counterfactuals
in similarly high-tax states, California top-earners on average report $352,000 less in taxable income
in 2012, $373,000 less in 2013, and $481,000 less in 2014. The appearance of an intensive margin
response in 2012 is consistent with the fact that Proposition 30 was retroactive to 2012, was known
to have a substantial chance of passage, and in general was a salient issue in California during the
bulk of 2012.5 We also estimate the average effect in logs, which leads to even larger estimates.
This intensive margin response is concentrated in non-investment income, not in capital gains,
dividends, and interest income.
      Using the levels result from 2013 and the more conservative similar-tax state counterfactuals,
the estimates imply an elasticity of taxable income with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate
of 2.5 to 3.2. This is a large estimate, especially relative to the classic public finance literature.
Although it is estimated on a population of taxpayers earning over $4 million dollars annually
  4
     Such filers on average have a California AGI to Federal AGI ratio of between 4.8% and 7.5% over the course of
the 2009-14 period
   5
     See the discussion of the Proposition 30 institutional setting in Section 3.


                                                        4
in taxable income, we note that according to the latest FTB statistics approximately 40% of the
individual income tax in California is paid by those with taxable income of over $1 million. Using
a midpoint of 2.8 as an elasticity of taxable income with respect to the marginal net of tax rate
                                                                       1
implies a revenue-maximizing state tax rate of 19% (=               1+1.52.8 ),   at least during a regime when
state income taxes were deductible from federal taxable income as was the case before the Tax Cut
and Jobs Act of 2017.
      We do not take a stand on the broad normative implications of our estimates. For example,
one possibility is that lower earnings in response to high tax rates reflects a reduction in productive
labor supply amongst high earners. On the other hand, as shown by Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva
(2014), a major driver of top income responses to taxation could be a reduction in rent-seeking,
for example a reduction in wage bargaining by CEOs. Our data, while rich, do not allow sufficient
granularity to disentangle such channels.
      Finally, we assess the implications of our estimates for tax revenue in the context of California
Proposition 30.6 A back of the envelope calculation based on our econometric estimates finds that
the intensive and extensive margin responses to taxation combined to undo 45.2% of the revenue
gains from taxation that otherwise would have accrued to California in the absence of behavioral
responses within the first year and 60.9% within the first two years. The intensive margin accounts
for the majority of this effect, while the extensive margin comprises 9.5% of this total response.
      This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review related literature. In Section 3, we
discuss the institutional setting, specifically California Proposition 30 and the federal tax changes
that occurred at the same time. In Section 4, we describe the data. In Section 5, we describe
the empirical methodology. Sections 6 and 7 present the extensive and intensive margin results
respectively. Section 8 describes the policy implications of our extensive and intensive margin
results. Section 9 concludes.


2.      Related Literature

2.a.     Extensive Margin
As Kleven et al. (2019) discuss in a recent survey, both lack of access to administrative data
and identification challenges have to some extent constrained this literature. Literature on the
behavioral response to taxation has aimed to analyze the response to taxable income as a whole
(Feldstein 1999) under the notion that this is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency of the tax system.
The availability of administrative micro-data, however, allows for the separation of the behavioral
response into intensive and extensive margins, so that the behavioral impact of taxation on stayers
can be separated from the impact on the decision to move out of a state or region.
      Within the tax-induced mobility literature, several studies examine the issue in an international

  6
    Our calculations bear on revenue implications with regard to the behavior of high-income taxpayers in the sense
of taxpayers who file in the top Proposition 30 tax bracket in three consecutive years; the intensive margin analysis
focuses on this group, and our extensive margin results are driven by these persistently high-earning taxpayers.


                                                         5
context. Agrawal and Foremny (2019) find using administrative Spanish data that conditional on a
decision to move, a one percent increase in the net-of-tax rate for a region relative to others increases
the probability of moving to that region by 1.7 percentage points. Kleven et al. (2014) document
an increased tendency of high earning foreigners to relocate to Denmark when a preferential top
rate is introduced for all workers who have lived outside Denmark for at least three years, with
estimates implying an elasticity of between 1.5 and 2; although Danish expatriates are afforded
this same relocation tax incentive, the authors finds small elasticities for such workers. Focusing on
specialized groups, Kleven, Landais and Saez (2013) find an elasticity of foreign European football
players with respect to the net-of-tax rate of around 1, with domestic players significantly less
sensitive to tax rates in the decision to leave their own country. Similarly, Akcigit, Baslandze
and Stantcheva (2016) study the international mobility of inventors and also finds an elasticity of
around 1 for foreign superstar inventors, but a negligible elasticity for domestic superstar inventors.
   As discussed by Kleven et al. (2019), an emerging theme in the microeconometric literature
on the migration response to taxation is that treatment effects are strikingly heterogeneous, and
may depend on factors such as the size of the tax base, local amenities, and agglomeration effects.
The above studies thus may not be informative for migration dynamics within the U.S. Several
studies that have considered mobility across the U.S. states have resembled Kleven, Landais and
Saez (2013) and Akcigit, Baslandze and Stantcheva (2016) in that they are focused on specialized
groups. For example, Moretti and Wilson (2017) consider evidence from star scientists moving in
response to taxation across state borders and find an elasticity with respect to the personal income
tax of 1.8 and to the corporate income tax of 1.9. Coomes and Hoyt (2008) examine the propensity
of in-movers to a metropolitan area to choose the part of that metropolitan area that is located in
a lower tax state. Work by Feldstein and Wrobel (1998) and Leigh (2008) examines the question of
the incidence of state income taxation, and in particular the mechanism whereby extensive margin
movement could affect the net-of-tax wage, thus considering the somewhat separate question of
whether extensive margin movement reduces the ability of state tax policy to redistribute income.
   More general work on the extensive margin response to tax rates in the U.S. context includes
work on millionaire migration such as Young et al. (2016) who use IRS data and argue that million-
aire migration is a phenomenon of limited economic significance. Young and Varner (2011) consider
micro-data from New Jersey around the imposition of a millionaire and find muted effects. Most
recently, and closest to the part of our study that considers the extensive margin, Varner, Young
and Prohofsky (2018) provide an empirical investigation of high-earner migration in the wake of tax
increases using the same dataset as in our work. They find negligible effects of high-earner taxes on
either the margins of inward or outward migration. We have little to add to their analysis on the
in-migration margin. However, we provide new evidence of substantial high earner out-migration
in response to rising state income taxes.

2.b.       Intensive Margin
Much has been written about the intensive margin response of taxable income to marginal net of tax
rates. The classic study by Feldstein (1995) was the first to use panel data methods in this context,
analyzing the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and finding elasticities from 1 to over 3 across specifications.
Gruber and Saez (2002) use panel data methods in the context of the NBER Continuous Work
History File from 1979-1990. This analysis yields a main estimate of 0.4. Kleven and Schultz (2014)
in an important recent study find elasticities in the 0.2-0.3 range in Danish data. The datasets
used in these papers give rise to the question of whether the studies reflect the responses of high
earners as well as earners in the middle of the distribution. For example, the data used by Gruber
and Saez (2002) contain only 13 observations of taxable income over 1 million dollars. In Kleven
and Schultz (2014), the average taxpayer in this sample earns approximately 250,000 DKK (2013
values) annually, which is $44,642 in 2013 dollars. As of 2018, the cutoff for the top bracket in
Denmark is 542,282, which is $81,537 in 2019 dollars.
    Studies of high earners have been more challenging given the need for strong assumptions when
working with aggregate data, or administrative data paired with appropriate empirical designs.
Saez, Slemrod and Giertz (2012) employ public use data and aggregate methods to find elasticities
for taxable income for the top 1% of U.S. earners with respect to the top marginal rate of between
0.58 and 1.71 between 1960 and 2006, depending on assumptions on time trends in the top 1% share
of income. Using microdata from IRS Statistics of Income containing a substantial share of top
earners, the paper analyzes the 1993 U.S. top rate increase from 31 percent to 36 or 39.6 percent
and finds an elasticity of taxable income with respect to the marginal net of tax rate of 0.5-0.6
using panel data methods. Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva (2014) present a theoretical framework in
which high top marginal rates reduce income by muting the returns to non-productive bargaining
efforts. Using microdata on CEO compensation, they find that the returns to U.S. CEOs from luck
are stronger when top rates are low rather than high. Using a sample of international CEOs, they
report elasticities of CEO pay with respect to top marginal rates of between 1.9 and 2 even after
controlling for firm performance and CEO characteristics.
    A recent literature has analyzed the impact of federal tax reforms from 2012-2013. Saez (2017)
analyzes the intensive margin impact of the 2013 ATRA reform using aggregate data, finding a
substantial time-shifting of income from 2013 into 2012 in response to the policy shift. Kawano,
Weber and Whitten (2016) use federal tax return microdata, restricting the sample to taxpayers
earning from $350,000 to $650,000, comparing taxpayers whose pre-ATRA incomes placed them
just above and below the 2013 federal top rate hikes. They find mostly negligible intensive margin
effects.

3.a.     California Proposition 30
In 2012 California governor Jerry Brown advocated and campaigned for the passage of Proposition
30, the "Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act". This effort was based on a desire to
preserve statewide education funding by instituting new tax increases on California's wealthiest
taxpayers. The Proposition also sought to establish the Education Protection Account (EPA)
within the state's General Fund, an account that would collect any new tax revenues that were
derived from the newly passed ballot measure for the purposes of education spending.
      In total, the Department of Finance believed that the new tax rates would result in an overall
increase in tax revenues of $6 billion annually between the tax years 2012-2013 and 2016-2017 with
smaller amounts in 2011-2012, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 as taxes are phased in and out. Initially
in tax years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, combined tax revenues were estimated to total $8.5 billion.
With this increase in tax revenue, there would be an additional $2.9 billion dollars constitutionally
required by Proposition 98 for the minimum funding of schools and community colleges. The
remaining $5.6 billion dollars in the General Fund would be appropriated for the purpose of closing
the budget gap.7
      The California Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) mentioned the potentiality for a behavioral
response in response to the newly instituted tax rates; however, the LAO never explicitly mentioned
the degree to which (if at all) the possibility of a behavioral response factored into their projections.8
      After the formal passage of Proposition 30, California's upper-income taxpayers saw three newly
established personal income tax rates. The new tax brackets were the following:

     · 10.3 percent tax bracket for single filers' taxable income between $250,001 and $300,000 and
        joint filers' taxable income between $500,001 and $600,000;

     · 11.3 percent tax bracket for single filers' taxable income between $300,001 and $500,000 and
        joint filers' taxable income between $600,001 and $1 million; and

     · 12.3 percent tax bracket for single filers' taxable income above $500,000 and joint filers'
        taxable income above $1 million.

      These tax rates would initially be in effect for seven years (from tax year 2012 through tax year
2018). In addition to the increase in individual tax rates, there would also be an accompanying
one-quarter percent increase in the state's sales tax rate, resulting in a sales tax rate of 7.5 percent
(up from 7.25 percent), not including local sales tax rates which were subject to potential increases

upon the discretion of local governments. When factoring in the state and local sales tax rates in
tandem, the average combined sales tax rate statewide was just above 8 percent.9
      Ultimately, the wealthiest one percent of California taxpayers, individuals making incomes of
more than $533,000, were expected to provide approximately 78.8 percent of the revenues raised by
Proposition 30's tax increases, while California's top five percent of taxpayers, individuals making
incomes of more than $206,000, would contribute 81.2 percent of the revenues raised. The tax
rate would amount to a 1.1 percent increase in income taxes for the top one percent of California
taxpayers and an increase in 0.05 percent for the top five percent of California taxpayers.10


3.b.     2012-13 Federal Tax Changes
Simultaneous to the changes to state level taxes were notable changes to the federal tax system with
the passing of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012. While much of the bill extended
provisions from tax bills of the past, there were nuanced yet significant changes that meaningfully
impacted the wealthiest American taxpayers in particular. In this section we review these changes.
To the extent federal changes affect federal MTR, it will affect relative tax costs of being in one
state versus another.11

3.b.1.     Tax Rates and Brackets

In 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Recon-
ciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). One of the main provisions of the law was to phase-in tax cuts
over the course of five years that would stabilize and become permanent. The rates of 28 percent,
31 percent, 36 percent, and 39.6 percent would eventually be reduced to 25 percent, 28 percent, 33
percent, and 35 percent, respectively, in 2006. However, the bill included a sunset provision that
would ultimately end the tax cuts in 2011.12
      With the passing of ATRA, the first three tax rates (25 percent, 38 percent, and 33 percent)
were permanently extended. Additionally, this remained true for the top bracket of 35 percent, but
only for individuals making less than $400,000, heads of households making less than $425,000, and
couples making less than $450,000. If taxable income exceeded those income levels, the rate would
rise to the original pre-EGTRRA level of 39.6 percent.13 Furthermore, all of the taxable income
thresholds for these tax rates would be indexed for inflation after 2013.
      ATRA also implemented an additional Medicare tax on employees of 0.9 percentage points on
incomes over $200,000 for single taxpayers and incomes over $250,000 for married couples. This is
in addition to the Medicare portion of the FICA tax, which is 1.45% for employers and 1.45% for

     Regarding the intensive margin, our empirical setting compares the evolution of income for California residents
versus propensity score matched non-residents. A key identifying assumption is that the federal tax changes did not
differentially affect California residents vs non-resident control observations.

employees. The total Medicare tax therefore became 3.8%, of which 2.35% is statutorily paid by
the employee. A self-employed individual would pay the entire 3.8%.

3.b.2.    Capital Gains

In 2003, Congress continued to make substantive changes to the U.S. tax system by passing the
Jobs and Growth Relief Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). As a consequence of the bill, realized capital gains
received by individual shareholders saw decreases in tax rates to which they were subject. More
specifically, realized capital gains that were initially subject to a tax rate of 10 percent (in brackets
where the ordinary income tax was higher than 15 percent) and 20 percent (in brackets where
the ordinary income tax was higher than 15 percent) were lowered to 5 percent and 15 percent,
respectively, through 2007 and zero and 15 percent in 2008.14
   ATRA, acting in the same fashion as the bill had done with respect to tax rates, permitted
the original decreases in the capital gains tax rates to remain permanent. However, this would not
be the case for those taxpayers who fell into the reestablished 39.6 percent tax bracket. For those
taxpayers, the tax rate on capital gains reverted to its original, pre-ATRA value of 20 percent.15

3.b.3.    Qualified Dividends

The JGTRRA of 2003 also established new tax rates for qualified dividends. These rates followed
the same 5 percent and 15 percent structure as the capital gains tax rates. However, with the
passage of ATRA, the rates were slightly altered to continue to mirror the new capital gains tax
rate structure (0 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent).16

3.b.4.    Alternative Minimum Tax Provisions

ATRA also provided relief to middle income earners by raising the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
exemption limit from $45,000 for married couples ($33,750 for singles) and certain personal credits
to $78,750 for married couples ($50,600 for singles) For 2013 and onward, the AMT exemption
would be indexed for inflation. However, these changes did not extend to higher income earners.
Under ATRA rules, the AMT imposed a 26 percent tax on taxable income for AMT purposes up
to $175,000. Any amount greater than $175,000 would be subject to a 28 percent rate.17


3.c.     Interaction between State and Federal Taxes
Determining whether confluences of legislative action on state and federal levels would have mitigat-
ing or accelerating effects on migration requires understanding the ways these legislative provisions

interact with one another. As far as ATRA and Proposition 30 are concerned, the newly estab-
lished tax rates and their interaction with the newly instituted "Pease Provision" is perhaps the
most important element.
      As discussed in depth by Saez (2017), ATRA introduced significant changes with respect to
itemized deductions. Through the new provision, the Pease limitation, itemized deductions were
reduced by 3 percent of an individual's AGI when that income exceeded more than $300,000 for
couples ($250,000 for singles and $275,000 for head of household filers) for up to 80 percent of the
itemized deduction. The addition of this provision ostensibly increased the marginal tax rate of
high-income earners by 1.2 percent (3% × 39.6% = 1.2%). However, when factoring in the new
state tax increase on the top marginal tax rate, an individual's marginal net tax rate is effectively
lower as a result. Consider, for example, an individual in the top tax bracket on both the state
and federal level living in California in 2013. This individual's marginal tax rate on the federal
level would be 39.6 percent while on the state level the state rate would be 13.3 percent. The top
marginal tax rate on income at the federal level in 2013 is 39.6%, the taxpayer share of the health
care marginal rate is 2.35%, and the state rate in California is 13.3%. The effective federal marginal
rate is 39.6 × (1 - .133 + .03) = 35.52, where 3% is added back due to the Pease Provision's limits
on itemized deductions.18 Under a no-Proposition 30 counterfactual, the effective federal marginal
rate is 39.6 × (1 - .103 + .03) = 36.71. Thus, under Proposition 30 the marginal net of tax rate is

                                     100 - 35.52 - 13.3 - 2.35 = 48.83

whereas without it would be

                                     100 - 36.71 - 10.3 - 2.35 = 50.64


3.d.     Polling Data and Proposition 30
Starting at the time of the March 2012 request for the ballot title for Proposition 30, there was
a lively public debate regarding the measure. Almost immediately, polls began to gauge public
sentiment regarding the ideas in the proposition. On March 14, the firm Greenberg Quinlan Ros-
ner conducted a poll in which California residents supported the measure by a 64 percent to 33
percent margin. While this margin would wane to some extent in coming months, support for the
proposition prevailed in every poll save for a SurveyUSA poll in October of 2012; this same poll
had 29 percent of its respondents identify themselves as "Undecided," 15 points higher than in any
of the other polls conducted concerning Proposition 30. Furthermore, those in favor of the measure
averaged a +12 point margin over those who opposed when analyzing the results of all of the polls
in the lead up to the vote.19
      At the same time, both proponents and opponents of the measure mobilized state-wide fundrais-
 18

ing efforts. A total of $120,500,000 was donated relating to Proposition 30. Of this total amount,
$67,100,000 (55 percent) of the funds were donated in favor of the measure's passage, compared to
the opposition's $53,400,000 (45 percent).20 The majority of anti-Proposition 30 donations derived
from one donor ­ Charles Munger, Jr. Munger donated $35,075,000, or approximately 66 percent,
of all donations in opposition to the measure. Anti-Proposition 30 donations in general repre-
sented the interests of high earners. In total, the top three donations (outside Munger, $11,000,000
came from Americans for Responsible Leadership and $1,100,000 came from William Oberndorf),
accounted for 88 percent of all donations for the opposition.21
      Donations in favor of the proposition derived from a broad coalition representing decidedly
less moneyed interests. The largest such donation was $11,439,297 from the California Teachers
Association, which amounted to only 17 percent of the total donation pool. The next-largest
donations were $10,746,928 from Service Employees International Union/California State Council
of Service Employees Issues Committee and $5,089,646 from Democratic State Central Committee
of California.22
      Overall, as is clear from the discussion of polling and political donations, Proposition 30 was a
first order issue in both California popular and political circles during much of 2012. It was clear
early on in 2012 that the Proposition had a substantial chance of passage, leading some interests
representing high-earning California residents to take political action against it. In general, this
suggests that even as of early 2012 many in California may have been adjusting their behavior in
anticipation of the passage of Proposition 30.


4.      Data
This paper uses administrative data from the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB). The data
file contains the universe of California tax returns from 2000-2015, although income items are only
complete for 2000-2014.23 These tax returns include both the filings of California residents, non-
residents and partial-year residents. Non-residents and partial-year residents are coded identically
in the data and thus from this point forward will be referred to interchangeably.
      From these returns, we have population-level coverage of certain variables measured from the
California Form 540. Variables for which we have full coverage include Taxable Income and Cali-
fornia AGI, Federal AGI, Capital Gains (we observe the sum of long term and short term capital
gains), Interest, and Dividends.24 Appendix B shows the components of "Total Income," which
is then adjusted to AGI through subtractions. AGI then becomes taxable income by removing
deductions. State and federal quantities differ due to state and federal specific adjustments. For
example, state and local taxes could at the time still be itemized in deductions from federal AGI.

     The file we received also contained some data from 2016 filings, but we determined that the filings were still
incomplete for that tax year.
  24
     Data for Interest and Dividends are missing for 2009, and capital gains data is missing for 2015


                                                        12
      Income variables in the data are measured at the household level, or more precisely the level
of the primary taxpayer in a household. Three filing statuses account for the near-universe of
filings: single, married joint-filers,25 and head of household.26 In the case of married joint-filers,
spousal incomes are aggregated together so that it is not possible to attribute income to one spouse
or another. The FTB designates one spouse the "primary taxpayer" and the other a "redundant
spouse," and the data include identical records for each party reflecting household quantities. All of
our analysis is conducted at the level of a primary taxpayer ­ that is, a household. However, when
appropriate we use the comprehensive panel nature of the data; for instance, when constructing
out-migration variables, a taxpayer who today is a primary taxpayer and tomorrow is a redundant
spouse is not defined as an out-migration event. We observe taxpayer-level demographic information
on marital status, dependents, and for years 2010 and after we observe taxpayer age.
      All dollar amounts are inflation-adjusted to 2015 dollars using inflation factors from the FTB
(see Appendix Table A1 for these inflation factors). Table 1 contains summary statistics for the full
sample, 2000-15. Lastly, to impute marginal tax rates and taxes paid, we follow the literature in
using version 27 of the TAXSIM calculator provided by the NBER. See Feenberg and Coutts (1993)
for a description of TAXSIM. We use taxpayer-level TAXSIM computations only in our assessment
of the average-tax-rate effects of Proposition 30 to inform the extensive margin analysis.
      The TAXSIM calculations were not done using the standard TAXSIM online interface due to
contractual limitations on the use of the data. Instead, we obtained the TAXSIM FORTRAN
archive directly from the NBER and performed computations locally on the FTB data. These
computations at the microdata level are used only in the context of assessing the incentives for
California taxpayers to out-migrate driven by either Proposition 30 or the 2018 Federal TCJA.


5.       Methodology

5.a.      Extensive Margin Responses: Migration
Our ability to detect a larger out-migration effect as compared to the work of Varner, Young and
Prohofsky (2018) owes primarily to our use of a more general definition of out-migration. In the
following we will define this measure and demonstrate its validity and quantitative importance for
high-earners.

5.a.1.      Measuring Out-Migration

To define an out-migration event, Varner, Young and Prohofsky (2018) identify cases in which a
taxpayer in three consecutive years t, t + 1, t + 2 displays the following behavior:

     · Year t: Files as a California Resident


 25
      In nearly all cases it is sub-optimal to file separately when part of a married couple.
 26
      Head of Household is for unmarried taxpayers who manage the upkeep of a home for a qualified set of individuals.


                                                          13
   · Year t + 1: Files as a California Non-Resident or Partial Year Resident

   · Year t + 2: Does not file

      We agree that such behavior patterns constitute migration, and term this phenomenon "full
out-migration" occurring in year t. However, this definition may under-count out-migration in the
following sense. Some California households may have California-based sources of income which
are not easy to immediately relocate. Thus, even if the household for all practical purposes has
relocated to another state, it may still file taxes in California due to these income sources. For
example, a household may own properties other than its residence from which it derives rental
income. Further, it is likely that this scenario is particularly relevant to high-income households.
Thus, we consider the additional channel of migration, in which a taxpayer in three consecutive
years t, t + 1, t + 2 displays the following behavior:

   · Year t: Files as a California Resident

   · Year t + 1: Files as a California Non-Resident or Partial Year Resident

   · Year t + 2: Files as a California Non-Resident or Partial Year Resident

      We refer to this sequence of events as "partial out-migration" occurring in year t. While we
have provided an intuition for this definition, we proceed to validate this definition in the data, as
well as the quantitative relevance of this out-migration margin.
      First, we show that such events fit the intuitive definition of a migration. Figure 2 plots
the cumulative ratio of California AGI27 to Federal AGI amongst all partial out-migrations of
top-bracket taxpayers28 which occur in years 2000-09, and separately for partial out-migrations
occurring in year 2012. We rely on this ratio to measure the fraction of total taxpayer income derived
from California-based sources, because we directly observe both the numerator and denominator in
the data (we do not observe state and federal quantities simultaneously for any other component
of income, such as taxable income). The figure demonstrates that among partial migration events
occurring in 2012, a top-bracket household decreases its California to Federal AGI by 83.6% by
2014. This effect is nearly identical during years 2000-09. Appendix Figure A1a shows that the
dynamics of this ratio are driven by a drop in the level of California AGI, whereas Federal AGI
does not appreciably drop after the partial out migration. Appendix Figure A1b shows the AGI
levels.
      Secondly, we check whether such events are quantitatively important in the data. Appendix
Table A2 shows, over the 2000-09 period, percentage rates of out-migration for various income
bins. This tables makes clear that "full out migration" is the dominant mode of out-migration
for taxpayers in the 9.3% bracket, but that "partial out-migration" is the primary mode of out-
migration observed amongst high-earners.
 27
     California AGI differs from Federal AGI in two ways: (a) it includes only California source income; and (b)
California and Federal law differ slightly in their definitions of AGI.
  28
     "Top-bracket" refers to households which are in the top tax bracket under Proposition 30 policy, based on
inflation-adjusted taxable income


                                                      14
5.a.2.   Out-Migration Regression Specification

We adopt a time-disaggregated differences-in-differences regression specification to evaluate the
impact of Proposition 30 on out-migration. First, we restrict the sample to CA-resident tax returns
from years 2000-2013 which are at the post-reform 9.3% tax bracket. The 9.3% bracket forms the
"control" group. We allow for three "treatment" groups: those in the post-reform 10.3%, 11.3%,
and 12.3% tax brackets. The bracket index b runs through the set b  {9.3%, 10.3%, 11.3%, 12.3%}
in the baseline specification, with alternative specifications including finer cuts of the top income
bracket. The dependent variable 1{Move Out}it indicates that taxpayer i engages in full out-
migration or partial out-migration beginning in year t, as defined above. We also consider each
source of out-migration separately. We use years 2000-10 as the "pre period," and estimate effects
separately for years 2011-13.



   1{Move Out}it = t + Marital Status + 1{t  2010}it ×               b,P re 1{In Bracket b at Year t}it
                                                                 b


                   2013
              +            1{t = x}it ×       b,x 1{In Bracket b at Year x}it +  Xit + it                 (1)
                  x=2011                  b

   All specifications include year and marital-status fixed effects. We run the regressions either
with an empty covariate vector Xit , or allow this vector to include the log of taxable income along
with fixed effects for 100 bins of taxable income. The baseline regression is weighted by taxable
income (inflation adjusted so that weights are consistent across years), so that the coefficients are
interpreted not as the fraction of taxpayers moving out, but the fraction of taxable base moving
out.
   Finally, we stop the sample at the outward migration that occurred in 2014 (2013 resident base
year), as going forward requires certainty that 2016 data are complete. Tax returns from high-
earners take longer to process, and this may bias the sample. Practically this choice does not affect
the estimates because we estimate year-by-year coefficients.

5.a.3.   Incentives to Move

Our methodology aims to estimate the abnormal rate of out-migration in the years surrounding
the passage of Proposition 30 in different categories of taxpayers. A naïve interpretation of our
results would state that they are driven by a three-point hike in the marginal income tax rate of
top bracket taxpayers, or two and one point hikes for lower brackets. Such statements would be
misleading in two ways. First, extensive margin decisions respond to changes in average tax rates
(not marginal rates). Secondly and more importantly, even it were the case that these two rates
were equal ­ as may approximately be the case for very high earners ­ the deductibility of state
taxes paid from federal taxable income leads the effective increase in tax rates due to Proposition
30 to be lower than 3%.


                                                      15
      To illustrate the issue, suppose that marginal rates are equal to average rates and that state
rates are 10.3% and federal rates are 40%. The taxpayer's cumulative tax rate is 10.3% + (1-.103)
× 40% = 46.18%. If state rates are raised to 13.3%, the taxpayer's cumulative rate is 47.98% by
the same logic, which amounts to a net tax increase of 1.8%.
      Complicating matters further, federal rates rose between 2012 and 2013, which would further
mitigate the change in average tax rates for those 2012 California residents contemplating out-
migration. This implies that in the absence of a federal tax increase any out-migration incentives
would in fact have been stronger.
      To precisely understand how Proposition 30 altered incentives to move out of California, we
undertake the following exercise. We fix taxpayer behavior at 2012 levels. We first use TAXSIM to
compute the difference in the average tax rate each taxpayer i would face if she moved to a state
outside California i, relative to California, under 2011 tax policy:29

                                      CA                 S
                                    {T2011 (zi,2012 ) - T2011 (zi,2012 )}i,S =CA

      This quantity represents for each taxpayer the pre-Proposition 30 tax gains to moving out of
California.30 Next, we compute this same quantity for 2012 tax policy:

                                    {T2012 (zi,2012 ) - T2012 (zi,2012 )}i,S =CA

      Federal tax policy did not change substantially from 2011 to 2012.                     On the other hand,
TAXSIM's 2012 policy incorporates Proposition 30 due to its retroactive nature. Thus, this quan-
tity can be interpreted as the post-Proposition 30 tax gains to moving out of California, before the
2012-13 federal tax increase. Finally, we repeat the computation for 2013 tax policy, computing:

                                      CA                 S
                                    {T2013 (zi,2012 ) - T2013 (zi,2012 )}i,S =CA

      This quantity represents for each taxpayer the post-Proposition 30, post 2012-13 federal policy
shift gains to moving out of California.
      To systematically summarize the results of this exercise, we first disaggregate taxpayers i into
groups B based on their 2012 income: those in the 10.3% bracket, the 11.3% bracket, 12.3% bracket
earning under $2 million, $2-$5 million, and over $5 million. For each such group, we report first
how Proposition 30 altered incentives to leave California, averaged over individuals and destination
states:




 29
     To render average tax rates comparable across states, we fix as the denominator 2012 California Taxable Income.
This is not ideal, but is advantageous compared to either using raw amounts of taxes paid (which is difficult to
interpret), state-by-state taxable income (this quantity cannot be computed in zero-tax states like Texas and Nevada),
or a measure of federal taxable income (which will be different under different amounts of state taxes paid).
  30
     We note that this calculation disregards movements out of America, but we will show in the results that this does
not represent a sizeable share of Proposition-30 driven out-migration.

      We report these averages in Table 2 in the "Only Prop 30" column. Note that if T2012 i,2012 ) =

the quantity collapses to T2012  i,2012 ) - T2011 (zi,2012 ). Thus, we do not disaggregate these averages
across destination states, as very few states other than California changed tax policy between 2011
and 2012. These figures show that even for very high earners earning over $5 million dollars in
2015 dollars, the effective increase in average tax rate is closer to 2% than to the top marginal rate
increase of 3%. This is due both to the federal deductibility of state taxes and the discrepancy of
average and marginal tax rates.
      We then account for how this increase in move-out incentives is altered by the concurrent 2012-
13 increase in federal tax rates, which induce variation in cross-state movement incentives due to
the interaction of the federal policy shift with the existing state of tax deductions in non-California
states. That is, we compute disaggregated averages of the form:


               1                      CA                 S                    CA                 S

            iB,S =CA 1       iB,S =CA


      We report such averages in the "Prop 30 + Federal Tax Increase" columns of Table 2. To
provide a broad picture of this heterogeneity, we split the destination states into three groups in
the latter columns of Table 2: (1) zero-tax states, which have zero state income taxes in 2012 and
2013; (2) non-zero tax states which tax income but do not change tax policy between 2012-13; (3)
Iowa, Kansas and Maine are reported separately because these states enacted tax cuts between
2012 and 2013, thus increasing the incentive to move there. Lastly, in the table calculations we
omit Minnesota, which raised the top state income tax rate from 7.85 to 9.85.31 Figure 1 provides
a visualization by state of average rate increases for taxpayers in the $5+ Million income bin.
      The largest change in marginal gains from out-migration in this calculation are realized by
moving to the states that cut taxes. However, outside these cases, we see that empirically the most
additional tax savings over and above pre-existing gaps are realized by relocating to previously low-
tax states such as Texas and Nevada, as opposed to states which previously had non-zero income
taxes. This occurs in the data because of the Pease Provision of ATRA, which as explained above
included a phase-out of itemized deductions.
      It is theoretically ambiguous whether out-migration in response to a California tax increase
should flow more strongly to states with higher marginal increases in tax savings, such as Kansas,
Maine, and Iowa, or whether migration should flow toward the states with all-in highest savings

 31
   Kansas and Maine explicitly cut rates, while Iowa held its rates constant but reduced its definition of taxable
base


                                                          17
in taxes, which are the zero-tax states. The latter behavior would be rationalized in a model in
which taxpayers only value tax savings in location decisions, in which case the salient decision
criterion is the minimum average tax rate obtainable by moving to any state within the U.S. The
former behavior could be rationalized in a model in which taxpayers have very strong idiosyncratic
destination preferences; in an extreme case suppose each taxpayer can only move to one destination
state at random (perhaps due to social networks or an employment situation), in which case the
decision criterion is the minimum average tax rate obtainable by moving to that one state. In this
case and given random preferences, states such as Kansas should see higher out-migration from
California than would a zero-tax state like Texas.
   We note that while all analysis here is framed in terms savings in the average tax realized from
leaving California, it can be considered equivalently as gains in the net of tax rate.
   Logs. Much of the literature on the extensive margin response to taxation uses logs of the
net of tax rate, instead of levels, as the independent variable of interest (i.e. Kleven et al. 2014;
Moretti and Wilson 2017; Agrawal and Foremny 2019). Appendix Table A3 shows the analysis
in terms of logs of the net of tax average rate. Note here that the incorporation of the federal
tax increase from 2012-13 in fact can lead to higher increases in the log net of tax rate benefits
from leaving California. This is because, although the levels difference argument from above carries
through, differences in logs are approximately percent differences. The large federal tax increase
leads all net of tax rates to fall, leading to the magnification of any percent difference. Based on
these calculations, the average incentive to move is approximately equal for states with non-zero
taxes and no tax changes when incorporating the federal tax rise, but it is 38% higher for zero-tax
states with the federal tax change.


5.b.     Intensive Margin Methodology
Our focus with regard to the intensive margin impact of taxation is estimating the effect of the
California tax reform, attempting to difference out behavioral responses to the federal tax reform.
We do this because the federal tax reform affects all U.S. citizens and thus it is difficult to construct
a credible counterfactual group. Existing studies largely attempt to use lower-income groups to
control for the income trends in top-brackets (see Kawano, Weber and Whitten 2016 in the context
of the 2013 federal tax reform). In contrast, our approach is to focus on state tax reforms for which
we have cross sectional variation for taxpayers of comparable earnings status.

5.b.1.    Differences in Differences

To study the causal effect of the California tax reform (and to difference out income re-timing from
2013 into 2012 resulting from the federal tax increase), we use the following empirical strategy.
We define the "treatment group" of taxpayers as those who from 2009 to 2011 filed as California
residents, and further who for each year earned taxable income which placed them in the range of
the top-bracket as newly introduced by California Proposition 30. Finally, we require that each



                                                   18
"treated" taxpayer file as a California resident through 2014. The motivation for defining treatment
status based on a measure of persistent high-earnings is the well-known issue in the literature on
intensive margin responses to taxation that high incomes are strongly mean reverting (see for
example Weber 2014). For example, in our setting of California, incomes may mean revert due to
startup IPOs or other liquidity events.
      To identify the causal response of such taxpayers to California Proposition 30, we need a suitable
counterfactual. Our "control group" is defined as those taxpayers who file non-resident returns in
California in every year from 2009 to 2014, and whose inflation-adjusted California taxable income32
places them in the top California bracket (as introduced under Proposition 30) for 2009-11. Such
taxpayers are not subject to California taxes except for their California source income; Appendix
Table A4 shows that such filers on average have a California AGI to Federal AGI ratio of between
4.8% and 7.5% over the course of the 2009-14 period. On the other hand, California residents are
subject to state income taxation on all income regardless of its geographic source.
      This setup suggests a differences-in-differences strategy. We show the raw plots of this differences-
in-differences for levels and logs of taxable income and AGI in Appendix Figure A9. As is evident
in this figure, and from the tabulation in Table 6, non-resident filers in the control group display
substantially higher earnings than do residents. Thus, covariate imbalance is severe and is a major
endogeneity concern.

5.b.2.     Differences in Differences with Matching

To address this concern, we use as a pre-processing step a simple matching procedure, making
advantageous use of the substantial size of both the California high-income tax filing sample and
of the non-resident filer sample. Our procedure matches with replacement on propensity scores
calculated using a logistic regression on 2009-10 total AGI, taxable income, and capital gains, and
matches with replacement. This approach retaining the full "treatment" group while re-weighting
the "control" group to achieve better covariate balance. The procedure enables us to recover an
average treatment effect on the treated, where the "treated" are persistently high-earning California
residents in our particular fashion.
      We conduct matching in two ways. First, we use the full set of non-resident controls as matching
candidates. Secondly, as a robustness check, we use only taxpayers filing in 2011 from states with
similar state tax rates to California. We define this group of states as Hawaii (11% top rate), Oregon
(9.9% top rate), Minnesota (9.85% top rate), Iowa (8.98% top rate), New Jersey (8.97% top rate),
Vermont (8.95% top rate), District of Columbia (8.95% top rate), and New York (8.82% top rate).
To motivate this robustness check, suppose in the initial procedure we match a California taxpayer
to a Texas resident filing as a California non-resident with the same pre-period income. If the
Texan were transplanted to California, she would presumably earn less given the higher marginal
tax rate in California, which contaminates the matching. That is, we would like to match on pre

 32
   That is, their California taxable income if they were California residents, in which case their entire income base
would be subject to California taxation. This quantity is a variable in our dataset.


                                                         19
period incomes under identical tax regimes. Using states with high tax rates in the pre-period
helps alleviate this concern, and yields more conservative estimates that we rely on in our elasticity
calculations.
      After matching, we apply a year by year differences-in-differences estimation to adjust for any
remaining differences in covariate balance across the matched treatment and control groups. As
discussed in Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), while the unconfoundedness assumption justifying the
matching procedure cannot be directly tested, its plausibility can be assessed through placebo-style
tests. In our setting, while 2009-2011 covariates are predetermined from the viewpoint of the tax
policy treatment, we only match on 2009-10 covariates. This allows us to examine outcomes in 2011
as a placebo-style test. If unconfoundedness were true, we would not expect the matched control and
treatment groups to display systematic differences in 2011. As such, in our differences-in-differences
regression we take the pre-period as 2009-10, and estimate "treatment effects" separately for 2011-
2014. If unconfoundedness holds, we do not expect to see a positive and statistically significant
coefficient for 2011. The estimating equation is as follows.


                                           2014
        zit = i + t + Marital Status +            1{t = x}it × 1{California Resident}it × t + it          (2)
                                         x=2011

      where 2011 is akin to a placebo test and t for t  {2012, 2013, 2014} are the coefficients of
interest.
      As an alternative specification, we also estimate a dynamic event study regression Borusyak and
Jaravel (2016), de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2018). We use 2011 as the "reference period"
(i.e. pre period). This enables us to leave 2009 and 2010 to estimate "treatment effects" in the pre
period to test for parallel trends. Specifically the dynamic event study estimation equation is:



zit = i +t +Marital Status +                                 1{t = x}it × 1{California Resident}it × t +it
                               x{2009,2010,2012,2013,2014}
                                                                                                          (3)
      Building on this specification, we implement the "honest approach to parallel trends" approach
of Rambachan and Roth (2019). We estimate fixed length confidence intervals (FLCIs) under the
single-parameter (M ) approach. M is the single-parameter that determines the degree of possible
nonlinearity of parallel trends, serving as an upper bound to the extent to which differential trends
can change within periods. We implement this method using the publicly available HonestDiD R
package.
      Regression specification and income re-timing. Our estimating equation differs from
the classical equation in the literature estimating intensive margin responses to tax policy using
microdata, which runs the year-on-year log difference in income variables on the left hand side.33

 33
    See Gruber and Saez (2002) for a classic treatment, and Kawano, Weber and Whitten (2016) in the context of
the 2013 federal tax change.


                                                      20
We use this specification because it enables a cleaner treatment of federal income re-timing than
the classic approach.
     To see this, consider the following framework. Suppose that observed income in year t for
taxpayer i is zit (Wit ) where Wit the treatment is binary: 0 corresponds to tax policy prior to the
reform, while 1 corresponds to the post reform tax policy. That is, we observe zit (0) in the absence
of Proposition 30, and zit (1) under Proposition 30. This potential outcomes formalism encapsulates
all behavioral responses (including "non-real" responses such as tax base shifting) except for income
re-timing responses. For such responses, let Fi > 0 denotes income shifted from 2013 into 2012
in response to the federal tax reform. Explicitly, in the absence of Proposition 30 the observed
sequence of incomes for taxpayer i is

                     {zi,2009 (0), zi,2010 (0), zi,2011 (0), zi,2012 (0), zi,2013 (0), zi,2014 (0)}

     In reality we observe the following sequence:

               {zi,2009 (0), zi,2010 (0), zi,2011 (0), zi,2012 (0) + Fi , zi,2013 (1) - Fi , zi,2014 (1)}

     Given this setup, any log-difference variables involving 2012 or 2013 are all mis-measured due
to front loading. We note that the year on year difference 2012-13 double-counts the front-loading
quantity, and any longer difference involving 2012 or 13 (such as a 2011-13 difference) will still be
contaminated by the income re-timing.
     Front loading of this type is empirically relevant. For example, Saez (2017) uses aggregate
public-use data to infer substantial front loading from 2013 into 2012 in response to the federal tax
reform. We corroborate this in our data.
     Appendix Figure A2 shows the forward log change in taxable income for each of 2000 taxable
income buckets for each tax year over 2009-2014. The change for 2012 to 2013 is very pronounced
at the very top of the income distribution. However, Appendix Figure A3 shows again that this
apparent "effect" disappears when averaging across 2-year periods.
     Working in levels instead of differences allows a year-by-year comparison of income levels and
avoids the problems in interpretation created by using log differences in the presence of front
loading. We also note that any 2012 treatment effects we estimate in the context of the California
Proposition 30 treatment effect do not have a re-timing interpretation because the California policy
was retroactive to 2012. We do not expect a 2011 front loading response as Proposition 30 was not
widely expected or discussed as of 2011.


6.     Extensive Margin Response
Figure 3 shows the main graphical results on out-migration, with the years in the x-axis representing
the base year and the departure is evidenced in both of the following years, either as move to non-
resident status for both years or a move to non-resident and then to non-filer. That is, the value


                                                          21
corresponding to the 2012 point on the x-axis is the hazard rate based on 2013 and 2014 for
taxpayers who were still California residents in 2012.
      The top two graphs show taxable-income weighted out-migration probabilities by year and tax
bracket for taxpayers who filed as California residents in year t, disaggregated across the two ways
that taxpayers leave the state: (i) resident to non-resident to non-resident; and (ii) resident to
non-resident to non-filer. The bottom panel shows the combined effect of both types of departure.
In order to examine how the departure rates vary at different points of the income distribution for
high earners, we decompose the 12.3% bracket into three subgroups: 12.3% under $2 million, $2-$5
million, and greater than $5 million.34
      The top graph shows a sharp uptick in taxpayers who earned $5 million or more in 2012 leaving
the state after 2012 for multiple years of non-resident tax filings, from a rate of around 1.2% in
the prior years to over 1.6% in the year 2012 to 2013. Taxpayers earning between $2 million and
$5 million display a similarly large effect. Figure 3 corroborates the aggregated statistics from
Appendix Table A2 in demonstrating that this tax structure of departure is substantially more
common for this group than moving from resident to non-resident to non-filer, presumably given
the fact that most very high earners have some remaining California source income and then would
have to file a California tax return even as a non-resident for several years after departure. As
discussed in Section 5.a.1, this mode of migration leads to an outflow of 83.6% of taxable base
within two years. The middle graph shows an increase in full out migration as well, although
smaller. Overall, the bottom graph shows that when the departure structures are combined, there
is a clear increase from a 1.5% departure rate after the 2011 tax year to a 2.125% departure rate
after the 2012 tax year for taxpayers with more than $5 million in taxable income. Similar patterns
are seen in the $2-$5 million range of broadly comparable magnitude. We note that there is no
evidence of pre-trends in the departure rates for the taxpayers in the highest income categories.
      Table 3 provides regression estimates of the magnitude of the out-migration effect, showing
estimates of the baseline equation 1. The estimates from column (1) show that, relative to the
2000-10 period, we cannot detect statistically or economically significant deviations in the rate of
migration in 2011-12 for the newly introduced top bracket, but from 2012-13 California loses 0.8%
of the taxable base in this income range. Column (2) demonstrates that the inclusion of log income
and fixed effects for 100 income percentiles as income controls does not diminish these results. The
remaining columns of the table decompose mover types into those who file the next two years as
non-resident versus those who file for one year as a non-resident and then do not file. More than
half of the effect (0.5% of the 0.8%) is concentrated in taxpayers moving from resident status into
persistent non-resident filing.
      Table 4 shows unweighted estimates with more granular income bins, showing that the out-
migration effect is indeed concentrated in higher-earning taxpayers. This table directly mirrors
the graphs in Figure 3. Investigating treatment heterogeneity in Appendix Table A5, we find

 34
     The tax brackets or taxable income bins are assigned based on 2012 rules and income, with income indexed to
inflation to lead and lagged years use California FTB inflation factors.


                                                      22
some evidence that 2012 treatment effects may be up to twice as large for single households as for
married households, perhaps indicative of the greater ease with which a single-individual can make
a decision to move states. Appendix Figures A4 and A5 show heterogeneity by wage share and age
respectively.
   Based on the differences reported in Table 2 between the increases in average tax rates based
on Proposition 30 alone versus based on Proposition 30 plus federal variation relative to other
states, we estimate that the treatment on California households' relative average tax rates would
have been 23-40% higher without the federal reform. In the absence of the ATRA, and assuming
taxpayers understood the actual net change in incentives due to both state and federal variation,
this analysis suggests that the hazard rates of departure would have been larger.


6.a.   Transitory vs. Persistent High Earners
It is well known that high incomes are strongly mean reverting, and this issue has been the subject
of much research for example in the literature on the intensive margin response to taxation (see
Weber 2014 for a recent discussion). Further, the tax revenue implications of transitorily high-
earners leaving California are less problematic than the out-migration of persistent high earners. It
turns out that out-migration in response to Proposition 30 is driven by persistently high earners.
   To see this, in Table 5 we replicate the baseline analysis in Table 3, but add one extra taxpayer
group: those whose taxable income places them in the Proposition 30 top bracket not only in year
t, but also in t - 1 and t - 2. We restrict the sample to years 2002 and after to accommodate the
definition of this group. The first two columns confirm that the out-migration effect holds when
dropping the early years of the table; columns (3) and (4) show that taxpayers persistently filing
in the top bracket fully subsume the out-migration effect from 2012-13. Figure 4 shows the year to
year movements trends for such taxpayers in isolation (Appendix Figure A6 shows this series along
with other income bins). Notably, this series is far more stable than the relatively noisy top-earner
migration rates shown in Figure 3, suggesting that noisy year to year migration rates are due to
the behavior of transitory high earners.


6.b.   Mover Origins and Destinations
Figure 5 disaggregates the out-migration effect across the six largest MSAs in California by total
taxable income. California resident locations in year t are measured as of year t - 1, as if year t is
a taxpayer's last year filing as a resident, by the time of filing taxes the taxpayer is often already
located in a different state. The figure shows that the out migration effect appears to be primarily
driven by the Los Angeles - Long Beach and San Diego metropolitan areas. Appendix Table A6
shows accompanying regression estimates confirming this graphical intuition.
   Figure 6 disaggregates the out-migration effect across mover destinations, by state of residence
as measured in the year t + 1 for taxpayers filing in year t as California residents and moving
immediately thereafter. The figure shows that the out migration effect is strongest in the direction



                                                 23
of states with zero state taxes. This is consistent with the strong salience of tax considerations in
relocation decisions. Appendix Table A7 contains the accompanying regression estimates, which
            2
show that   3   of the out-migration in the $2-5 income range is directed toward states with zero state
                    5
income tax, and     7   of the effect is directed toward such states amongst those earning more than 5
million in taxable income. Appendix Figure A7 shows in a map the destination states of households
that move out of California, both prior to Proposition 30 in 2000-09 and from 2012-13.


6.c.   In-Migration
Appendix Figure A8 shows the in-migration share of the specific income brackets from 9.3% to
11.3% and then for the three sub-brackets of the 12.3% bracket. Overall, the higher the income
bracket the smaller the share of a given tax bracket category that is accounted for by inward
migration. We do not observe any strong effects of tax policy on the differential trends of inward
migration across tax brackets.


6.d.   Elasticity Calculations
As highlighted by Kleven et al. (2019), the elasticity of mobility with respect to tax policy may
vary substantially depending on the specific context. However, for completeness we present here
a calculation of the elasticity of out-migration to zero-tax states with respect to the difference in
average tax rates between such states and California.
   Focusing only on moves to zero-tax states, Appendix Table A7 shows that the treatment effects
are 0.4% for the 2-5 million bin, and 0.5% for the 5+ million bin. Appendix Table A8 reports that
the baseline rates of migration from California to these zero-tax states are 0.394% and 0.428%,
respectively. These figures supply the necessary ingredients for the numerator of the elasticity. To
evaluate the denominator, the disparity in average tax rate from California to the zero tax states
was 6.56% in 2011 and 8.22% in 2013 for taxpayers earning $2-$5 million in 2012, and similarly
6.78% in 2011 and 8.65% in 2013 for those earning over $5 Million (see Section 5.a.3 for a discussion
of how these figures are computed).
   For taxpayers earning $2-5 million, the elasticity is
                                                 0.4
                                                0.394
                                              8.22          = 4.01
                                              6.56 -    1

   For taxpayers earning over $5 million, the elasticity is
                                                 0.5
                                                0.428
                                              8.22          = 4.61
                                              6.56 -    1

   Log of Net of Tax Rate. Using the log specification of Moretti and Wilson (2017) along with
the log net of tax rate differences computed in Appendix Table A3, we compute the elasticity of




                                                        24
migration with respect to the log net of tax rate as for the $2-$5 million bracket:
                                     .004+0.00394              0.00394
                            log( 1-0(0 .004+0.00394) ) - log( 1-0.00394 )
                                                                            = 15.66
                                              0.0450

     where 0.0450 is the increase in the average tax rate difference between California and the zero
tax states for those earning $2-$5 million. For the $5+ million category:
                                     .005+0.00428              0.00428
                            log( 1-0(0 .005+0.00428) ) - log( 1-0.00428 )
                                                                            = 15.45
                                              0.0504

     where 0.0504 is the increase in the average tax rate difference between California and the zero
tax states for those earning $2-$5 million.
     These magnitudes are far higher than those documented in Moretti and Wilson (2017), which
are around 2. However, we again emphasize that our elasticity calculations should be interpreted
with substantial caution; they are likely to over-state magnitudes relative to other papers because
the out-migration effect we find is a one-time movement; out migration in our context reverts to
pre-Proposition 30 levels after 2012-13, while for example Moretti and Wilson (2017)'s analysis
finds a hazard rate of migration which increases with time.


7.     Intensive Margin Response

7.a.    Covariate Balance After Matching
Table 6 shows summary statistics for covariate balance in the year 2011 across the treatment group
(that is, taxpayers filing as California residents from 2009-14 who file in the top Proposition 30
bracket in 2009-11), raw control group (taxpayers filing as California non-residents from 2009-14
who would file in the top Proposition 30 bracket in 2009-11 if all of their income were California
sourced), and the two matched samples (first using the full control set as matching candidates, and
secondly using only control observations filing from states with similar tax rates to California). We
note that the matching procedure uses only the average levels of taxable income, AGI, and capital
gains across 2009-10 to estimate the propensity score, so that 2011 balance is not baked into the
procedure. Matching achieves reasonable balance across the 2011 income variables, and further
also in demographics.


7.b.    Estimates Relative to Matched Sample of Nonresidents
Figure 7 shows annual group averages for both logs and levels of AGI and Taxable Income. The
matching procedure only matches on average levels of income across 2009-2010. Therefore, neither
parallel trends in 2009-2010 and nor their continuation in 2011 is an artifact of our matching
procedure. Visually, we observe parallel trends between resident and non-resident groups both in
levels and logs from 2009-11.


                                                      25
   Table 7 shows the accompanying difference in difference regression estimates, corresponding to
equation 2. The first row of the table shows that we do not estimate statistically or economically
significant placebo treatment effects in 2011, which corroborates the graphical analysis. Across
specifications, we estimate economically and statistically significant treatment effects of Proposition
30 in years 2012-14. The average high earning California resident reports 0.134 log points less in
taxable income in 2012 due to Proposition 30, 0.174 log points in 2013, and 0.282 log points in
2014. In levels, we find that residents on average reported $0.522 million less in 2012 income, $0.357
million less in 2013 income, and $0.599 million less in 2014 income. The appearance of an intensive
margin response in 2012 is consistent with the fact that Proposition 30 was retroactive to 2012,
and as discussed in Section 3 was known to have a substantial chance of passage and in general
was a salient issue in policy circles during the bulk of 2012.
   Using as a baseline the 2011 average taxable income of $4.15 million among residents, the
levels magnitudes are smaller than the log estimates in each year. That is, the average percentage
treatment effect is larger than the cumulative percentage response. This outcome could be generated
by the presence of a few taxpayers experiencing high income growth while the majority of others
see a decline, a plausible scenario given our setting in California.
   While we view the lack of a significant 2011 coefficient as evidence against deviation from parallel
trends that could drive spurious results, we conduct two further tests to address the possibility of
deviation from parallel trends. First, in Appendix Table A12, we present the results of the dynamic
event study specification shown in equation 3. In this specification, the omitted year is the year
before the treatment, and the test for deviation from parallel trends is the extent to which the
pre-period would show opposite signed and significant coefficients. While there is one specification
in which there is a small and statistically significant positive coefficient in 2009, we generally do not
see significant evidence of deviation from parallel trends that could possibly drive the main results.
   Second, Table 7 also shows several statistics that emerge from robustness tests for possible
parallel trend violations, following Rambachan and Roth (2019). The statistic Threshold M is
defined as the highest value of M in the procedure of Rambachan and Roth (2019) for which the
entire 95% confidence interval for the 2012 treatment lies below zero. The fact that M >0 in columns
(1)-(3) implies robustness to any data-implied linear deviation from parallel trends suggested in
the through the Rambachan and Roth (2019) procedure, and the results are further robust even
to some degree of nonlinear deviation from parallel trends. For column (4), while the specification
would not be robust to deviation from parallel trends as estimated under this procedure, the 95%
confidence interval for the 2012 treatment when M =0 (allowing for data-implied linear deviation
from parallel trends) is [-0.399,0.037].
   Table 8 examines the contribution of investment income to the main estimates. In the data,
we are able to consistently observe dividends and interest for the full sample of taxpayers from
2010 through 2013 (in other years these variables are missing for at least 90% of our sample).
Thus, in this specification we restrict to years 2010-13, using the year 2010 as the only pre period.
We further restrict to regressions in levels (not logs), because this provides a natural setting for a


                                                   26
decomposition as logs do admit additive decompositions.
   In columns (1) and (2) we first confirm that the results from the main estimates carry through
with this altered sample; they are smaller in magnitude, but still economically and statistically
significant. Furthermore, the specifications for levels of taxable income and Federal AGI are both
robust to the Rambachan and Roth (2019) procedure to account for some degree of nonlinearity in
parallel trends as well as any data-implied deviation from parallel trends.
   We next define "Deductions" as the difference between Federal AGI and taxable income. Con-
sistent with the first two columns, we see that around half of the effect is due to the difference
between these two quantities. We note that taxable income here for non-residents is defined as
taxable income of the taxpayer if they were a California resident and their full income were subject
to California state taxation. That is, the difference is reflective of actual differences between AGI
and taxable income holding tax rules constant, hence justifying our labeling of this quantity as
deductions.
   Columns (4) and (5) show that the estimated treatment effects persist when subtracting out
investment income, and if anything appear larger. Columns (6) through (8) show that we are
unable to conclude that Proposition 30 has statistically significant impacts on investment income.
   The first row of this table confirms the lack of significant departures between treatment and con-
trol groups in 2011 in any of the income categories. Appendix Figure A10 shows the accompanying
difference in difference graphs.


7.c.   Tax-Similar States Control Group
Figure 8 shows annual group averages for both logs and levels of AGI and Taxable Income, in a
specification where only tax-similar states are used for the matching. Once again, the matching
procedure only matches on average levels of income across 2009-2010. Therefore, neither parallel
trends in 2009-2010 and nor their continuation in 2011 is an artifact of our matching procedure.
   Table 9 shows the accompanying regression estimates. For taxable income, in logs the treatment
effects here appears somewhat larger, while in levels the treatment effects appear smaller. For
AGI, the estimates appear to be similar or slightly smaller. Either way, this provides a useful
robustness check to the main estimates which more closely approximates the ideal of matching
income variables in the pre-period under identical tax regimes. To provide conservative estimates,
we base our headline elasticity calculations on the taxable income levels of this tax-similar state
control group.


7.d.   Elasticity Calculations
As discussed in Section 3.c, under Proposition 30 the top marginal net of tax rate for California
residents is 48.83 whereas without it would be 50.64. The log difference between these is 3.63%;
this quantity is the denominator in the elasticity calculation.
   To compute the numerator ­ that is, the change in taxable income ­ we rely on the main



                                                 27
estimates for the treatment effect of Proposition 30 on the level of taxable income in 2013 relative
to controls in tax-similar states, found in Table 9 column 2. We choose to use the estimate in
levels rather than logs because the concavity of the log function shifts the focus away from large
level movements. While helpful in some circumstances, this property in our setting may not be
desirable. For example, suppose that there are 100 taxpayers for whom the marginal tax rate
is raised from 10.3% to 13.3% at any level of income. Of these, there are 99 taxpayers each of
whom in the absence of the tax reform would earn $100, and each of these taxpayers display
earnings under the tax reform of $95. The last taxpayer earns $1000 and does not respond to the
                                                           99
treatment. The average treatment effect in logs is         100 [log(95)   - log(100)]   -0.05, whereas the
                                        99
average treatment effect in levels is   100   × -5 = -4.95. Using these treatment effect estimates, the
revenue consequences using the log version would imply far more serious revenue consequences than
would the levels version. This is because the log result focuses on the average percentage effect,
which in this scenario is concentrated in lower-level incomes which are less relevant to revenue
considerations than the behavior of the single taxpayer earning $1000. This example is obviously
highly stylized and unrealistic, but displays the intuition that levels are perhaps a more natural
specification for studying the revenue consequences of taxing high-earners. Further, it turns out
that in our specifications the levels estimates are more conservative than log estimates, so in a
practical sense this procedure gives conservative estimates.
     Using a $4.15 million baseline value for taxable income, the 2013 treatment effect of $0.373
million dollars for tax similar states is 8.99% of the mean value, and the 2014 treatment effect is
$0.481 of the mean value. With the denominator of 3.63%, this yields a rough elasticity of income
with respect to the marginal net of tax rate in the range of 2.5-3.2. This is a large estimate relative
to the classic public finance literature. We emphasize that the estimate is for California residents
on average earning over $4 million dollars in taxable income annually, although also that according
to the latest FTB statistics approximately 40% of the individual income tax in California is paid
by those with taxable income of over $1 million.


8.     Policy Implications

8.a.    California Tax Revenue
We use the estimates from our intensive margin estimation exercise to perform a back of the
envelope calculation, aimed at quantifying the fraction of windfall revenue accruing to the state of
California from the Prop 30 policy shift which was lost to behavioral responses.
     Intensive Margin. The matching and differences in differences methodology above yields
yearly estimates of average treatment effects in levels among repeated top-bracket California tax-
payers for each of 2012, 2013, and 2014. We re-estimate these treatment effects separately within
marital status cells using a disaggregated version of our main specification, since tax bracket cutoffs




                                                      28
vary across such cells.35 For each marital status by year cell, we define a representative taxpayer as
the mean taxable income in each cell, assuming all income is in wages and no itemized deductions
outside the state tax deduction. For each such earnings profile, we first compute the revenue gains
to California from Proposition 30's tax increases assuming no behavioral change. We then use
the econometric estimates to compute the revenue gains from Prop 30 under observed behavioral
changes. Aggregating up across marital status cells using population ratios allows us to compute
the percentage of windfall revenue gains dissipated by behavioral responses on the intensive margin.
      Using this procedure, the levels results imply that 46.6% of windfall revenue gains are dissipated
by intensive-margin behavioral response in 2012 among the group of California resident taxpayers
analyzed. The intensive margin response dissipates 40.9% of such gains in 2013, and 56.7% in 2014.
      To illustrate, consider married California residents, who in every year from 2012-14 comprise
approximately 67% of the sample.36 To illustrate the calculation consider the case of married
California residents in 2013 (and note all calculations use 2015 dollar values). For this subset, the
mean observed income is $4,459,590. To compute the revenue gains to the state of California from
Proposition 30 under this observed behavior, we calculate that this representative taxpayer pays
an additional amount of

                     (631, 732 - 526, 444)  .01 + (1, 052, 886 - 631, 732)  .02 = $9, 476

over the 10.3% and 11.3% brackets. The taxpayer then has $3,406,704 of income in the top bracket,
on which California earns an additional 3%, leading to a revenue gain of $102,201. In total, the
revenue gain the state has over and above what it would have had under the old tax code at the
same level of income is therefore $102,210 + $9,476 = $111,677.
      For these calculations, we estimate treatment effects specific to marital filing status. The
married-specific treatment effect estimate is $298,000 as shown in Table A10. Since in this example
we are considering the case of reported 2013 income, the income is already net of this behavioral
response. Continuing to use the married-specific treatment for the sake of example, while the state
has gained $111,677 relative to what it would have received at the same income level under the old
tax code, it has also lost $298, 000 × .103 due to behavioral responses or $30,964, as in the absence
of the tax this amount would have been earned and taxed at the pre-reform top rate of 10.3%. This
leads to revenue gain of $111,677-$30, 694 = $80, 983, net of the behavioral response.
      Now suppose there were no behavioral response. The additional revenue from inframarginal
tax brackets does not change. However, the taxpayer has $3,406,704 + $298,000 of income in the
top bracket, on which California earns an additional 3%, leading to a revenue gain of $120,617.
This implies that among married couples, the intensive margin behavioral response dissipates 1 -
$80,983
$120,617   = 0.328 of windfall revenue gains from taxation. This is aggregated with single and head
of household figures through a weighted average (using the weights 0.67, 0.29, and 0.04) leading to
the aggregate figure 40.9% (the treatment effect point estimates in 2013 are larger for singles and
 35
      Appendix Tables A9, A10, and A11 contain the marital status specific estimates used for this procedure.
 36
      Single filers account for 29%, and head of household filers make up the remaining 4%.


                                                         29
heads of household, see Appendix Tables A9 and A11).
      Extensive Margin. To understand the impact together of the extensive and intensive margin
estimates, we rely on the estimates in Table 5 which demonstrate that the out-migration effect is
concentrated among taxpayers who have filed in the top California bracket three years in a row.
In this manner we aim to arrive at an estimate which will inform the revenue implications of our
behavioral estimates with regard to this particular class of high-earning taxpayers.
      To incorporate this margin, we use the estimate that there was 0.9 percentage point increase
in the hazard rate of out-migration for taxpayers who had filed in the top California bracket three
years in a row. Assuming that the representative taxpayer in this group earned $4.15 million,37
they were paying $515,135 in taxes to California.38 Including this additional margin, the state loses
45.2% of its windfall gains in 2013, so that the extensive margin accounts for 9.5% of the behavioral
response impact on tax revenues in the year 2013. A similar calculation for 2014 yields an effect of
60.9%.
      State Tax Deductibility and Revenue Impact Magnitudes. We note that in light of
the very large intensive margin elasticity estimate, the revenue impact calculated above may seem
smaller than reasonably expected. This is an artifact of the deductibility of state and local taxes
during our sample period: whereas California raised top rates by 3% and state tax revenues reflect
this fully, the state tax increase implicitly lowers the federal tax increase so that the effective
top rate increases less than 3%. In particular, with a 39.6% top rate, a 3% state tax increase is
accompanied by a 39.6% × .03 = 1.188% drop in the federal tax rate, so that the effective top rate
increase is 1.812%.


8.b.     2018 Federal Tax Reform
In 2018, Congress passed the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (TCJA). Under this law, the top rate is
37% for single and head-of-household filers earning over $500,000, and for married filers earning
over $600,000. Despite this nominal cut to top rates, the legislation on net increased rates on top
earners because it capped state and local deductions at $10,000 total.39
      Intensive Margin. First we use our top line intensive margin elasticity estimate to provide
a ballpark quantification of the federal tax revenue implications of TCJA for the particular set
of California high earners in our treatment group. As we showed in 3.c, incorporating the SALT
deduction and the Pease Provision, the net-of-tax rate for a California high earner in 2017 in the
13.3% bracket was 100 - (39.6*(1-0.133+0.03) + 13.3 + 2.35) = 48.83. In 2018, with the capping
of the SALT deduction, the net-of-tax rate for the same high earner is simply 100 - (37 + 13.3
+ 2.35) = 47.35. Using the elasticity estimate of 2.8, we compute that top-earner incomes for

 37
     This uses the average taxable income for 2011, which is more conservative than using the average from 2012 which
is distorted by income shifting from 2013
  38
     This quantity is computed using TAXSIM assuming a married taxpayer earning all wage income, and that 83.6%
of the taxable base moves out of California, which is conservative as some high earners do fully migrate out.
  39
     The "Pease provision" was repealed by TCJA until 2025 under this legislation. The Pease Provision had reduced
the marginal rate gains to itemized deductions by 3%.


                                                         30
the particular group of high-income California residents in our sample would change by 2.8 ×
(log(47.35) - log(48.83)) = -0.086 log points.
      Consider a married California taxpayer earning $4.15 million of wage income. In 2017, this
taxpayer pays a federal tax bill of $1,431,305. In 2018, incorporating the 8.6% income decrease,
this taxpayer pays a federal tax bill of $1,333,946. This amounts to a 6.8% decrease in tax revenue,
putting the TCJA on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve for high-earning individuals in California.
This calculation should be interpreted with caution, since our estimates are interpreted as an
average treatment effect specific to our particular group of California high-earners (that is, those
filing in the top California tax bracket three years in a row). Further, the literature such as Gruber
and Saez (2002) has found that taxpayer intensive margin decisions are more sensitive to state than
to federal tax policy changes.
      Extensive Margin. The TCJA led to changes in average tax rate differences between states
as a result of the SALT deduction cap. In Appendix Figure A13, we repeat the computations from
Table 2 to assess how the 2018 CA-other state gap in average taxes paid grew over and above
the 2017 CA-other state gap. The gap is reported only for the case of zero income tax states.
The zero-tax states in this period are the same as in the prior exercise, with the exception of
Wyoming which changed policy between 2017-18.40 Taxpayer behavior is still fixed at year 2012
levels suitably inflation-indexed. While we would ideally use year 2017 data, we do not have access
to these data. We simply carry through 2012 behavior for parsimony and ease of comparison with
our other calculations.
      Comparing Table 2 to Table A13 reveals that the TCJA increased incentives (in terms of the
level of the average tax rate gap) to leave California for zero-tax states by 2.15 times the amount
of Proposition 30 for those earning over $5 million, and by a factor of 2.43 for those earning from
$2-5 million. Based on these scaling factors, we would predict an out-migration effect of 1.46% of
those earning $2-5 million, and 1.51% of those earning $5 million.


9.       Conclusion
The issue of behavioral responses to income taxation is an important question in academic and
policy circles. Prior research has made important progress in this area, but substantial controversy
remains. In this paper we draw on rich microdata on the universe of tax returns from the California
FTB to provide two new data points to inform this debate with a particular focus on the income
taxation of high earners.
      First, we document a substantial one-time out-migration response to increased state tax rates.
Relative to the pre-period 2000-10, the taxable income weighted rate of departures amongst top-
bracket taxpayers was abnormally high by 0.8% in 2012-13. Consistent with the theoretical pre-
diction that migration decisions respond to average tax rates, this migration effect increases with
income and is concentrated among taxpayers earning over $2 million dollars.

 40
      This group is as follows: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, Texas, South Dakota, and Washington.


                                                         31
   Second, we provide a simple, transparent framework to study the intensive margin response to
Proposition 30's increased marginal tax rates for taxpayers who do not respond on the extensive
margin. We use a differences-in-differences design which compares upper-income California resident
taxpayers to a matched sample of non-resident California filers who are not subject to Proposition
30's higher tax rates (except through the small share of their income filed in California). Our design
focuses on California taxpayers who are likely to earn top-bracket incomes in the absence of Propo-
sition 30, defined as those who file in the new Proposition 30 top-bracket in each of the years 2009,
2010, and 2011. To increase covariate balance between the treatment and control groups, we apply
a propensity score matching method which matches only on 2009-10 covariates. This procedure
leaves the equality of covariate values in 2011 as a testable implication of the unconfoundedness
assumption, which we cannot reject. This increases our confidence in the empirical design.
   Our intensive margin estimates show a substantial intensive margin response to Proposition 30,
which appears in 2012 and persists through the last year of our analysis in 2014. We find that this
intensive margin response is concentrated in non-investment income. Using the more conservative
levels result from 2013 compared to the similar-states sample, the estimates imply an elasticity of
taxable income with respect to the marginal net of tax rate of 2.5 to 3.2.
   Overall, we find strong behavioral responses to income taxation amongst high earners. Despite
this, we are unable to provide convincing evidence as to the normative implications of the results.
On the one hand, decreased high-earner income in response to taxation could reflect the distortion
of productive activity among those residents whom California's most innovative residents. This
could encompass the classic labor supply channel or other channels such as idea generation and
innovation, as in Jones (2019). On the other hand, our results may also be driven by higher taxes
reducing the incentive to engage in wasteful rent-seeking activities, such as wage negotiations by
CEOs (as in Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva 2014). While we are able to perform simple calculations
to inform the revenue consequences of our estimates, the broad policy and welfare implications of
our work depend on these unanswered questions. We view this as an important avenue for future
research.

See Section 5.a.3 for a full discussion of this figure. This map shows the Proposition 30-driven incremental savings
in average taxes paid from moving out of California from years 2012-13. Note: Kansas is omitted as it dropped rates
substantially from 2012-13, leading to large value (around 3) which would obscure the variation in other values.

The sample is all taxpayers who displayed a Resident - Non resident - Non resident transition, where in the "Resident"
year the taxpayer was in the top tax bracket according to 2012 tax policy.

This figure decomposes out-migration across the 6 largest MSAs in California, by total tax base as of 2010; these
MSAs account for 73.5% of Taxable Income in 2010. LA is Los Angeles-Long Beach (Los Angeles County), SF is San
Francisco (Marin County, San Francisco County, and San Mateo County), OC is Orange County (Orange County),
OAK is Oakland (Alameda County and Contra Costa County), SJ is San Jose (Santa Clara County), SD is San Diego
(San Diego County). MSA classifications are based on a 2005 crosswalk accessible through the NBER website41 and
a zip code to county crosswalk is accessible through the Census.42

Mover destinations are measured as of year t + 1 for a move beginning in year t for a year t California resident. "Zero"
denotes states with a zero state tax, which is Wyoming, Washington, Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, Florida, and
Alaska. "East" denotes New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, and Connecticut.
"Midwest" denotes Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. "West" denotes Oregon, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah.

This figure shows annual group averages for both logs and levels of AGI and Taxable Income. The matching procedure
only matches on average levels of income across 2009-2010. Therefore, neither parallel trends in 2009-2010 and nor
their continuation in 2011 is an artifact of our matching procedure.

        Figure 8: Matched Sample Income Trends: Similar-Tax States Control Group Restriction




This figure shows annual group averages for both logs and levels of AGI and Taxable Income, when only tax-similar
states are used for the matching. The matching procedure only matches on average levels of income across 2009-2010.
Therefore, neither parallel trends in 2009-2010 and nor their continuation in 2011 is an artifact of our matching
procedure.

The table shows summary statistics for all observations pooled over the time period 2000-15. The level of observation
is the household, as reflected in the primary taxpayer observation which aggregates spousal income. California AGI
differs from Federal AGI in two ways: (a) it includes only California source income; and (b) California and Federal
law differ slightly in their definitions of AGI.

     For this table, each taxpayer i is sorted into an income bin B based on their 2012 income. For each such group, the
column "Only Prop 30" reports how Proposition 30 altered incentives to leave California, averaged over individuals
                                           S                S
and destination states. Note that if T2012    (zi,2012 ) = T2011 (zi,2012 ) ­ that is, the destination state does not change
                                                                       CA                CA
tax policy between 2011 and 2012 ­ the quantity collapses to T2012         (zi,2012 ) - T2011 (zi,2012 ). Differences between the
effective increase in the average tax rate and the increase in the top marginal rate are due to the federal deductibility
of state taxes and the discrepancy between average and marginal tax rates. In the remaining columns, we account
for how this increase in move-out incentives is altered by the concurrent 2012-13 increase in federal tax rates, which
induce variation in cross-state movement incentives due to the interaction of the federal policy shift with the existing
state of tax deductions in non-California states. We report such averages in the "Prop 30 + Federal Tax Increase"
columns of the table. To provide a broad picture of this heterogeneity, we split the destination states into three
groups in the latter columns: (1) zero-tax states, which have zero state income taxes in 2012 and 2013; (2) non-zero
tax states which tax income but do not change tax policy between 2012-13 (3) the states of Iowa, Kansas and Maine
separately because these states enacted tax cuts. See Section 5.a.3 for further details.

 Regressions include years 2000-2013 but exclude all taxpayers below the 9.3% bracket. All
 specifications contain marital status and year fixed effects. 2000-2010 is the pre-period, and differences
 in differences effects are estimated for years 2011-13. Standard errors are clustered by taxpayer. Income
 controls include log income and fixed effects for 100 income percentiles. Regressions are weighted by
 taxable income.

 Regressions include years 2000-2013 but also exclude all taxpayers below the 9.3% bracket. All specifications contain
 marital status and year fixed effects. 2000-2010 is the "pre" period, and differences in differences effects are estimated
 for years 2011-13. Standard errors are clustered by taxpayer. Income controls include log income
 and fixed effects for 100 income percentiles.

The Resident sample consists of taxpayers who from 2009 to 2011 filed as California residents, and further who for
each year earned taxable income which placed them in the range of the top-bracket as newly introduced by California
Proposition 30. The Non-Resident sample is the matched sample of non-residents. Matching is done on 2009-10 data,
using the total value of income across those two years for three separate variables: Federal AGI, Taxable Income, and
Capital Gains. The table compares compares 2011 covariate values. For the "Tax Similar States" sample, the control
pool used is Hawaii (11% top rate), Oregon (9.9% top rate), Minnesota (9.85% top rate), Iowa (8.98% top rate), New
Jersey (8.97% top rate), Vermont (8.95% top rate), District of Columbia (8.95% top rate), and New York (8.82%
top rate). Taxable Income for California residents is their California taxable income. For California non-residents,
Taxable Income is the taxable income of the taxpayer if they had been a California resident and their full income
had been subject to California state taxation.

 This table reports the percentage likelihood of different modes of out-migration, disaggregated
 by income bins reported in 2015 dollars. The calculations omit taxpayers who in the next year file
 as a non-resident, only to file again as a resident in the subsequent year (these are not
 quantitatively important). Out-migration rates are unweighted.

     This table proceeds identically to Table 2, calculating changes in the tax rate differences between California and
other states. The difference compared to Table 2 is that we use the log net of tax average rate. See note to Table 2
for explanation.

 Regressions include years 2000-2013 but also exclude all taxpayers below the 9.3% bracket. All
 specifications contain marital status and year fixed effects. 2000-2010 is the "pre" period, and
 differences in differences effects are estimated for years 2011-13. Standard errors are clustered by
 taxpayer and 5-digit ZIP. Income controls include log income and fixed effects for 100 income
 percentiles. Regressions weighted by taxable income. Baseline is Los Angeles - Long Beach MSA.
 Geocodes are based on year t - 1 zip code. t - 1 is used because as of filing for year t, many
 taxpayers are already out of California and filing from another state.

                                      Figure A9: Raw Diff in Diff Trends




These figures show the raw plots of the differences-in-differences for levels and logs of taxable income. The "control
group" is defined as those taxpayers who file non-resident returns in California in every year from 2009 to 2014,
and whose inflation-adjusted California taxable income would have placed them in the top California bracket (as
introduced under Proposition 30) for 2009-11. As is evident in this figure, non-resident filers in the control group
display substantially higher earnings than do residents.

for the case of zero-tax states, that is states with zero state income tax. This is the same group as
in the prior exercise, with the exception of Wyoming which changed policy between 2017-18. This
group is as follows: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, Texas, South Dakota, and Washington. Taxpayer
behavior is still fixed at year 2012, with inflation-indexed levels.

B.       Components of Taxable Income
This section summarizes IRS Form 1040 (Federal) and California FTB form 540 (California). Start
with Federal AGI. Subtract "California subtractions" and add "California additions"; this gives
California AGI43 . Then, we have

                    Taxable Income = (California AGI - California Deductions)+

      In the following we describe how Federal AGI is constructed, from an intermediate quantity
known as Total Income. Note our data contain Taxable Income, California wages, Federal AGI,
and California deductions for the universe of California tax returns.

    California AGI differs from Federal AGI in two ways: (a) it includes only California source income; and (b)
California and Federal law differ slightly in their definitions of AGI.
