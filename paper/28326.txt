                                         ABSTRACT

Previous research has shown that norms around the role of women in society could help explain
the gender gap in mathematics, and that these norms could be transmitted within the family.
Using data from the Florida Department of Education combined with birth certificates we
uncover important heterogeneity in the transmission of gender biases within the family. We find
that gender role norms can explain the lower performance of girls in mathematics only in
relatively affluent White families, whereas they do not apparently matter for the performance of
Black girls.

 Notes. This table reports OLS estimates, with robust standard errors clustered at the student and school level. The unit of observation is a
 student-year. The sample includes all students born in Florida between 1994 and 2002 from a family for whom we were able to reconstruct
 the fertility history without any gap, and none of the children has unknown father. From these families we keep students enrolled in grades
 6th to 10th for whom we have a math test score. In this table we look only at firstborn female students, excluding only children. Sample
 statistics for this sample are reported in Appendix Table A2, Panel A. In Column (2), the sample is restricted to families with at least one
 child eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRL), in at least one year in our sample. In Column (3), the sample is restricted to students
 from families where no child ever was eligible for free or reduced-price lunch in any year. In Column (4) the sample is restricted to students
 whose mother is either a high school dropout or a high school graduate (never enrolled in college). In Column (5), the sample is restricted to
 students whose mother attended college. The dependent variable measures the student score in the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test
 (FCAT) in mathematics in a given grade (the score is standardized with mean 0 and variance 1 over the population for a given grade and
 year). "Boy bias" is a dummy equal to 1 if the last born child in the family is a boy, and all the older children are girls, equal to 0 otherwise.
 The set of controls is identical to the one described in Table 1. All columns include year FE, grade FE, school FE. ***, **, and * indicate
 significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels.

Notes. This table reports OLS estimates, with robust standard errors clustered at the student and school level. The unit of observation
is a student-year. The sample includes all students born in Florida between 1994 and 2002 from a family for whom we were able
to reconstruct the fertility history without any gap, and none of the children has unknown father. From these families we keep
students enrolled in grades 6th to 10th for whom we have a mathematics test score. In this table we look only at firstborn male
students, excluding only children. Sample statistics for this sample are reported in Appendix Table A2, Panel B. Columns (1) to (5)
are defined in the same way as in Table 2. "Girl bias" is a dummy equal to 1 if the last born child in the family is a girl, and all the
older children are boys, equal to 0 otherwise. The dependent variable and the controls are identical to the ones described in Table
2. All columns include year FE, grade FE, school FE. ***, **, and * indicate significance respectively at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels.

Notes. The table reports descriptive statistics for the Florida sample used in Table 1 of the main text. The unit of observation is a student-year.
The sample includes all students born in Florida between 1994 and 2002, attending a Florida public school grade 6 to 10 in years 2002 to 2011,
and for whom we have a score in mathematics. Columns (1) to (3) report mean, st. deviation and sample size for the full sample of students.
Columns (4) to (6), and Columns (7) to (9) report the same statistics respectively for the subsample of White students, and for the one of Black
students. "Math score" measures students' Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test math score in a given grade (standardized with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 over the population for a given grade and year). The race dummies are taken from the FLODE school records. "Median
income in zipcode of birth (USD)" is taken from the 1999 US Census, and it refers to the time of birth of the child. "Free Lunch" is a dummy
equal to 1 if the student is enrolled in the Free lunch program in the given academic year. "Special Education" is a dummy equal to 1 if the
student is enrolled in the special education program in the given academic year. "Age in months" is the student's age at the beginning of the
academic year. "Mother married at birth" is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the mother was married when the child was born. "Mother age at
birth of 1st child" is the age (in years) of the mother when she gave birth to her first child. "Mother graduated high school", "Mother attended
some college", "Mother graduated from college" are dummy variables with excluded category "Mother is a high school dropout".

Notes. The table reports descriptive statistics for the Florida sample used in Table 2 and Table 3. The unit of observation is a student-year.
The observations shown in this table are all subsamples of the sample shown in Appendix Table 1. In Panel A, Columns (1) to (3) we
report mean, st. deviation and number of observations for the subsample of White firstborn females. This corresponds to the sample used
in Table 2, Panel A, Column (1). In Panel A, Columns (4) to (6) we report mean, st. deviation and number of observations for the
subsample of Black firstborn females. This corresponds to the sample used in Table 2, Panel B, Column (1). In Panel B, Columns (1) to
(3) we report mean, st. deviation and number of observations for the subsample of White firstborn males. This corresponds to the sample
used in Table 3, Panel A, Column (1). In Panel B, Columns (4) to (6) we report mean, st. deviation and number of observations for the
subsample of Black firstborn males. This corresponds to the sample used in Table 3, Panel B, Column (1). "Boy bias" is a dummy variable
equal to 1 if the last born in the family is a boy, and all the older children are girls, 0 otherwise. "Girl bias" is a dummy variable equal to
1 if the last born in the family is a girl, and all the older children are boys, 0 otherwise. The rest of the variables is defined as in Appendix
Table 1. In our definition of firstborns we always exclude only children.
