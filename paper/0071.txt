       Considerable attention has been devoted in the economic literature to

capital accumulation and savings. Little systematic attention, however, has

been given to the actual process of saving, by which is meant the generation

of nonwage income through the productive management of accumulated stocks of

nonhuman assets. Such activity generally has been thought of as a "neutral"

process which does not claim the use of scarce resources. At least, the re-

turns from saving activity have been considered independent of the amount of

resources foregone in its pursuit. The central thesis of this paper is that

the management of portfolios incorporating a variety of investment assets does

require the use of time and other scarce resources in searching for, collecting,

interpreting, and applying relevant information. Accordingly, the returns on

these assets would depend, in part, on managerial efforts and abilities and

other related inputs.

       The view that the generation of nonwage returns by individuals is a

neutral process may be rooted in Irving Fisher's theory of interest which large-

ly abstracted from differences in rates of interest at a point in time in order

to focus attention on the determinants of an overall, unique market rate of

interest. It has been indirectly defended in the contemporary economic litera-

ture as an implication of so-called "efficient" capital markets. In an ideal

or efficient market, is is argued, all the relevant information concerning

the productivity of assets is fully impounded in the market prices of these

assets at any given point in time.1 No gains are to be had by individual in-

vestors from search or from other management efforts in such a market. Speci-

fically, expected nonage income may vary across assets as a function of the

"risk" indigenous to these assets but otherwise is expected to be strictly

proportional to the amount   of   capital invested.
                                    2



        The condition that prices of all capital assets fully reflect all

available   information at every point in time could be   fulfilled only if

information were freely available or perfectly forecast by all investors

and if all capital markets were free of transaction costs. Since none of

these conditions literally are fulfilled in practice, search and management

of portfolios could be considered unproductive to individual investors

only if all had equally ready access to relevant information and     the   same

opportunities to implement it. Because relevant information concerning

the productivity of assets is costly to obtain and transaction costs slow

the process of price adjustment, investors who can collect and apply new

information at relatively low cost or stand to gain more through such

activity would be willing to sacrifice sufficient resources to secure

added returns. This hypothesis, though inconsistent with the notion that

capital markets are "perfect," is not inconsistent with the notion that they

are "efficient" in the sense of providing competitive rewards for superior

ability and resource expenditures in the management of assets.

      Although, in principle, the productive saving hypothesis applies to all

capital markets, practically, its importance may vary widely across different

markets. In the centralized markets for common stocks and other highly sub-

stitutable securities, the speed of price adjustments to newly available infor-

mation may be much faster than in markets for real estate assets and unincor-

porated businesses, although even in the stock market adjustments are not in-

stantaneous.2 Furthermore, investors who secure superior information concerning

the prospects of specific securities would have an incentive to appropriate its

full value by selling it to others. The opportunities for selling superior


information presumably are constra±ned, however, by added search and trans-

action costs to both seller and buyers. In addition, selling the information
                                         3



to   all investors simultaneously ou1d preclude differential returns to any one

investor. Thus, one cannot rule out a priori differential returns to better-

informed investors--especially those specializing in the collection of infor-

inst   ion--even in the markets for securities. Moreover, returns for superior
management of capital assets may    be   more sizable in connection with the
management of equity in unincorporated businesses       (including farms),   real
estate    operations, mortgage assets, and other loans. Markets for such assets

are more segmented as the assets themselves are more differentiated, less

divisible, and relatively costly to trade. Conceivably, then, the speed of

adjustment of stock and rental values to changes in market conditions is rela-

tively slow for these ty-pes of assets, and, consequently, the opportunities

for gains from search and management efforts may be more abundant.3 In con-

trast, in the markets for short—term government notes and other "safe" assets,

where yields are relatively fixed or highly predictable, returns to management

efforts may be low.

               saving activity pays or is important in explaining saving be-
          Whether

havior ultimately is an empirical issue. Tests of the efficient markets hypo-
thesis in its strong form, namely that no distinct investor or groups of in-
vestors have superior information and achieve differential returns, to our
knowledge,    have been conducted exclusively in connection    with the markets for

securities.     Even there a number of tests yielded results clearly at odds with
that    hy-pothesis. It may also be argued that the development and rapid growth

of such occupations as portfolio managers and investment specialists is not

inconsistent with the notion that opportunities for gains from productive

management of assets do exist in practice.
                                                  While the productive saving
hypothesis has potential implicatjos
                                             concerning the relative magnitude
of returns fr search i,n
                             specific capital markets, our main interest is
to derive a more general set of
                                   testable implications relating to the
productive management of assets. These implications concern a.U.ocations

of consumptive and productive resources throughout the life cycle and

saving behavior in general.


          The productive saving hypothesis extends a line of thought offered by

Alfred Marshall in connection with his distinction between "gross" and. "net"

interest on capital. Whilerecognizing that gross interest typically includes

some    insurance against   risk, Marshall also stressed that it includes "earnings

of management of a troublesome business" and. that in some cases it may consist

almost entirely of "earnings of a kind of work for which few capitalists have

a taste."7 But     whereas   Marshall ascribed the willingness to engage in the kind

of work underlying the management of certain assets basically to peculiar in-

dividual preferences, we propose that an investor's willingness to devote re-

sources to the management of capital assets is negatively related to his manage-

inent costs and. positively related to his expected gains determined, in part,

by his    specific training and.   experience. Details of these assumptions, alDng

with some conventional assumptions concerning the utility of lifetime consump-

tion and. bequest, form the basis for the development of a life cycle model of

consumption, work, and. saving      activity.
          To simplify matters, the life cycle model developed abstracts from an

explicit analysis of the joint accumulation of human        and   physical capital by

treating    human capital   endowments as exogenously determined. It also abstracts

from    any analysis of nonneutral attitudes toward risk and from variations in
the   demand for leisure in the    context of   intertemporal   decision-making. The
basic    implications of the model, however, are expected to hold under more gen-

eral conditions. These implications cicern the interdeperidencies between

consumption and saving activities, on the one hand, and the allocation of in-

d.ividual working time between conventional work and productive saving on the

other.

            The plan   of   the paper is as follows. A life cycle        model of con-

sumption   and productive saving without borrowing is developed in Section 1.

Borrowing is introduced into the model and       its   relationship to productive

saving is explored in Section II. In Section III we attempt to elucidate the

model's implications concerning capital accumulation paths and life cycle varia-

tions in resource allocations to productive activities. Implications regarding

the determinants of the propensity to save are         derived     in Section IV and then

briefly examined in light of some earlier theoretical and empirical findings.


 I. A Life Cycle Model of Consumption,
     Work, and Productive Savin&

        To introduce systematically the novel implications of the productive-

 saving hypothesis, we consider a simple model of the allocation of time and

 goods over the life cycle in which time can be used in only two income generat-

 ing activities: conventional work and capital management, or saving. We as-

 sume that the consumption unit's horizon consists of n equal t!periodsl? over

 which it wishes to allocate its productive and consumptive resources so as to

 maximize the utility of the overall consumption plan:


                               U = u(x,1, x2, ...,   X,   K1.) .                      (1.1)



 In equation (1.1), X. represents the expected stock value of a nondtrable
 composite market good. consumed in period t K is the terminal stock of
 physically nond.epreciable     nonhuman capital assets (measured in units of

 x) that are bequeathed or carried over beyond         the   planning horizon, and U

 is a function that converts stocks of dated goods and terminal wealth into

 consumption flows and utility. The consumption unit is assumed to have a

 neutral attitude toward risk. Consequently, it is assumed to behave as if

 all the expected variables pertinent to the production and consumption plans are
                                            6


known   with   certainty. For methodological simplicity, it is also assumed that

the price of X is constant at unity             throughout         the planning horizon and that

no direct costs are entailed in transforming X into K.

         The basic constraints limiting the consumption unit's total consumption

and   bequest   opportunities generally can         be     identified with its initial endow-

ments   of human and nonhuman capital, H0 and K0, and the total amount of
time it can devote to the generation of wage and nonwage income in any period
during   the life cycle. We assume that productive pursuits are exhausted                     by
work and saving. Therefore, abstracting from any effects of "aging" on pro-

ductive capabilities (any depreciation of human resources), human capital is

fixed at its endowed level H0. Assuming that the rental value of one unit of

time spent at work is a single-valued function of the stock of human capital,

wage income in any period would depend only on working time,
                                                                                                      .
                            Et
                                 =
                                     w°Xt
                                                t =   1,    ...,   n   ,                      (1.2)

where w0        w (H0) is a constant real wage rate defined in terms of the composite

good  X, and       denotes the amount of time expended in wage-generating
activities (work).
       xpected nonwage income can be written as the product of the accumulated
stock of nonhuman capital in the beginning of a given period Kt_i and the ex-

pected one-period gross rate of return: the expected
                                                                           interest, dividends,

royaltje other rental income, and capital gains or losses yielded per unit of

capital, net of the direct costs of purchased inputs including brokers? fees

and other transaction costs but inclusive of the value added through own

efforts. That is,


                                                =
                        Rt(ht,   H0, Kt1)           Kt1 r(ht, H0) ,                           (1.3)
                                       7


where ht is time spent at saving in period t, with r?(h) >0 and

rt(110) > 0. Oui basic thesis is that the expected gross rate of return to

capital, rt, or the expected private lending rate of interest, is not a fixed

yield but rather a continuously increasing and twice differentiable function of

saving time, h,' and the consumption unitts stock of human capital--at least

that part of its human capital that is complementary to the management of

assets.

          The production function of nonwage incnme specified in equation (1.3)

shows expected nonwage income to be strictly proportional to Kti at any

given level of ht. While this assumption may be largely valid with regard to

the markets for securities on the grounds that individual portfolios are not

large enough to affect the market prices of securities in their possessioti, it

may not always hold in connection with the management of, say, mortgage assets

and rentals of property. An increase in the amount of capital invested in

these latter assets may require more search and own-supplied management efforts

in order to maintain a given gross rate of return even though diminishing

returnb to managerial efforts may be suppressed to some extent through adjust-

ments in the amounts of hired factors of production. Moreover, retaining such

factors at relatively low levels of portfolio size may be uneconomical. More

generally, then, the expected rate of returns may be written as r(ht, H0, Kti)

with r'(Kti)       0. We assume, however, that capital and saving time are com-

plements in the production of nonwage income (see n. 9) and that the magnitude

of rt(Kti) at given levels of ht is negligible over a wide range of port-

folio size (see n. 10).

          The total amoune of resources available to a consumption unit for con-

sumption and nonhuman capital holding in any given period is generally the sum

of its nonhuman net worth in the begnning of the period and the stock value

of the wage and nonwage income accruing to it during the period. Initially,

the analysis will proceed on the assumption that the consumption unit engages
                                              8

in    no borrowing. The capital constraint for a given period then can                  be   stated
in terms of the requirement that total
                                                  outlays on goods plus the amount           of
capital    accumulated at the end of the period just exhaust the amount of re-
sources available. That is,

                                Et+Rt+Ktl=xt+Kt,                                              (l.)
or, substituting equations        (1.2) and   (1.3) in equation (i.li),

where
                                  pt(ht) = 1 +        r(h)
The problem becomes that of

and    the initial endowments of the individual's nonhuman and human capital,

                                K(0) =
                                         K0           H(0) =
                                                               H0
                                                                    .
                                                                                             (i.)
A more illuminating formulation of the problem can be achieved through an in-
iuctive solution of the set of equations (1.5) in terms of the initial endow-
nent   of nonhuman capital given in       equation      (1.7). This is permissible on the

ssumption that no borrowing for consumption purposes is desied by the con-

3umption unit   so that none of the single period constraints is
                                                                 binding. Using

Equation        (1.8) is just a variant of the Fisherian wealth constraint: it equates

the total expenditures on goods and bequest evaluated in terms of period n

"dollars" with the similarly evaluated future value of the consumption unit's

wage and nonwage receipts. Unlike the Fisherian model, which assumes identical

market discount rates for all individuals, this model allows the private lending

rates of interest to vary across different consumption units and over time ac-

cording to the extent of individuals' participation in and productivity at sav-

ing activities.

        Given an optimal allocation of productive time between work and saving,

the optimal plan of consumption and terminal capital must satisfy the set of

n + 1   equations summarized above or, alternatively, the n independent

equations

                       MU(x) = ____
                      MUx
                          t-JY  h   t
                                                t = 2, •..,     ,              (i.n)
and

                                            =     •                            (l.lla)
                                 MU(X)

The latter set of equations reproduces the familiar result that the ratios of

the marginal utilities of consumption goods in different time periods must be

the same as the ratios of their respective-marginal costs: the terms at hich

alternatively dated (otherwise identical) consumption claims can      be   traded be-

tween any two periods. If borrowing for consumption is undesired, these terms

of trade are determined by tllendingfl or productive saving opportunities.

Equation (1.lla) shows that the optimal level of terminal capital (measured in

terms of the composite good x)   must yield the same marginal utility as con-

sumption in the final period of the planning horizon since this capital can be

exchanged with similarly dated consumption claims at equal marginal costs.

        In turn, given an optimal consumption-bequest plan, an optimal alloca-

tion of productive time between work and saving in any given period must satisfy

the set of equations summarized in (l.loc). Dividing this equation through by
                                        n+l
the price of consumption in period t,    fl p., and noting that by definition
                                             i=rt-i-l



(seen. 7), kl(tkw° - Xk)                +               = Kt1, the necessary con-
                                             K0
dition for optimal participation in work and saving involving positive values

of      and ht can be rewritten as


                        = Kti rt(ht)            t = 1, ..., n   .             (1.12)
                                    U
Equation (1.12) is the familiar factor employment equation of general price

theory. It states that an optimal allocation of time between work and saving

at any given period in which there is positive participation in each activity

can be achieved only if the marginal return to time is identical in both. The

sufficient condition that such an allocation of productive time will maximize

the total expected return from employment (given the level of initial capital

and the constancy of the wage rate) is that there be diminishing marginal pro-

ductivity of saving time, or r"(h) < 0. Figiire 1 illustrates these conditions

graphically. With the assumption that saving time and noiihuman capital are

complements in the generation of nonwage income and given a constant opportu-

nity cost of time, an immediate implication is that the optimal extent of self-

employment in saving activities, except in cases of specialization in work or

saving activitie would be an increasing function of the initial amount of ac-

cumulated capital that summarizes the results of earlier productive and con-

sumptive resource allocations (see Figure 2). A fortiori, given w and K,

any decrease in the marginal productivity of management time due to exogenous

factors operating in capital markets would increase individuals' demand for

conventional market activities relative to time in productive saving.

       These results may be modified to some degree if markets for capital

provided opportunities for substitution between own management of portfolios

and the services of hired specialists. However, we expect these opportunities

to be imperfect in practice. In the first place, inasmuch as specialists

differ in abilities and the information they possess regarding various assets

at different points in time, investors would have an incentive to search for

productive managers. In addition, transaction costs incurred in hiring special-

ists' services may make their retention uneconomical especially when the port-

folio of capital and expected benefits to the owner are relatively small.

Moreover, a complete reliance on specialists generally would be optimal only

if specialists' services could be considered as perfect substitutes to own

productive saving in all relevant aspects of saving. But specialists need not

have the same incentive for prudence in the management of owners' assets as

have the owners themselves. Thus both factors of production may be used in

managing individual portfolios in accordance with cost minimizing principles.

As long as own entrepreneurial services and specialists' services were com-

plementary in the production of nonwage returns, the employment of both may be

expected to rise as individual portfolio sizes rise. Formally, the analysis

of optimal employment of hired factors of production is similar to the analysis

of   borrowing for productive saving that is               considered in the following section.

Both   are   undertaken   so as to maximize wealth. Since services rendei'ed by hired
factors are      expected   to raise the lending rate of interest at any given level
of own    saving   activity, their optimal employment is expected to increase mono-
tonically with portfolio size even when the consumption unit                       specializes   in
productive saving, i.e., when ht/To = 1.
         The interaction between productive and consumptive allocations of re-

sources and the stability conditions underlying these allocations can be il-

lustrated graphically by means of conventional, two-period analysis, Let the

consumption unit's horizon consist of two periods and let the desired bequest

be zero. The endowment position represented by point C in Figure 3 represents

the amounts of resources available for consumption in periods 1 and 2 in the

absence of any intertemporal capital transfers. These are I and 12 = w°T0,

respectively. Consumption of goods can be traded between the two periods via

the transformation curve:


                          X2 =               -         +           -
                                                                                              (1.13)
                                 p2(h2)(11       X1)       w0(T0       h2)   ,



where the difference I -

                                             denotes the amount              of capital accumulated

at   the end.   of period 1. The    slope of this curve is readily found to equal p2.

consumption and savings decisions, however, are the marginal terms of trade

that are determined by the (expected) gross rate of return inclusive of the

value added through the investor's own efforts. Since, in general, the gross

rate of return is expected to be positively related to the amount of capital

accumulated, the transformation curve AC in Figure 3 is expected to be convex

toward the origin (see n. 10). The sufficient condition for a stable equilib-

riuin involving productive saving therefore requires that the marginal rate of

substitution in consumption between X2 and X1 rise faster than the cor-

responding marginal rate of substitution in production as more of                        X1 is ex-

changed for X2 through productive saving. The shape of the segment of the

consumption transformation curve that involves borrowing for consumption will

be discussed in Section II below.

       The behavioral content of the model can be sharpened at the expense of

some simplifying assumptions oancerning the form of the utility function. Let

sumption unit's preference bias in period n toward own consumption relative

to its retirement fund or bequest. By introducing equations (1.15) and (1.15a)

into equations (1.11) and (1.lla), it now can be shown that the optimal rate

of growth of the composite good X over the life cycle and the corresponding

optimal level of bequest relative to consumption 111 the last period of the planning

         The homotheticity of the utility function for lifetime consumption and

bequest generally implies that an increase in the gross rate of interest would

raise the optimal ratio of later to earlier consumption claims in consecutive

periods. More specifically, given the weakly separable C.E.S. utility function

considered in the preceding illustration, the direction as well as the extent
                                         15


of the growth of consumption over time are shown by equations (1.16) and (i.i6a)

to be dependent essentially on the difference between the consumption unit's

gross lending rate of interest and its time preference for "present" or own

consumption relative to "future" consumption or bequest. Ihus, if the

consumption unit had neutral time preferences in all periods and the lending

rate of interest wee always positive, then consumption of goods would increase

continuously over the planning horizon and peak at the final period. Moreover,

since by assumption the lending rate of interest is positively related to the

level of saving activity, so would be the optimal rate of growth of consumption

over time, and thus, indirectly, the absolute size of bequest also would re-

late positively to saving activity.

         The preceding analysis generally indicates the existence of interde-

pendencies between consumption-saving decisions and work-saving decisions.

Under given labor market opportunitie participation in saving activity is seen

to be inoriotonicafly related to the amount of accwnulated capital. In turn,

the extent of participation in saving activities and the resulting rates of

return   on   capital would, along with time preferences, determine the rate of

growth   of consumption over time and,   consequently,   the rate and direction of
capital accumulation that are necessary to effect the desired consumption plan.
The analysis indicates that then saving activity is viewed as a productive
process,   consumption decisions concerning the intertemporal allocations of goods

cannot be separated frctn production decisions concerning the maximization of

wealth and that the separation theorem of conventional models of intertemporal

consumption and production decisions, asserting the independence of the two,

cannot be considered valid.13 Another apparent implication of this analysis,

which is more fully developed in Section IV below, is that different consumption

units- - even   equally wealthy ones- -may have different consumption paths not
necessarily because of differences in subjective discount rates or because of
                                              16

 •systematic     association between time preferences for consumption and. wealth,

)ut because of differences in their gross rates of retuni to savings due to

Iif±'erences in their initial endowments of nonhuman       and human      capital and

bilities.


:i. Foductive Saving and Borrowing

        For the sake of a simple yet general introduction of borrowing opportu-

iities into our    choice   theoretic framework, we make the following assumptions

oncerning the market      for   borrowing. We assume that borrowing, like consump-

'ion and the augmentation of capital assets, occurs at the end of a standard

eriod and that principal and       interest   payments mature and   are   planned to be

aid at the end of the succeeding period. The length of a standard borrowing

eriod is identified with the length of a single period of the consumption

nit's
 •           •        .
        planning horizon.         We further assume that the marginal borrowing cost

f capital is a function of the amount borrowed, D,          and   the   borrower's net

orth,    N. That is, in symbols, MbC =
                                               MbC(Dti,Ntj),   with MbCI(Dti)           >0
ud Ct(Nti) <         0. The       logic behind the productive saving hTothesis

uggests that borrowing costs also should be influenced by resource expendi-

ures by the borrower in search for less expensive sources of funds. We shall

iscuss this possibility later in this section. Initially, borrowing is viewed

s an activity that does not ccnsume resources.

        A consumption unit can borrow for two fundamentally distinct purposes.

ne is to finance current consumption of nondurable goods./ The other is to

ugnient the amount of income generating assets under its command. We call the

econd borrowing for productive saving. Clearly, borrowing for productive

aving is inconsistent with the simple Fisherian model of saving which assumes

aat the lending and borrowing interest rates are identical. It also is in-

Dnsistent with differing, though constant, lending and borrowing rates since then
                                          17



the latter must always exceed the former. Under the assumptions of rising

marginal borrowing costs, however, such borrowing is compatible with productive

saving activities since the expected gross rate of return on assets is assumed

to be an increasing function of saving activity.

          Regardless of whether productive saving is own         financed   or funded   by
borrowing,    borrowing for consumption is not expected to be undertaken           simul-
taneously with productive saving activity. It would not pay the consumption

unit to borrow funds to finance consumption purchases prior to tapping its own

capital assets because the cost of borrowing funds at the margin necessarily

exceeds the return from lending foregone if own, rather than (additionally)

borrowed, capital is used. This is readily seen when                borrowing for productive

saving is optimal. Then the marginal gross return on own capital must fall

short of the minimum cost of borrowing funds. Moreover, if the consumption

unit has already undertaken positive borrowings for productive saving, then

borrowing additional funds for consumption cannot be optimal since, as will be

shown later, optimal borrowing for productive saving requires equality in

equilibrium between the marginal borrowing cost of capital and the gross rate

of return on that capital." Thus, we derive the important implication that

any borrowing can be considered borrowing for productive saving as long as

the consumption unit has positive holdings of nonwage income generating capital

assets    (excluding emergency funds that may      be   subsumed under   consumption expendi-

tures).    The foflowing   axalysis   indicates that the relevant rate of interest
or interteniporal consumption decisions then would be identified with the 'oss
(lending) rate of interest on own capital.
             The preceding discussion suggests that when borrowing opportunities
are   available   to the consumption unit,   the   resource constraint limiting cal-
sumption and capital holding in each period can          be   specified in either of two

forms depending upon whether borrowing is done for the purpose of consumption

or for productive saving. In the first case, the one-period resource caistraint

                                      w°t+DtXt+tDti,                                           (2.1)


where             1 +          indicates     the average return to the lending institution,
     =
         T,     and Dt may be positive, negative, or nhl The terms of trade between

pairs of consumption goods in different periods would be determined by the

marginal borrowing cost of capital, which is expected to rise with the scale

of borrowings. Thus, the relevant transformation curve between future                     and
present       consumption would be concave toward the origin, as depicted by the arc

CB in Figure 3. In the case of borrowing for productive saving, the one-

period resource constraint is given by


                                +
                                    Nt_i t ÷ Dt_i ( -                 =    +N   ,            (2.2)

bhrough productive borrowing. By utilizing the equilibrium conditions for optimal

orrowing and saving activity, it can easily be shown that the slope of the

Lictated by the lending             rate   of interest as is the arc AC in Figure 3.      In

'urther restriction of the utility function of lifetime consumption and. be-

uest considered in Section I, however, one can show that erratic switching

rorn a position of i. net borrower to one of a net lender is not likely to

ccui from one period to another. Let                   the    parameter     in equation (1.15)

    different periods. Clearly, then, as long as there were no
                                                               exogenous in-

creases in wage income over time, borrowings for consumption purposes would be

inconsistent with a positive difference between objective (lending or borrowing)

interest rates and   subjective   rates of time preference. The reason

is that equation (i.i6) then would imply a strictly ising    consumption   path

over   time, whereas the borrowing of capital for current. consumption decreases
the amount of resources that can be expended on bequest    or the purchase of goods

in at least one future period by the amount of debt service payments. This

assertion must be modified, of course, if wage income grew over time at a rate

exceeding the optimal rate of growth of planned consumption expenditures.         In

our deterministic model of intertemporal consumption and production decisions,

however, the growth of wage income must be explained primarily as the result

of human capital accumulation. Intensive investment in human capital is ex-

pected to take place early in the investor's life, during which time he might

also resort to net borrowing of capital if his initial net worth is negligible.

But with rt > Tt, and with accumulation of human capital rapidly leveling off,

as models of human capital accumulation invariably predict (see, in particular,

Becker (l96i.) and Mincer (i971.)), the only way to effect a plan of persistently

rising consumption expenditures is by gradually building up, and then maintain-

 ing, a positive stock of own physical capital. Since the main interest in this

paper is in explaining the behavior of consumption units with positive levels

 of capital assets, we henceforth focus on the implications of borrowing for

 productive purposes, assuming that r(ht) > Tt and that asset holdings are

 nonnegative throughout the relevant planning horizon, starting at t =      1.
          With this restriction in mind, it is easily shown that the overall

 wealth constraint for consumption units that are net lenders throughout their

 planning horizon would be

sions now can be derived by differentiating the utility function of lifetime

consumption and    bequest   with respect to the relevant choice variables, subject

to the wealth constraint given in equation (2.3). The optimality conditions

for consumption decisions .are formally the same as those derived u-i Section I.

Production decisions, however, involve the simultaneous determination of optimal

values of f        (or ht) and Dti. Given the value of Dti, the optimal
allocation of time between work and saving must satisfy the set of optimality

conditions


                              w° =
                                      (Nt_i   + Dt1) r'(ht)                                (2.)

provided that ht and             are positive; t = 1,          ...,    n.    These conditions are

formally identical to the conditions for optimal work and saving decisions de-

rived in Seclion I except that here           Kt is comprised of both own and borrowed

assets. In turn, the optimal scale of borrowing in any period where D > 0

must satisfy the set of equations

(2.5) is the marginal       rate of return on lending and     the   expression on the right

is the marginal borrowing cost of capital. In equilibrium, of course, they
must be the same. The sufficient conditions for optimal values of

Dti     to maximize   the   consumption unit's wealth, in addition to (2.li-a) and

(2.5a),   require that


                            +
                                Nti) rt1(ht) Ct/Dtj - [rt(ht)]2 >         0 .        (2.6)

Diagrammatically,     equation (2.6) is satisfied if the marginal borrowing cost

of   capital   becomes increasingly adverse to the borrower, relative to his rate

of   return on nonhuman capital, as he expands the scale of his borrowing.19
These optimality conditions are portrayed in Figure II.
          The central behavioral implications of the foregoing analysis involve

potential interdependencies between N and D. At low levels of net worth,

saving activity may be negligible, and so r(h) is expected to be lower than

the marginal borrowing cost of capital. Little borrowing for the purpose of

acquiring additional income generating assets is expected. But as N grows

and participation in saving activity is enhanced, r(h) also is expected to

rise sufficiently to make borrowing for productive saving optimal. Moreover,

an increase in own assets is expected to promote a greater absolute amount of

borrowing as well as greater participation in productive saving activity.20

This is demonstrated graphically in Figure II., where an increase in N from

N0 to N1 is associated with a greater absolute increase in K from K0 to

K1. This analysis does not rule out borrowing for productive saving at low

levels of asset holdings. It implies, however, that such borrowing is more

likely to be undertaken by those who specialize in the management of their as-

sets since their lending rates of interest are expected to be relatively large

at given levels of asset holdings. Thus we expect that borrowing for productive

saving will be more prevalent among unincorporated business families than among

families of wage earners. Indeed, at low levels of asset holdings entrepre-

neurial savings consequently may be more negative than those of wage earners.

The analysis generally implies that saving activity and productive borrowing

can be considered "complements" in the sense that an increase in one activity

due to exogenous factors will promote both.

       The analysis so far has ignored the possible role of ti!ne and

other resources in borrowing costs. In the generally segmented market for bor-

rowing, careful search among lenders may reduce the borrowing costs of capital

to the consumption unit at any level of borrowing and net worth. Optimal bor-

rowing activity would then be achieved when the marginal return from time de-

voted to shopping for funds, a, is equa] to the opportunity cost of time in

other pursuits. The necessary condition for an optimal allocation of time be-

tween work, borrowing, and saving activities, if all are positive, is given by


                  w0 =
                         (Nt_i   +
                                     Dt_i)   r'(ht) =   _Dt1   b'(at) ,   (2.7)

where b(at) is a continuously decreasing, twice differentiable, and convex

function of at.

       Productive borrowing and saving activities generally are expected to

be complementary in affecting nonwage returns. Indeed, these may be joint

activities from the investor's point of view. In general, active borrowing

for productive saving is likely to take place at a relatively high level of

borrowing which, in turn, is expected to increase with net worth. Moreover,

the higher is N at any given level of opportunities for work, the greater

will be the amount of time devoted to both saving and borrowing. Thus, the

 formal incorporation of productive borrowing activity in the model strengthens

 theimplications of the preceding analysis of productiire saving. The main signi-
ficance is in pointing to the potential existence of an additional source of
productivity in the process of generating nonwage income.

III.     Capital Accumulation Paths and Life
         Cycle Variations in Productive
         Resource Allocations
          While     the   allocation of goods over time, the allocation of time between
work and saving,          and   the optimal level of productive borrowing in each period
are the      "control variables" of our model, the accumulation of nonhuman capital
over the planning horizon is the "state variable" that summarizes all previous

production and consumption decisions. Since changes in the level of accumulated

capital, in turn, indicate the magnitude of savings in each period, optimal

savings paths can be derived through analysis of capital accumulation paths.

As in Section II, the analysis here will focus on consumption units with posi-

tive capital assets. For methodological convenience, we assume that on the

average life cycle expectations are fulfilled so that the planned resource al-

locations of a representative consumption unit are realized in practice.

         The one-period resource constraint given by equation (1.5) can alter-

natively be defined by

                =
                    w° + K1 r            - (Nt    -

                                                                                                        (3.2)

The term Nt =             -        represents the magnitude of savings in period t.
                Nt÷i          Nt
Since an optimal allocation of time between work and saving insures the equal-

ity of the marginal returns on all productive uses of time, the first term on

the right-hand side of equation (3.2) in equilibrium is equal to zero (provided

that specialization in saving activities implies that ht                       is constant), and

equation (3.2) reduces to


                =
                    r(ht+i)Nti        -
                                          t   -

Equation (3.3) defines a direct relation between the rate of change in the

allocation of goods and the rate of capital formation over time.                          For example,

if the gross lending rate of interest exceeds the subjective rate of time pref-

erence in all the relevant periods, as was assumed in the preceding section,

then the optimal path of the allocation of goods will be rising throughout the

planning horizon, or X. > 0 in all t.                    If, in addition, relative prefer-

ences between om consumption and bequest in the final period of the planning
                                                     x(N* l
horizon are such that the optimal ratio                  N*        implies N > N1, then
     and hence the algebraic value of savings in period t,                       must have been

positive in all preceding periods. Alternatively, if the consumption unit is

 initially a net borrower, then its debt must be reduced in part or in full fol-

 lowing the initial period(s) of borrowing when net worth is either zero or

 negative. To prove this, note that if Nt1 were negative, then Nt neces-

 sarily has the same algebraic sign to insure that X. > 0, since by rearranging

 terms, equation (3.3) can be written as


                      =   [l + r(ht+i)] --                    t=   1,   •..,   n -l .             (3.)
                                               25



The path of capital accumulation would be falling continuously over time once

the consumption unit starts dissaving. But such a path would be inconsistent

with N1 =     Nn
                    -        > 0. The optimal path of capital accumulation must

then be continuously rising over time. Possibly, however, relative preferences

between on consumption and bequest in the typical case are such that the ratio

   N        implies .1V* < N1 (see the discussion in n. 12). If Nn > N in

this case, the optimal path of capital accumulation must rise initially over

some range of the planning horizon, attain a peak, and then continuously de-

cline over the final range (see Figure 5).              This path of capital accumulation,
of course, may be consistent with              < N0 also. The main implications of

this analysis can be summarized by the following theorem.

Theorem: Given a homothetic utility function of lifetime consumption as con-

sidered in Section I, with the gross rate of interest always exceeding the rate

of time preference, and with a constant wage rate, the capital accumulation path

is either continuously rising (with a possible net indebtedness being first

settled) or is initially rising and then falling, provided that initial capital

ioes not exceed terminal capital.

       The preceding analysis depends crucially on the assumption that the wage

rate w° =               is constant throughout the planning horizon. If it were sub-
            w(H0)
ject to uncontrollable variations over the life cycle, equation (3.Ii) would

reflect such variations as follows:


                            -       = [1   +
                                               r(ht)]   k1 -                        (3.5)

learly,   then, any systematic exogenous decreases in the wage rate would

trengthen the above theorem, whereas systematic exogenous increases in the

rage rate may render it invalid, unless the difference                -        were always

investments in human capital, so far assumed to be endowed at a constant level.

Investment in human capital is clearly an alternative means of accumulating

capital assets or engaging in productive saving. AM, as has already been

pointed out in our analysis in Section II, the accumulation of human capital,

due to its embodiment in the investor and. its nonmarketability in general, is

expected   to take    place early in the     life cycle. Following the termination of
investments in   human    capital, w = w(H) is expected to remain constant or de-
cline   as a result of depreciation of human capital. The theorem expounded in

the preceding discussion would then hold unambiguously. But even during the

period of accumulation of human capital, the theorem may remain valid if human

and nonhuman capital were complements in the production of wealth, because

planned persistent increases in consumption expenditures, in the absence of

expectations for purely exogenous increases in wage income, must be effected

through some positive accumulation of future income-generating assets--human

or nonhuman--as long as initial (nonhuman) capital is less than or equal to

terminal capital (N0 <N). Indeed., human and nonhuman capital assets are likely

to be acquired simultaneously, at least throughout the latter part of the human

capital investment period, if only because an increase in human capital may en-

hance productivity in saving activities.'

        The paths of capital accumulation derived above generally appear com-

patible with empirical evidence relating to asset holdings in a cross section

of age groups at a point in time (see, e.g., Projector and Weiss (1966), Tables

A8 and AlO). These paths might also be used to predict life cycle variations in

hours of   work and   labor force   participation rates. If wage rates and the
marginal   productivity of saving     time   were constant over the planning horizon,
                                            27



the amount of working time devoted to labor market activities would tend to

decline as caiiital was continually accuilated and the amount of time devoted

to self-employment in the management of capital assets would adually increase,

peaking at the peak of nonhuman asset accunmiation. The latter result follows

from equation (1.12) since, with a constant market price of time and an un-

changing function r(h, k), there exists a unique relationship between the size

of capital accumulated and the expected absolute amount of time devoted to saving.

This prediction remains valid even if human capital changed. systematically over

the life cycle, provided that it had a neutral effect on the productivity of

time devoted to saving and to work, as well as to other potential pursuits.

Specifically, if          =
                              t-l   and rt =     r(ht    .
                                                             Hti),   an increase in

would. not affect the equilibrium condition for an optimal allocation of time

between work and saving since the ratio wt/rt(ht) would be invariant to

changes in Hti. It is possible, of course, that human capital acquired

through general schooling and training is biased in favor of conventional labor

market activities. Persons with such training would tend to specialize in labor

market activities at least through the period of intensive training and. other

related investments. Still, our basic prediction concerning the effect of

physical capital accumulation on the allocation of time between work

and    saving   is expected to hold at any given level of human capital accumula-

              And it is expected to hold even more strongly during the period of

net human capital depreciation as long as there was no comparable deaccumula-

tion of nonhuman      capital.   Indeed, empirical evidence controlling for family

income indicates that the share of nonhuman             assets   among all assets increases

continuously with age: controlling for family income, Projector and Weiss

(op. cit., pp. 7,      8) report   a positive correlation between net asset holdings

and.   age   across. the entire age range. A general implications of the analysis is
                                                28

that    as age rises the fraction of all working time devoted to asset management

also rises. Evidence derived from the same data analyzed by Projector and Weiss

is consistent with this implication. It shows that among all household heads

the proportion of those who are self-employed increases monotonically with age.

Even retirement may be explained, in part, as a consequence of nonhuman capital

accumulation inducing specialization in saving activities. If, however, asset

holdings substantially decrease later in life, then the allocation of working time

between saving and work may once again shift in favor of the latter. Reentry

into the labor market after a period of specialization in self-employment might

be   explained as a consequence of deaccumulation of assets which decreases the

marginal productivity of saving time relative to labor market ea1ning power.


IV. The Average Propensity to Save

                In the preceding section we discussed expected capital accumulation

paths    over the life cycle, Of course, realized paths may vary among consuiixp-
tion units of like characteristics, Consumption units also differ in their
initial endowments      of human   and   nonhuman    assets and. in their chosen occupational
careers.       In this section we discuss the effects of these differences on the

propensity to save in light of the productive saving hypothesis,

                Consider, first, the effect of an        increase in wealth due to an
exogenous increase in the endowment of nonhuman capital or the corresponding
magnitude   of   nonwage income.    In the Fisherian model this would not affect
the relative     interteniporal allocation of goods if the utility function of life-

time consumption and. bequest were homothetic. This implication of the Fisherian

modelunderlies the well-known theories of the consumption function by Friedman

(1957)   and   by Modigliani and Brumberg (1951i-). Interms of the permanent income

hypothesis one can write


                                         X =   kt(r)                            (.1)
                                                29

 where         denotes permanent income (or wealth) as evaluated by the consunrption

 unit at age t,       and
                            kt    measures its average propensity to consume out of

 permanent income. If r were constant, so would be                   k.    In constrast, our

 model suggests that an exogenous increase in net worth or nonwage income would

 increase simultaneously the desired amount of asset holdings, the optimal

 amount of productive resources allocated to saving activity (including om time,

 hired factors, and borrowing activity), and the rate of return on savings.

 Consequently, we expect an exogenous increase in net orth to decrease the

 average propensity to consume out of permanent income. This major implicatLon

 of the analysis can be demonstrated, graphically via the
                                                                      two-period consumption
 model discussed in Section I. An increase in K0 (as in Section I, we here

 identify K with N) implies that he initial endowment point B                   in Figure 6
 shifts out horizontally to point F. Since the consumption unit's wage rate

 is unaffected, the consumption transformation curve passing through F, BFB',

 is just a horizontal translate of the initial transformation curve, AEA'./

 Clearly, the slope of the curve BFB' is steeper than the slope of AEA'

 along the ray OP' passing through the initial equilibrium position P.

Thus, if the utility function is homothetic the new equilibrium position must

lie to the left of the ray OP',           say at point Q. Both the optimal level
of net worth in period 1 and the optimal ratio                       increase as a result.
That an increase in the desired level of asset holdings increases the optimal

ratio   of future   to current consumption can be verifed mathematically by

differentiating     equation     (1.16) with respect to      K.1 since



                            d ao(x2/x)
                                            =
                                                22/1>          0 '               (1.2)

as long as r'(K1)       dr2/dX1 > 0. If desired bequest were nil, an increase

in x2/x1 necessarily implies that the percentage increase in wealth, defined

at the new equilibrium position Q by                 =                    exceeds the
                                                         X1 p(h2) + X2,
percentage increase in X1. The ratio of current consumption to permanent

income, k1, then is expected to fall. The same result obtains if the analysis

is generalized to n periods. Furthermore, since by equation (l.16a) the ratio

of bequest to the planned consumption expenditures in period n is independent

of   wealth, planned bequest, if     positive, would rise by the same 'proportion as

X. Consequently, the ratio of the         discounted, as    well as   undiscounted, life
time   consumption to life time income would necessarily fall." Regardless

of whether bequest is optimal, the decline in the ratio o± current consumption

to wealth as northuman wealth rises also implies that the ratio of current con-

sumption to current income falls. That is, the analysis implies that both

          and X/Y decline as wealth rises.'
             Next, consider an increase in       wealth   due to a greater ?tendowmentt

of human   capital. Since the corresponding        increase in earning    power   implies

an   increase in current wage income as well       as in potential wage income in all

relevant ftiture   periods, the end.owment position in Figure 6 shifts upward and.
to the right of point E, but below the ray OE'. -'Point                 H illustrates an

increase   in wage income in pexod 1 by an amount equal          to the absolute increase

in   nonwage resources considered in the preceding illustration. If the increase
in human   capital   does not affect the consumption unit's rate of return at
given levels of nonhuman     capital, that is, if dr(K)/dH       = 0,    then   the new

consumption   transformation curve passing        through H, CaC',       again would be
a horizontal translate of curves        AEA.'    and. BFB' after adjusting for the

vertical distances between the different endowment positions. It can easily

be shown in   this case   that the new optimal ratio of            to       would be

higher   than their initial ratio at point P, but lower than the             corresponding

ratio   associated with an equal increase in nonwage         income   or nonhuman wealth

(compare points R and Q         in   Figure 6).    A permanent increase in wage income
here is found to raise the optimal savings to wealth ratio by             less   than would
an equal once and for     all increase in nonwage income       or nonhuman wealth.        More-

over, this conclusion is strengthened if the effect of an increase               in wage

income   is compared with the effect of an increase in nonwage income or nonhuman
                                             31


 wealth that led. to an equal   increase    in the consumption unit's     overall   wealth.
 This easily can be verified by comparing the equilibrium positions R and. S
 associated with the consumption transformation curves CHC' and DGD',
 respectively. By construction these two          curves   intersect at point R.
               Since, in general, a change    in   human capital   may alter   the allocation
 of   resources to productive saving activity, the preceding illustration,assumng

 no such effects, may serve only as a bencbmark for analysis of more general

 cases. A neutral effect of human capital on the productivity of resources at

work and saving, as analyzed in Section III, would not affect the allocation

 of working time and other resources between the two activities but would. raise

 the productivity of time and other resources spent saving at given levels of

Kt1. The result could be an increase im r(K), hence in the steepness of

the arc OH along the curve CHC'. The implication of the preceding analysis

concerning the positive effect of an increase in wage income on the optimal

saving to wealth ratio then would be fortified. In constrast, if human capital

were "biasedt' in favor of conventional labor market activities, which is likely

if it were comprised mainly of "general" schooling and labor market experience,

then   an   increase in human capital, by   shifting the allocation of resources away
from   productive saving toward "work," might decrease the levek of r(K), hence

the steepness of the transformation curve OH. An exogenous increase in wage

earnings due to an improvement in labor market opportunities           is an obvious
example of a shift in opportunities    that may "bias" the allocation of resources

away from productive saving. In these cases the optimal savings to wealth

ratio resulting from an increase iii   wage income may be decidedly lower than
the one resulting from an equal increase in nonwage income or nonhuman wealth.

              This analysis may be used to reinterpret the positive association

between the level of measured income and the average propensity to save as

reported in numerous budget studies without exclusive resort to explanations
                                           32



&rawingon the effect of variations in transitory components of income on the
propensity to save. Households or spending units of given age, schooling, and
labor market    experience   and with larger endowments    of nonhuman capital may

have higher    propensities to save out of permanent      income because of their

relatively higher rates of return       on savings. A similar     conclusion may also

apply to the propensities to save of consumption units o± a given age and net

worth and with higher levels      of human capital,   provided   the cha'acter of their
human capital were not %iased" significantly against saving            activities.--'
Inasmuch as cross-sectional variations in income        reflect variations in permanent

components of income, an observation of a systematic association between the

propensity to save and income may be explained,        at least in part,      as a con-

sequence o± a positive association between permanent income and. the productive

management of assets. That is, one may write



                                  X =                                          (•3)

        dk
with           <0.    Equation (1,..3) is cctrpatible with Keynes' (second) "law"
          pt
of consumption (see Keynes (1961), pp. 28,126). In our analysis the law is

 conditional, however,   upon   the interaction between the optimal level of

 accumulated assets and productive saving activity and. does not rely on any

 systematic association between time preference for consumption and wealth.

 It also should be noted that our result is stated         in terms   of a   negative associa-
 tion between    permanent income and the averg, but not the marginal propensity

 to consume.

             The preceding analysis may be applied ire directly in interpreting
 empirical, evidence on the average propensities to consume of different occupational
 and racial groups. Assuming       (as does Friedman (1957),     pp. 61, 80) that transi-
 tory   coiuponents of measured income and. consumption expenditures tend to average
                                                 33



out   to   zero across all income brackets of specific occupational and racial

groups, the average consumption          to   income ratios of these groups may serve

as    unbiased estimators of their average propensities to consume out of per-

manent income. Indeed, Table 1 contains evidence on average consumption to

average income ratios of independent business, farm, and other spending units

in   the United   States in l9l.8-5O    hich     appeai to be highly compatible with the

productive     saving hypothesis. The groups of farmers and.          independent business

units can    be distinguished from others in that they presumably are more
"specialized"     in   direct management of their assets and engage less 5n conventional
t?worktT relative to other groups. Not only are independent business units and.

farmers expected to allocate more resources into productive saving activities

relative     to those tho    specialize in wage earnings, also their specific human

capital--training      and   job   experience--is likely to be more complementary to
the management of their business assets. Consequently, we would. expect the
rate   of return on their nonhuman capital             (especially on equity in own business),

and. hence their average      propensity to save out of permanent income (especially

in the form of business assets), to be relatively high. Moreover, since independent

business units in the 1914.8-50 sample on the average have more income and pre-

sumablylarger portfolios of capital assets than              farmers, they are expected to
allocate    relatively more resources, own and          hired, into productive saving than
do farm units (many of which are farm laborers). Consequently, the average

propensity    to save of independent nonfamn business          units may indeed be expected.

to   be higher than that of farm units."
              The well-known permanent        income   hypothesis provides   an effective

and   systematic explanation for       cross-sectional differences between least squares

regression estimates of marginal propensities to consume out of measured income

and. income elasticities of consumption of different occupational groups by

 virtue of the different degrees to which variations in the total income of

 these groups are accounted for by variations in transitory components of

 income. However, it does not appear to offer similarly powerful explanations

 of systematic differences in the average consumption to income ratios of

 these groups. The main consideration raised by Friedman in connection with

 the evidence reported in Table 1 is that the relatively larger variance in

 transitory income obtained by business and farm units makes it optimal for

 them to save more than nonfarm, nonbusiness units for the purpose of building

up reserves for emergencies. By similar reasoning, however, the average pro-

 pensitytosave out of permanent incoae is also expected to be negatively re-

 lated to the ratio of nonhuman capital to permanent income, as the discussion

 in n. 25 indicates. Since the income of business and farm families derives to

a large extent from their nonhuman capitsi assets, the ratio of their nonhuman

assets to their permanent incomes should be markedly higher than that of other

families as an occupational prerequisite. Indeed, evidence based on the Survey

of Financial Characteristics of Cnsumers in 1963 shows that the ratio of mean

nonhuman wealth (including business assets) to mean income of self-employed units

j   about 7 as compared to 2 for salaried units. Even when business assets are

excluded, the nonhuman capital to income ratio of the self-employed is about 1j,

as compared to 1.8 for the salaried. (See Projector and Weiss (1966), Tables A8

and A3)-i-.)   The higher ratio of' nonhuman assets to permanent income of' business

fainilies might lessen the incentive in these groups to save for emergencies.

The productive saving hypothesis thus offers an independent and consistent in-

terpretation for differences in the average propensities to consume of these

different occupational groupings (also see Friedman (1957), pp. 69, 78).

               A second application of this analysis concerns the apparently

different average propensities to consume of black and. white families as

reported in Friedman (1957, Table 7). In each of ten comparisons of average

propensities to consume of black and white families in various city sizes in
                                         35

Northern   and Southern states, the ratio is higher for blacks than for their

white neighbors. Reference to systematic differences in the relative disper-

sion of transitory components of measured income across the two groups fails

to provide a consistent explanation for the evidence just mentioned: the rela-

tive dispersion of transitory components of incon of black families is estimated

to be higher than or equal to that of white families in three of the four Southn

communities included in the sample. Yet the average propensity to consume of

black families still appears higher thanthat of whites for all income classes.

On the productive saving hypothesis the relatively lower propensity to save of

black families can be consistently interpreted as a consequence of objective op-

portunities. Discrimination in real estate markets and in markets for certain

unincorporated businesses may limit the range of investment options available to

blacks just as labor market discrimination reduces their wage income opportunities.

Even if discrimination in ]abor markets affected earning opportunities more than

discrimination in capital markets, any presence of the latter implies that r(h)

would be lower for blacks than for whites at any given value of h. Moreover,

blacks generally possess smaller endowments of assets andacquire less (specific)

human capital than whites. Thus, the average propensity to save from permanent

income for black fi1ies might be lower than that for whites not because of

unique motivation or diferent time preference, but becaues of inferior oppor-

tunities for producing returns on noithuman assets.

              Although the productive saving model developed in this paper can

be applied in explanation of cross-sectional differences in average propensities

to consume,it is not directly applicable in explanation of secular trends in

the aggregate consumption to income ratios over time. The productive saving

hypothesis links cross-sectional differences in average propensities to

consume   to differences among consumption    units in their   private rates of return
on savings.    But while the theory identifies the basic factors affecting the

distribution    of private rates of return at a point in time, it   has no direct
                                        36


implications   for movements in the level of the distribution over time. The

latter essentially depends on market forces determining the real rates of

interest in the economy. Moreover, trends in the allocation of resources to

productive saving activities depend on the secular growth Of labor-market-

specific human capital relative to other human and nonhuman capital assets

as well as on structural trends in occupational coniposition in the economy.

Thus, the cross-sectional implications of the theory would be consistent

with a virtually zero correlation between permanent income per capita and

the   aggregate propensity to consume out of permanent income over time if, as
seems to be the case, the proportion of business and farm families iii the
economy decreased relative to the proportion of "wage   earnerstt   while the average
per   capita portfolio sizes increased over the long haul. A comprehensive

analysis of secular trends in the aggregate propensity to consume in light

of this model further requires consideration of secular trends in institutional

and technological factors bearing upon the degree of segmentation or "efficiencytt

of various capital markets and, thus, indirectly on private returns available

from search and   related asset management efforts.

Conclusion
             The thesis developed in this paper is that insofar as opportunities

for gains from saving activities by individuals exist in capital markets, the

rates of return on capital   assets will depend, in part,   on the amount and

efficiency of resources devoted to such activities. Accordingly, private

investment in information concerning the prospects of capital assets and other

related management efforts may be thought of as a special asset commanding a

unique market return. Since opportunities for productive saving activities

depend on the degree of segmentation in capital markets and the magnitude

of relevant transaction costs, the importance of the productive saving hypo-

thesis in explaining saving behavior may vary across different economies or

over time according to the degree of ttimperfectiofltt inherent in capital markets.

                Differences   in rates of return on portfolios of capital assets, or

private lending rates of interest, are       traced   exclusively to differences in

resource allocations to productive saving activities since the model is

developed on the simplifying        assumption   that individual attitudes toward risk

are   neutral, in practice, much of the variation in private rates of return
is    the result of differences in the     degree of objective risk associated with
portfolios.       The basic implications of the simple model developed here none-

theless are general since they apply to rates of return achieved on capital

assets classified in the same objective ttrisk class. tl A systematic study of

the full nature of the interdependence between productive saving, risk, and

return,    as   well as other generalizatiorof the model, are set aside for fu.ture

work.

                The set of behavioral implications that are obtained follows
essentially      from the hypothesized interactions between allocations of

resources to saving activities and the level of human and nonhuman capital

assets possessed by consumption units.            The main results concern the alloca-

tions of productive and consumptive resources throughout the life cycle and

the interd.ependencies among these allocations. The analysis indicates that

the magnitude of om, hired, and borrowed resources generally is an increasing

function of net worth. It also implies that the paths of human and nonhuman

capital accumulation together determine the allocation of productive resources

between wage and nonwage earnings generating activities. Some of the observed varia-

tion in the extent of participation in conventional "work" over the life cycle

might be explained through consideration          of nonhuman   capital   accumulation
paths as derived in Section III. The model generally provides a framework
for analysis of the determinants of self-emplo,ment n the management of
assets    relative to participation in conventional labor market activities.

                Since the magnitude of resources devoted to productive sawing, in

turn, affects the private rates of return on capital assets pertinent to con-

sumption    decisions, differences among    consumption units in their allocations       of
                                            38



 consumptive    resources over the life cycle may result largely from differences
in   their private rates of interest rather than in their subjective time        pref-
erences or attitudes toward      risk.    Perhaps the most intriguing behavioral

implications developed in this paper concern the association between levels

of human   and nonhuman wealth   and the average propensity      to consume out of
permanent   income, Under certain conditions the analysis can be used to re-

formulate Keynes' postulates concerning a positive association between the

propensity to save and wealth without resort to any systematic associatn

between time preference for consunrption and wealth. The analysis also provides

consistent explanations for evidence reported in the literature concerning

differences in average propensities to consume across occupational and racial

groups without reference to variations in transitory component. of measured

income. Our analysis complements the permanent income hypothesis in one

important sense. whereas the permanent income hypothesis provides a systematic

explanation for differences in statistical estimates of marginal and average

propensities to consume out of measured income, the productive saving hypothesis

provides a framework for analyzing       differences   in average propensities to com-

sume out   of   permanent income across different wealth and occupational groups.

Since our behavioral propositions are based upon systematic variation in

expected rates of return from capital assets in        the   same risk class, the em-

pirical ixixplementation   of the theory should begin by estimation of nonwage
eariiin genezating functions by relating risk adjusted levels of portfolio
returns to the basic determinants of the allocation of resources to productive
saving.

         1For an excellent survey of the literature pertaining to the "efficient

markets"hypothesis,    see Fama (1970). Although   the presentation of the h3rpo-

thesis in the literature is general and may be interpreted as applicable to
all markets for capital assets, the illustrations usually have related to the
markets    for securities.

         2For example, Scholes (1972) has presented evidence indicating that the

total adjustment of a price of a stock to a large secondary distribution of

that stock takes approximately six days. The evidence also indicates that the

sale period itself is too short to account for the entire length of the adjust-

ment period in the market.

         3For theoretical and empirical analyses bearing upon the role of educa-

tion in the efficient management of farm assets, see Welch (1970), Shultz (197tl),

and references therein. Differences in efficiency of management of agricultural

enterprises have been recognized in these studies in regard to the speed of

adoption of itmovations and the rapidity of adjustments in resource allocations

to changing market conditions.

         Neiderhoffer and Osborne (1966), Lone and Niederhoffer (1968), Scholes

(1969), and Jaffee (1973) present evidence suggesting that officers of corpor-

ations consistently utilize superior information regarding the performance of

stocks. A similar finding concerning specialists in major security exchanges

also is presented in Neiderhoffer and Osborne (1966). Specialists and corpor-

ation officers constitute a small fraction of all investors, but the question

as to whether deviations from the strong form conditon of the efficient markets

model reach further through the investment community has not yet been adequately

explored.
        5See Marshall (8th edition, l99, pp. 588, 599). Marshall noted in this

context that

    "A pawnbroker's business involves next to no risk; but his loans are made
    at the rate of 25 percent per annum or more; the greater parbof which is
    really earnings of management of a troublesome business. Or to take a
    more extreme example, there are men in London, and Paris, and probably
    elsewhere, who make a living by lending money to costermongers . . . at a
    profit of ten percent [per day]: there is little risk in the trade, and.
    the money is seldom lost .     . .. But
                                        no one can become rich by lending to
    costermongers . . .. The so-called interest on the loans really consists
    almost entirely of earnings of a kind of work for which few capital.sts
    have a taste."

We are indebted to Lawrence Fisher for pointing out this reference to us.

        6The overall, expected rate of return on northunian capital generally can

be thought of as consisting of two parts



                    r    r(O) +   rth   r' (h) dh   0 < h < ht


where r(O) is the expectedrate of return with no saving activity, and r'(h)

is an additional expected yield achieved through efficient selection and man-

agement activities. It may be noted that the expected rate of return is de-

fined in equation (1.3) as a function of current saving activity only. A more

general formulation of the productive saving hypothesis would relate r to

past periodst allocation of time and otherresources to productive saving as

well. For simplicity, (the effect of) past experience is subsumed under the"en-

dowment" of human capital H0.


        7The terminal stock of capital is given by the equation

(1.8) is easily derived.

        8Equation (1.lOa) is derived on the assumption that 't-l = 0.                            For

a simple illustration of the solution when rt is defined as a direct function

of Kt1, see n. 10. The sufficient conditions for values of the control

variables satisfying equations (1.lOa-l.lOd) to maximize equation (1.9) require

that the principal minors of the relevant bordered Hessian matrix of second-

order derivatives alternate in sign.

        9The effect of an exogenous increase in Kti on the optimal value of

ht, for ht > 0,          can be found by differentiating equation (1.12) with respect

positive, then the consumption transformation curve AC depicted in Figure 3

would be convex toward the origin if, and only if,

We do not expect the direct negative effect of K on r to dominate its in-

direct effect on r through its positive effect on h except, perhaps, at very

high levels of asset holdings. In that case,                                       would be negative in sign
                                                                          dKti
and the transformation curve AC in Figure 3 might be concave toward the origin.


       11Specifically,         Tt
                                    =0     (or                     1) implies zero time preference for

X1 relative to X. This form of the utility function and the following

analysis leading to equation (1.16) are entirely based upon that of Becker

(1971,   pp.     192-193). For       a related analysis, see Modigliani and Bruinberg                    (1951i-).


       l2 alternative formulation of equations (1.lla), (l.l5a), and (l.16a)
can be achieved by redefining the choice variable K in terms of a "perpetual"
sequence of one-period endowments of the composite good X                               that   can be gener-
ated   by    the terminal stock of capital beginning at period n +                         1   and   extending
indefinitely:       X =
                          dK,       where 0 < d < 1 is, say, an "institutional" yield
per unit of bequeathed capital. This approach is an application of the general

treatment of the problem of intertemporal decision-making as a choice between

current consumption and perpetual or permanent future income flows (see

Hirshleifer(197'O), p. 69).   If this definition of the choice variable implicit
in      is valid, equation (i.16a) can be rewritten as


                          log     =
                                      o(log   d. -
                                                      T)   .                 (l.16b)

Equation (l.16b) indicates that X would be smaller than X if the con-

sumption i.mit had neutral (time) preference for own consumption in period n

relative to an annuity of consumption opportunities bequeathed to heirs, since

log d < 0. If wage earnings and saving activity in period n were nil, the

condition X < Xn would also imply that               < K1. Savings in the final

period of the planning horizon then would necessarily be negative.

     Hirshleifer (1958) showed that the separation theorem implicit in the

assumption of "perfect capital marketst' collapses whenever there is a divergence

between the market's borrowing and lending rates of interest. The preceding

statement can be viewed as a generalization of Hirshleifer's famous result;

the separation theorem collapses even in the case of net lenders, since the

gross lending rates of interest are not constant.


     lsince the length of a period in any discrete time analysis is arbitrary,

there is no loss of generality in this assumption. Alternatively, funds bor-

rowed for a duration of more than one period can. be looked upon as two separate

loans taken on successive marketing dates, the latter designated to pay off

the principal and interest on the previously maturing loans.


     15The marginal as well as the average borrowing cost of capital can be

expected to rise with the amount      borrowed if only because of seentation in
 capital markets that arises from transaction costs and      legal   restrictions on

 certain kinds of borrowing. In addition, the probability of default, as per-

 ceived by the lending institution, is likely to rise with the consumption unit's

debt-equity ratio even if the true risk per dollar of borrowing were constant

or nil (for a discussion of similar arguments in the context of corporate fi-

nance, see Fisher (1959) and Stiglitz (1972)). However, the effect of an in-

crease in Dti. need not be symmetrical to that of a decrease in Nt_i. In

the following analysis,    "b" denotes the average borrowing rate of interest.

     l6rrowing    in order to finance the purchase of durable        goods including
own houses does not belong in this category since it is      essentially determined
according to whether it is more economical to rent the services yielded by

durable goods or to own them. Thus it is largely independent of time prefer-

ence for consumption   and can   be considered as special borrowing for productive

saving that does not involve future management costs.

     17Let the investor's initial net worth and his initial asset holdings be

given by N1 and K1 in Figure ii. below       and assume that he then finds it op-
timal to increase his current outlays on consumption by LC. He can follow

one of two policies to accomplish that. Policy 1 requires a reduction in his

net worth from N1 to N0, where         N1 - N0   N =   LC.   By the forthcoming

analysis of optimal borrowing for productive saving, the investor's optimal

asset holdings then would fall by an even greater amount from
                                                                      K1 to K0
(see n. 20). Policy 2 requires additional borrowings in the amount of LC.

That policy thus amounts to a decision to keep intact the initial level of

asset holdings at K1, notwithstanding e decrease in N from
                                                                         N1 to N0.
Clearly, Policy 1 is superior to Policy 2. In comparison to 1, Policy 2 gen-

erates higher returns but even higher borrowing costs. The net loss associated

with 2 relative to 1 is represented by the triangular area APB in Figure !..

from which equation (2.) is easily derived. This differentiation assumes

that r is not a direct function of K. If it were, the term r(h) in equa-

tion (2.5) would be replaced by MRRt =
           t K1                                       r(ht,Kt       i)(l +    rk'      where

5rIc =
          Kti        rt
          19Equation (3.6) implies that

                                                                    Dt1)    r"(h)] .                (2.6a)

The left-hand side of equation (2.6a) is the slope of the supply curve of bor-

rowed     funds in Figure 3,        MbC,    and the right-hand side can easily be shown
to be equal to dr(h)/dKti =                r' (h) dh/dKti (see n. 9).                  The   latter ex-
pression     represents the slope of        the demand curve for productive capital de-
picted by r(h(Kti)) in Figure .                   The     curve r must then cut the relevant
MbC curve from above as Figure 4 illustrates.

         20The effect of an exogenous increase in Nti on the optimal values of

Dt_i and t-          can be determined by differentiating                   the first-order optimality
conditions     given in equations (2.4) and (2.5) with respect to Nt_i. It is

then seen that if r(ht)/Kt1 = 0,                   then

since r"(ht) < 0 and                      is assumed negative in sign. The geometrical

proof illustrated in Figure           is based        on the following reasoning. If MbC

were just a function of Dti, then MbC1 would be a horizontal translate of
MbCQ, indicated by the curve CC, with the horizontal distance between the two

being equal to AN =            -           Even then, AK =                 -             would exceed AN.

Moreover, since MbC is assumed to be a decreasing function of N, MbC1 would

lie below the auxiliary curve CC at any level of Kt_i. Clearly, then, the in-

crease in K would exceed the increase in N. It should be noted, however,

that if the marginal rate of return on assets were a decreasing function of the

size of asset holdings (see the discussion in n. 10), then the curve r(Kt1)

in Figure 1, interpreted as indicating the marginal gross rate of return on

capital, would be a domward-sioping curve. It might then be possible for an

exogenous increase in N to lead to a reduction in the amount borrowed for

productive saving. For evidence consistent with the proposition that the in-

dividual portfolio sizes are positively correlated with debt secured by in-

vestment assets, see Projector and Weiss (1966), Table Al4.

     21Given the one-period resource constraint as summarized by equation (2.2),

the modified equation of motion (3.3) can be derived by sri analysis similar to

the one pursued in n. 22 and shown equal to


                  =   [1 +     r(ht1)      -
                                               Dt_i   bt(Nt          Nt_i - Nt       ,              (3.3a)

where _Dti b'(Nt1) is, by assumption, positive if                                    > 0. Clearly, the

qualitative implications of equation (3.3a) are the same as those inferred from

(3.3). Note that these implications would not be affected even if it were

assumed that r(ht,1Vt1)/Nt1 0. In such a case, r(ht+1) in equation

(3.3a) would be replaced by t+l' where MRR                                 is       defined in n. 18.

Assuming that tht is sufficiently small,                                   0, the difference

r (ht÷i) -
             r(ht)   can be approximated by r' (ht )                  h,            and the second term on

the right-hand side of equation (4.2), Kti[r(ht÷i) -                                    r(ht)]    can be approxi-

mated by _Kt1 r'(ht)A(t .              By collecting terms, we obtain equation (3.2).

      231n addition, as investments in human capital accumulate, they become

more specific and thus more risky to the investor. Relaxing our simplifying

assumption concerning neutral attitudes toward risk, we may conclude that a

risk-averse consumption unit would then seek to diversify its asset holdings

through the building of a positive stock of noithuman assets preceded, perhaps,

by a period of initial dissaving or net borrowing to finance investment in

human capital.


      24m      prediction      is compatible with evidence reported by Becker concern-

ing the association between the mean number of hours worked in the labor market

by male cohorts of given educational and racial groups, the mean hourly earnings,

and the nonwage family income of the same cohorts. The evidence based on the

1/1000 sample from the 1960            Census shows that an increase in hourly earnings
                                         1i8


increases the number of hours worked and that an increase in nonwage family

income reduces it at given average family size and age of the respective male

cohorts(see Ghez and Becker (1972, Ch. Iii). In Becker and GhezTs analysis,

changes in hours of work over the life cycle are expected to be independent of

anticipated changes in nonwage income (or initial net worth') since their model

does not recognize saving activity as an alternative to work and consumption

ac1ivities.

      25Friedman argues, however, that k may increase with the ratio of

nonhuman capital to permanent income K/Yr,       because   nonhuman capital, being

more "liquid" and a better collateral against loans than human capital, pro-

vides a superior means of insurance against emergency consumption needs. An

increase in K/Yr thus reduces the need to save for emergency funds at any

given level of permanent income (see Friedman (1957), p. 16). With neutral

attitudes toward risk our    analysis   below implies that the absolute level of

nonhuman wealth and possibly even its ratio to permanent income may be posi-

tively related to the propensity to save. Empirical evidence compatible with

this latter prediction thus would indicate the relative importance of the pro-

ductive saving hrpothesis in explaining observed behavior.

      26m     result   holds even if working and leisure time were not assumed

to be constant in each period but were assumed to vary with wealth. Given

the market price of time, w0, then by equation (1.12) or (2.1.1.) the abso-

lute magnitudes of h and r, hence the slope of the consumption trans-

formation curve, are uniquely related to the level of accumulated net worth

as long as labor market time were positive. Furthennor,insofar as productive

saving involved employment of hired factors, r(K) would generally be in-

variant to changes in wealth. As our      discussion   in Section I indicates,

                                                                                     .
                                             I9


the optimal employment of hired factors, being determined through wealth maxi-

mizing principles, is an increasing function of K and is independent of the

consumption   unit's ealth constraint as well as its wage earnings.

        27Utilizing   the preceding two-period analysis and assuming that optimal

bequest is positive, the ratio of the discounted life time consumption to total

wealth is given by
                                             -
                                                  K2
                                   m1=                 <1
                                              2

and   the ratio of the undiscounted life time consumption to life time income is

given by

                          x1 +x2           x1 +x2           x1 +x2
                      —           —                    —
                m1 —
                          + E + rK1       W2 - rX1           + K2 +


where    Y1 denotes total income receipts, iiicluding the initial endowments ob-

tained, in period 1. Clearly, any         change in W2 that increases the ratios
x2/x1 and K2/X1 by the same proportion necessarily decreases both m1

and

        28i the two period-no-bequest model7 consumption in the second period

equals the total amount of resources available in that period: X2 = K1p(h2) + E2.

By definition, x2/w2 = [K1p(h2) +E2]/[Y1P(h2) +E2], where                 is defined

in n. 27. Clearly, X2        and          are positive linear transformations of     K1
and Y1. Thus                1 -
                                  K1/Y1
                                           is a decreasing function of x2/w2. The same

result obtains if bequest is positive, since the ratio K2/X2 is assumed to be

 independent of wealth.


         9Future income endowments consist of potential wage income only.

 Consequently, the endowment position E could shift along ray           CE'   fol-


 lowing an increase in H only if current income endowments also consisted

 solely of wage income.
                                            50


        30
             Solmo,n (1971) reported a positive zero-order correlation between

 mean savings to income ratios of families classified by schooling attainments

 of their heads and the head's educational ranking. However, he has not con-

 trolled for the families' net worth or their age distribution.

        31Some evidence in support of increasing average propensities to con-

 sunie out of permanent income is reported by Crocket and Friend (1967).      They

have attempted to estimate permanent or "normal" income from-cross-sectional

data containing observations of the samehouseholdformorethanoneyear. A

principal finding of their regression analysis is that the ratio of net worth to nor-

mal income increases with income when the age of the household's head is

held   constant. They suggest that this finding is inconsistent with saving
theories which contend that permanent savings is a constant fraction of
permanent income.

       321t   should be noted that the statistics reported in Table 1 have been

derived by summing data on consumption and income over all imcome and age

brackets sampled in the nationwide surveys of consumer finances covering

191l8, 19119 and 1950 incomes. One interpretation of these statistics is that

they approximate the undiscounted ratios of life time consumption to life time

income of consuniptionunits in different occupational groups. Given a stationary

equi1ibrj wIth no bequest, these ratios would be unitary across all groups.

However, with optimal bequest being positive, the average undiscounted life

time consumption to life time income would be 1es than unitary and our theore-

tical analysis would be compatible with the ranking of the statistics reported

in Table las our discussion in n. 27 indicates.

         An alternative interpretation of the ratios reported in Table 1 is that

they approximate, on the average, "current" consumption to inccme ratios of

consumption units    of   age brackets in which savings is positive (say, age l-0;
                                      51


an assumption of this kind is made in a similar context in Friedman (1957, p. 92)).

Given this interpretation, our theoretical analysis, again, is compatible with

the ranking of the consumption to income ratios in Table 1, as the discussion in

n. 28 indicates.


        Other data concerning the ranking of propensities to save of dif-

ferent occupational groups alsoare consistent with this analysis. For exam-

ple, Klein (1960) reports relatively higher rates of saving among entre-

preneurial groups. He also shows that the self-employed save more than

other families principally because of their business savings. More generally,

Friend and Kravis (1957) show that saving rates of different occupational

groups are closely correlated with the average income of these groups.
