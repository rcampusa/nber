                                            ABSTRACT

This chapter surveys work in behavioral public economics, emphasizing the normative
implications of non-standard decision making for the design of welfare-improving and/or optimal
policies. We highlight combinations of theoretical and empirical approaches that together can
produce robust qualitative and quantitative prescriptions for optimal policy under a range of
assumptions concerning consumer behavior. The chapter proceeds in four parts. First, we discuss
the foundations and methods of behavioral welfare economics, focusing on choice-oriented
approaches and the measurement of self-reported well-being. Second, we examine commodity
taxes and related policies: we summarize research on optimal corrective taxes, the efficiency
costs of sales taxes that are not fully salient, the distributional effects of sin taxes, the use of non-
price policies such as nudges, the tax treatment of giving, and luxury taxes. Third, we examine
policies affecting saving, including capital income taxation, commitment opportunities, default
contribution provisions for pension plans, financial education, and mandatory saving programs.
Fourth, we detail the manner in which under-provision of labor supply and misunderstandings of
policy instruments impact optimal labor income taxation and social insurance. We close with
some recommendations for future work in behavioral public economics.

1        Introduction
The standard economic approach to policy evaluation relies on the assumption of rational revealed

preferences, which holds that people always choose what is best for them, that their choices do not

depend on seemingly inconsequential frames, and that the preferences revealed by their choices

are transitive and complete. This assumption may seem stringent from a psychological perspective.

Nevertheless, it is at the heart of modern Public Economics because it directly connects theory

and data. Within the rational choice paradigm, economists can often quantify the welfare eects

of policies involving commodity taxes, income taxes, unemployment insurance benets, and savings

incentives using only a few measurable, high-level statistics, such as the elasticity of consumption

or labor with respect to the tax rate.             In a eld often concerned with quantitative evaluation of

real-world policies, revealed preferences is a powerful and seemingly crucial identifying assumption.

        Even so, the ostensible purpose of many important public policies is to address the concern that

people do not always choose what is best for them, and that the determinants of consumer behavior

extend beyond narrow self-interested optimization. For example, many countries have established

government bureaus that oer consumer protection to guard against the possibility that rms may

attempt to exploit unsophisticated buyers.
                                                       1   A number of countries have also created behavioral

insights teams, the role of which is to leverage ndings from psychology and Behavioral Economics

to formulate more eective government policies.
                                                              2   Policy makers often justify otherwise standard

policies such as sin taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, sugary drinks, and similar goods on the grounds

that they discourage harmful behaviors.                Motivations for consumer-facing energy policy include

the possibility that people may undervalue energy-ecient goods and overvalue energy-inecient

ones due to a defective telescopic faculty (Hausman, 1979). Arguments for mandatory retirement

savings programs often reference consumer myopia (Feldstein and Liebman, 2002).

        The existence of such policies, combined with a large and growing body of empirical work in Be-

havioral Economics, suggests that the standard approach in Public Economics to policy evaluation

may yield misleading conclusions about the welfare eects of some policies, and are simply inappli-

cable to other policies that inuence behavior through framing eects, such as those that determine

salience.       The rapidly expanding literature in Behavioral Public Economics (henceforth BPE)

combines the methods and insights from Behavioral Economics and Public Economics to extend

the public-economics toolbox, thereby allowing for more robust evaluations of real-world policies,

to develop innovative policy tools, and to explain why consumers' responses to policy incentives are

sometimes anomalous (Chetty, 2015).

        This handbook chapter summarizes the emerging eld of BPE. A comparison with Bernheim

and Rangel (2007), which assessed the state of the nascent eld roughly a dozen years ago, reveals

that progress has been dramatic. Our focus is on the normative questions that have historically

Consumer Protection in Germany, the Competition and Consumer Commission in Australia, and the Financial
Conduct Authority in the U.K. See the OECD 2017 report for a summary of over 100 applications of behavioral
insights by government bureaus and sectors across the world.

        As of the writing of this chapter, such countries include the U.K., U.S., Australia, and Singapore.

played central roles in the eld of Public Economics; we are not primarily concerned with research

that only aims to describe the positive eects of government policies. There are at least two ways

to organize such a chapter: we could focus on substantive policies, considering relevant behavioral

phenomena in each instance, or on behavioral phenomena, describing the various policy implications

in each instance. Consistent with our substantive focus, we adopt the rst of these approaches. The

challenge for BPE that we seek to highlight throughout this chapter is the need to maintain the

tight link between empirically measurable statistics and welfare estimates, while moving beyond the

revealed preferences assumption.

   The merger of Behavioral Economics and Public Economics has required the formulation and

renement of new paradigms for evaluating economic welfare. Accordingly, the chapter begins in

Section 2 with a review of recent developments involving the foundations of Behavioral Welfare

Economics. We distinguish between two main schools of thought, one that employs choice-oriented

methods, another that relies on measures of self-reported well-being. We articulate the foundations

for each approach, explain strategies for implementation, and discuss limitations. Additional topics

include paternalism and alternatives to welfarism.

   While Section 2 focuses on foundational conceptual issues such as the nature of economic welfare

and the denition of a mistake, as well as on classes of empirical strategies for quantifying mistakes,

the next three sections examine concrete aspects of policy design and evaluation, as well as empirical

implementation. The general conceptual framework usefully disciplines the applications, sometimes

in subtle and surprising ways, and it claries their interpretation. However, readers whose interests

lie in concrete policy analysis will nd that it is possible to read Sections 3 through 5 without rst

absorbing all of Section 2.

   In Section 3 we summarize research on policies targeting commodities. We use a simple model

to illustrate how changes in the commodity tax aect social welfare when a bias arises either from

consumption internalities (i.e., people over- or under-consume a particular good) or from a lack

of tax salience.   We also explain how to incorporate redistributive concerns, as many sin taxes

are regressive. We summarize existing empirical estimates and empirical approaches that facilitate

robust implementation of the commodity tax formulas. We end by mentioning some implications

of social preferences for commodity taxation, and by reviewing the potential roles of non-tax policy

instruments, such as information provision and graphic warning labels.

   Section 4 reviews research concerning policies that target personal saving. We begin by sum-

marizing two behavioral themes that have played important roles in this literature: imperfect self

control, and limited nancial sophistication. From there we turn to capital income taxation, which

we explore as an application of the principles developed in Section 3.       Other policy instruments

include features of special savings accounts, such as opportunities for commitment and default

options.   We use simple models to explore the use of each instrument, and discuss strategies for

deploying them in combination. We close the section with discussions of other related policies, such

as nancial education, choice simplication, and mandatory saving.

   In Section 5 we turn to policies targeting earnings. Analogously to Section 3, we provide a simple




                                                   3
formula for optimal income taxation in the presence of biases that lead to either under- or over-

provision of labor, or that foster inattention to, or misperception of, the tax. We use the formula

to guide a discussion of theoretical work involving more complex models, as well as related research

on social insurance programs designed to address medical needs, unemployment, and other adverse

developments. We summarize empirical studies that yield estimates of the key parameters appearing

in the formula, and point out that many of the rationality failures documented in the literature can

be good for social welfare. We also discuss the feasibility of using the mechanism design approach

to optimal income taxation when consumers are behavioral, as well as the possibility of motivating

labor supply through non-tax instruments.

    Section 6 concludes with a discussion of challenges for future work.

    Despite the length of this chapter, we have not attempted to canvas the eld comprehensively.

Rather, our object has been to provide a somewhat unied perspective on a reasonably large col-

lection of themes that we regard as important. We could make a strong case in favor of covering

many other papers and topics. To the authors of those papers, we oer our apologies.




2     Behavioral Welfare Economics
Normative questions are central to the eld of public economics. For well over half a century, the

dominant approach to those questions was rooted in the paradigm of revealed preference, which

instructs us to infer objectives and welfare from choices.    But behavioral economics teaches us

that choices are not always consistent. While we have achieved some insight into the sources of that

inconsistency, many puzzles and controversies remain. How can we make coherent statements about

welfare when the choices to which we look for guidance are inconsistent for reasons we do not fully

understand? In this section, we briey review the leading approaches to welfare analysis in settings

with behavioral agents. For more complete discussions of these issues, see Bernheim (2016; 2018).



2.1 What is welfare?
Meaningful measurement requires a clear conceptual understanding of what one is trying to measure.

Accordingly, we begin with a foundational question: what is economic welfare? To be clear, our

focus here is on the denition of individual well-being. We address the important issue of social

aggregation below in Section 2.2.7.



Accounts of well-being.         Philosophers often divide accounts of well-being into three broad

classes. The following labels and one-line summaries are from Kagan (1998); see also Part (1984)

and Grin (1986).


    1. Welfare hedonism : Well-being consists solely in the presence of pleasure and the absence of

      pain.   Classical economists such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Benthan advocated forms

      of welfare hedonism. To the extent modern economists sympathize with this view, they are




                                                  4
         usually drawn to a variant called mental statism, which holds that well-being is exclusively a

         reection of mental states.


   2. Preference theory : Well-being consists in having one's preference satised. To be clear, the

         question here is whether preferences are satised in reality  in other words, whether the

         world is as the individual would like it to be, rather than whether she believes this to be

         the case.    However, generalized versions of preference theory allow for the possibility that

         the individual's preferences encompass their own mental states, which may depend on their

         understanding of outcomes. Modern economics rmly embraces preference theory.


   3. Objective theories : Well-being is a matter of having certain goods in one's life, goods that

         are simply worth having, objectively speaking, irrespective of whether one prefers them or

         not. The classic statement of this perspective is due to Aristotle (2012, translation). For a

         more contemporary expression, see Sen (1985), who denes welfare in terms of basic functio-

         nings, such as nourishment.
                                            3   Objective theories have received considerably less attention in

         behavioral public economics than the alternatives.


The following example illustrates why it is important to think through foundational issues concerning

the denition of welfare when practicing behavioral welfare economics.



The parable of the oblivious altruist.                  A small town in Arkansas experiences massive ooding,

leaving many families homeless.              To provide nancial assistance for the impacted families, the

government raises taxes, including a $100 levy on Norman. As a general matter, Norman thinks

government spending is wasteful, but he is also an altruist, and would gladly contribute $100 to the

fund if he knew about it. However, he never learns about the ood or the relief eort. Does the

government's policy make him better o or worse o ?

       According to welfare hedonism, external states such as the true status of impacted families in

Arkansas matter to Norman only insofar as they aect his internal states. Because he assumes

his incremental taxes fund low-value government projects, the relief eort degrades the quality of

his internal states.       Welfare hedonists must therefore conclude that the aid initiative reduces his

well-being.

       According to preference theory, the true state of the world determines Norman's well-being.

Because the government actually uses the incremental taxes to assist impacted families, and because

Norman would approve of this expense if he understood it, those adhering to simple versions of

preference theory must conclude that the initiative makes him better o.

       The example is instructive because neither conclusion is entirely satisfactory. On the one hand,

welfare hedonism elevates perceptions over truth and applauds happy delusions. On the other hand,

simple preference theory fails to account for the genuine psychic costs that may result from Norman's

misconceptions.

   3
       In some respects, Sen's discussion of functionings is preference-theoretic, inasmuch as he argues that people likely
have similar preferences over functionings.




                                                              5
       A more satisfactory account of well-being follows from a generalized version of preference theory

in which desires encompass both external and internal states. Imagine, for example, that Norman

knows legitimate needs arise from time to time, such as those of the Arkansas ood victims. Ac-

cording to this theory, if he would prefer to live in a world where the government addresses those

needs when they come up as a matter of policy regardless of his awareness, then the hypothesized

initiative enhances his well-being. However, if he would prefer to live in a world where the govern-

ment addresses those needs only when he is aware of them, then the same initiative reduces his

well-being. Under this theory, Norman's own preferences determine the relative weights attached

to his internal mental states versus external reality.
                                                                 4

       The relevance of this example to behavioral economics should be clear.                     We are frequently

concerned with settings in which people may misunderstand the consequences of their choices.

In those cases, does well-being depend on the imagined state of aairs, the real state of aairs, or

both? The answer to this question fundamentally shapes the conclusions that follow from normative

economic analyses.



2.2 Choice-oriented methods
Implementation of preference theory requires us to identify empirical expressions of consumers'

desires. In classical welfare analysis, choices serve this role.
                                                                           5   Naturally, there are other potential

windows into preferences, and we address them in the course of the discussion below.



2.2.1        The behavioral critique of standard welfare economics

Bernheim (2016; 2018) articulates the preference-theoretic premises for standard welfare economics

as follows (see also Hausman, 2012):


       â¢   Premise 1 : Each individual is the best judge of their own well-being.


       â¢   Premise 2 : A single coherent, stable preferences governs each individual's judgments.


       â¢   Premise 3 : Each individual's preferences determine their choices: when they choose, they

           seek the greatest benet according to their own judgment.


Signicantly, these premises do not require one to take a rigid philosophical stand on the precise

nature of well-being.        Instead, one can leave such matters to the individual.               For the parable of

   4
       While the generalized version of preference theory oers more satisfactory normative prescriptions than the simple
version, implementation is especially challenging. For example, it is dicult to see how one elicits preferences over
deluded states of mind without identifying and hence removing the delusions. As a result, simple preference theory
often provides the implicit philosophical foundations for practical exercises in behavioral welfare economics.
   5
       Confusion can arise, however, because philosophers and economists sometimes use the word preference die-
rently. To illustrate, imagine Norman chooses a sour apple over a pear, believing incorrectly that the apple is sweet.
Some philosophers would say that, by virtue of his choice, Norman demonstrates a preference for the sour apple over
the pear. This perspective leads to certain criticisms of preference theory (see, e.g., Hausman, 2012). An economist
would distinguish between preferences and beliefs: Norman prefers a sweet apple to a pear, and falsely believes the
sour apple to be sweet. According to that perspective, the problem lies in Norman's beliefs, not in his preferences.




                                                             6
the oblivious altruist, we can be philosophically agnostic as to whether the true and/or imagined

state of aairs contributes to welfare, and defer to each individual's own judgment, as reected in

appropriate choices.
                         6   Some see this agnosticism as an advantage of the preference theory approach.

       Behavioral economics arguably calls for a new welfare paradigm because it challenges the validity

of these premises. Fallibility critiques call Premise 1 into question on the grounds that people do

not or cannot reliably exercise good judgment.              Consistency critiques highlight the sensitivity of

our choices to apparently irrelevant contextual features of decision problems, a phenomenon that

implies either a lack of coherent and stable objectives (contrary to Premise 2), or a loose connection

between preferences and choices (contrary to Premise 3). Aggressive versions of consistency critiques

raise the possibility that the concepts of true preferences and aggregate experienced utility are

ctions  that we do not aggregate the many diverse aspects of our experience until we are called

upon to do so for a given purpose, such as making a choice or answering a question about our well-

being, at which point, instead of accessing and applying pre-existing preferences, we construct (or

assemble) our judgments (see, e.g., Lichtenstein and Slovic, 2006).
                                                                                   7   This perspective attributes

context-dependent choice to the vagaries of aggregation: dierent circumstances may render dierent

aspects of experience more or less salient, and thus change the weights attached to them during the

process of preference construction.



2.2.2        Behavioral Revealed Preference

Many economists are reluctant to relinquish the core assumption that people have coherent, sta-

ble preferences, or the normative dictum that those preferences ought to govern welfare analyses.

Accordingly, they attribute the phenomena animating the fallibility and consistency critiques to

features of decision processes that ostensibly distort true preferences. To construct formal theories

of decision making, they supplement standard models with additional elements representing the

cognitive biases that arguably give rise to those distortions.

       Unfortunately, choice data can shed only so much light on the parameters of such models.

Accordingly, if one hopes to recover preferences, one must adopt a reasonably parsimonious repre-

sentation of the pertinent biases. Bernheim (2016; 2018) summarizes the core principle underlying

this approach, known as behavioral revealed preference (or sometimes model-based behavioral welfare

economics ) as follows:


       â¢   The Principle of Behavioral Revealed Preference (BRP): If enough is known about the process

           mapping preferences to choices, then one can invert it conditional on its unknown parameters,

           and recover both those parameters and preferences from choice data.

   6
       These choices may be unconventional and dicult to implement, but one can visualize them in principle. For
Norman, we might seek to elicit the compensating variation for learning the true disposition of the incremental taxes,
stipulating that the memory of the decision would be erased upon making the choice.
   7
       The hypothesis that people construct their judgments contextually may help to explain why stated preferences
dier systematically from actual choices; see, for example, Harrison and Rutstrom (2008). If it were possible simply to
access preexisting preferences, consumers would presumably be able to access and state those preferences accurately,
even in the absence of choice. Instead, it appears that people do not actually know what they will choose until they
choose it.



                                                           7
As an example, analyses positing biased beliefs fall within this paradigm. The typical study of this

type supplements the standard von Neumann-Morgenstern model of decision making under uncer-

tainty with an account of systematic divergences between beliefs and objective probabilities. Under

appropriate assumptions, and with sucient data, one can both measure the bias and estimate the

other parameters of the utility function. Substituting the objective probabilities for the distorted

beliefs, one then obtains true preferences.           Koszegi and Rabin (2008b) illustrate this approach

by modeling a particular bias (the gambler's fallacy) in a setting where a decision maker bets on

repeated ips of an objectively fair coin, and showing that one can in principle recover both beliefs

and risk preferences from choices.          See Sections 2.2.3 and 3.2.3 for further discussions of biased

beliefs. We discuss many other examples in subsequent sections of this chapter.

       An attraction of this approach is that it accommodates behavioral economics by departing only

modestly from the underlying perspectives of standard welfare analysis.                   However, the apparent

simplicity of the approach can be deceptive. We turn our attention next to the main complications

and challenges encountered when applying the behavioral revealed preference paradigm.



The nature of consumers' limited concerns.                       All choice-oriented welfare methods require

the practitioner to take a stand on the aspects of experience that contribute to well-being.                      The

very concept of a delimited consumption bundle implicitly distinguishes between experiences that

intrinsically matter to the individual and those that do not. The dimensions of that bundle provide

the analyst's answer to the question, what do people care about?

       The BRP paradigm allows for the possibility that decisions depend on conditions that have no

direct bearing on well-being, but that instead impact biases.               Once the analyst takes a stand on

the aspects of experience that contribute to well-being, the identity of these conditions, known as

decision frames, follows as an implication.

       As an illustration, suppose we ask Norman to order his lunch for a scheduled meeting one week

in advance. Whether he selects a sandwich or a salad may depend on whether we require him to

decide at 1pm after he has just eaten, or at 4pm when he's hungry (Read and van Leuwen, 1998).

Here, the natural assumption is that Norman's concerns, and hence his consumption bundle, only

encompass food items, in which case the decision frame consists of the time at which he makes his

choice. A BRP model might account for the framing eect by positing that hunger (or alternatively

the absence thereof ) induces a cognitive bias.

       Bernheim (2016; 2018) points out that the BRP paradigm inextricably links the notion of a

framing eect to the concept of a bias.           If the choices of a consumer with a coherent and stable

preference relation vary across decision frames (as in our motivating example), then bias must of

necessity infect some of those choices. Conversely, whenever a choice suers from a hypothesized

bias, one can imagine a reframed version that removes the cause.
                                                                           8   In some applications, the reframed

   8
       As a purely logical matter, one can of course imagine environments in which cognitive processes   always distort
choices. However, if there is no context within which an individual expresses a judgment consistent with the optimal
choice according to a BRP model, then there is no empirical foundation for claiming that the model correctly captures
his true preferences. As an example, imagine that there are no conceivable circumstances under which Norman would




                                                           8
choice problem has an obvious empirical counterpart. If Norman's hunger is the source of bias when

choosing at 4pm, then moving his decision time to 1pm facilitates an unbiased choice.                     In other

applications, the reframed choice problem is merely a potentiality. For example, if a consumer holds

biased beliefs concerning events that occur with known probabilities, one could imagine replacing the

naturally occurring (and potentially confusing) information structure with a transparent alternative,

such as drawing balls from an urn. One can interpret the welfare-optimal alternative according to

a BRP model of biased beliefs as the choice the consumer would make in this reframed setting

(assuming it successfully removes the cause of the bias).

    Dierent assumptions about the scope of consumers' concerns lead to dierent implications

about the nature of framing eects and biases. To appreciate this point, notice that our motivating

example admits a second interpretation:             Norman's well-being depends not only on the food he

eats, but also on what he orders and when he orders it. In that case there are no decision frames,

and arguably no biases: Norman acts on his true preferences at all points in time, despite making

time-dependent selections.

    This alternative interpretation of Norman's behavior suggests a variant of the BRP approach,

wherein the analyst expands the assumed boundaries of the consumer's concerns until all incon-

sistencies disappear, and then proceeds as if there are no biases.                  Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001)

analysis of temptation preferences fall within this category. They account for various patterns com-

monly associated with time inconsistency by assuming that consumption bundles consist not only

of the items consumed, but also of the menus from which consumers select them. Both of these

applications place aspects of the decision problem, rather than merely the selected item, within

the scope of consumers' concerns, thereby raising a complication that we discuss momentarily (the

Non-comparability Problem).

    In practical applications, nding objective criteria for drawing lines between decision frames and

elements of the consumption bundle can prove challenging. Because one can in principle rationalize

virtually any behavior as a reection of either framing eects or exotic preferences, valid justications

for drawing the lines one way rather than another inherently hinge on non-choice evidence.                    We

mention some possible empirical approaches in Section 2.2.4.

    Unfortunately, as we discuss next, intuition concerning consumers' concerns can sometimes steer

the analysis into conceptually treacherous waters.



The Non-comparability Problem.                    In some applications, it may seem natural to assume that

the experience of choosing falls within the scope of the consumer's concerns.                      For example, if

Norman chooses a sandwich when salad is available, he may feel guilty, and if he chooses salad

when a sandwich is available, he may enjoy greater self-respect. Unfortunately, these possibilities

raise conceptual challenges for choice-based welfare analysis.

    The following example illustrates how seemingly sensible assumptions about consumers' concerns

order salad for lunch.   An economist theorizes that Norman actually prefers salad, but suers from a pervasive
cognitive bias. While this theory is logically consistent, it is also untethered from the facts.

can lead to diculties.
                             9   Suppose we task Norma with dividing a sum of money between herself and

a friend.     Norma is averse to bearing the responsibility for leaving her friend with nothing when

other options are available. Consequently, no matter how the task is framed, she divides the money

equally.     However, she is inherently selsh and fervently wishes someone would take the decision

out of her hands and give her the entire prize.               Plainly, none of Norma's choices can reveal this

preference. In particular, if we ask her to choose between the original choice problem and a setting

in which a third party decides to give her everything, she will still feel responsible for the outcome,

and consequently choose to divide the money herself, splitting it equally.

       Bernheim (2016, 2018) conceptualizes the general problem as follows.
                                                                                             10   When a planner faces

a decision involving various potential courses of action, choice-based welfare analysis makes a pres-

cription by asking what the aected consumer would choose if oered the same alternatives. But in

situations where consumers' concerns encompass the experience of choosing, the planner's task and

the consumer's task are inherently non-comparable. In particular, presenting the planner and the

consumer with (ostensibly) the same menu does not mean that the alternatives (correctly dened)

are actually the same.           For instance, if Norma's well-being depends not only on what she orders

but also on what she personally chooses to forego, her choices cannot shed light on the best course

of action for a planner who makes the decision for her, because she personally chooses to forego

nothing when the planner makes the selection.

       We can avoid the non-comparability problem completely if we are willing to assume that con-

sumers' concerns do not encompass conditions pertaining specically to the experience of choosing

(conditions of choice, as opposed to conditions of consumption ). Another possibility is to assume

that consumers only care about conditions of choice under well-dened circumstances. For example,

choice-based welfare analysis becomes possible in Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001) theory of tempta-

tion, which is otherwise susceptible to the non-comparability critique, if we assume that people

care about the conditions of choice (e.g., experience temptation) only when decision tasks have

immediate material consequences.
                                           11   Objectively justifying such assumptions can prove challenging,

however, because justications must hinge on non-choice evidence rather than on choice patterns.

   9
       We have adapted this example from Koszegi and Rabin (2008a).
  10
       The following is a more formal statement of the non-comparabilty problem. Let       (X, f )   denote the decision task
consisting of the opportunity set     X   presented with framing   f.   To allow for the possibility that the consumer's
concerns may encompass the experience of choosing, we assume preferences are dened over objects of the form
(x, X, f ). If the consumer chooses xâ (X, f ) when presented with the problem (X, f ), we can conclude only that
(xâ (X, f ), X, f )  (x, X, f ) for all x â X . For two distinct decision problems, (X, f ) and (X 0 , f 0 ), the consumer's
                                                                                     â                       â   0  0   0 0
choices provide us with no basis for determining whether she is better o with (x (X, f ), X, f ) or (x (X , f ), X , f ).
Consequently, we can never say whether a policy that changes the decision problem facing a consumer helps or
hurts her. Presenting her with a choice between two decision problems does not by itself resolve the issue, since the
                                                                  0  00                          00
metachoice simply creates a new choice problem of the form (X âª X , f ) (where the new frame, f , captures the fact
that the decision is now structured as a choice between frames). Without additional assumptions, there is no reason
to think that the choices in this new setting reveal the consumer's preferences between an unchosen assignment to
one decision problem or the other.
  11
       Implicitly, Krusell et al. (2010) make this assumption when evaluating welfare using Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001)
model of temptation preferences, which otherwise implicates the non-comparability problem.




                                                             10
The identication of biases.                 In any given application, once we settle issues pertaining to the

boundaries of consumers' concerns, we confront another equally vexing question: when choices in

two frames conict, how can we tell which (if either) accurately reects preferences, and which is

biased?   In Norman's case, hunger might cloud his judgment or focus his attention.                   How do we

tell the dierence? As with any economic question, researchers should resolve these issues based

on objective, generally applicable criteria informed by pertinent evidence. It (almost) goes without

saying that I know it when I see it is not a sound methodological principle. We discuss empirical

strategies for making these judgments in Section 2.2.4. Here and in Section 2.2.3 we examine the

conceptual foundations for those strategies.

    A common practice among practitioners of the BRP paradigm is to posit the existence of a

utility function,   U (x, f )   (where   x   is the chosen item and   f   is the decision frame) that rationalizes

decisions.   This function summarizes all positive knowledge about choice.                  For obvious reasons,

many behavioral economists call it decision utility (or sometimes ex ante utility). Another common

practice is to posit the existence of a welfare function,          V (x).    In this framework, welfare depends

only on the chosen item because, by denition, the frame lies outside the scope of the consumer's

concerns. In any frame,         f , bias then consists of the (ordinal) discrepancies between U (Â·, f ) and V (Â·).
The literature oers three alternative interpretations of          V:     rst, that it captures true preferences,

second that it reects experienced utility (also known as ex post utility), and third, that it is simply a

function that rationalizes choices within a special subset of decision frames (and hence is also a form

of decision utility). Here we focus on the rst two interpretations, noting some conceptual diculties.

The third interpretation, which emerges from the Bernheim-Rangel framework (discussed in Section

2.2.3), provides an attractive alternative for those who nd the following issues problematic.



    The circularity trap.            A common but problematic idea is to dene a biased choice as one that

is contrary to true preferences. Unfortunately, that approach can lead to circularity: we identify

bias by looking for choices that conict with true preferences, while inferring true preferences from

unbiased choices. A key challenge in behavioral welfare economics is to nd a conceptually sound

escape route from this circularity trap.            In Section 2.2.3, we describe an approach that involves

focusing on whether particular decisions reect correct perceptions of available actions and the

outcomes they yield (conditional on the available information), rather than on whether particular

objectives are true, and we detail strategies for empirical implementation in Sections 2.2.4 and

3.2.3.

    Sometimes economists attempt to recover true preferences by estimating structural models of

choice.   While this approach can prove invaluable, it cannot provide the needed escape route.

Such models always have multiple normative interpretations; see, for example, the discussion of

quasi-hyperbolic discounting in Section 2.2.5.            Using them for welfare analysis therefore requires

an assumption concerning the component of the model that represents true preferences.                      In the

absence of some other objective foundation for inferring bias, labeling a model one way rather

than another amounts to resolving normative issues by assumption. It is simply too much to hope




                                                           11
that choices themselves can reveal which choices are unbiased.
                                                                                    12   Consequently, the identication of

bias generally requires consideration of non-choice evidence. That said, in some contexts, evidence

favoring minimalistic structural assumptions will suce; see Goldin and Reck (2015) and Benkert

and Netzer (forthcoming) for theoretical treatments.



       The trouble with experienced utility.                          The interpretation of         U (x, f ) and V (x) as, respecti-
vely, decision utility and experienced utility has gained traction among some economists; see, for

example, Chetty (2015). Even setting aside important questions regarding empirical implementa-

tion, this interpretation raises some conceptual concerns.

       First, the assumption that people derive welfare only from experience is limiting because it

excludes legitimate non-experiential objectives, and consequently leads to some problematic conclu-

sions. Recall the case of the oblivious altruist: a policy of routinely assisting ood victims reduces

Norman's experienced utility because he is never aware of the ooding and is always upset about the

associated taxes. Suppose Norman's preferences favor the policy even in light of these consequences.

Are we nevertheless prepared to say that the policy makes him worse o ?
                                                                                                           13

       The following example illustrates how such considerations can drive a wedge between decision

utility and experienced utility even in the absence of a bias.                           Every day, Norma eats vegetables

sautÃ©ed in olive oil. She actually thinks vegetables taste better when sautÃ©ed in butter, but she is

vegan and believes it is immoral to consume animal products. She is also forgetful: if she deviated

from her routine and used butter, she would not remember, and would attribute the better taste to

the freshness of the vegetables.
                                              14   She is fully aware of her forgetfulness, but still chooses olive oil

over butter. In this example, experienced utility ranks the options dierently than decision utility

(butter over olive oil rather than olive oil over butter). Yet Norma's decisions are clearly consistent

with her preferences.

       Second, even if people only care about hedonic experience, there are natural and important

settings in which that experience cannot logically include the welfare evaluation                                        V.    To illustrate,

suppose a consumer's decisions in period 1 determine her consumption in periods                                       t = 1, ...T .     We will

assume that welfare             V   depends on a collection of hedonic sensations (h1 , ..., hT ) that span all periods

 in other words, that every period's experience matters to some degree. We allow for the possibility

that    ht   may be a vector of sensations, but it does not have to include all sensations experienced in

period       t.   To apprehend       V (h1 , ..., hT )   as a coherent hedonic sensation, the consumer would have to

experience it in at least one period,                    t,   either as an element of   ht ,   or as an additional sensation.
                                                                                                                                                 15

Letting       hÌts   denote the perception of period-s sensations as of period                  t   (either a memory for                s<t      or

an anticipation for            s > t),   the consumer can in principle experience                   V (hÌt1 , ..., hÌttâ1 , ht , hÌtt+1 , ..., hÌtT )
  12
       Sen (1993)makes a version of this point: there is no way of determining whether a choice function is consistent
or not without referring to something external to choice behavior (such as objectives, values, or norms).
  13
       To be clear, welfare hedonism embraces this implication, but we suspect most readers will reject it.
  14
       The purpose of assuming she is forgetful is to eliminate the possibility that knowledge of her unethical behavior
might degrade her ex post experience.
  15
       Indeed, if     V   represents an ex post evaluation, she would have to experience it in period               T,   which is potentially
problematic in an innite-horizon setting, but we will not impose that restriction.




                                                                      12
as a hedonic sensation in period                 t,   but she cannot experience the true value of aggregate welfare,

V (h1 , ..., hT ), unless all period-t recollections and expectations are accurate.                   Thus, when we assume

the consumer hedonically experiences aggregate welfare,                    V,   we exclude a broad swath of behavioral

economics.

       Analogous issues arise in the context of settings with uncertainty.                         To illustrate, suppose the

welfare function is             V (x1 , .., xS ) = p1 v(x1 ) + ... + pS v(xS ),   where   xs   is the payment received in

state    s   and   ps   is the associated (objective) probability. To experience               V   ex post (that is, after the

realization of          s),   the consumer's sensations would have to include regret and/or relief associated

with unrealized outcomes, based on a correct understanding not only of the alternative outcomes

and the sensations they would have induced, but also of the probabilities.                                When a consumer

chooses an action and then experiences an outcome, she does not actually experience any of the

other outcomes, nor does she experience the associated probabilities (inasmuch as only one outcome

materializes).           While her experience may correct ex ante misconceptions concerning                          xs   or   v(xs )
for the realized state            s,   it does not inherently correct misconceptions about               xr   of   v(xr )   for any

unrealized state          r,   nor about the probabilities (biased beliefs). Accordingly, the consumer cannot

plausibly apprehend actual aggregate welfare,                  V , as an ex post hedonic sensation in most behavioral
settings with uncertainty,

       A satisfactory interpretation of the welfare function                V   therefore requires a clearer conceptual

foundation for the concept of bias. We discuss foundations in Section 2.2.3, and address empirical

implementation in Section 2.2.4.



A rigid consistency requirement.                           Because the BRP paradigm adheres rigidly to the core

assumption that people have coherent, stable preferences, it requires one to dene the scope of con-

sumers' concerns, and then to identify decision frames that induce bias, in a manner that yields an

internally consistent set of unbiased choices.
                                                               16   This inexible consistency requirement can compel

one to make assumptions about consumers concerns, and about bias, that lack objective supporting

evidence and go beyond our actual understanding of choice processes.
                                                                                               17    As an example, several

studies have found that decisions with no immediate consequences are sensitive to the weather at

the moment of choice (Busse et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2016). Yet as far as we know, there is no

objective foundation for declaring that rain induces a bias while sunshine does not, or vice versa.

Even more fundamentally, the requirement is sensible only if people make decisions by attempting

to access pre-existing, coherent preferences. If instead they construct preferences contextually (as

strong versions of the consistency critique maintain), one cannot claim that bias is the only pos-

sible source of inconsistency.
                                          18   In that case, the BRP paradigm can require the adoption of models

that are too simplistic given the underlying decision processes.

  16
       Formally, the set of unbiased choices must satisfy the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP) to ensure
the existence of a true preference representation.
  17
       Goldin and Reck (2015) show that it is sometimes possible to recover the consumer's preferences without such
assumptions, but the applicability of their methods is limited.
  18
       Notably, attempts to clean choice data through the application of objective criteria do not generally remove all
signicant inconsistencies (Benjamin et al., 2016).




                                                                    13
       One potential solution is to introduce the possibility that each consumer acts upon multiple

true preference relations, which they harmonize ineciently (for example, by expressing dierent

preferences in dierent frames). To make welfare statements, one must aggregate over the preference

relations. As an example, Laibson et al. (1998) interpret the standard model of quasi-hyperbolic

discounting as implying that the consumer has a distinct true preference relation at each moment

in time; their welfare analysis employs the Pareto criterion.             Despite some initial interest, this

approach is not currently in widespread use. For further discussion, see the Appendix.



Model uncertainty.            The BRP approach is also demanding on analysts because it presupposes

that they can successfully identify correct behavioral models. Because behavioral economists operate

within a domain that oers abundant degrees of freedom, many distinct models of choice processes

can potentially account for the same or similar choice mappings. Experience teaches us that building

a professional consensus for the right model can be extremely dicult, even when the choice

mapping is known.



2.2.3        The Bernheim-Rangel framework

The absence of a conceptual framework for identifying biases based on objective evidence represents

a serious gap in the BRP paradigm. Unfortunately, attempts to ll that gap collide head-on with the

paradigm's rigid consistency requirement. There is simply no guarantee that general principles for

diagnosing biased choices will, in any given application, reduce the choice domain to an internally

consistent subset, and indeed no hope of success if people construct their preferences contextually.

It is possible, for example, that upon applying a set of sound principles, one would conclude that

Norman's choices at 1pm and 4pm both reect legitimate perspectives, or that choices made on

rainy and sunny days are equally valid, even though they dier. (See also the discussion of time

inconsistency and welfare in Section 2.2.5). What then?

       The framework for behavioral welfare economics proposed by Bernheim and Rangel (2009),

and rened by Bernheim (2016; 2018), eliminates this tension. As a result, it opens the door to

principled evidence-based methods for identifying the scope of consumers' concerns and diagnosing

decision-making errors.        It dispenses with the need to make strong assumptions concerning the

nature of preferences and decision mechanisms simply to satisfy the rigid consistency requirement,

while at the same time permitting such stands where there is adequate foundation. Accordingly, as

we explain in greater detail below, it nests BRP, as well as other approaches (see Sections 2.3 and

2.4).
        19


The overall structure             As emphasized in Section 2.2.2, all choice-oriented welfare methods

require the practitioner to take a stand on the scope of consumers' concerns. Conditional on that

stand, the Bernheim-Rangel approach involves two steps.

  19
       In this respect, we disagree with the characterization of these methods in Chetty (2015), who sees them as
competing rather than nested.




                                                        14
       â¢   Step 1 : Identify all decisions that merit deference (the welfare-relevant domain)


       â¢   Step 2 : Construct a welfare criterion based (at least in part) on the properties of choice within

           that domain.


These steps are implicit in the BRP approach. As explained in Section 2.2.2, in settling on a positive

model and adopting a particular normative interpretation, we eectively identify collections of

decision problems for which choices ostensibly express undistorted true preferences. BRP amounts

to conducting standard revealed preference analysis on those restricted domains.

       The BRP approach entails serious challenges because it places demanding restrictions on the

inputs for the second step: we cannot recover preferences unless welfare-relevant choices are mu-

tually consistent. In contrast, a key feature of the Bernheim-Rangel framework is that the second

step employs a criterion that exibly accommodates inconsistencies among the choices that merit

deference. That feature fundamentally alters the nature of the rst step. We can in principle iden-

tify welfare-relevant choices by entertaining the same evidence, arguments, and modeling strategies

as in the BRP framework. However, unlike BRP, the Bernheim-Rangel framework does not compel

the analyst to settle on welfare-relevant domains within which all choices are internally consistent.

This dierence is particularly important in contexts where there is skepticism about the evidence

used to identify biases. If the application of objective and appropriate criteria for evaluating whet-

her any given choice merits deference fails to yield a set of internally consistent choices, the analyst

does not need to try harder. The Bernheim-Rangel framework also allows one to perform welfare

analysis provisionally under dierent views of which choices do and do not merit deference, and the-

reby provide a more thorough understanding of the assumptions upon which particular normative

conclusions depend.



Revised premises for choice-oriented welfare analysis                     To derive defensible general principles

for diagnosing decision-making errors and constructing welfare criteria, one needs to build on sound

conceptual foundations. As discussed in Section 2.2.1, behavioral economics oers various critiques

that call the foundations of standard welfare economics into question. Bernheim (2016; 2018) argues

that certain essential features of the main premises nevertheless survive. He distinguishes between

direct judgments, which are opinions that pertain to outcomes we care about for their own sake,

and indirect judgments, which involve alternatives that lead to those outcomes. He then reasons

that while behavioral economics and psychology provide a foundation for questioning certain types

of indirect judgments, they do not impugn direct judgments. With respect to the latter, standard

arguments for deference to individual judgment continue to apply.                    One such argument invokes

justication for self-determination in the tradition of classical liberalism: my views about my life are

paramount because it is, after all, my life. A second entails the Cartesian principle that subjective

experience is inherently private and not directly observable, which renders each of us uniquely

qualied to assess our own well-being.

  20
       Modern libertarian philosophers such as Nozick (1974) describe self-determination as a fundamental right rather
than a means to an end, and construe that principle as constraining the legitimate scope of government.



                                                           15
existence of true preferences or of aggregate experienced utility.   Nor do they assume that an

individual always reaches exactly the same judgment. Objections to direct judgments entail nothing

more than a dierence of opinion between the analyst and the consumer as to what constitutes a

good or fullling life. Thus there is no objective foundation for overturning the presumption in favor

of a direct judgment and declaring the analyst's perspective superior. The same argument applies

to indirect judgments for which the consumer properly understands the connection between actions

and consequences.

   The question remains, why draw the line at choices?        Why not accord equal status to other

types of judgments, such as evaluations of happiness and life satisfaction? Obviously one cannot

assert the primacy of choice based on a presumed connection with true preference if the latter

does not actually exist. If choice is simply a constructed judgment, then one could argue that other

types of constructed judgments, such as self-reported well-being, should be equally admissible for

the purpose of evaluating welfare. The answer given in Bernheim (2016; 2018) is that deference to

a constructed judgment in the course of analysis is warranted only if the purposes of the analysis

and the judgment are conformable. He argues that economists usually see normative analysis as a

tool for guiding policy makers when they select among alternatives, under the assumption that the

objective is to promote the well-being of those aected by the selection. When people make choices

for themselves, they aggregate over the many dimensions of their experience for precisely the same

reason. Accordingly, when advising policy makers on the selection of an alternative that aects a

particular consumer, we may justiably defer to that consumer's choices because they reveal the

alternatives that, in her judgment, would provide her with the greatest overall benet if selected.

In contrast, other types of constructed judgments aggregate experience for dierent purposes; see

in particular the discussion of self-reported well-being in Section 2.3, below.

   These considerations lead to the following revised premises:


   â¢   Premise A: With respect to matters involving either direct judgment or correctly informed

       indirect judgment, each of us is the best arbiter of our own well-being.


   â¢   Premise B : When we choose, we seek to benet ourselves by selecting the alternative that, in

       our judgment, is most conducive to our well-being.


To formulate a welfare framework based on these revised premises, one has to grapple with two

main issues. First, how does one distinguish between choices that reect correctly and incorrectly

informed judgments?     Second, how does one accommodate inconsistencies among the judgments

that merit deference? The next two sections describe the answers provided in Bernheim and Rangel

(2009) and Bernheim (2016; 2018).



Welfare-relevant choices        In principle, the two-step structure allows analysts to dene welfare-

relevant domains however they wish, but forces them to make these restrictions explicit so others

can evaluate them. Despite this exibility, only certain types of restrictions on the welfare-relevant

domain are consistent with the underlying philosophical foundations set forth above. Those foun-



                                                  16
dations justify the exclusion of a choice that expresses an incorrectly informed indirect judgment,

but not one that is correctly informed. Indeed, Bernheim (2016, 2018) takes the position that, ab-

sent clear evidence that a judgment is incorrectly informed, or that choices and judgments diverge,

the presumption in favor of deference to individual choice should stand. Under this view, proper

exclusions from the welfare-relevant domain should be limited to identiable mistakes. Others may

take a broader view.    For example, some argue against deference to sadistic or immoral choices

(Harsanyi, 1978; Sen, 1980-1981).

   The challenge, of course, is to identify mistakes without presupposing a knowledge of preferences,

and thereby encountering the circularity described in Section 2.2.2. Bernheim (2009, 2016, 2018)

classies a decision as a mistake if it has two distinctive features.    First, there must be some

unchosen option in the opportunity set that the decision maker would select over the chosen one in

some other decision problem, where either the menu or the framing diers (i.e., a choice reversal ).

If, on the contrary, the decision maker robustly stands by her choice irrespective of menus or

framing, then we have no empirical basis for claiming that another option in the opportunity set

is superior according to her judgment. A choice reversal is, however, neither helpful in identifying

which choice is mistaken, nor even sucient for establishing the existence of mistake, inasmuch as

it could reect contextually constructed judgments. Thus we look for a second feature: a mistaken

choice is predicated on a characterization of the available options and the outcomes they imply that

is inconsistent with the information available to the decision maker (characterization failure ). In

other words, it reects an incorrectly informed indirect judgment. By itself, characterization failure

raises the possibility that a mistake may have occurred, but does not guarantee that outcome,

because one can make the right decision for the wrong reason. However, as long as characterization

failure infects only one of two decision problems associated with a choice reversal, we can declare

the infected choice a mistake. Because this denition avoids any reference to divergences between

choices and preferences, it avoids circularity.

   To identify a mistake under this denition, one requires both rich choice data and information

concerning the decision maker's understanding of the available options and the outcomes they imply.

We discuss possible empirical strategies in Section 2.2.4.

   To illustrate the principles discussed above, suppose we are concerned that a consumer makes

mistakes due to biased beliefs.   As we explained in Section 2.2.2, one can interpret the welfare-

optimal alternative according to a structural model of biased beliefs as the choice the consumer would

make in a reframed, transparent setting. Thus, choice reversals are implicit, and one could verify

their existence by implementing the corresponding decision problems.       In settings with objective

probabilities, one can demonstrate characterization failure in a given frame by showing that people

misunderstand the mathematical rules governing the derivation of pertinent probabilities from the

available information (e.g., conditioning), or that they do not notice, retain, or properly understand

pertinent facts governing the probabilities. (See Spinnewijn, 2015, for an empirical example involving

excessive optimism concerning reemployment prospects.)       Signicantly, some of the strategies for

demonstrating characterization failure discussed in subsequent sections are equally applicable in




                                                  17
settings with subjective probabilities, where objective odds are either unknown or unmeasurable

absent debatable assumptions about the underlying data-generating processes.                          Accordingly, in

contrast to the BRP method of Koszegi and Rabin (2008b), this approach allows one to analyze

the impact of biased beliefs even in settings where one cannot rule out any particular belief as

objectively irrational.

       The aforementioned notion of a mistake has parallels in the literature on the philosophical

foundations of paternalism. New (1999) separates failures of reasoning into two general categories:

those pertaining to judgments about the appropriate course of action and those related to the

actual choices made to achieve a given object (see also Dworkin, 1971). The rst category includes

technical inability, which prevents the individual from properly using the available information

to understand the nature of the available options  in short, characterization failure. The second

category includes phenomena such as weakness of will, which ostensibly cause choices and judg-

ments to diverge. A question arises as to whether this second category denes an additional class

of mistakes involving optimization failure.

       To make this discussion more precise, imagine the consumer responds to a particular decision

task by attempting to solve the following problem:
                                                                    21


                                                        max u(g(x)),                                                (1)
                                                         xâX


where     x is an action, g maps actions to outcomes that matter to her intrinsically (e.g., mental states),
and    u captures her judgments.        Objections to the consumer's choice must fall into one of the following

four categories: (i) she misunderstands the set of available actions,                 X,   (ii) she misunderstands the

mapping from actions to outcomes,                g,   (iii) she fails to perform the max operator correctly, or

(iv) she uses an inappropriate objective function,              u.22     Choice-oriented welfare analysis rejects (iv)

as a source of mistakes. Characterization failure subsumes (i) and (ii), while optimization failure

subsumes (iii).

       With respect to optimization failure, the critical question is whether one can detect it using sys-

tematic evidence-based criteria without knowing the objective function. Discussions of optimization

failure generally assume not only that the individual has a single coherent objective function (which

is debatable), but also that it is known. Weakness of will is a good example. If we are amenable

to assuming that the consumer has a well-dened unitary objective that reliably guides her choices

only when all consequences are delayed, then it is sensible to say that optimization failure can occur

when some consequences are immediate.                    Yet it is also possible that the consumer embraces an

objective that guides the choices she makes when actions have immediate consequences. Moreover,

this may be her true objective, or she may embrace dierent objectives in dierent contexts (see

the discussion in Section 2.2.5). In that case, references to weakness of will reect disagreements

about proper objectives rather than problems with optimization; in other words, the objection to

  21
       To be clear, in adopting this formulation, we do not intend to imply that the consumer employs the same objective
function   u   for dierent decision problems.
  22
       We thank Sandro Ambuehl for suggesting this categorization.




                                                               18
the consumer's choices actually falls within category (iv), which choice-oriented methods disavow,

rather than category (iii).

         In principle, evidence on decision processes could establish that consumers choose their actions

by applying algorithms that cannot logically maximize any objective function. Such evidence would

obviously establish the existence of optimization failure.                 Whether this strategy proves useful in

practical applications remains to be seen.



The welfare criterion                 Upon completing Step 1, the analyst may nd that the welfare-relevant

domain is too large in the sense that inconsistencies among choices remain, too small in the

sense that certain choice-based comparisons are impossible, or just right in the sense that choices

are comprehensive and consistent. Here we focus on the case where the domain is too large (which

is especially pertinent if there is skepticism about evidence of bias), and then comment on the case

in which it is just right. We take up the possibility that the domain is too small in Section 2.4.

         In the Bernheim-Rangel framework, a normative criterion is a binary relation. If                  W   is a generic

normative relation, and if          x   and   y   are outcomes, then  xW y  means that outcome       x   is better than

outcome         y.   Bernheim (2016, 2018) argues that any sensible criterion should satisfy the following

three properties:
                        23

         â¢   Property #1 (coherence) :     W      is acyclic.
                                                             24

         â¢   Property #2 (respect for unambiguous choice) : If, within the welfare-relevant domain,                      y   is

             never chosen when    x   is available, then     xW y .

         â¢   Property #3 (consistency with the welfare-relevant domain) : If            x   is chosen in some decision

             problem with opportunity set          X   within the welfare-relevant domain, then       x   is not welfare-

             improvable within    X   according to      W.

The justication for the rst two requirements is transparent, but the third may require some

explanation. To declare          x welfare-improvable within X         would mean that choosing       x in the specied
problem is a mistake. But a central purpose of Step 1 is to weed out all identiable mistakes, and no

data or inferential methods in Step 2 are excluded from Step 1. Therefore, if one can legitimately

classify the selection of         x   as a mistake in Step 2, one should already have deleted it from the

welfare-relevant domain in Step 1.

         Bernheim and Rangel (2009) demonstrate that there exists one and only one candidate for the

welfare relation        W    satisfying these three properties: the unambiguous choice relation,               P â .25   This
                                                                                    â
result makes our lives fairly simple: if one endorses the three requirements, then P is the only game

    23
         The second and third properties reference choices made within the welfare-relevant domain. To be clear, nothing
in the framework requires direct observation of those choices. The analyst can use the usual methods to ll in missing
data, including interpolation, extrapolation, and structural modeling.
    24
         Acyclicity is generally regarded as the weakest possible coherence requirement, in the sense that it is necessary
and sucient for the existence of maximal elements.

                                                                  19
in town. When there are inconsistencies within the welfare-relevant domain,                        Pâ   is an incomplete

relation.     Intuitively, it instructs us to respect choice whenever choice provides clear normative

guidance, and to live with whatever ambiguity remains.                   Thus, it allows analysts to exploit the

coherent aspects of behavior, which feature prominently in virtually all behavioral theories, while

embracing the normative ambiguity implied by any lack of coherence.

       In settings where choice inconsistencies within the welfare-relevant domain are pervasive,                     Pâ
may not be very discerning. Whether the resulting ambiguity undermines our ability to draw useful

welfare conclusions depends on the context; for an example, see the discussion of Bernheim et

al. (2015a) in Section 4.5.2. When a lack of discernment proves problematic, one can attempt to

sharpen one's conclusions by returning to Step 1 and focusing on the theoretical and empirical issues

governing the denition of the welfare-relevant domain.

       What if it turns out that step 1 yields a welfare-relevant domain that is just right, in the sense

that it is both comprehensive and internally consistent, rather than too large? In that case,                       Pâ
coincides with the normative criterion obtained from the familiar principles of revealed preferences.

We therefore arrive at the third interpretation of the welfare function,                   V,     introduced in Section

2.2.2: it is simply a function that rationalizes choices within a special subset of decision frames

(the welfare-relevant domain), and hence is actually a form of decision utility. Thus the framework

provides a true generalization of both standard welfare economics and BRP.
                                                                                             26   Seeing BRP exercises

through the lens of the Bernheim-Rangel framework is useful because it highlights the fact that

welfare analysis hinges on the properties of the naturally occurring and welfare-relevant choice

mappings, rather than on the cognitive models one invokes to rationalize those mappings.                             The

importance of deriving welfare implications from choice mappings implied by models of cognition,

rather than from the models themselves, is a theme of Section 3.



Applying the criterion              The analytic implementation of the aforementioned welfare criterion is

reasonably straightforward. The framework yields intuitive counterparts for the standard tools of

welfare analysis, including equivalent variation, compensating variation, and consumer surplus. To

take a simple case, suppose Norman has two tickets to a college football game, and is wondering

whether he should use them or sell them. His willingness-to-accept diers across decision frames,

but is never less than $50 and never more than $60.                  In that case, we can say that having and

using the tickets improves his welfare by $50 to $60. That range reects the ambiguity implied by

his choices.      In many instances, applications of the framework simply involve evaluating a policy

from the perspective of the most favorable and least favorable frames using otherwise conventional

methods; see Section 4.5.2 for an example.

  26
       Bernheim (2016; 2018) argues that apparent counterexamples reect a failure to envision the entire choice domain.
As an example, consider the following BRP model of a masochist: instead of maximizing utility,         u(x), the consumer
minimizes it. The Bernheim-Rangel interpretation of this model is that, if   u truly represents the consumer's objectives,
then it must be possible to envision an alternative decision frame in which the consumer acts on those objectives;
absent    any setting that is free from an alleged distortion, we ought to question whether the associated conception of
preference lacks a foundation and is merely a contrivance.




                                                            20
Discussion         The Bernheim-Rangel framework draws a stark distinction between choices that fall

within and outside the welfare-relevant domain. In principle, one could imagine an alternative ap-

proach that admits uncertainty concerning the correct classication while simultaneously reviving

the core BRP assumption that people have coherent, stable preferences. Under this view, incon-

sistencies remain after eliminating all obvious mistakes in step 1 simply because some errors are

dicult to detect. Accordingly, one might hope to compute expected welfare eects based on poste-

rior probabilities concerning the likelihood of error for each decision problem. In Norman's case, the

expected improvement in his welfare from having and using the football tickets would be a single

value between $50 and $60.

       Any approach that assumes the existence of true preferences is obviously vulnerable to the

criticism that our judgments may be contextually constructed. Even setting that objection aside,

implementation of the alternative approach described in the preceding paragraph is challenging

due to the diculty of devising an objective method for recovering the posterior probabilities of

error. No such methods currently exist and, unfortunately, it is hard to imagine an implementation

that avoids arbitrary and problematic assumptions. For example, one could build and implement

a structural model based on the assumption that choices tend to cluster around preferred options,

in which case outliers are likely mistakes. However, if the frames that induce error arise far more

frequently than those that do not, the outliers may be the best guides to welfare.



2.2.4        Empirical Implementation of Choice-Oriented Methods

In this section, we discuss general empirical strategies for conducting behavioral welfare analyses

using choice-oriented methods. Because we view the Bernheim-Rangel framework as a generalization

of the Behavioral Revealed Preference paradigm, our discussion will employ the vocabulary of the

former.



Core methods.            As we have emphasized, all applications of choice-oriented behavioral welfare

economics implicitly or explicitly specify the scope of consumers' concerns and dene a welfare-

relevant domain.        The ideal application also performs the following three tasks, in each case by

marshaling appropriate evidence:


       â¢   Task 1 : Estimate choice mappings within the naturally occurring domain, and within the

           welfare-relevant domain.


       â¢   Task 2 : Justify assumptions concerning the boundaries of the welfare-relevant domain by

           providing evidence that inconsistencies between choices in naturally occurring and welfare-

           relevant frames are attributable to characterization failures in the latter and not the former.


       â¢   Task 3 : Justify assumptions about the scope of consumers' concerns.
                                                                                        27

  27
       To be clear, it is impossible to perform the rst two tasks without assumptions about the scope of consumers'
concerns. We do not mean to suggest otherwise by listing the task of justifying these assumptions third.




                                                          21
As discussed in subsequent sections, most applications are more attentive to task 1 than to tasks 2

and 3. We recommend addressing each task with equal seriousness where there is legitimate scope

for controversy. Here we elaborate on general approaches to each task.



       Task 1: Estimating choice mappings              Essential inputs for choice-oriented welfare methods

include rich descriptions of behavior within both naturally occurring and welfare-relevant decision

frames (choice mappings).         The task of estimating a choice mapping over a naturally occurring

domain is entirely standard.        In cases where welfare-relevant choices are also observed, the same

methods apply. Here we are concerned with the frequently encountered problem of estimating the

choice mapping for the welfare-relevant domain when data on welfare-relevant choices are either

sparse or nonexistent. Applicable methods fall into the following four categories.

       The rst method is to create the data by presenting people with appropriately reframed decision

problems. Examples include Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) on the demand for lightbulbs, discussed

in Section 3.2.3, and Ambuehl et al. (2017) on the quality of nancial decision making, discussed in

Section 4.6.2. An important advantage of this approach is that one can deduce welfare implications

directly from the discrepancies between the original and reframed choices without the need for

restrictive assumptions about behavioral and cognitive processes.

       When psychologists use this rst method, they call it debiasing ; for a recent survey, see Soll

et al. (forthcoming). In eect, the objective of debiasing is to reframe the decision so that it lies

within the welfare-relevant domain. That said, the normative superiority of the supposedly debiased

choices is not always justied as carefully as it should be. As an example, one procedure is to point

out inconsistencies across choices, and then ask subjects to rethink their decisions. The intent is

to improve decision making, but the eect could be to prompt spurious resolutions of legitimate

normative ambiguity by inducing an experimenter demand eect.
                                                                           28

       The second method is to extrapolate the missing welfare-relevant choices from other types of

decisions using structural models. As an example, in applications involving the  Î²Î´  model (quasi-

hyperbolic discounting), many analysts have assumed, in eect, that the welfare-relevant domain

consists of choices with no immediate consequences (see Section 2.2.5). Even if no such choices are

observed for the application of interest, one can in principle recover the model's parameters either

from the naturally occurring choices, or from time-preference experiments. Setting             Î² = 1,   one can

then use the model to infer choices within the welfare-relevant domain.              The approach to biased

beliefs described at the outset of Section 2.2.2 has a similar structure, and falls within the same

category. We provide many examples of this method in subsequent sections.

       Unlike the rst method, structural modeling requires one to make restrictive assumptions about

behavior and decision processes.         However, minimalistic structural assumptions suce for some

applications. Suppose, for instance, that consumer demand for a product depends on two types of

fees, one transparent and the other shrouded. If we assume only that the response to the shrouded

fee ought to be the same as the response to the transparent fee, we can reconstruct unbiased demand.

  28
       One can design alternative protocols that minimize those demand eects, but then signicant normative am-
biguities may remain. See, for example, Benjamin et al. (2016).



                                                        22
For applications of this idea, see the discussions of Allcott and Wozny (2014) and Busse et al. (2013)

in Section 3.2.3.

      The third method is to extrapolate the missing welfare-relevant choices from the decisions of si-

milar individuals who ostensibly avoid characterization failure (the rational consumer benchmark).

For instance, one could attempt to deduce sensible portfolio decisions from the choices of nancial

professionals, or sensible medical decisions from the choices of doctors; see the discussion of Bron-

nenberg et al. (2015) and Allcott et al. (2018b) in Section 3.2.3. Studies employing this approach

must address the possibility that the tastes of the experts dier systematically from those of the

target population, or that the experts suer from other sources of characterization failure (e.g.,

medical training may tend to induce hypochondria).

      The fourth method is to extrapolate the missing welfare-relevant choices from non-choice data.

One variant of this approach assumes that a properly informed consumer would choose the option

that leads to the greatest happiness or life satisfaction; see Section 2.3.1. One could also attempt

to draw such inferences from data on hypothetical choices and stated preferences (Shogren, 2005;

Carson and Hanemann, 2005; Carson, 2012).                   A related strategy is to rely on statistical models

that treat these types of subjective responses as predictors, instead of taking them at face value as

predictions. With that approach, there is no need to resolve which of two or more SRWB measures is

correct because one can use them as co-predictors of choice, potentially along with other subjective

reactions and even biometric measurements.
                                                       29   Experimental evidence indicates that this strategy

can dramatically reduce both mean-squared error and bias when predicting choice out of sample;

see Bernheim et al. (2015b).

      We return to these methods in Section 3.2.3, where we discuss empirical applications.



      Task 2: Justifying the welfare-relevant domain                     While the conceptual principles gover-

ning the identity of the welfare-relevant domain are reasonably straightforward (see Section 2.2.2),

justifying particular assumptions within the context of an application can be challenging, and in-

deed this task often receives short shrift.           Potential strategies include the following.    First, one

can evaluate whether people properly understand concepts central to the proper characterization

of certain choice problems.         See the discussion of Ambuehl et al. (2017) in Section 4.6.2 for an

illustration. Second, one can examine evidence concerning the processes of observation, attention,

memory, forecasting, and/or learning, with the object of determining the contexts in which certain

types of facts are systematically ignored or processed incorrectly. See the discussion of Bernheim

and Rangel (2004) in Section 2.2.5 for an illustration. Finally, one can evaluate whether people un-

derstand particular decision problems by posing factual questions with veriable answers. Potential

evidence includes ex post acknowledgements by decision makers that they ignored or misunderstood

pertinent facts. See Benjamin et al. (2016) for an implementation.

       Task 3: Justifying assumptions about the scope of consumer's concerns                            It is worth

reiterating that all choice-oriented methods require one to take a stand on the aspects of experience

that contribute to well-being  in other words, to specify the component dimensions of consump-

tion bundles. How does one determine what people care about, and thereby draw a line between

consumption bundles and frames?             The most common approach is to assume, as in conventional

analyses, that consumers care only about standard consumption items such as traded goods, and

to blame framing eects for most patterns that appear anomalous under that assumption. Yet there

are also applications in which consumer's ostensible concerns extend to non-standard considerations

such as internal emotional states.

       Justications for assumptions about the scope of consumers' concerns necessarily invoke non-

choice evidence, inasmuch as one cannot describe choice data prior to settling on the denition of the

consumption bundle.
                          30   Formal methods for executing this task remain underdeveloped. Sometimes

one can rely on information about the mechanism through which a given condition aects choice 

for example, whether it demonstrably leads to confusion. Another strategy is to ask people what

they care about, or to introspect.

       Next we turn to some alternative approaches that do not t neatly within these core methods (in

the sense that they do not systematically address each of the three tasks), but that can nevertheless

inform choice-based welfare evaluations.



Dominated choices.              An alternative empirical approach is to evaluate changes in the quality

of decision making by monitoring the frequency of dominated choices; for applications, see the

discussion of nancial decision making in Section 4.6.2.             One variant of this approach focuses on

decision tasks with dominant options; see, for example, Bhargava et al. (2017), who nd that the

majority of employees in a large U.S. rm choose dominated health care plans.
                                                                                              31   A second variant

examines decisions with non-degenerate ecient frontiers.

       Dominance methods allow one to proceed with minimalistic assumptions, but they are not

assumption-free. To justify these methods within the Bernheim-Rangel framework, one must assume

that direct judgments respect monotonicity. Upon observing a dominated choice, one can then infer

the existence of frames in which the consumer notices the dominance relation and makes a dierent

selection. Thus, choice reversals are implicit, and one could verify their existence by implementing

the corresponding decision problems. The same assumption also removes all potential explanations

for the dominated choice other than characterization failure.                According to this reasoning, this

approach oers an important potential advantage:                one does not need to identify the nature of

characterization failure or provide direct evidence of its existence in order to classify a dominated

choice as a mistake.
  30
       This observation poses a logical diculty for those who argue against the use of non-choice data in economics,
such as Gul and Pesendorfer (2008).
  31
       The rm in question oered a large menu of options that diered only with respect to nancial cost-sharing and
premium. High-deductible plans often dominated low-deductible plans because the premium dierentials exceeded
the deductible dierentials.




                                                          24
       Unfortunately, dominance methods also have their limitations. The rst variant of the approach

 studying decision tasks with dominant options  removes personal preferences from the mix.

Each decision eectively boils down to solving a math problem that has one and only one correct

answer. In contrast, the vast majority of real-world decisions are not simply math problems: the

right choice almost always depends on preferences. This dierence is important because consumers

may be more susceptible to characterization failure when preferences come into play.                      Posing a

problem that has no objectively correct answer may reduce the resemblance to textbook examples,

making the applicable objective principles harder to recognize.
                                                                             32   People may be less likely to

deploy mathematical tools when mathematics potentially govern only one amongst several aspects

of evaluation. Preferences may also activate specialized heuristics or psychological mechanisms, such

as motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990), that sweep relevant principles into the background, even if

they are invoked.

       The second variant of this method  studying decision tasks with non-degenerate ecient fron-

tiers  avoids this criticism by keeping preferences in the mix. However, in that case, a reduction

in the frequency of dominated choices does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with a welfare impro-

vement. One can make unambiguous welfare statements only in special cases where there happens

to be a dominance relation between the actions a given consumer takes with and without the

intervention of interest.



Consistency with revealed preference axioms.                     Another alternative approach is to evaluate

changes in the quality of decision making by monitoring the frequency of WARP or GARP viola-

tions. For an example involving nancial decision making, see Choi, Kariv, Mueller and Silverman

(2014). Unlike the dominance method, this strategy presupposes the existence of coherent, stable

preferences, and cannot accommodate the possibility that inconsistencies may reect the vagaries

of preference construction.        However, conditional on that assumption, WARP/GARP violations

plainly imply that some choices are mistaken. As with the dominance method, the analyst avoids

the need to identify the source of the characterization failure or provide direct evidence of its exis-

tence. However, this method oers no basis for determining which choices are mistaken. Instead, it

provides a way to quantify the overall prevalence and severity of decision errors.
                                                                                               33

       A conceptual problem with this method is that decision-making errors do not necessarily give

rise to WARP/GARP violations.             A consumer who exhibits a consistent misunderstanding of a

principle governing the relation between choices and outcomes will nevertheless respect such axioms.

For example, suppose Norman prefers oranges to bananas and bananas to apples, but consistently

mistakes apples for oranges in naturally occurring decision frames.               In that case, his choices will

  32
       Along these lines, Enke and Zimmermann (2015) show that many people tend to neglect correlations even in
simple settings, despite knowing how to account for them. Likewise, Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming) nd
that many consumers underreact to sales taxes, even though they can properly compute tax-inclusive prices.
  33
       To be clear, some measures of non-conformance with GARP, such as the Afriat (1972) critical cost eciency
index, do have eciency interpretations; see, e.g., Choi et al. (2014) for a related application. Moreover, Echenique
et al. (2011) provide a measure of non-conformance that is interpretable as the maximal amount of money one can
extract from a decision maker with specic violations of GARP.




                                                         25
satisfy WARP: he will consistently choose apples over bananas, and will never choose bananas when

apples are available. It follows that a reduction in WARP/GARP violations is neither necessary

nor sucient for an improvement in the quality of decision making.



Metachoices.     A nal choice-oriented empirical strategy for evaluating welfare involves the use of

metachoices  that is, choices among decision problems. In principle, we could attempt to discover

which of two decision frames leads to a better outcome when paired with the same menu by asking

the consumer to choose between them. Likewise, we could try to determine the value of a choice

situation by assessing the consumer's willingness-to-pay either to obtain it or to avoid it.

   When evaluating such methods, the reader should bear in mind that a metachoice between two

decision problems constitutes a third decision problem, in which the menu of options is the union

of the menus for the two component problems, and the framing subsumes the sequential nature of

the choice. Therefore, choices and metachoices are not dierent types of objects. While there are

circumstances in which choices that happen to be framed as metachoices are informative, they do

not automatically resolve welfare questions, for at least two reasons.

   First, bias that infects either or both of the component problems may also infect the metachoice.

To illustrate, suppose the presence of objects in shiny wrappers causes Norman to ignore all other

options. In that case, decision problems that present a subset of the options in shiny wrappers (type

S problems) generally leave him worse o than ones that present all options in dull wrappers (type D

problems). If Norman's bias manifests itself only when he actually sees objects in shiny wrappers, a

metachoice will correctly reveal the superiority of the type D problems. However, if merely thinking

about objects in shiny wrappers triggers his bias, he may express a preference for type S problems.

The metachoice is then misleading because the bias infects it. For a more consequential illustration

of these issues, see the discussion of metachoices in Section 2.2.5, which concerns time inconsistency.

   Second, metachoices can also introduce new biases.       To illustrate, suppose we oer Norma a

metachoice between two 100-question multiple choice tests, one on history, the other on biology.

Either way, she will receive $1 for each correct answer.     Objectively, the probability that Norma

answers the typical question correctly is 80% for history and 85% for biology. Abstracting from risk

aversion, she should therefore be willing to pay $5 to switch from the history test to the biology test.

Yet if she incorrectly believes she answers 70% of history questions and 95% of biology questions

correctly, she will overpay by $20 to switch tests. Here, the new bias infecting the metachoice is

poor metacompetence (i.e., an inaccurate assessment of competence).

   Some economists have attempted to use metachoices to assess the welfare eects of changes in

the conditions of choice. For example, DellaVigna et al. (2012) assess the willingness to pay to avoid

face-to-face charitable solicitations. Because these solicitations do not create new opportunities to

give, their only eect is to change a condition of choice.      As noted in Section 2.2.2, assuming

that conditions of choice fall within the scope of consumers' concerns potentially introduces the

Non-comparability Problem. The welfare analysis in DellaVigna et al. (2012) is nevertheless valid

under the additional assumption that the eects of social pressure do not inuence the metachoice.




                                                  26
However, that assumption may be mistaken. For example, the existence of a solicitor may create

social pressure to allow the solicitation (i.e., a perceived obligation). In that case, the welfare eects

of solicitation do not necessarily coincide with the measured willingness to pay, and indeed may not

be identied. See also the discussion of Allcott and Kessler (forthcoming) in Section 3.5.



2.2.5       An application to time-inconsistency

Even after settling on the conceptual foundations for choice-based welfare analysis, normative judg-

ments can remain challenging and controversial. To illustrate some of the diculties that can arise,

we will examine the problem of evaluating welfare for a time-inconsistent consumer.

       For concreteness, suppose Norma must choose between eating pizza or salad for lunch.                           She

enjoys pizza more than salad but recognizes that salad is healthier. Prior to lunchtime, she prefers

salad overall because she prioritizes health.          However, when lunchtime arrives, she prefers pizza

because she prioritizes immediate gratication. Assuming Norma cares only about the identity of

the selected lunch item, this pattern constitutes time inconsistency. One could also say that she

manifests imperfect self-control in the sense that she hopes and intends to order salad for lunch,

but ends up with pizza.

       Here we are concerned with welfare: Is Norma better o with salad or pizza? According to one

prominent school of thought, the present-focused tendencies that emerge in each moment reect a

cognitive bias (see, for example, O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). In Norma's case, this perspective

favors salad.

       To apply the Behavioral Revealed Preference paradigm, we require a model of Norma's behavior.

The most widely used framework for modeling time inconsistency posits quasi-hyperbolic discoun-

ting (QHD preferences, or, more colloquially, the             Î²Î´   model).
                                                                                34   The period-t objective function for
                                     PT       sât u , where
a QHD consumer is           ut + Î²    s=t+1 Î´      s          (ut , ..., uT )   represents ow utility, and   Î²   is assu-

med to lie between 0 and 1. The judgment articulated in the previous paragraph associates true

preferences with      Î´   discounting (the long-run criterion ), and construes             1âÎ²   as parameterizing the

magnitude of present bias.

       A diculty with this approach is that the QHD model admits a large number of disparate

normative interpretations (Bernheim, 2009). For example, one could take the position that people

achieve true happiness by living in the moment, but that they suer from a tendency to over-

intellectualize when making decisions about the future.                   Relabeling the model, one arrives at a

dierent account of true preference and cognitive bias consistent with this alternative perspective.

The model itself provides no guidance as to which account is right and which is wrong.

       Ideally, economists should rely on objective evidence-based criteria to justify using value-laden

labels such as bias and true preference for elements of the model. The Bernheim-Rangel fra-

mework provides structure for such inquiries.            In Norma's case, we identify two decision frames,

dierentiated according to whether she chooses in the moment (contemporaneous framing) or in ad-

  34
       This formulation was popularized by David Laibson (1997; 1998), who borrowed it from a related experimental
literature in psychology (Chung and Herrnstein, 1961).




                                                         27
vance (forward-looking framing). If we exclude contemporaneous choices from the welfare-relevant

domain, then salad is optimal, but if instead we exclude forward-looking choices, pizza is optimal. If

we dene the welfare-relevant domain to include all choices, Norma's best choice between pizza and

salad is ambiguous.
                         35   In the latter case, we may still be able to make statements such as: Norma is

denitely better o with salad plus $0.50 than with pizza, and denitely worse o with salad than

with pizza plus $0.75.
                              36

       As noted in Section 2.2.3, Bernheim (2009, 2016) argues that an evidence-based inquiry into

welfare-relevance should focus on characterization failure.              As an example, Bernheim and Ran-

gel (2004) marshal evidence on the neurobiology of addiction to support their contention that the

welfare-relevant domain should not include contemporaneously framed choices made in the presence

of substance-related environmental cues. In brief, neurobiological research shows that a specic me-

chanism (the mesolimbic dopamine system, or MDS) measures correlations between environmental

cues and subsequent rewards. The use of addictive substances causes the MDS to malfunction in

a way that exaggerates those correlations in the presence of use-related environmental cues. As a

result, the system eectively supplies the addict's brain with inated forecasts of available rewards.

The pertinent mechanism is, however, specic to addiction, and does not justify the general practice

of classifying present focus as a cognitive bias.

       Despite widespread use of the phrase present bias rather than the more neutral and descripti-

vely accurate present focus, the literature oers little in the way of general evidence (not pertaining

specically to addiction) of characterization failure in contemporaneously framed decisions. Bern-

heim (2016) oers several cautionary observations, including the fact that many cultures emphasize

the importance of living in the moment, as well as the popular adage that deathbed regrets rarely

include having spent too few hours at the oce. These observations raise the possibility that sup-

port for the long-run criterion among some economists is a consequence of type-A paternalism 

that is, successful workaholics imposing their own personal values on others.

       The case of time inconsistency underscores the limitations of the metachoice method, discussed

in Section 2.2.4, Because a metachoice must temporally precede the component choices, any attempt

to ociate between the contemporaneous and forward-looking perspectives based on this method

would involve a metachoice made in the forward-looking frame. It follows that the normative validity

of the metachoice hinges on the assumption that the forward looking frame is free from bias. Using

it therefore assumes the conclusion.
  35
       In this example, one reaches the same conclusion by treating Norma as two separate individuals (selves) and
applying the Pareto criterion. For a more elaborate application of the multi-self Pareto criterion involving life-cycle
planning, see Laibson et al. (1998). However, in the context of life-cycle planning problems, the multi-self Pareto
criterion does not generally coincide with the Bernheim-Rangel unambiguous choice criterion under an unrestricted
welfare-relevant domain.      Indeed, Bernheim and Rangel (2009) argue that the multi-self Pareto criterion lacks a
conceptually sound foundation. Perhaps most problematically, it assumes that each self is indierent with respect
to all past experience. That assumption is empirically vacuous, inasmuch as choices cannot shed light on backward-
looking preferences.
  36
       For example, this conclusion would follow if, prior to lunchtime, Norma is indierent between salad and pizza
plus $0.74, but at lunchtime is indierent between salad plus $0.49 and pizza.




                                                          28
2.2.6          The problem of the second best

The elds of psychology and behavioral economics have identied a wide assortment of broadly

applicable framing phenomena which analysts generally examine one at a time in narrowly delimited

contexts. Unfortunately, welfare analyses that abstract from the pervasiveness and multiplicity of

framing eects and biases arguably overlook critical second-best considerations (in the sense of

Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956-57) that could overturn their implications.

          To illustrate this concern, suppose consumers initially overestimate the benets of compound

interest. Imagine in addition that the government could eliminate this bias by adopting a nancial

education program, T. Ignoring the possibility that consumers suer from other biases, the program

is plainly benecial.           But what if consumers also suer from severe present bias,
                                                                                                         37   so that, on

balance, they initially save too little?              Considering all sources of ineciency, the policy is likely

harmful. Indeed, formal welfare analysis might favor an alternative educational intervention,                        D,
that misleads consumers into exaggerating the benets of compound interest even further.

          Matters are even worse if one acknowledges the possible existence of unknown biases outside

the immediate scope of analysis. If behavioral welfare economics dees compartmentalization (i.e.,

considering biases one, or a few, at a time) and instead requires a comprehensive account of human

decision making, the prospects for useful progress are remote.

          Fortunately, there is a coherent case to be made for compartmentalization. Returning to our

example, the indictment of policy T and justication for policy D arguably follow from a conceptual

error: the analysis attempts to treat sources of ineciency comprehensively, but does not treat policy

options comprehensively.
                                   38   Distorting policies that target consumers' understanding of compound

interest in order to address concerns arising from present bias makes little sense if other policy

tools are better suited for the latter purpose. Suppose the optimal comprehensive policy consists

of    T     combined with measures that create appropriate commitment opportunities.                      Then one can

arrive at the optimum by compartmentalizing policies and the concerns that motivate them in

parallel.        A compartmentalized evaluation of nancial education would focus on welfare eects

involving comprehension, and would treat concerns about present bias as if they will be (but are

not yet) fully resolved through appropriate commitments. Likewise, a compartmentalized evaluation

of commitment opportunities would focus on welfare eects involving present bias, and would treat

concerns about comprehension as if they will be (but are not yet) fully resolved through appropriate

education.

          Ambuehl et al. (2017) refer to this approach as idealized welfare analysis, to indicate that it

treats sources of ineciency outside the scope of the analysis as if other policies will provide ideal

resolutions.         The main advantage of the approach is that it provides a coherent justication for

compartmentalization, at least in cases where there are good solutions for each compartmentalized

problem: the planner can focus on one problem at a time, and still achieve the overall optimum.

     37
          For the purpose of this example, we assume that present focus constitutes a mistake, as is often assumed.
     38
          One could also object to policy   D based on concerns about the ethics of spreading misinformation, or about the
government's long-term credibility. Those considerations are orthogonal to our current focus.




                                                                29
That said, compartmentalization obviously involves compromises. If there is no good way to address

a source of ineciency outside the scope of analysis, the approach will overlook potentially important

second-best considerations.

   At rst, it might appear that idealized welfare analysis requires a deep understanding of all

decision-making aws and their solutions, because it references judgments made in an idealized set-

ting, rather than actual decisions. However, Ambuehl et al. (2017) show that it is sometimes possible

to approximate idealized welfare eects using actual choice data, even if one has no information

concerning the existence or nature of other biases that may aect those choices.

   A simple example helps to illustrate the preceding point. Suppose a nancial instrument                    z   yields

a future payo     f (z),   which the consumer mistakenly perceives as     g(z, Î¸),   where   Î¸   is an educational

policy.    For simplicity, the consumer expects to spend income when it is received, and evaluates

outcomes according to the utility function       c1 + Î³u(c2 ), where c1   is current consumption,        c2   is future

consumption, and       Î³    is a discount factor. In that case, the consumer is willing to pay           Î³u(g(z, Î¸))
for the instrument, but should be willing to pay        Î³u(f (z)).   Thus, the measured valuation error is

Î³ (u(g(z, Î¸)) â u(f (z))).     Now suppose that, unbeknownst to the analyst, the consumer discounts the

future excessively due to present bias, and that true time preferences are governed by a discount

factor    Î´ > Î³.   To conduct idealized welfare analysis of the educational policy, we would construct

the valuation error that would result from the discrepancy between             f (z)   and    g(z, Î¸),   assuming a

full resolution of present bias through some other policy (e.g., one involving commitments). Under

our assumptions, the idealized valuation error is      Î´ (u(g(z, Î¸)) â u(f (z))).     Notice that the measured

valuation error equals the idealized valuation error up to a factor of proportionality (here,                     Î³/Î´).
Accordingly, the measured valuation error has the right sign, ranks policies (Î¸) in the correct order,

and provides a valid gauge of their proportional costs and benets. Notice also that the factor of

proportionality does not depend on the instrument under consideration,                z.   Ambuehl et al. (2017)

prove under much more general conditions that these properties hold to a rst-order approximation

for small instruments (e.g., even when true preferences involve an arbitrary function                v   that diers

from   u).

2.2.7      Social aggregation

The thorny problem of social aggregation has fascinated and perplexed economists for decades.

The same challenges are present in behavioral economics, and similar solutions are available. For

instance, the Bernheim-Rangel framework lends itself to generalizations of aggregate consumer

surplus, the Pareto criterion, and various methods of making interpersonal comparisons. A complete

discussion of these issues would consume many pages; we refer the reader to Bernheim and Rangel

(2009), Bernheim et al. (2015a) (also discussed in Section 4.5.2), and Fluerbaey and Schokkaert

(2013).

2.3 Self-reported well-being
The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in various measures of self-reported

well-being (SRWB).
                         39   Perhaps the most visible application in economics has involved the con-

struction and renement of national happiness accounts (see, for example, Helliwell et al., 2014;

Kahneman et al., 2004). The literature is far too vast to survey here; see Helliwell and Barrington-

Leigh (2010); Fujiwara and Dolan (2016); Graham (2016).

       As noted in Section 2.1, one can potentially provide conceptual foundations for SRWB through

either mental statism or preference theory. Unfortunately, the intended foundations for particular

applications are sometimes unclear. We will begin the preference-theoretic perspectives because, in

our view, it provides the strongest foundation for SRWB analysis.



2.3.1       SRWB as an implementation of preference theory

There are two possible routes to justifying SRWB as an implementation of preference theory. The

rst, which we already discussed in Section 2.2.4, construes SRWB as an adjunct to choice-oriented

methods. Instead of taking SRWB at face value as a generally reliable measure of overall well-being,

we interpret it instead as an indicator of what people would likely choose.                This distinction has

important practical implications because it recasts the object of the exercise as accurate prediction

(of choice) rather than accurate measurement (of well-being). Such indicators may be particularly

useful when pertinent choice data are unavailable, or when we have reason to believe the associated

choices reect misconceptions.         As an example, Frey et al. (2010) use SRWB data to infer the

willingness to pay for environmental goods.           Likewise, Stutzer and Frey (2008) hypothesize that

people make faulty decisions about where to live because they systematically misunderstand how

they will feel about lengthy commutes; the study uses SRWB data to ll the resulting evidentiary

gap concerning preferences. See also Benjamin et al. (2012, 2014).

       The second preference-theoretic route to justifying SRWB assumes that the domain of preferen-

ces is limited to the decision maker's mental states. Answers to questions about overall well-being

arguably express preferences over those states, as do choices. Of course, respecting the decision ma-

ker's preferences over mental states also qualies as a form of mental statism, and consequently some

of the challenges facing mental statist interpretations of SRWB, discussed in the next subsection,

apply.



2.3.2       SRWB as an implementation of mental statism

In many ways, mental statist interpretations of SRWB methods seem more natural than preference-

theoretic interpretations.       The objective of these methods is to elicit the mental states a person

actually experiences as the result of pursuing a particular course of action. As the parable of the

oblivious altruist illustrates (Section 2.1), a decision to adopt mental statism is highly consequential

  39
       The phrase subjective well-being (abbreviated SWB) is more commonly used in the literature. We prefer the
phrase self-reported well-being (SRWB) because it avoids the incorrect implication that subjective experience is
directly observable.

for the many settings in behavioral economics wherein people are assumed to hold incorrect beliefs.

In eect, one must embrace the adage that what you don't know can't hurt you.

          Justifying SRWB as an implementation of mental statism is, however, more challenging than

one might think. The following is a brief summary of the conceptual issues discussed in Bernheim

(2016, 2018).

          There are two distinct schools of thought about the nature of aggregate utility (AU). The rst

holds that we go through life experiencing disaggregated hedonic sensations, and aggregate only

when we are called upon to express judgments or make choices.
                                                                                     40   According to this view, AU does

not exist until we have reason to construct it. The second holds that AU exists as a continuous

hedonic sensation that we can access and report when asked about our well-being. Obviously, the

second perspective is more favorable to the use of AU as a welfare measure.



Case 1: Aggregate utility as a constructed judgment.                                If AU is merely a constructed judge-

ment, then eorts to formulate a sound conceptual foundation for using SRWB to measure welfare

within the mental statist paradigm encounter signicant obstacles. Suppose we can describe hedo-

nic experience as a vector             h = (h1 , .., hN ) â H .    We can think of a judgment as a binary relation

<     that orders potential experiences (elements of                  H)   either partially or fully.     If people care only

about their own mental states, then choice reects one such judgment, call it                        <C .   SRWB embodies

another judgment,            <S .   If aggregate hedonic experience implies a true preference relation,               <E ,   then

one is free to argue that             <S   serves as a better proxy than           <C .   However, if the consumer does

not experience aggregate utility hedonically, the justication for respecting                        <C   cannot reference a

relation such as         <E ;   the criterion must then stand on its own, as must             <C .
          As noted in Section 2.2.1, the argument for              <C      is that the purpose of choice is conformable

with the purpose of normative economic analysis: in each case, the objective of the judgment is to

promote the well-being of those aected by the selection and implementation of an alternative. In

contrast, the purpose of any judgment underlying SRWB is simply to answer a question. Granted,

arriving at an answer is itself a choice, but it is a choice of words rather than of the particular

alternative or outcome the words describe. An honest respondent aggregates over the dimensions

of    h    according to her understanding of the words and phrases that comprise the SRWB elicitation

question.         In the best possible scenario, those words have a precise meaning  for example, they

may instruct the subject to score experiences according to a particular function,                            f (h)    in which

case the analyst's choice of wording, rather than the subject's judgment, dictates the principles

of aggregation.           Using vague words and phrases such as happiness and satisfaction that do

not precisely specify the function               f   only magnies these concerns.            If, in response to her own

idiosyncratic experiential associations, consumer                 i    has learned to equate the word happiness with
           H                            H                                                S
the value fi (h) for some aggregator fi , and the word satisfaction with the value fi (h) for some
             S
aggregator fi , the analyst's choice of wording will continue to dictate the principles of aggregation,

     40
          The notion that life consists of highly disaggregated subjective experiences has a long philosophical tradition: see,
for example, Aristotle (2012, translation), Mill (2012, reprinted), and more recently Sen (1980-1981), who advocates
a vector view of utility.




                                                                  32
but in a more haphazard way.



Case 2: Aggregate experienced utility as a continuous hedonic sensation.                                            If instead we

assume that aggregate experienced utility exists as a continuous hedonic sensation, then the object

of an SRWB question is to elicit it. Here we also encounter several conceptual challenges.

       As discussed in Section 2.2.2, there are natural and important settings in which hedonic expe-

rience cannot logically include the aggregate welfare evaluation,                         V,   for example because experience

is distributed across time or states of nature.                          If the consumer does not hedonically experience

V,     it must reect a judgment concerning experience. But then we are eectively back in Case 1.

In principle, one can speak of eliciting the true momentary AU at each point in time and under

each state of nature because, by denition, the individual can only have one aggregate hedonic

experience at any given moment.                       Yet there is no single true version of overall welfare,            V,   to

elicit: because dierent judgments can have dierent purposes (e.g., evaluating satisfaction versus

evaluating happiness), the consumer can simultaneously subscribe to multiple judgments about the

same state-and-time-contingent proles of hedonic experiences.                              Thus, in attempting to justify a

particular version of          V,   one cannot reference the experiential truth; rather, the criterion must

stand on its own, as in Case 1.

       There are two possible paths forward. One is to take the view that our objective is to elicit some

particular     V   (apparently other than the objective function that rationalizes choice), the justication

for which remains unclear. The other is to focus on measuring the stream of momentary hedonic

sensations,     ht ,   as in the Experience Sampling Methods of Kahneman et al. (2004). A limitation of

this second approach is that one must supplement it with some other criterion for aggregating sen-

sations across time and states of nature; otherwise, one has no basis for comparing two momentary

AU trajectories,         (h0 , h1 , ...)   and   (hÌ0 , hÌ1 ...),   except in rare cases of dominance.

       Regardless of which analytic path one chooses, elicitation raises a separate set of conceptual

challenges. To measure AU, we have to ask a question about it. But the phrases that economists,

psychologists, and philosophers use to describe normative ideals, such as experienced utility, are

terms of art.          People construe natural language according to their own experiential associations,

rather than the rigorous principles the analyst intends. As an illustration, consider the problem of

eliciting momentary AU at time                   t   rather than       V,   or vice versa, in a setting where people may have

memory utility and anticipatory emotions. What phrasing would allow respondents to understand

that we want them to account for certain types of feelings about the past and future, but not others?

       Another elicitation issue concerns motivations. People may not feel obliged to answer questions

about well-being truthfully, or based on careful introspection. Answers may have incidental conse-

quences that provide respondents with incentives to misreport their true feelings. For example, some

responses may speak well of the subject's character, others poorly.
                                                                                               41   Also, because deliberation is

costly, people may give SRWB questions only cursory consideration, particularly if they are averse

to contemplating negative sensations. Even a preference for honesty cannot resolve these issues if

  41
       See, for example, List et al. (2004).            Another possibility is that I may have an incentive to exaggerate my
preferences if I think the resulting SWRB analysis will be politically impactful; see Frey and Stutzer (2007).



                                                                        33
respondents talk themselves into believing answers that sustain self-serving personal narratives, or

if they truthfully report supercial judgments.

       Further challenges arise from the fact that we always measure SRWB on a unitless scale. As

a result, respondents have to decide what the numbers mean, and their interpretations may vary

with context. For example, the respondent might treat 4 as typical because it is in the middle

of the 1-to-7 range, and then renormalize the scale subsequent to an event that changes what is

typical. Celebrated results in the literature concerning hedonic adaptation, such as the Easterlin

paradox, may be attributable to confounding changes in normalizations.
                                                                                        42   Bernheim (2009) argues

that there is no objective way to distinguish between changes in underlying well-being and changes

in the way people interpret the scale  in other words, that these two eects are not independently

recoverable, in the sense that we cannot identify their separate eects even with ideal data.
                                                                                                              43

       In defense of SRWB as an implementation of mental statism, one could argue that the appro-

priate standard for evaluating a welfare measure is not whether it is perfect, but rather whether

it reasonably approximates a consumer's well-being. Some economists nd this defense convincing

because they believe that, as a practical matter, answers to questions about states of mind such as

happiness and satisfaction must correlate with any reasonable notion of true welfare. Others nd

this defense problematic for at least two reasons.
                                                             44    First, even if our objective is approximation,

we are still obliged to identify the ideal we seek to approximate, and to explain why it provides an

appropriate standard. Thus the preceding discussion continues to apply. Second, since true (as

opposed to reported) AU is unobservable, there is no way to validate the elicitation process and

gauge the accuracy of the approximation.
                                                    45   Without the possibility of validation, debates about

normative methodology inevitably devolve into unprovable assertions. From the perspective of a

skeptic, a justication for a welfare measure that relies on its relationship to some unknowable

underlying truth is no justication at all; if the pertinent truth is not knowable, the measure must

stand on its own, exactly as in Case 1.

       A point that potentially favors SRWB over choice-oriented methods is that, in some contexts,

it may more easily accommodate the possibility that consumers' concerns include conditions of

  42
       See Easterlin (1974), or Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) for some contrary evidence.
  43
       While the SRWB literature acknowledges the possibility that changes in the interpretation of the well-being
scale may confound comparisons, those commentaries usually do not address the question of recoverability; see, for
example, the discussion of scaling in Dolan et al. (2011).        There are exceptions such as Lacy et al. (2008), who
claim to measure rescaling separately from eects on happiness. However, that study relies on supposedly intuitive
assertions rather than rigorous accounts of identication, and close examination reveals that its conclusions hinge
on unstated and potentially unprovable assumptions (in particular, that people use the same scale when rating their
own experiences and others' hypothetical experiences).
  44
       The same argument is more persuasive in the context of discussions of national accounts, where alternatives such
as GDP are also intended as rough proxies, rather than as rigorous welfare measures. Here we are concerned instead
with the conceptual foundations of microeconomic welfare analysis. The question is whether it is possible to provide
rigorous foundations for a mental statist interpretation of SRWB.
  45
       Some argue that correlations between self-reported well-being, biometric variables, and neural measurements
corroborate the use of such objects as indicia of well-being (see, e.g., Larsen and Fredrickson, 1999).      But that
argument is circular: it demonstrates only that the variables in question have something in common, not that they
individually or collectively embody true well-being. Nor does it tell us much about the accuracy of the purported
approximation.




                                                           34
choice.
          46   To illustrate, suppose Norma cares both about the item she chooses,                  x,   and the set from

which she chooses it,      X.   Without further restrictions, all we can infer from her choice is that she

prefers    (x, X)        0
                    to (x , X) for all   x0   in   X.   This type of information does not allow us to determine

whether she is better o with a policy that mandates                  x   (thereby giving her     (x, {x})),   or one that

mandates       y   (thereby giving her    (y, {y})).       The SRWB method potentially avoids this diculty

because  setting aside other concerns  it ostensibly allows us to gauge well-being under each type

of mandate.

       As with choice-oriented methods, social aggregation poses important challenges.                         The issues

are largely similar. The common practice of reporting simple summary statistics such as average

SRWB responses resolves these issues somewhat arbitrarily, and makes the implied welfare weights

dependent on how dierent consumers happen to use the scale. To illustrate, suppose a consumer

who initially rates her happiness as               r(h)   when experiencing sensations        h   switches to reporting

re(h) = 4 + Î±(r(h) â 4), with Î± > 1 (where 4 is the midpoint of the scale).                 By virtue of reinterpreting

the unitless scale in this way, the consumer would eectively increase the weight she receives in social

welfare analyses. For discussions of other aggregation issues, see Ng (1997); Nordhaus (2009); Frey

and Stutzer (2007).



2.4 Flavors of paternalism and justications for government intervention
Few people would argue that deference to consumers' judgments should be absolute. Obvious excep-

tions include the treatment of children and the cognitively impaired, who arguably lack the capacity

required to understand the consequences of their actions. However, the scope of paternalistic policy-

making is far broader in practice. Dworkin (1971) lists a wide range of examples, such as laws that

require motorcyclists to wear safety helmets, forbid swimming at public beaches when no lifeguards

are on duty, criminalize suicide, and preclude contracts for perpetual involuntary servitude. In each

case, the primary rationale for these policies is arguably to protect the decision maker, rather than

to limit harm to others.

       In Section 2.2.3, we identied four classes of reasons for objecting to a consumer's choices, and

thus potentially for intervening in their decisions (see equation (1)): (i) the consumer misunderstands

the set of available action, (ii) she misunderstands the mapping from actions to outcomes, (iii) she

fails to perform the max operator correctly, or (iv) she uses an inappropriate objective function..

Those who subscribe to welfare hedonism or to objective accounts of welfare can potentially justify

paternalistic interventions based on (iv). However, preference theory limits us to (i), (ii), and (iii)

(Dworkin 1971; New 1999); it is consonant with a weak form of paternalism that defers to the

consumers' underlying objectives, but nds fault with their execution.                       Within a choice-oriented

framework, a paternalistic planner can improve welfare by proscribing or compelling particular

  46
       This advantage is not always present.       Recall, for example, our discussion of DellaVigna et al. (2012), which
examined the willingness to pay to avoid charitable solicitation.         We observed in Section 2.2.4 that, if people feel
socially obligated to hear out charitable fundraisers, social pressure may infect the metachoices that dene the
willingness to pay. A similar phenomenon could arise in the context of SRWB: people may feel a social obligation to
report high well-being despite charitable solicitation.




                                                              35
actions whenever naturally occurring decision frames lie outside the welfare-relevant domain, the

object being to achieve outcomes the consumers would choose in welfare-relevant frames.         This

consideration motivates the various corrective policies we consider in the subsequent three sections

of the chapter.

   Preference-theoretic approaches encounter conceptual diculties in cases where the individual

in question suers from endemic characterization failure (as with children and the cognitively impai-

red), so that the welfare-relevant domain is either empty or too sparse to permit useful comparisons.

While this problem may initially strike the reader as severe, it is important to remember that eco-

nomists rarely observe rich choice data for any particular individual, and that we routinely impute

vast portions of the choice correspondence from the behavior of people we deem similar according to

statistical models. The current problem is no dierent. Thus the choice-oriented framework yields

a disciplined recipe for implementing paternalism in cases with endemic characterization failure: ll

out the sparsely populated welfare-relevant domain based on the choices of consumers who avoid

characterization failure but resemble the individual of interest in all other respects. This approach

to paternalism represents an application of the rational consumer benchmark method discussed

in Section 2.2.4; see also Section 3.2.3.

   A more recent strand of literature explores the notion of libertarian paternalism (Thaler and

Sunstein, 2003). It focuses on a class of policies known as nudges, dened as non-coercive changes in

choice architectures that minimally impact opportunities, but nevertheless incline people toward

good decisions.   Such policies are arguably libertarian in the sense that choice is left to the

individual, but they are paternalistic in the sense that the government intervenes with the objective

of improving outcomes, on the grounds that people have cognitive limitations and suer from biases.

Just as with paternalism, each account of welfare oers a dierent route to rationalizations of this

perspective. For example, within choice-oriented (preference-theoretic) framework, the planner can

improve welfare by modifying the framing of a decision problem so that it falls within, rather than

outside, the welfare-relevant domain. Because changes in framing do not alter opportunities, they

are interpretable as nudges. We return to the topic of nudges in Section 3.5.



2.5 Other perspectives on social objectives
It is important to acknowledge that normative analysis is not limited to welfarist perspectives.

Alternatives arise for both practical and conceptual reasons.

   As a practical matter, economists are rarely given carte blanche to design policies from the

ground up with the objective of promoting consumers' interests. More commonly, we respond to

specic directives from policy makers. For example, a government ocial or agency may adopt the

normative view that more saving is better, and ask economists to devise strategies for increasing

rates of saving at the smallest possible cost to the government.     Directives can reect carefully

thought-out welfarist objectives, or they may be simple-minded proxies. Alternatively, they may

reect the personal objectives of the pertinent ocials, such as maximizing the odds of reelection.

Usually, one can reformulate such directives as formal problems that are amenable to economic



                                                 36
analysis.

    A variation of this theme is present in the optimal tax literature.      Consider the problem of

setting income tax rates to optimally balance redistribution from rich to poor against the costs of

discouraging labor supply. What weight should an economist attach to the redistributive motive?

A common approach is to formulate the problem in terms of parameters measuring the marginal

social benets of increasing each individual's income (Saez and Stantcheva, 2016). Implicitly, these

welfare weights reect the preferences of the policymaker.

    There are also conceptual alternatives to welfarism. For instance, some have argued that policy

evaluation should focus on opportunities rather than outcomes (Sen, 1992; Arrow, 1995; Roemer,

1998; Sugden, 2004), while others emphasize the importance of process (Frey et al., 2004). To date,

these perspectives have gained relatively little traction within behavioral public economics.




3    Policies targeting commodities
Our focus now shifts from the general principles of welfare analysis to specic classes of applications.

The role of taxes or subsidies as a means of correcting consumer mistakes is one of the rst questions

explored in BPE.

    The rst wave of the literature has focused on particular biases in specic markets. The motiva-

tion was simple: conventional interpretations of standard behavioral models implied that consumers

would not spend their money optimally due to decision making failures such as imperfect self-control.

The research agenda was then to formulate a model with these features and examine its implications

for, e.g., taxes on cigarettes or potato chips. This work highlighted a variation of the Pigouvian prin-

ciple for externalities: the optimal tax should oset the average degree of over- or under-estimation

of the marginal utility from the good in question.

    Because the Pigouvian principle is not limited to any one particular bias, the next wave of papers

provided richer analyses by deriving more general optimal tax formulas that envision a variety of

biases. These papers eshed out the modied Pigouvian principle in greater generality. We derive

this principle in Section 3.2 for the simple framework introduced in Section 3.1.       In addition to

illuminating the forces behind the optimal commodity tax formulas, in Section 3.2 we also survey

the empirical strategies that economists use to implement the formulas.

    In practice, policymakers often worry that taxes on sin goods such as cigarettes or sugary drinks

are regressive.   The literature has therefore advanced beyond the simple Pigouvian principle by

incorporating motives for redistribution.    We discuss this work and derive some basic lessons in

Section 3.3.

    Alongside the literature on corrective commodity taxes, recent work has begun to explore the

welfare implications of inattention to taxes that are not fully salient or misunderstood because, for

example, they are not included in the posted prices of products.       We survey the core theoretical

principles, as well as the strategies for empirical implementation in Section 3.4.

    Finally, we briey discuss non-nancial policy instruments, such as nudges, in Section 3.5, and




                                                  37
the implications of consumers' social preferences for commodity taxes in Section 3.6.



3.1 A stylized model of consumer choice
To organize our discussion, we study a simple model based on the general framework of Farhi and

Gabaix (2015). We consider an economy in which consumers choose to divide their wealth between

two goods,     x   and       y.    Firms produce       x   at a constant marginal cost            c   and sell it in a competitive

market at a price            p   (which equals    c   in equilibrium), where it is also subject to a sales tax                   t.   The

second good,       y,   is the numeraire. We use            xÎ¸ (p, t)   to denote a type-Î¸ consumer's demand for                 x    at a

price   p   and tax     t,   and   D(p, t)   to denote the total demand. The measure over types is                      Âµ(Î¸).
   We let     VÎ¸   denote the objective (or welfare) function that a type                     Î¸   consumer should maximize.

See Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 for commentary on interpretations of this function.                                     By positing the

existence of a well-dened welfare function                   VÎ¸ ,   we focus on settings in which the analyst entertains

no normative ambiguity.

   For simplicity, we assume there are two types of consumers,                            Î¸ â {s, b}.     Type   s   (for standard)

consumers always maximize                VÎ¸ .   Type   b (for behavioral) consumers may follow a dierent behavio-
ral rule owing to some cognitive bias. The following three biases have attracted particular attention

within the literature on corrective commodity taxation:


  1. Limited attention or salience bias.                      Consumers may be inattentive to features of decision

        problems that are insuciently salient. In certain contexts, sales taxes and energy costs may

        fall into this category. Consumers may also ignore health costs that accrue slowly over the

        course of time.             See, for example, Gabaix and Laibson (2006); DellaVigna (2009); Gabaix

        (2014); Bordalo et al. (2013); Koszegi and Szeidl (2013); Koszegi and Szeidl (2013).


  2. Incorrect beliefs.             Consumers may have incorrect beliefs about certain attributes of a good,

        such as its calorie content, its future health implications, or its energy eciency.                                 See, for

        example, Allcott (2013); Attari et al. (2010); Bollinger et al. (2011); Bordalo et al. (2013).


  3. Imperfect self-control. Consumers who place excessive weight on immediate gratication will

        tend to overconsume goods with immediate benets and delayed costs, and underconsume

        goods with immediate costs and delayed benets. Delayed consequences can be particularly

        important for activities with implications for health; see, for example, Gruber and KÂ®szegi

        2001, 2004; Bernheim and Rangel 2004. We discuss theory, evidence, and normative issues

        pertaining to self-control in Section 6.


For simplicity, we assume utility is quasilinear:                          VÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t), y) = y + vÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t)).      The budget

constraint requires              y = zÎ¸ â (p + t)xÎ¸ (p, t),      where       zÎ¸   is the initial endowment of type          Î¸,    which

we assume is large enough such that                    xÎ¸ (p, t) < zÎ¸      in the range of taxes we consider. Accordingly,

we can write utility as              VeÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t)) = zÎ¸ â (p + t)xÎ¸ (p, t) + vÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t)).           This formulation allows

for heterogeneity with respect to behavior (xÎ¸ ), normative objectives (VÎ¸ ), and income (zÎ¸ ), but

imposes no restrictions on the manner in which these characteristics are related.



                                                                      38
3.2 Corrective taxation for behavioral consumers: Basic implications
3.2.1      Basic theory
                                                                                              P
The policymaker sets           t to maximize aggregate welfare W (t) =                          Î¸   Âµ(Î¸)VÌÎ¸ (x(p, t)), accounting for the
fact that all revenues are returned to consumers through lump-sum distributions. (Thus,                                         zÎ¸ = zÌÎ¸ +T ,
where    zÌÎ¸   is the exogenous endowment and                      T   is the lump-sum distribution.) Although here we have

in mind commodity taxes addressing internalities, rather than inattention to or misperceptions of

the tax   t itself as in Section 3.4, our derivations do not require x to depend only on the tax-inclusive
price   p + t.
   A small increase in the tax,                dt,   has three eects:


   1. It lowers consumers' utility by                       D(p, t)dt       through a direct wealth eect, but mechanically

        increases revenue, and hence lump-sum distributions, by                                   Ddt.    With quasilinear utility and

        no dierences in the marginal social value of a dollar across potential recipients, these two

        changes cancel out. However, once we relax quasilinearity, dierences in the distributions of

        revenue collections and lump-sum transfers will aect aggregate welfare.


   2. Consumers substitute away from good                              x,   causing tax revenue to fall by           tDt (p, t)dt.
                                                                                                                                                  d
   3. Behavioral consumers alter their purchases, causing their utility to change by                                     Âµ(b) (vb0 (xb ) â p â t) dt xb (p, t)dt.

The third eect is not present for standard consumers. This conclusion follows from the Envelope

Theorem:         because      xs    maximizes        Vs ,   it satises the rst-order condition                   vs0 (xs ) = p + t,   which
                                        d
means     Âµ(s) (vs0 (xs ) â p â t)      dt xs (p, t)        = 0.       The presence of behavioral consumers introduces the

term    Î³b (p, t) :=   p + t â vb0 (xb (p, t)), henceforth called the price-metric measure of bias, into optimal
tax formulas.

   The term        Î³b (p, t)   has a concrete empirical interpretation. Let                           xâb (p, t)   be the demand relation

implied by maximization of              Vb .   Using the associated rst-order condition, it is straightforward to
             â
verify that xb (p       â Î³b (p, t), t) = xb (p, t).          Intuitively,       Î³b (p, t)   prices out the bias: it is the amount

by which the price of           x   would have to fall to bring optimal purchases in line with actual purchases

at consumer price of           p + t.   As discussed later, a number of studies including Chetty et al. (2009),

Allcott and Taubinsky (2015), Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming), and Allcott et al. (2018b)

have used this price-metric approach.

   The welfare eects of a change in the tax rate depend critically on the price-metric measure of

bias. Putting the three eects together, we nd:


                                                                                              d
                                        W 0 (t) = tDt (p, t) â Î³b (p, t)Âµ(b)                     xb (p, t)
                                                                                              dt
                                                      = (t â Î³Ì(p, t))Dt (p, t)                                                            (2)

                       Î³b (p,t)Âµ(b) dt xb (p,t)
where    Î³Ì(p, t) =            Dt (p,t)         is the average marginal bias; i.e., it is the average degree to which

consumers over- or under-estimate the net benets of the marginal purchases stimulated by a change

in the tax rate        t,   weighted by their demand responses. This statistic is the critical determinant of



                                                                            39

the optimal tax rate because biases only matter insofar as people with those biases adjust their

consumption in response to variations in the tax-inclusive price.

   Because   W 0 (t) = 0   at the optimum, equation (2) immediately yields a simple formula for the

optimal commodity tax:


                                                    tâ = Î³Ì(p, t)                                                              (3)


The parallel to Pigouvian taxation is clear:              the planner sets the commodity tax to oset the

marginal internality (i.e., the average wedge induced by consumers' cognitive biases), instead of

the marginal externality.

   Figure 1 illustrates the optimal tax rule for the case of homogeneous consumers under the

additional simplifying restriction that we can write           xb (p, t)   and   xâb (p, t)   as   xb (p + t)   and   xâb (p + t),
respectively. The gure plots the naturally-occurring demand curve and the welfare-relevant demand

curve. At market prices, individuals overconsume the good by                  xb (p) â xâb (p),      because they perceive

its marginal utility to be   Î³   higher than it actually is (for simplicity,           Î³   does not vary with           p   in the

gure). A tax equal to  Î³ decreases the quantity consumed from xb (p)                                   â
                                                                                        to the optimal xb (p), because
              â
xb (p + Î³) = xb (p). The welfare-gain from the optimal tax is given by the shaded triangle below the
                                               â
market price p and above the demand curve xb (p).



3.2.2   Applications

The literature contains variations of formula (3) that
                                                  1    are specic to particular combinations of

products and cognitive biases. Some examples follow.

   Unhealthy foods : O'Donoghue and Rabin (2006) study the taxation of unhealthy foods such




                                                          40
as potato chips under the assumption that present-focused tendencies render consumers time-

inconsistent. They adopt the normative perspective that present focus constitutes a bias. It follows

that people overconsume unhealthy foods because they place too little weight on future health

costs. Based on a variant of (3), they conclude that, as long as the operative cognitive biases lead

to overconsumption and behavioral consumers are at least somewhat price-sensitive, the optimal

tax is positive.
                    47

       Smoking: Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2001) study the taxation of cigarettes using the same model of

time inconsistency as O'Donoghue and Rabin (2006), and adopt the same normative perspective.

Their model is at once simpler because they consider a homogeneous population with no standard

consumers, and more complicated because they account for the types of intertemporal complemen-

tarities in preferences commonly associated with addictive tendencies. Their analysis demonstrates

that the main insights from (3) carry over to settings with this type of dynamic preference struc-

ture, provided one adjusts the denition of the marginal bias               Î³   to account for the eect of current

consumption on future overconsumption.

       Energy-using durables: Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) and Allcott et al. (2014) study the sub-

sidization of energy-using durable goods under the assumption that consumers underweight future

energy costs, and derive variants of (2) and (3).                Allcott et al. (2014) also provide extensions to

settings with multiple policy instruments (both taxes on energy consumption and subsidies for

energy-ecient products), as well as externalities. A key result in Allcott et al. (2014) is that, in

the presence of heterogeneous behavioral biases and externalities, the optimal policy mix involves

a subsidy for the energy ecient durable good and a tax on energy that is less than the marginal

externality of energy use. The intuition builds on the observations that standard consumers will

over-purchase the subsidized energy-ecient durable good, and will have larger reactions to the

energy tax (which behavioral consumers discount because it is in the future). Making the tax lower

than the marginal externality for energy use is welfare-enhancing because it osets the subsidy's

distortionary eect on standard consumers while aecting behavioral consumers to a lesser degree.

See Farhi and Gabaix (2015) for a related and more general analysis of the violation of the principle

of targeting. See also Heutel (2015) and Tsvetanov and Segerson (2013) for other applications to

energy-using durables.

       General frameworks.        Mullainathan et al. (2012) provide a general treatment of commodity

taxation similar to the one presented here, with the exception that consumers have unit demand

for the good in question.          Farhi and Gabaix (2015) examine a more general framework that en-

compasses continuous demand for multiple products with arbitrary patterns of complementarities,

substitutabilities, and biases.

3.2.3       Empirical measurement and implementation

The naturally occurring and ideal demand functions for behavioral consumers,                                         xb (p, t)   and   xâb (p, t),
are the key inputs for the optimal commodity tax formula.
                                                                                       48    Applications require empirical estima-

tes of these functions. The studies discussed in this section undertake empirical applications using

the approaches discussed in Section 2.2.4, and we reference the three core tasks discussed therein

throughout.

       Calibrating or estimating models with bias parameters. Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2001) and O'Donoghue

and Rabin (2006) derive optimal tax formulas for the case of present-biased consumers, and use evi-

dence from behavioral economics and public health to calibrate the parameters of structural models

of choice.      If   h    represents the future health costs of smoking or eating unhealthy food (calibra-

ted from public health studies), and if consumers improperly discount those costs by the factor                                                Î²
(calibrated from estimation in other domains), then the magnitude of the bias is                                        Î³ = (1 â Î²)h.49
       How do these studies address the three tasks set forth in Section 2.2.4? Both assume implicitly

that the welfare-relevant domain consists of decisions with no immediate consequences, so that

present focus (Î² ) exerts no inuence on ideal behavior. Choices in those frames are not actually

observed. Consequently, task 1 is accomplished by inferring                                 xâb   from   xb   based on a structural model

of preferences, with the key parameters,                        Î²   and   h,   identied from decisions in other domains. Tasks

2 and 3 receive less attention and are implicitly addressed through assumptions. These assumptions

raise both conceptual and empirical issues; see Section 2.2.5 for a discussion of time inconsistency

and the welfare-relevant domain (task 2), and the Appendix for comments on competing models of

self-control, which make dierent assumptions about consumers' concerns (task 3).

       A limitation of the aforementioned studies is that, by focusing on a particular model of bias,

they assume away other plausible biases. For example, in addition to being present-focused, consu-

mers may also hold incorrect beliefs about the health consequences of unhealthy foods or addictive

substances.          Or consumers may over-indulge in addictive substances because they underestimate

how addictive those substances actually are. As noted in 2.2.6, focusing on biases one at a time

ignores second-best issues arising from the potential existence of multiple biases.

       As these applications illustrate, an advantage of using a parametrized structural model of be-

havior and bias is that the problem of recovering the choice mapping becomes tractable even when

the analyst cannot directly observe choices in the welfare-relevant domain.

       Belief elicitation. Allcott (2011a; 2013) and Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) study the welfare

eects of biased beliefs concerning energy costs and income taxes, respectively.                                         As we explained

in Section 2.2.3, the welfare-relevant domain for any setting with purportedly biased beliefs (impli-

citly) consists of choice problems in which simple and transparent framing of pertinent information

ensures proper comprehension of the consequences following from each potential action.                                                    In an

ideal implementation, the analyst would perform task 1 by observing the naturally occurring and

  48
       Within the Bernheim-Rangel framework, one views both of these objects as manifestations of a more general
demand function,         x
                         bb (p, t, f ),   where   f   is the decision frame.
  49
       This formulation of bias also plays a crucial role in the types of contracts oered by prot-maximizing rms to
present-biased consumers (DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2004).




                                                                           42
welfare-relevant choices directly.         Task 2 requires corroborating evidence that consumers misun-

derstand consequences (e.g., that they ignore, misinterpret, or misuse information pertaining to

likelihoods) in the naturally occurring problems, but not within the welfare-relevant domain. Task

3 raises standard issues, but the scope of consumers' concerns is usually not controversial in these

applications.

       However, the ideal implementation is rarely feasible, because the hypothesized welfare-relevant

choices are typically articial and generally dicult to implement. One must therefore nd another

strategy for recovering the full choice mapping (task 1). The practical alternative used in the cited

studies is to formulate a structural model relating choices to beliefs, attempt to measure those beliefs

as directly as possible, and then substitute objective probability for subjective beliefs to extrapolate

choices within the welfare-relevant domain.
                                                     50

       The most direct route to justifying the belief-elicitation approach, and the one most applied

economists likely have in mind (at least implicitly), is to treat the expected utility model (or some

variant thereof ) as a literal depiction of cognitive processes.              In other words, upon writing the
                                          Pn
consumer's objective function as             i=1 Ïi u(xi ), we assume that    u(xi )   and   Ïi     actually exist within

the decision maker's mind, the former representing her actual hedonic evaluation of the outcome                            xi ,
the latter representing an actual subjective belief that takes the form of a mathematical probability,

and that  at least to an approximation  the cognitive process maximizes the expectation of the

hedonic reward. We are then free to ask decision makers about the values                       (Ï1 , ..., Ïn ),   or to elicit

these parameters in some other manner, and to infer unbiased choices by substituting objective

probabilities for the subjective values.

       Many economists prefer an interpretation of the theory under which the model of decision

making is an as-if  representation, rather than a literal depiction of cognition.                     This alternative

view has many attractions, including its ability to accommodate the realistic possibility that people

actually act on qualitative assessments of likelihoods rather than quantitative notions of subjective

probabilities.      However, once one adopts this perspective, a conceptual gap potentially opens up

between the elements of the theory and their ostensible empirical counterparts.                            Moreover, the

foundation for inferring unbiased choices by replacing the as-if subjective probability parameters

with objective probabilities becomes murky. The belief-elicitation approach may or may not be valid

under an as-if interpretation of the theory; in any given case, the question is amendable to empirical

investigation, and merits closer attention. See Bernheim (2018) for further discussion.

       One important limitation of the belief-elicitation strategy is that it cannot accommodate settings

in which objective probabilities are either unknown or controversial. Some have argued that realistic

economic settings rarely admit objective probability assessments; see, for example, Kurz (1994) on

the diversity of rational beliefs.

       Another important limitation of this strategy is that it assumes one particular biashere, in-

correct beliefswhile ignoring all others.           For example, if we derive         xâb (p, t)   by adjusting      xb (p, t)
  50
       For the purpose of this discussion, one can think of a belief as a probabilistic assessment. Elicitation methods
that induce people to state beliefs as point estimates rather than probability distributions are problematic for these
purposes, because they abstract from subjective uncertainty, which may well aect behavior.




                                                           43
to account for false beliefs in a setting where          xb   also reects present focus and inattention, the

normative standard will likely be misleading. See again the general discussion of second-best issues

in Section 2.2.6.

       An additional challenge encountered when taking this approach relates to equation (2): ulti-

mately, what matters are the mistaken beliefs of individuals who respond on the margin to the

policy in question, and not those of the overall population. Unfortunately, surveys that elicit beliefs

generally aim to do so for the latter and not the former. In their study of misperceptions concerning

income taxation, Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) address this issue by performing robustness

checks using the elicited beliefs of population subgroups that are more responsive to changes in tax

rates, such as those in the labor force and the self-employed.

       Comparing analogous demand responses.            Allcott and Wozny (2014) and Busse et al. (2013)

reason that consumer demand for vehicles should be equally responsive to the present value of

gasoline costs and up-front prices.         Upon nding that the sensitivity to gasoline costs is in fact

much lower, they attribute the dierential to biases aecting the evaluation of future costs, such as

inattention.

       In such settings, the denition of the welfare-relevant domain depends on the nature of the

assumed bias. For the case of vehicle demand, it presumably consists of settings in which conditions

putatively favor attentiveness to all components of cost. These studies accomplish task 1 by inferring

xâb (p, t) from xb (p, t) based on the observed responses to changes in vehicle prices and the net present
value of gasoline costs. In eect, they ll out the choice mapping by imposing a weak structural

assumption. This extrapolation hinges on a crucial statistic that Allcott and Wozny (2014) do not

measure directly: the appropriate discount rate.
                                                         51   Accordingly, they present estimates for a range

of discount rates between 0% and 15%.

       To map the demand response estimates to the price-metric measure of bias,                    Î³,   using the Allcott

and Wozny (2014) procedure, it is also necessary to assume that elasticities to salient costs are

uncorrelated with the magnitude of the bias, and that the costs do not inuence the bias.                             For

example, if consumers are more attentive to gasoline costs when gasoline is more expensive, the

ratio of the two demand responses would generate only a lower bound on the bias (Allcott et al.,

2014). Knowing only the slopes of the demand curves              xb (p, t)   and   xâb (p, t)   at the market price does

not permit imputation ofÎ³b ; generally, one must measure these demand curves more comprehensively,

much as in the next two strategies described below.

       An evidence-based approach to task 2 does not appear in the aforementioned papers, but would

require a demonstration that the dierence in demand sensitivities is in fact traceable to selective

attention or biased beliefs, rather than to some other contextual reaction such as exaggerated sticker

shock. The latter hypothesis could have diametrically opposed implications for the welfare-relevant

domain.

       Task 3 raises standard issues, but the scope of consumers' concerns is usually not controversial

  51
       And the procedure assumes that this discount rate is homogeneous across consumers. But to the extent that
uncertainty and liquidity constraints vary, the discount rate would as well.




                                                         44
in these applications.

       Rational consumer benchmarks. Bronnenberg et al. (2015) show that doctors and pharmacists

are less likely to choose branded drugs over generic alternatives that are cheaper and chemically

equivalent. This nding suggests that imperfect information distorts the purchases of other con-

sumers toward branded drugs. Here, the welfare-relevant domain presumably consists of settings

in which the typical consumer putatively receives and correctly processes the same information as

doctors and pharmacists.

       For task 1, one extrapolates demand from the observed choices of the unbiased consumers.

In practice, this extrapolation does not involve a simple comparison between the expert and non-

expert consumers, as they may dier with respect to demographic characteristics that are correlated

with tastes, or they may shop at dierent stores and thus see dierent presentations of the items.

Bronnenberg et al. (2015) adjust for dierences in the observable characteristics of consumers and the

stores they frequent. Of course, analysts cannot control for unobservable taste dierences between

professions. An advantage of strategies that reframe decisions, discussed below, is that they avoid

this potential confound by, in eect, experimentally inducing expertise.

       For task 2, Bronnenberg et al. (2015) support their assumption concerning the welfare-relevant

domain by showing that the doctors and pharmacists are indeed much more knowledgeable about

their purchases than others. Their strategy is to survey a subset of consumers in their retail dataset,

asking them to name the active ingredient in various national-brand headache remedies. They nd

that pharmacists, physicians, and surgeons answer 90 percent of these questions correctly, compared

with only 59 percent for the general population. In principle, expertise might go hand in hand with

other biases; for example, medical students are known to suer from excessive anxiety concerning

the conditions they study. However, Bronnenberg et al. (2015) also demonstrate that the knowledge

gap accounts for most of the dierences in the purchasing behavior of experts and non-experts.

       Task 3 raises standard issues, but the scope of consumers' concerns is usually not controversial

in these applications.

       In another application, Allcott et al. (2018b) compute the optimal tax on sugar-sweetened

beverages allowing for the possibility that consumers may suer from both misinformation and

imperfect self-control. They measure misinformation using the General Nutrition Knowledge que-

stionnaire, and they measure domain-specic self-control using a combination of assessments (by

respondents and their spouses) of the extent to which respondents consume sugary drinks more

than they should.        In eect, consumers who display high nutritional knowledge and claim (with

their spouse's agreement) that they do not overconsume sugary drinks provide the rational consu-

mer benchmark for this study.
                                      52   The empirical methods used in this study involve several other

notable features. First, the study addresses potential confounds associated with unobservable taste

dierences by exploiting survey questions that directly elicit the degree to which respondents like va-

  52
       Implicitly, this benchmark assumes that, if a consumer who struggles with self-control were able to commit to
decisions in advance, he would make the same choices as a consumer who does not struggle with self-control.       It
also assumes that the welfare-relevant domain consists of these advance commitments  in other words, it adopts the
long-run criterion.




                                                          45
rious sugary drinks and the importance they attach to health. Second, it explicitly accounts for the

possibility that the rational consumer benchmark yields noisy proxies for the decisions consumers

would make within the welfare-relevant domain.                  Third, it directly quanties the money-metric

bias    Î³   for each consumer by combining an estimate of overconsumption with an estimate of the

price-elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages. To arrive to the money-metric measure,

it utilizes a log-linearization of the demand function:            ln x â ln xâ + Î¶ c Î³b /p,   where   Î¶c   is the com-

pensated elasticity and       p   is the market price. As an example of this approach, imagine that bias

increases quantity demanded by 30%, and that the compensated demand elasticity is 1.5. Then the

impact of bias is the same as a 20% price reduction:             Î³b = p Â· 30%/1.5 = 0.2p.
       Reframed decisions. Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) examine purchases of more vs. less energy-

ecient lightbulbs by consumers who are potentially inattentive to, or misinformed about, the

(relative) energy costs of the lightbulbs. They conduct a within-subject experiment that consists of

three steps. First, they elicit consumers' initial willingness to pay for the lightbulbs. Second, they

treat a subset of consumers with an intervention that teaches consumers about the total costs of

the lightbulbs and helps them learn this information through a series of quiz questions. The control

group receives statistical information that does not shed light on the relative value of the dierent

lightbulbs. Third, they elicit willingness to pay for the lightbulbs a second time.

       The foundational assumption behind this strategy is that the welfare-relevant domain consists of

choices made after the informational treatment. Task 1 follows from a simple dierence-in-dierence

comparison of the pre- versus post-willingness to pay between the treated and untreated consumers.

The main challenge here lies in task 2: how does one demonstrate that that inconsistencies between

the original and reframed choices are attributable to characterization failures in the former, and not

in the latter? One potential confound for the reframing strategy is that the eects could be at least

partially attributable to browbeating, social pressure, and/or the induction of guilt. Allcott and

Taubinsky (2015) address this issue in three ways. First, they show that a measure of susceptibility

to social pressure is not correlated with the treatment eect. Second, they obtain similar results

based on cross-subject comparisons when the initial valuation round is eliminated.                          This result

addresses the hypothesis that subjects might feel pressure to change their decisions. Third, they

demonstrate that their results continue to hold when they add information to the main treatment

that arguably obscures the experimenter's intent by highlighting negative aspects of energy-ecient

bulbs (specically, the fact that they take longer to warm up and contain mercury).                         This third

strategy assumes that these negative features are important to consumers (otherwise their inferences

about the experimenter's objectives would be unaected).
                                                                      53

       Another potential concern regarding task 2 is that some consumers may ignore or discount the

informational treatment, in which case characterization failure will continue to infect some portion

of the putative welfare-relevant domain. Requiring consumers to correctly complete a quiz guards

  53
       Note that this treatment variation could also depress choice if these features were not already known. The fact
that this does not occur thus additionally implies that consumers are familiar with features such as warm-up time.
This conclusion is consistent with a theory of learning in which warm-up times are easily observable and memorable
experiences, whereas the impact of various appliances on the total energy bill are dicult to infer and recall.




                                                           46
against this possibility to some degree, but does not ensure that subjects believe what they learn.

Indeed, Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) nd that some treated consumers do not have correct beliefs

about the energy cost savings of ecient lightbulbs after the completion of the experiment. However,

focusing more narrowly on consumers who do express correct beliefs (in eect, a renement of the

welfare-relevant domain), they nd that the impact of the treatment on the willingness to pay is

30% larger. This nding provides the basis for alternative welfare estimates.

   Task 3 raises standard issues, but the scope of consumers' concerns is usually not controversial

in these applications.

   Advantages and disadvantages of the approaches :          An advantage of the last three empirical

approaches we have discussed is that they do not require one to take a stand on a precise model

of cognition. For example, when studying analogous demand responses, one does not need to know

whether the dierences between the responses of the two groups are attributable to inattention,

incorrect beliefs, or present focus, provided one can justify the assumption that the responses ought

to be identical. Similar comments apply to strategies involving rational consumer benchmarks and

reframed choices.

   The aforementioned approaches are, however, neither assumption-free nor psychology-free, as

our critiques of particular applications highlight. Allcott and Taubinsky (2015), for example, take

the stand that the relevant psychological mechanism involves inattention or incorrect beliefs. They

note that their reframing intervention would not necessarily eliminate biases that might arise in a

Koszegi and Szeidl (2013) model of focusing.

   An additional advantage of the last two empirical approaches discussed above is that they are

more direct. For example, even if the researcher has a very specic model and normative criterion

in mind, such as quasi-hyperbolic discounting coupled with the long-run criterion, they permit

direct recovery of the key empirical objects,   xb (p, t)   and   xâb (p, t);   there is no need to infer those

objects from a structural model based on estimated parameters.                  Either by analyzing consumers

who demonstrably do not suer from self-control problems (the fourth approach), or by asking

consumers to make decisions with no immediate consequences (the fth approach), the analyst can

elicit the welfare-relevant demand curve directly. A comparison between the welfare-relevant and

naturally occurring demand curves reveals the policy-relevant statistic           Î³b , without the separate need
to measure the present-focus parameter for the relevant consumption dimension, such as the the

marginal health costs.   See, e.g., the Allcott et al. (2018b) application of the rational consumer

benchmark method to the case of over-consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, discussed above.

   Of course, direct measurement of the welfare-relevant demand function is not always possible, in

which case stronger structural assumptions are needed to identify           xâb (p, t)   from naturally occurring

choices. When it is clear that a direct approach is infeasible, structural methods can be fruitful,

provided the analyst clearly spells out and justies the necessary assumptions. However, one can

needlessly sacrice robustness and generality by jumping directly to tightly parametrized psycholo-

gical models, rather than focusing on recovering the key empirical objects of interest,              xb (p, t)   and

xâb (p, t), through the method that requires the least restrictive assumptions.


                                                  47
3.3 Distributional concerns
Section 3.2 focused exclusively on a behavioral Pigouvian principle, which holds that the object

of taxes and subsidies is to correct internalities, and thereby bring actual demand in line with

optimal demand. In practice, taxes and subsidies also redistribute resources.

   Concerns about redistribution include the common complaint that sin taxes are regressive. The

poor consume disproportionate quantities of cigarettes and sugary drinks (see Gruber and KÂ®szegi

(2004), Goldin and Homono (2013), and Lockwood and Taubinsky, 2017; Allcott et al., 2018b),

while the rich benet disproportionately from subsidies for energy eciency (see Allcott et al.,

2015, Davis and Borenstein, 2016, Davis and Knittel, 2016). These regressive patterns have fostered

forceful opposition to sin taxes and virtue subsidies on the grounds of equity and fairness.

   In settings with uncertainty, redistribution can either occur ex ante across individuals, or ex post

across realizations for the same individual. The mathematics of these two settings are essentially

identical, except that in the second case the social welfare function corresponds to the individual's

ex ante preferences over outcomes in the various states of nature.

   We now generalize the basic ideas of Section 3.2 to incorporate concerns about redistribution.

Our setting is a stylized version of the Diamond (1975) generalization of the Ramsey model, which

allows for heterogeneous consumers varying in their marginal utility of wealth.



3.3.1     Basic theory

Here we consider the same model as in Section 3.2, except we assume that                             VÎ¸ = G(y + vÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t))),
where   G is a concave and dierentiable function.             Notice that the introduction of              G does not change
the rst-order condition that characterizes the demand function,                     xÎ¸ .   Let   gÎ¸ (t) = G0 (zÎ¸ â (p + t)xÎ¸ (p, t) + vÎ¸ (xÎ¸ (p, t)
This term denotes the marginal utility of wealth for a type                    Î¸     consumer, normalized by the value
                            dW
                                         Âµ(Î¸)G0 (zÌ

E[gÎ¸ (t)] = 1.
   A small increase in the commodity tax rate,                 dt,   has the following four eects:


   1. A direct eect on consumer welfare,          âÂµ(s)xs (p, t)gs (t)dt â Âµ(b)xb (p, t)gb (t)dt

   2. A direct eect on public funds,        D(p, t)dt

   3. An indirect eect on public funds,          tDt (p, t)dt
                                                                      d
   4. An indirect eect on consumer welfare,               âÂµ(b)gb Î³b dt xb (p, t)dt,       where     Î³b = p + t â vb0 (xb (p, t)),
        as before.


Putting these eects together, we nd that




                                                                                                            d â

                                                                                                            dt b
                      = (t â Î³Ìgb (t))Dt (p, t) dt â Cov[xÎ¸ (p, t), gÎ¸ (t)] dt                                                 (4)

                             corrective benets                 regressivity costs

                                                              48
Because     W 0 (t) = 0 at the optimum, equation (4) immediately yields a simple formula for the optimal
commodity tax:


                                                               Cov[xÎ¸ (p, t), gÎ¸ (t)]
                                             tâ = Î³Ìgb (t) +                                                          (5)
                                                                   Dt (p, t)
       Formulas (4) and (5) lead to a few insights.               First, it is crucial to account for the manner in

which the propensity to consume               x   covaries with marginal utility from income. When low-income

consumers are more likely to purchase the taxed good, the tax is regressive, and hence the optimal

rate is lower. Conversely, when high-income consumers are more likely to purchase the taxed good,

the tax is progressive, and hence the optimal rate is higher.

       The second and more subtle insight is that the corrective benets of the commodity tax no longer

simply equal    Î³Ì ,   the money metric measure of the average bias of marginal consumers. To illustrate,

suppose everyone purchases the same amount of the good                        x,   but the behavioral consumers have

lower income, so        gb (t) > gs (t).   Then the optimal tax is higher than the pure Pigouvian benchmark,

Î³Ì .   The intuition is as follows (see Lockwood and Taubinsky, 2017):                        When consumption is the

same for both types, the direct eects on consumer welfare and public funds cancel out. The two

remaining eects are the same as in the model with no distributional concerns, except that the

indirect eect on consumer welfare is multiplied by the term                    gb .    This change reects the fact that

a planner with redistributive motives is willing to pay more, for example, to eliminate a $1 mistake

made by the poor than by the rich.

       More broadly, if we view the marginal welfare weights               gÎ¸ (t) as reecting the policymaker's redis-
tributive preferences, the formulas show that, as a general matter, one cannot translate empirical

measurements of bias into optimal policy prescriptions without taking those preferences into ac-

count. The only exception arises in the case where                   gÎ¸ (t) â¡ 1,   which is sensible only if we assume

quasilinear utility.

       Third, the relative importance of corrective versus redistributive motives in shaping the optimal

commodity tax depends on how price-responsive consumers are.                             When they are not very price-

responsive (|Dt (p, t)| is small), redistributive motives dominate corrective motives. When consumers

are very price responsive (|Dt (p, t)| is large), corrective motives dominate redistributive motives. To

obtain intuition for why consumers' response to the tax is crucial, imagine the extreme case in which

consumers are completely inelastic. In this case, the regressive tax simply shifts funds from low-

income consumers to high-income consumers, without correcting their behavior.



3.3.2      Applications and related literature

Bernheim and Rangel (2004) consider a dynamic model of addiction in which consumers randomly

encounter environmental cues that trigger compulsive tendencies to consume the addictive good.

They assume that consumption in the triggered state is completely inelastic to the tax. Although

the good is enjoyable, sustained consumption impairs health, thereby reducing both earnings and

baseline well-being.




                                                                49
   The authors restrict the welfare-relevant domain to the state-contingent choices consumers would

make in advance, prior to being cued. They argue that this restriction is justied because charac-

terization failure infects choices made in the presence of substance-related environmental cues, a

proposition that nds support in the literature on the neurobiology of addiction (see Section 2.2.5).

   A central conclusion of the Bernheim and Rangel (2004) analysis is that the optimal tax on

addictive goods is negative; in other words, they should be subsidized.              Our simple optimal tax

formula, equation 5, anticipates this result. The inelastic response of behavioral consumers implies

Î³Ì = 0,   which means the tax oers no corrective benets. As a result, the covariance between the

marginal utility of income and the consumption of     x, Cov[xâÎ¸ (p, t), gÎ¸ (t)],   determines the sign of the

tax. If consumption reduces income, the covariance is positive. Because             Dt   is negative,the optimal

tax is negative. Although Bernheim and Rangel's dynamic model is more complicated, the simple

two-good model captures the essential economic forces.

   While Bernheim and Rangel (2004) focus on a case where distributional concerns generate a

sin subsidy, in other cases the optimal tax can still be large and positive even when it appears

to be regressive. This result will obtain when the term       Î³Ìgb (t)   is suciently large; that is, under

the assumption that behavioral consumers have lower incomes, and (contrary to the Bernheim-

Rangel premise) that they respond elastically to the tax even when expressing their behavioral

biases.   These conditions may hold for at least some sin goods.           Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2004) use

the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to show that the aggregate demand for cigarettes among

low-income consumers responds elastically to cigarette taxes.            By assuming away the possibility,

featured in Bernheim and Rangel's analysis, that present-focus is a cue-triggered state, and that

its activation also suppresses demand elasticities, they show through numerical simulations that

cigarette taxes can make low-income consumers better o even without accounting for the benets

of the additional revenue, provided present bias is suciently severe. The intuition is most easily

understood for the case in which the magnitude of the price elasticity is greater than one. In this

case, a 1% increase in price decreases demand by more than 1%, thus consumers' total expenditures

on the sin good fall, and so they spend more money on the other goods.                    At the same time, if

consumers are suciently biased toward over-consuming the sin good, then exchanging some of the

sin good for even a little bit of another good makes them better o. Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2004) thus

argue that cigarette taxes may not be regressive according to a comprehensive welfare metric. We

emphasize, however, that their argument rests on the assumption that present focus is always active,

and consequently that the high demand elasticity they measure applies to biased decisions. While

Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2004) do not consider optimal tax implications, Farhi and Gabaix (2015) apply

their framework to a two-type Ramsey model that generalizes the insight about the importance of

the demand elasticity of low income consumers.

   Bernheim and Rangel (2004), Gruber and KÂ®szegi (2004), and Farhi and Gabaix (2015) all

study environments in which commodity taxes are the only means for redistribution. It is arguably

inappropriate, however, to set the tax rate for any given commodity based on distributive implica-

tions without considering the full range of redistributive instruments at the government's disposal.




                                                 50
Far from being an abstract or technical consideration, this issue surfaces in practical discussions

of sin taxes under the guise of revenue recycling  the idea that the government can use sin

tax revenues to fund progressive initiatives that benet low-income consumers. For example, some

cities in the U.S. earmarked the revenue from taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages for progressive

policy initiatives such as universal pre-K education.

     Allcott et al. (2018b) address these considerations by studying the simultaneous optimization of

commodity taxes and nonlinear income taxes. Their analysis builds on Saez's (2002) extension of

Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), in that they model an economy consisting of behavioral consumers with

heterogenous earning abilities and tastes who choose labor supply and a consumption bundle that

exhausts their after-tax income. The optimal policy depends on the relative importance of income

and preference heterogeneity in driving the consumption of sin goods. When all dierences in sin

good consumption stem from income eects, the planner addresses distributional considerations

entirely through the income tax, and commodity taxes depend only on their corrective benets.

When elasticities and biases are non-decreasing with income, the optimal tax is unambiguously

higher than the Pigouvian benchmark. However, when preference heterogeneity plays a larger role,

progressive income taxation osets the distributional eects of commodity taxation imperfectly,

creating labor supply distortions that outweigh the redistributive benets. In that case, the optimal

commodity tax rates depend on distributional eects.



3.4 Eciency costs of misperceived commodity taxes
3.4.1    Basic theory

We now turn our attention to settings in which consumers misperceive taxes. Unless consumers also

suer from some other bias, they correctly understand the prices they pay when taxes are absent.

Consequently, there is no corrective role for commodity taxation. Here, our focus is on measuring

the eciency costs of commodity taxes in settings where the government raises revenue for other

purposes, and does not necessarily optimize the use of tax instruments. With quasilinear utility,

the eciency cost of a tax is identical to its impact on the consumer welfare function we dened in

Section 3.2.

     We focus here on the implications of imperfectly salient commodity taxation: consumers react

to the tax   t   as if it is    Ït,   where   Ï   is a decision weight that could potentially depend on the tax

but varies smoothly with it. This modeling strategy encompasses a number of related psychological

biases such as exogenous inattention to the tax, so that consumers always react to the tax as if

it is a constant fraction         Ï   of its size (DellaVigna, 2009; Gabaix and Laibson, 2006); endogenous

inattention to the tax, or boundedly rational processing more broadly (Chetty et al., 2007; Gabaix,

2014); certain types of rounding heuristics; or simply forgetting (in which case                    Ï = 0).
     For simplicity, assume throughout this discussion that               Vb = Vs ;   that is, the welfare function is

the same for behavioral and rational consumers. We continue to assume quasilinearity.

     The behavioral consumer's rst-order condition is              vb0 (xb (p, t)) = p + Ïb t.   Dening the bias term

Î³b   as before, we have        Î³b (p, t) := p + t â vb0 (xb (p, t)) = (1 â Ïb )t.   Equation (2) continues to apply.



                                                             51
However, in this special case,                xâb   depends only on the perceived tax-inclusive price, so we have

xb (p, t) =      xâb (p   + Ït).
       In settings where all consumers are behavioral, formula (2) implies:
                                                                                                 54




                                                W 0 (t) = (t â Î³b )Dt (p, t)
                                                         = (t â (1 â Ïb )t)Dt (p, t)
                                                         = Ïb tDt (p, t)                                                          (6)



Formula (6) appears in Chetty et al. (2009). Its key implication is that underreaction reduces e-

ciency costs through two separate channels: rst, it reduces                     Dt , the sensitivity of demand to the tax
rate; second, it reduces the eciency costs for any xed value of                     Dt (p, t) (through the multiplicative
term     Ïb ).   An economist who overlooks the consumer's misperception, but who nevertheless correctly

measures the sensitivity of demand to taxes, will capture the rst eect but not the second, and

as a result will overstate the welfare costs of the tax. The reason is that the consumer's marginal

utility of consumption is only                v 0 (x) = p + Ït   rather than    v 0 (x) = p + t.      Consequently, when the

tax induces the consumer to purchase                    Dt   fewer units, utility declines by         (p + Ït)Dt (p, t),     and net

social surplus falls by            [(p + Ït) â p] Dt (p, t),   where the term     âpDt (p, t)    corresponds to the decrease

in production costs that results when                  Dt   fewer units are purchased.

       Suppose next that the economy also includes some rational consumers, with                                   Ïs = 1.       The

eciency cost formula becomes:


                                                               d
                          W 0 (t) = tDt (p, t) â Âµ(b)(1 â Ïb )t   xb (p, t)
                                                              dt

                                   = Âµ(s)t xs (p, t) + Âµ(b)t xb (p, t) â Âµ(b)(1 â Ïb )t xb (p, t)

                                             d                     d
                                   = Âµ(s)Ïs t xs (p, t) + Âµ(b)Ïb t xb (p, t)
                                             dt                  dt        
                                                                  d
                                   = tE[ÏÎ¸ ]tD(p, t) + tCov ÏÎ¸ , xÎ¸ (p, t)                                                        (7)
                                                                  dt

Equation (7) shows that the marginal eciency costs depend not only on the average                                      Ï,   but also

on how      Ï    covaries with the demand elasticity. Models of tax salience build in a negative covariance

between bias and elasticities: a higher value of                    ÏÎ¸   (less bias) implies a larger demand response,
d                                        d                               d
dt xÎ¸ (p, t). Suppose in particular that dp xs (p, t)              â     dp xb (p, t) at the price-tax pair       (p, t),    and that
                                                                                                     d
Ïb   does not depend on              t   (assumptions that are likely valid for low tax rates). Then
                                                                                                     dt xÎ¸ (p, t)                  =
   d
ÏÎ¸ dp xÎ¸ (p, t)     â ÏÎ¸ Dp (p, t),      in which case equation (7) becomes



                                           W 0 (t) â tE[ÏÎ¸ ]tD(p, t) + tV ar[ÏÎ¸ ]Dp (p, t).                                       (8)

  54
       Notice that the rst-order condition for the optimal tax rate,         W 0 (t) = 0,   is satised for   t = 0.   This property
reects the fact that our model includes a lump-sum tax.                 Exclusive reliance on the lump-sum tax achieves the
rst-best because then the consumer perceives all prices correctly.




                                                                  52
       Equation (8) is a special case of the formulas derived in Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming).

It shows that the marginal eciency cost of taxation depends not only on the average value of                            Ï , but
also on the variance: the higher the variance, the higher the eciency costs. The broad principle

driving this result is that an increase in the tax has a higher impact on welfare when the consumers

who are most elastic to the tax are the most biased ones. See, e.g., equation (2) and our discussion

of the average marginal bias below it. This principle is true for any kind of bias, and since bias

here is given by        Î³b (p, t) = (1 â Ïb )t,   a positive covariance between            Ïb    and the elasticity implies a

negative relationship between the size of the bias and the                     elasticity.
                                                                                           55

       Figure 2 provides a graphical illustration of eciency costs when consumers underestimate taxes

to the same degree (the homogeneous case), and separately when consumers underestimate taxes to

diering degrees (the heterogeneous case). Beginning with the homogeneous case, the demand curve

D(p0 , t)    corresponds to how observed demand varies with the not-fully-salient tax.                             The demand

curve     D(p0 + t, 0)     corresponds to how demand would vary with a fully salient tax (for example,

one that is included in posted prices). The equilibrium quantity sold in the market is such that the

marginal utility from the product is              p0 + Ït.     Thus, the deadweight loss from taxation corresponds

to the smaller triangle with height            Ït,   rather than to the larger triangle under the demand curve

D(p0 , t)   with height      t.   Turning to the heterogeneous case, we can reinterpret                D(p0 , t)   as capturing

the demand of the consumer with the mean salience parameter,                         E(Ï).      As shown in the gure, there

are additional eciency costs beyond those the average consumer incurs. Again, this result follows

because consumers with the highest values of                   Ï   have the most elastic responses to the tax, but also

attach the greatest value to the good on the margin.

       In light of the preceding analysis, both the mean and variance of misperceptions should aect

the magnitude of optimal commodity taxes within a Ramsey framework. Farhi and Gabaix (2015)

provide general optimal tax formulas showing that optimal taxes are indeed decreasing in                             E[ÏÎ¸ ] and
increasing in       V ar[ÏÎ¸ ].



3.4.2       Empirical measurement and implementation56

Chetty et al. (2009) provide the rst empirical estimates of underreaction to sales taxes, using two

empirical strategies. The rst involves a eld experiment at a grocery store. The main nding is

that posting new tags that highlight the tax and display tax-inclusive prices reduces demand, and

that the magnitude of the eect is the same as that of a price increase equal to 65% of the tax. The

authors infer that the average value of              Ï   is   0.35.     This experiment is perhaps the rst example of

the empirical strategy that we previously labeled reframing decisions.

  55
       To build intuition for this principle, recall that the marginal eciency cost of taxation for a single consumer
with misperception parameter Ï is ÏtDt . For simplicity, assume for the moment that D(p, t) = a â b(p + Ït). Then
ÏtDt = âbÏ 2 t. Notice in particular that this expression is negative and concave in Ï . As a result, an increase in the
variance of   Ï   necessarily increases the population average of the marginal eciency cost of taxation (as a consequence
of Jensen's inequality).
  56
       See also Gabaix (forthcoming) in this handbook for a discussion of measuring inattention in a variety of domains
including sales taxes.

   The second empirical strategy employs naturally occurring data to measure demand responses

to changes in excise taxes and sales taxes on alcohol using the method of dierences-in-dierences.

Excise taxes are included in posted prices, while sales taxes are not. Based on the small observed

responses to changes in sales taxes but large responses to changes in excise taxes, the authors infer

that the average value of         Ï   is 0.06. This empirical strategy is an example of the empirical strategy

we labeled analogous demand responses.

   The tendency for people to underreact in response to taxes that are not included in posted prices

has been replicated in laboratory experiments by Feldman and Rue (2015) and Feldman et al.

(2015). Although these experiments were not designed to permit estimation of                     Ï,   they nevertheless

corroborate the spirit of the Chetty et al. (2009) results in settings with cleaner identication of the

behavioral eects. Finkelstein (2009) also provides related evidence that paying a toll electronically

is less salient than paying it personally, which leads to an increase in tolls once electronic tolling is

operationalized.

   The Chetty et al. (2009) approach to welfare analysis is an application of the Bernheim-Rangel

framework. Changing the presentation of information concerning taxes does not alter opportunities;

hence it is an aspect of framing. A discrepancy between the quantities purchased in the two frames

raises the possibility that consumers err when making decisions in either or both of them. Arguably,

posting tax-inclusive prices makes the opportunities transparent, while computing them at the

register does not. Consequently, characterization failure is most likely when posted prices are not

tax-inclusive. The authors conduct welfare analysis based on that premise.

   However, there are plausible reasons for thinking
                                                   1 this restriction of the welfare-relevant domain
may not be the right one. The rst empirical strategy in Chetty et al (2009) may lead consumers

to become especially tax averse, for example because the new tags cause them to focus on their

resentment of taxes. Alternatively, the tags may simply confuse consumers, who might interpret the



                                                           54
after-tax prices as before-tax prices, and thus erroneously think the products are more expensive

than they actually are.

     One way to justify the paper's implicit restriction on the welfare-relevant domain would be

to show that people are not aware of unposted taxes through surveys.                           But in fact, the authors

demonstrate precisely the opposite using a survey administered to shoppers exiting the store.

     The second empirical strategy in Chetty et al.               (2009) addresses some of the confounds that

could follow from the use of unusual tags in their experiment. Because naturally occurring posted

prices include excise taxes, there is no problem with conspicuous highlighting. Consequently, this

second strategy avoids potential experimental demand eects, as well as the consumer confusion

that could arise in the experiment.

     Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming) conduct an experiment that directly varies both prices

and taxes. Because their experimental design does not rely on tags that draw attention to the tax-

inclusive vs. the tax-exclusive price, their estimates are not subject to framing eects that could

have generated confounds in the Chetty et al. (2009) experiment.

     A more important limitation of the Chetty et al. (2009) approach is that it does not shed light

on individual dierences in         Ï.   Nor is it suitable for measuring how           Ï   changes with the size of the

tax. Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming) estimate a lower bound for the variance of                             Ï   using a

within-subject experimental design. They replicate the qualitative ndings of Chetty et al. (2009)

concerning underreaction to taxes. Their estimates place the average value of                     Ï   at roughly   0.25 with
a tight condence interval. At the same time, they estimate a large lower bound for the variance of

Ï.   Using a generalization of formula (8) along with the estimated mean and variance of                      Ï , they nd
that the representative-agent formula used in Chetty et al. (2009) underestimates the deadweight

loss of taxation by a factor of three or more.

     Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (forthcoming) also nd that people underreact less when tax rates

are higher.     This nding is important because the distortionary eects of tax increases can be

substantially greater if high tax rates stimulate attention, than if attention is exogenous. The intui-

tion is straightforward: behavioral responses tend to be larger with endogenous attention because

Ï(t0 ) > Ï(t)   for   t0 > t   implies



                        Ï(t0 )t0 â Ï(t)t =         Ï(t)ât             + (Ï(t0 ) â Ï(t))t0 > Ï(t)4t
                                                   | {z }               |       {z     }
                                             Eect given constant Ï        Eect on Ï

. In words, when attention is endogenous, a higher tax increases perceived (after-tax) prices not

only by mechanically making actual prices higher, but also by increasing attention to the tax.



3.5 Non-nancial policy instruments
While we have focused primarily on corrective tax policy, academics and policy makers have also

proposed using other non-standard policy instruments to achieve changes in behavior. These instru-

ments include interventions that make information salient, such as visibly posting caloric content

for foods (e.g., Bollinger et al., 2011) or requiring graphic cigarette warning labels (e.g., Chaloupka



                                                            55
et al., 2014); disseminating information on social norms (e.g,. Allcott, 2011b; Allcott and Rogers,

2014; Ayres et al., 2013; Costa and Kahn, 2013); increasing the social visibility of consumers' be-

havior (e.g., Butera et al., 2018); oering commitment opportunities (e.g., Beshears et al., 2005);

encouraging people to form concrete actions plans (i.e., implementation intentions; see, e.g., Milk-

man et al., 2011 or Carrera et al., 2018); and simply providing reminders (e.g., Karlan et al., 2016a).

We call these policy instruments non-standard to distinguish them from more standard non-price

instruments such as quantity regulation (e.g., Weitzman, 1974) and mandatory information disclo-

sure (Grossman and Hart, 1980; Grossman, 1981; Milgrom, 1981).
                                                                                 57   For an extensive catalog of

such policies, see OECD (2017).



3.5.1       What is a nudge?

Summarizing the perspectives articulated in Thaler and Sunstein (2003); Sunstein and Thaler (2003)

and Thaler and Sunstein (2008), Sunstein (2014) refers to all such strategies as nudges, which he

denes as liberty-preserving approaches that steer people in particular directions, but that also

allow them to go their own way. In our view, it is inappropriate to group all these policies together

under the nudge rubric. Implicit in the rationale for libertarian paternalism is the notion that

nudges do not change opportunity sets. Yet most of the examples of non-price interventions cited

above do change opportunities in meaningful ways. For example, providing people with information

about social norms, or revealing their behavior to others, fundamentally changes the social and

emotional costs and benets of taking various actions; thus, it changes the nature of available

consumption bundles. Similar remarks apply to interventions that manipulate the salience of certain

types of information, such as graphic imagery on cigarette packs. One should not call an intervention

a nudge, which falsely suggests a minimal level of pressure, simply because the consequences are

non-nancial. On the contrary, social and/or emotional manipulation can be highly coercive. While

it is worth knowing that certain types of non-price interventions can achieve desired changes in

behavior at lower nancial costs than traditional policies (e.g., Benartzi et al., 2017), one should

not leap to the conclusion that these interventions are welfare improving without explicitly factoring

in non-nancial eects on well-being.

       For the remainder of this section, we dene a nudge more precisely as a non-price intervention

that achieves a change in behavior by modifying the decision problem in a way that would not

alter a consumer's perception of the opportunity set absent some error in reasoning.                        In other

words, nudges exploit framing eects, dened as in Section 2.2.2: they may leave the consumer's

perception of the opportunity set intact but change a contextually constructed judgment, or they

may change the perceived opportunity set due to a cognitive error without actually altering the

consumer's objective information. Whether we classify any given intervention as a nudge therefore

depends on our assumptions about the scope of consumers' concerns, which may be controversial.

As an example, if consumers' concerns are limited to conventional goods and services, then posting

  57
       We contrast mandatory disclosure of otherwise non-available information with information saliency interventions
that make otherwise available information more salient or easier to process.




                                                           56
tax-inclusive prices (in a setting where information on tax rates is generally available) is a nudge.

However, it is not a nudge if calculating tax-inclusive prices entails non-trivial cognitive costs, or if

salient reminders of tax rates cause aversive emotional reactions.



3.5.2       Justications for non-price interventions

The most compelling case for non-price interventions involves a perfect nudge that debiases be-

havioral consumers by modifying the prevailing decision frame so that the task lies within the

welfare-relevant domain rather than outside it. Standard consumers are unresponsive to the deci-

sion frame, and are therefore unaected. In contrast, taxation is a blunt instrument that generally

changes the actions of all consumers, benetting some while hurting others. Thus, in some settings

with heterogeneous agents, nudges can be more ecient than taxes because their eects are more

appropriately targeted.
                              58

       Despite this potential advantage, the case for non-price interventions is more nuanced than

it might at rst seem.         First, as we have already noted, the purported cheapness of these non-

price interventions (i.e., the contention that they involve relatively low costs to governments and

consumers), can be a misconception if they do change opportunity sets. While a commodity tax

raises revenue, a non-price intervention does not. As an example, graphic images on cigarettes packs

generate negative emotions that resemble a tax from the consumer's perspective, but they raise no

revenue (Loewenstein and O'Donoghue, 2006; Glaeser, 2006). Of course, these considerations can

also favor non-price interventions: a promotional campaign that makes consumers feel good about

buying green products (rather than guilty about buying energy-inecient ones) can potentially

replicate the utility boost obtained through a subsidy without depleting public funds.

       A second problem with non-price interventions, including nudges (or near-nudges), is that their

impact on behavior may be either limited or temporary.
                                                                        59    Even the typical information saliency

intervention, which arguably entails more than a mere nudge, has only modest eects on beha-

vior. Some degree of reliance on conventional policy instruments such as taxes may therefore be

unavoidable.

       A third issue arises in settings where suboptimal choices are actually desirable because they

oset other distortions. Imagine, for example, that the government must raise revenue through a

distortionary tax. Welfare will be higher if consumers ignore the tax. Nudging them to make better

decisions by posting tax-inclusive prices increases distortions and reduces eciency.

       The preceding discussion suggests that the framework of libertarian paternalism is not parti-

cularly useful for rigorously evaluating the costs and benets of non-price interventions, especially

  58
       This advantage may not be present, however, if a nudge aects dierent subsets of biased consumers dierently.
For example, suppose all consumers display the same quantitative bias,       Î³ , with respect to the consumption of cigarettes
in the naturally occurring frame. Then a tax    t=Î³   achieves an ecient allocation, as shown in Section 3.2. In contrast,
despite the homogeneity of    Î³,   smokers' responses to nudges (such as warning labels) may be heterogeneous. Nudging
some consumers to respond eciently may cause others to underreact, and still others to overreact. In that case,
nudges are less ecient than the optimal tax.
  59
       See, e.g., Long et al. (2015) for a review of calorie labeling interventions, or Conn et al. (2016) for medication
adherence interventions.




                                                             57
when it is applied to policies that are not true nudges (as dened above).       Instead, the task of

policy evaluation calls for economic analyses that embrace a defensible welfare criterion and use

it to evaluate costs and benets accounting for behavioral responses, direct eects on utility, and

interactions with other policy instruments such as taxes (e.g., through scal externalities).

   In this spirit, Farhi and Gabaix (2015) provide a theoretical analysis of optimal nudges that

addresses a key question: whether it is better to nudge or to tax. They show that in a setting with

redistributive motives, as in Section 3.3, a nudge tends to be more (resp. less) ecient than a tax

if consumption patterns render the latter regressive (resp. progressive).



3.5.3   Empirical measurement of welfare eects for non-nancial interventions

On the empirical side, Allcott and Kessler (forthcoming) attempt to analyze the welfare eect of a

particular type of non-price intervention on consumers' utility. The intervention provides consumers

with social comparisons about how well they conserve energy relative to their peers. They estimate

welfare eects by eliciting each consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for receiving information about

social comparisons in the future. They nd signicant heterogeneity in elicited WTP, with the range

encompassing both positive and negative values. The average is moderately positive.

   A crucial assumption of the Allcott-Kessler analysis is rational expectations: for WTP to be a

valid money-metric measure of welfare, consumers have to rationally anticipate how much energy

they will use in the future. If consumers are overcondent about their ability to conserve in the

future, or simply underestimate the energy consumption of their appliances, then the Allcott-Kessler

method would yield upwardly-biased estimates of welfare, assuming consumers prefer to receive

reports that show them doing well rather than poorly.

   The conceptual validity of the Allcott-Kessler welfare analysis depends on the underlying be-

havioral mechanism.    A negative willingness to pay (WTP) for information is inconsistent with

standard theories of decision making under uncertainty. The prevalence of negative WTPs there-

fore calls for a behavioral theory that can explain why the possession of information concerning

social comparisons is sometimes unpleasant.     An obvious possibility is that the consumer enjoys

hearing that she uses less energy than others and dislikes hearing that she uses more than others.

If these feelings are independent of the circumstances that determined her consumption, then the

Allcott-Kessler method is valid.   However, others plausible possibilities merit consideration.   For

example, a consumer who discovers that she uses more (less) energy than others may be more likely

to suer guilt (feel virtuous) if she knows she had the option to conserve (squander). For similar

reasons, a consumer who does not receive the usage comparison report may be more likely to feel

guilty if she declined the opportunity than if the report were never available. Problems arise in such

cases because the consumer's concerns encompass conditions of choice, which potentially implicates

the Non-comparability Problem (see Section 2.2.2). For example, a consumer with a positive WTP

for the report may feel a strong social obligation to seek it out and act on it when the opportu-

nity arises, but may nevertheless abhor having that opportunity and feeling that obligation, and

may fervently wish for Congress to enact legislation banning its dissemination (provided she avoids




                                                 58
responsibility by playing no role in policymaking). As long as the consumer cares only about the

conditions of energy choice and not the conditions of the metachoice, it is possible to rationalize

a negative WTP without rendering welfare unrecoverable, but this assumption is debatable and

unproven.

       In a similar vein to Allcott and Kessler (forthcoming), Butera et al. (2018) develop a method for

evaluating the welfare eects of a social recognition intervention, but one that avoids relying on the

rational expectations assumption and arguably allows for a more robust welfare interpretation of

WTP. They conduct a eld experiment with the YMCA in which consenting individuals are enrolled

in a Grow and Thrive Program. During the program, a donor contributes $2 to the participants'

local YMCA every time they attend it over a month-long period. Additionally, some individuals are

assigned to a social recognition group in which YMCA attendance is revealed to all other group

members at the end of the Grow and Thrive month.                 The assignment to the social recognition

group is exogenous with 90% probability.            With 10% probability the assignment is based on the

individuals' choices. In particular, Butera et al. (2018) elicit from each individual the WTP to be

in the social recognition group for each possible realization of his or her monthly attendance. This

WTP elicitation is incentive compatible because with 10% chance, a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak

(BDM) mechanism determines whether or not the individual's behavior is made public at the end

of the Grow and Thrive month.

       Because Butera et al. (2018) elicit the WTP to be in the social recognition group for every

possible attendance pattern, they are able to measure welfare eects using only ex-post choices,

rather than ex-ante expectations of behavior. This approach avoids the need for a rational expec-

tations assumption. Moreover, by adopting a social signaling interpretation, which assumes that

consumers' concerns extend to social image rather than to conditions of choice, they avoid the con-

ceptual problems that potentially arise in Allcott and Kessler. In principle, an observer could draw

a negative inference about individuals who are not part of the social recognition group because some

of them are assigned based on realized WTPs, which are positively related to YMCA attendance.

This consideration could generate a signaling incentive to express a higher WTP for joining the

social recognition group. However, the experiment minimizes this eect by assigning groups based

on WTPs with only 10% probability.

       Consistent with previous work, Butera et al. (2018) nd that social recognition is a signicant

motivator of behavior. And consistent with standard social signaling models, they nd that low-

attendance individuals are worse o in the social recognition treatment, while high-attendance

individuals benet signicantly from it. They then study welfare in the aggregate, and show that

because the social recognition utility function is modestly convex, social signaling is a modestly

positive-sum game, and thus is more welfare-enhancing than nancial incentives that achieve the

same (distribution of ) changes in behavior.
                                                   60

       Other empirical welfare analyses of non-nancial interventions examine the eects of changes in

  60
       This holds under the assumption of quasilinear utility, which they propose as a reasonable approximation for
small to modest nancial incentives.

default options, e.g., Bernheim et al. (2015a). We mention that work in Section 4.5.

   As the literature progresses, careful empirical studies of non-price interventions that are groun-

ded in basic economic principles will be crucial for assessing their role as potentially useful tools

in the optimal policy mix. Close attention to the conditions needed to draw empirical conclusions

about the welfare eects of these policies is essential (see, e.g., Benkert and Netzer, forthcoming).



3.6 Commodity taxation with social preferences
An important branch of Behavioral Economics concerns the existence and eects of social preferen-

ces. Here we briey mention some implications for tax policy.



3.6.1   The taxation of giving

While other-regarding concerns do not generally entail failures of rationality, they can give rise to

externalities. Consequently, they can also justify the use of corrective taxation. Perhaps the most

obvious applications involve the tax treatment of giving, either to charities or to family members.

The US tax system currently subsidizes charitable contributions because they are, to a degree,

deductible for the purpose of calculating income taxes. In contrast, interpersonal transfers in the

form of gifts and estates are subject to taxation.

   An important property of giving is that it creates an externality that benets the recipient, as

well as those who care about the recipient. Because the giver does not account for these benets,

giving tends to be suboptimal. Kaplow (1995) cites this mechanism as providing the foundations

for a general argument in favor of subsidizing charitable contributions and other giving.      Others

examine the form of the optimal subsidy. For example, Hochman and Rodgers (1977) argue that

tax credits for charitable contributions are more ecient than charitable subsidies. More recent work

explores the optimal treatment of contributions to privately provided public goods in the context

of income taxation (Saez, 2004; Diamond, 2006). There is also a parallel literature on the optimal

tax treatment of gifts and bequests, which inherently implicates concerns about distribution (e.g.,

Piket and Saez, 2013).

   A notable theme emerging from this literature is that optimal policy depends on the particular

motives that account for giving (Diamond (2006)).       Leading alternatives include pure altruism,

warm glow giving, and signaling. As an extreme illustration, Bernheim (1986) and Bernheim and

Bagwell (1988) show that, if all giving is purely altruistic and everyone is connected either directly

or indirectly through voluntary transfers, then ostensibly distortionary taxes have no eects on

resource allocation. However, the authors intend that observation as a critique of models positing

pure altruism, rather than as descriptive of actual tax policy. Signaling motives for giving introduce

rather dierent types of externalities. Because signals are often socially excessive, taxing them can

be ecient.




                                                 60
3.6.2       Luxury taxes

Social motives also play a signicant role in the analysis of commodity taxes on luxury goods,

the purchase of which may involve status-seeking.                   Ireland (1994) formulates a signaling theory

of conspicuous consumption in which people overconsume certain goods to signal their wealth,

and demonstrates that a tax on those goods can be welfare-improving. This result follows from the

general property of signaling models noted at the end of the previous section. For a related analysis,

see Corneo and Jeanne (1997).

       Bagwell and Bernheim (1996) examine the eects of luxury taxes in a setting that generates

Veblen eects, which are said to exist when consumers prefer to pay a higher price for the same

conspicuous good in order to render it more exclusive.                    They identify conditions under which

people prefer to signal their wealth by paying too much rather than by consuming too much.

In those settings, luxury brands earn strictly positive prots under conditions that would, with

standard formulations of preferences, yield marginal-cost pricing. As a result, commodity taxes on

luxury goods are equivalent to non-distortionary taxes on pure prots.

       The following simple model illustrates the logic of the Bagwell-Bernheim conclusions concerning

luxury taxation. Suppose each consumer chooses either one unit of a luxury good or none. Firms

produce the good at cost         c per unit.   All versions are functionally identical, but they are nevertheless

distinguishable (i.e., they are conspicuously branded). The prices of all brands are publicly observa-

ble and sellers cannot grant secret price concessions to individual customers. Preferences are given

by   u(x) + v(R â px) + RÌ,        where   x â {0, 1}     denotes consumption of the luxury good,         R   is wealth

(which takes on one of two values,             RL   and   RH ), R â px      is consumption of the non-conspicuous

numeraire good, and        RÌ is perceived wealth.     We assume that the function       v   is increasing and strictly

concave. According to this formulation, greater perceived wealth entails greater status, which the

consumer values.

       For the moment, imagine that versions (brands) of the good are available at every price                         p
(weakly) exceeding        c.   Low-wealth consumers would then buy the cheapest version (p                = c).   High-

wealth consumers would choose to buy the good at a price               pH > c, chosen to satisfy the non-imitation
constraint:     v(RL â pH ) + RH = v(RL â c) + RL .61             Thus, Veblen eects emerge: wealthy consumers

prefer to pay a price above costs for the conspicuous good.
                                                                       62   In a competitive market with free entry

and Bertrand pricing (where consumers resolve indierence in favor of incumbent rms), entrants

will provide budget brands at          p = c,   while incumbent rms will provide elite branded products

at   p = pH .
       Now suppose the government imposes a luxury tax  in other words, an excise tax                        t   on the

amount paid for the good above some threshold, where the threshold exceeds cost.                          High-wealth

  61
       Consistent with the application of various standard equilibrium renements, this condition characterizes the most
ecient signaling equilibrium.
  62
       In this simple setting, consumers do not have the option to signal with quantity rather than with price. Bagwell
and Bernheim (1996) provide conditions under which their results generalize to settings in which consumers can
choose any quantity    x > 0.   They show that Veblen eects emerge when indierence curves exhibit double crossing
rather than single crossing, and they argue that double crossing arises naturally in settings with liquidity constraints.




                                                             61
consumers continue to prefer an all-in price of             pH ;   it is of no consequence to them whether they pay

the markup to a rm or to the government. Therefore, competition among branded rms will drive

the before-tax price of elite brands down by precisely                  t.   The tax is therefore a non-distortionary

levy on pure prots. Bagwell and Bernheim (1996) observe that, consistent with this implication,

subsequent to the imposition of a substantial federal luxury tax on various conspicuous goods such

as high-end automobiles and yachts in 1990, several automakers including Rolls Royce, BMW, and

Jaguar advertised that they would reimburse customers for the full tax payment.




4         Policies Targeting Saving
4.1 Behavioral themes pertaining to saving
The literature on behavioral approaches to understanding household saving grew from concerns

about the empirical validity of the classical Life Cycle Hypothesis (LCH) due to Ando and Modig-

liani (1963). During the 1980s and 1990s, questions arose as to whether the LCH could adequately

account for basic facts about saving among U.S. households.                        Empirical investigations revealed

that most households accumulate relatively little nancial wealth (Diamond, 1977; Diamond and

Hausman, 1984), a nding that proved dicult to reconcile with the ostensible life-cycle objective

of sustaining pre-retirement living standards after retirement (Bernheim, 1993),
                                                                                                      63   as well as with

consumers' stated objectives and intentions (Bernheim, 1995; Laibson, 1998). Far from contriving

smooth consumption proles, households that accumulate little wealth often experience sharp de-

clines in consumption at retirement, particularly in cases where Social Security and employer-based

dened-benet pension plans provide low income replacement (Bernheim et al., 2001b).
                                                                                                               64

         Other work in this area called specic LCH assumptions into question. One important line of

criticism emphasized imperfections in self-control. Two approaches to modeling self-control emerged,

one emphasizing time inconsistency (Strotz, 1955-1956; Schelling, 1984; Laibson, 1997), which we

have already touched upon in Section 2.2.5, the other positing the existence of internal goods

(Thaler and Shefrin, 1981; Shefrin and Thaler, 1988; Gul and Pesendorfer, 2001; Fudenberg and

Levine, 2006). A second important line of criticism explored the limits of consumer sophistication,

documenting (i) deciencies in the knowledge and skills necessary for sound nancial planning

(Bernheim, 1988, 1995, 1998; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004, 2005; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007;

Lusardi, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011, 2014b), (ii) the pervasive failure to consult nancial

experts or use planning tools (Bernheim, 1998; Lusardi, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011), (iii) the

superciality of decision processes (Bernheim, 1994; Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007), and

    63
         Subsequently, Scholz et al. (2006)argued that it is nevertheless possible to rationalize patterns of wealth accumu-
lation using life-cycle models.
    64
         See also Hamermesh (1984), Mariger (1987), and Banks et al. (1998). Based on a disaggregated analysis of changes
in expenditures, Aguiar and Hurst (2013) argue that the reductions in consumption at retirement are consistent
with declines in work-related expenses and increases in household production, but they fail to address the observed
relationship between the decline in consumption and income replacement rates. Indeed, Olafsson and Pagel (2018)
show that the patterns of personal nancial choices around retirement are inconsistent with Aguiar and Hurst's
explanation.




                                                               62

pendix to this chapter. For related discussions, see the chapters on Intertemporal Choice (Laibson

The case for collective action.                An important question is whether self-control problems justify

collective action. Prot-seeking companies have incentives to design nancial contracts and infor-

mational products that appeal to consumers seeking better tools for exercising self-restraint. This

principle presumably applies to employers as well, who are motivated to congure their pension

plans so as to maximize the value of benets to its employees. Where is the market failure?

       Some justications for government intervention hinge on consumers' lack of sophistication. Mar-

kets do not necessarily x problems arising from misinformed decision making. On the contrary,

instead of providing needed information and education, competitive rms may exploit consumers'

limited comprehension of opportunities (Gabaix and Laibson, 2006).

       Even if all consumers are sophisticated, government intervention may be warranted. As we note

below in Section 4.3.3, eorts to design menus of options that optimally accommodate population

heterogeneity with respect to behavioral biases potentially encounter constraints arising from asym-

metric information.         The asymmetries can give rise to adverse selection, a well-known source of

market failure. See Section 4.4 for further discussion.



4.2 The tax treatment of capital income
A strictly positive (negative) capital income tax in period              t implies that period-(t + 1) consumption
is taxed at a higher (lower) eective rate than period-t consumption.                       Accordingly, zero capital

income taxation is equivalent to a uniform system of commodity taxes applied to the elements

of the time-dated consumption bundle.                According to a classical result due to Judd (1985) and

Chamley (1986), the optimal capital income tax rate is zero in the long run for economies with

innite-lived consumers.
                                66   One can reinterpret this statement as implying that the optimal solution

to the equivalent commodity tax problem involves rates that converge to a constant for large                             t.
Recently, Straub and Werning (2015) have argued that the proofs of the Chamley-Judd results are

incorrect, and that in fact the optimal capital income tax rate is positive in the long run when the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution is less than or equal to unity.

       Any factor that distorts the allocation of consumption between consecutive periods can alter the

character of the policy prescription. The optimal policy creates an osetting wedge that reduces or

  65
       One line of work identies choice patterns that experts deem inadvisable, such as low rates of saving (Bernheim
(1993)), low enrollment in pension plans that oer generous matches, naive diversication strategies, and the tendency
for employees to invest in their employers' stock (Benartzi and Thaler (1999, 2001, 2007)). Another focuses on evidence
of excessive inertia, suggestability, and intention (e.g., Madrian and Shea (2001), Bernheim et al. (2015a), and Karlan
et al. (2016b)).
  66
       In contrast, taxation and subsidization of capital income are both potentially optimal in the long run for economies
with overlapping generations of consumers (Atkinson and Sandmo, 1980; Erosa and Gervais, 2002).

removes the distortion in every period, and hence is present even in the long run. In this section,

we discuss the nature of appropriate wedges for settings involving imperfect self-control and limited

nancial competence.



4.2.1      Imperfect self-control and the case for capital income taxation

One school of thought holds that many people fail to save as much as they should because they

lack sucient self-control. Under this view, public policy can compensate to some degree for poor

decision making by providing incentives to save more.               To explore the validity of this intuitive

prescription, one must rst adopt a particular theory of self-control. In this section, we explore the

implications of three theories, two of which support the intuition, and one of which does not. The

contrast between these approaches underscores the importance of exploring nuances concerning the

nature of the choice mapping.



Correcting internalities arising from time inconsistency.                        We begin with theories that at-

tribute poor self-control to time inconsistency. Following Laibson (1996), we adopt the perspective

that choices provide valid normative guidance only when their consequences are correctly antici-

pated and limited to future periods. As with the analysis of commodity taxation, one can think

of the decisions made in normatively suspect frames as involving internalities, in the sense that

the consumer does not fully or properly internalize all the costs and/or benets she imposes on

herself. As we have noted, these internalities can interact in interesting ways with concerns about

revenues and distribution. For the time being, we will defer all discussion of distribution, and focus

on policies impacting a representative individual.

   Relabeling the commodity tax model of Section 3.2, we can think of                    y   and   x   as current and

future consumption, respectively.             Assuming the consumer undervalues the future, the optimal

policy will involve subsidization of future consumption, which is achievable through capital income

subsidies. Additional complications arise in settings with more than two periods. Altering the tax

rate on capital income at time           t   changes the implied commodity tax rate on consumption in all

future periods. It also has complex budgetary implications because it potentially alters the entire

trajectory of wealth and hence impacts tax collections in all periods. Even so, the logic of the simple

model continues to apply.

   We illustrate this point through a simple model, versions of which appear throughout this

section.   Suppose the consumer lives for four periods,           t = 0, 1, 2, 3.   No consumption takes place

in period     0,   though for some purposes we will assume the consumer makes a decision aecting

later opportunities. In each subsequent period (t           = 1, 2, 3),   she consumes   ct .    Consumption yields

ow utility    u(ct ),    which she aggregates according to quasi-hyperbolic discounting, with             Î´=1     and

Î² â (0, 1).    For simplicity, we assume Cobb-Douglas ow utility            u(ct ) = ln(ct ).   The consumer also

receives income       Y    in period 1 and, for the time being, nothing in later periods.              She has access

to a savings account that pays a gross return of 0, but the government subsidizes period                     t   saving

(for   t = 1, 2)   at the rate   Ït .   She also pays a lump-sum tax,       T,   in period 1, which balances the




                                                          64
government's budget. Under these assumptions, we can write her intertemporal budget constraint
             c2             c3
as   c1 +   1+Ï1   +   (1+Ï1 )(1+Ï2 )   â¤ Y â T.
     The normative standard mentioned above eectively equates welfare with the consumer's ob-

jective function as of period 0. According to this standard, the rst-best allocation solves



                                                max Î² [ln(c1 ) + ln(c2 ) + ln(c3 )]



                                                     s.t. c1 + c2 + c3 = Y
                                                        Y
The solution is plainly to consume               câ =   3 each period.
     How will a time-inconsistent consumer behave subject to arbitrary policy parameters                                      T   and

Ï = (Ï1 , Ï2 )?        Her decision in period 1 will depend on how she expects to deploy her remaining

resources at the start of period 2. A naif will expect to maximize                       ln(c2 ) + ln(c3 ), while a sophisticate
will expect to maximize          ln(c2 ) + Î² ln(c3 ).   Using the xed expenditure property of the Cobb-Douglas

function, we see that the naif expects to spend half of its income in period 2 and half in period 3,
                                                                           1
while the sophisticate expects to spend the fraction
                                                                          Î²+1 in period 2 and the balance in period 3. In
either case, it is straightforward to check that the solution to maximizing the rst-period objective

function,    ln(c1 ) + Î²[ln(c2 ) + ln(c3 )],      subject to the second-period continuation rule, is:


                                                                 1
                                                    cU
                                                     1 =              (Y â T ) .
                                                               2Î² + 1

Thus, rst-period consumption is the same irrespective of whether the consumer is naive or sophi-

sticated. (This property is a special feature of logarithmic utility, and is not generally true.) Note

in addition that        cU
                         1 >c
                             â    for the case of    T = 0.      In other words, rst-period consumption is excessive

regardless of whether the consumer is naive or sophisticated.

     In the second period, the consumers allocates her remaining resources in the manner anticipated

by a sophisticate (even if she is a naif ). Accordingly, she consumes the following in periods 2 and 3:

                                                                1            2Î²

                                                               1+Î²         1 + 2Î²
                                                                                      
                                                                      Î²           2Î²

                                                                     1+Î²        1 + 2Î²
For the case of        T, Ï = 0,   it is straightforward to check that              cU    â   U
                                                                                     2 = c = c3         if and only if   Î² â [ 12 , 1).
Accordingly, for empirically plausible parameters, the model predicts overconsumption in periods 1

and 2, and underconsumption in period 3.
                                                        1âÎ²                      1âÎ²
     We now claim that subsidies of              Ï1 =    2Î²    > 0 and Ï2 =       Î²     > 0 achieve the rst-best allocation
for both naifs and sophisticates. This conclusion is easily veried by substituting these values into
                                                                                      1

leakages of resources from the system, there is no need to solve for                          T    explicitly; the only possible




                                                                     65

                1 = c2 = c3 = 3 Y = c .
    Intuitively, the positive subsidies for saving correct the internality arising from placing too

much weight on the present by increasing future rewards commensurately. The rst-period subsidy

is lower than the second-period subsidy because the former generates a larger scal externality than

the latter: more rst-period saving leads to higher subsidy payouts in both periods, while more

second-period saving only leads to higher subsidy payouts in the second period. If age-dependent

subsidies are politically infeasible, the optimal (constant) rate will reect a balance between the

rst- and second-period objectives.



Moderating the disutility from temptation.                          Similar conclusions also follow for some theories

that associate imperfect self-control with internal goods rather than time inconsistency. Krusell et

al. (2010) make this point in the context of temptation preferences (Gul and Pesendorfer, 2001). To

illustrate, assume the consumer's preferences are dened over the consumption bundle                             c = (c1 , c2 ),
as well as the menu          X,     and correspond to the utility function

                                                                                
                                         U (c, X) = u(c) â Î± max v(cÌ1 ) â v(c1 ) ,
                                                                 cÌâX


where    maxcÌâX v(cÌ1 ) â v(c1 )        represents a temptation penalty incurred when choosing anything

other than the most tempting alternative from the menu                       X.    We assume       v   is strictly increasing,

so that higher consumption is more tempting.                   If we interpret      Î± maxcâX v(c1 )       as representing an

internal bad the decision maker experiences when selecting an option from the menu                              X,    then it

is natural to treat         U (c, X)   as a measure of welfare; see the Appendix.

    Now assume, as in the previous model, that the consumer receives net-of-tax income                                  Y âT
in period 1, and has access to a savings account paying a rate of return of
                                                                 n                                   o 1 + Ï,   where   Ï   is a
                                                                                    c2
subsidy. Her opportunity set is then given by                 X = c | c1 +         1+Ï   â¤Y âT         . In this setting, the

optimal subsidy is strictly positive. To understand intuitively why this result holds, note rst that

there is no tension between the objectives of the consumer and planner with respect to the choice of

consumption from any menu, which depends only on                       u(c) + Î±v(c1 ),   or with respect to the choice of

the menu from a set of feasible menus, which also depends on                      maxcÌâX v(cÌ1 ).     Because the consumer

optimizes over        c,   it follows from standard optimal tax principles that              Ï =0       achieves the highest

possible value of          u(c) +   Î±v(c1 ), or equivalently that d[u(c)+Î±v(c
                                                                        dÏ
                                                                              1 )]
                                                                                   |Ï=0 =    0.   The sign of
                                                                                                                 dU (c,X)
                                                                                                                    dÏ    |Ï=0
therefore depends entirely on whether                maxcÌâX v(cÌ1 )    is locally increasing or decreasing in          Ï    in

other words, it depends on the manner in which a subsidy aects the most tempting option in the

choice set. Because the consumer does not optimize over                      X,   there is no reason to think we have
d[maxcÌâX v(cÌ1 )]
       dÏ            |Ï=0 = 0     as well.   Indeed, using the fact that       maxcÌâX v(cÌ1 ) = v(Y â T )         (the most

tempting alternative is to consume everything in period 1), we see that small subsidies are better

than small taxes: subsidies necessitate positive lump-sum taxes (T                       > 0),    which reduce rst-period

disposable income and hence the level of temptation experienced at the consumer's optimal choice,

while taxes have the opposite eect because they necessitate positive lump-sum subsidies (T                              < 0).



                                                               66
Insuring risks arising from state inconsistency.                                 As the preceding discussion suggests, the

classes of theories emphasized in the literature provide formal rationales for the intuitive proposition

that the government should subsidize capital income in settings where consumers save too little as

a result of challenges associated with exercising self-control. Yet that conclusion may be less robust

than such analyses suggest.

       Consider the following alternative model of self-control and capital accumulation, inspired by

the Bernheim and Rangel (2004) theory of addictive behavior. Suppose the consumer lives for two

periods,      t = 1, 2, consuming c1             and   c2 .   With probability   1 â Ï, she chooses rst-period consumption
to maximize the intertemporal utility function                       u(c1 ) + u(c2 ).   Following Loewenstein (1996), we will

call this the cold decision state. With the complementary probability                           Ï , she enters a hot   decision

state and binges, consuming                 cÌ   in the rst period, which is signicantly more than she would choose

in the cold state.             These hot states are triggered by environmental cues outside the consumer's

control. She also receives income                      Y   in period 1 and nothing in period 2. As before, government

policy consists of a saving subsidy,                 Ï , and a rst-period lump-sum tax, T , yielding the intertemporal
                                       c2
budget constraint             c1 +    1+Ï   â¤ Y â T.           The government budget constraint requires the budget to

balance for a large population of ex ante identical consumers.

       Let   cÎ¸t   for   Î¸ â {C, H} denote consumption in period t in either the cold or hot state, respectively.
We will adopt a normative standard that equates welfare with the cold-state objectives, and that

places no weight on any objectives that might rationalize the hot-state behavior.

the optimal subsidy, we employ a simple perturbation argument as in Section 3.3.                                    For analytic

open question.




                                                                       67
   The preceding reasoning is a variation of the analysis in Section 3.3. Under the assumptions in

our example, we have      Î³Ì = 0.   It follows from equation 4 that the marginal welfare eect of taxing

future consumption is governed by the correlation between future consumption and the marginal

utility of income.   Because binges reduce the former and increase the latter, the correlation is

negative. Accordingly, small taxes on future consumption, and hence on capital income, are welfare-

improving.

   According to this theory, the benet of a capital income tax is that it provides implicit insurance

against the otherwise uninsurable risk of encountering environmental cues that trigger a spending

binge. Our specic conclusions plainly depend on the assumption that rst-period spending in the

hot state is unresponsive to taxes and subsidies, and one can in principle overturn the main result

by building in a suciently elastic response. Even so, the example provides reason to question the

widespread presumption that capital income subsidization is desirable when low saving results from

imperfect self-control.



Implications of population heterogeneity.             We can alternatively interpret the preceding exam-

ple as one in which there are two types of consumers: optimizers and undersavers who are inelastic

to taxes and subsidies.     Our result is then that the optimal policy does not actually induce the

undersavers to behave in a socially optimal way. Generally speaking, when preferences vary across

the population, it becomes impossible to optimize the policy for all consumers simultaneously. In

light of this observation, it is important to ask whether conventional tax and subsidy instruments

are too blunt for this policy application.

   In Section 4.3, we consider an alternative policy approach involving the creation of opportunities

for consumers to undertake commitments. As we explain, that approach accommodates population

heterogeneity more eectively. However, it too has potentially important limitations. Most obvi-

ously, by reducing the consumer's exibility, it magnies the consequences of unanticipated expenses

and income uctuations. In contrast, taxes and subsidies preserve the consumer's exibility to make

adjustments as events unfold. Because both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, mixed

approaches merit consideration. We turn to mixtures in Section 4.4.



4.2.2   Limited nancial sophistication and capital income taxation

The implications of limited nancial sophistication for capital income taxation are largely unexplored

and likely complex. Even so, the literature points in a few interesting directions.

   If consumers rigidly employ well-dened heuristics when making nancial decisions, positive

analysis becomes reasonably straightforward. Suppose, for example, that  consistent with common

nancial planning strategies  consumers aim to achieve xed rates of earnings replacement after

retirement.   It would then follow that the interest elasticity of saving is negative and potentially

substantial, and consequently that eorts to increase saving by reducing the rate of capital income

taxation are counterproductive (Bernheim, 1994). Indeed, tax breaks provided through retirement

savings accounts would simply constitute lump-sum subsidies. Alternatively, imagine that consu-




                                                     68
mers employ xed rules of thumb, such as saving 10% of earnings (Bernheim, 1994). In that case,

the interest elasticity of saving would be zero. Of course, far from being xed, heuristics and rules

of thumb may respond to the economic environment in unknown ways, rendering policy analysis far

more challenging.

   In a few cases, research has identied specic biases arising from limited sophistication, such as

the tendency to underestimate compounding, a phenomenon known as exponential growth bias (Wa-

genaar and Sagaria, 1975; Eisenstein and Hoch, 2007; Levy and Taso, 2016; Stango and Zinman,

2009; Almenberg and Gerdes, 2012). Models of this bias may have signicant policy implications.

Consider, for example, the possibility that people evaluate their intertemporal opportunities by

computing simple interest, rather than compound interest (Levy and Taso, 2016). The resulting

underestimation of returns could provide another justication for capital income subsidization,

although it would appear to argue for subsidies that increase with the investment horizon, and

consequently decline with age. Unfortunately, this simple model appears to have implausible im-

plications, such as an innite willingness to pay for any asset that makes a xed periodic payment

indenitely.



4.3 Special savings accounts: commitment features
Next we examine an alternative strategy for addressing ineciencies associated with imperfect

self-control: create appropriate commitment opportunities, and possibly provide consumers with

inducements to employ them.       Discussions of commitment devices originate with Strotz (1955-

1956). For a time-inconsistent consumer, the purpose of a commitment is to bring future choices

in line with current objectives and intentions. In the example of Section 2.2.5, Norma might avoid

eating pizza by making a social commitment to meet a friend for lunch at a restaurant that only

serves salad.

   Typically, policymakers imbed these opportunities into special savings accounts, such as IRAs

and 401(k)s, and provide further inducements in the form of tax breaks. The nature of the asso-

ciated commitments vary.    Below, we draw an important distinction between provisions aecting

the liquidity of invested funds and those that provide for delayed implementation of contribution

decisions.   IRAs and 401(k)s are both illiquid investments.    With 401(k)s, employers implement

changes in contributions with a signicant lag (next pay period). IRAs do not share this feature.

   Throughout this section, we assume the consumer is a quasi-hyperbolic discounter and adopt the

same welfare standard as in Section 4.2. Alternative theories of self-control have similar implications

for commitment opportunities. Dramatically dierent implications could follow from other welfare

perspectives.



4.3.1   The case for illiquidity.

The main idea.       We begin by illustrating how the existence of illiquid savings vehicles can help

consumers overcome self-control problems. For this purpose, we consider a variant of the rst model

examined in Section 4.2: a quasi-hyperbolic consumer with Cobb-Douglas preferences lives for four



                                                  69
periods (t   = 0, 1, 2, 3)   and must allocate her resources to consumption in periods 1 through 3.

Instead of starting out with all of her income in period 1, she receives an income stream        (y1 , y2 , y3 ).
She divides her savings between three accounts, one liquid, the other two illiquid. The rules of one

illiquid account preclude withdrawals prior to period 3 and prevent her from using these funds for

collateral to secure loans; the rules of the second are identical except that they preclude withdrawals

prior to period 2. The liquid account pays an interest rate of zero, while the period-2 illiquid account

pays   Îµ2 > 0,   and the period-3 illiquid account pays    Îµ3 > Îµ2 .     To avoid confounding the eects of

illiquidity and subsidies, we focus on the limiting case in which          Îµ3 â 0.   The analytic purpose of

these small subsidies is simply to break (perceived) ties rather than to oer meaningful incentives.

At the outset, we will assume the consumer has access to perfect credit markets, so that liquid

balances can be negative, up to the sum of future income.

   Without an illiquid account, both sophisticates and naifs select the consumption prole                   cU
dened in Section 4.2 (with      Ï = T = 0).    With the option of contributing to illiquid accounts, a
                                                                                                     Y
sophisticate instead achieves the rst-best by borrowing       y2 + y3   in period 0 and investing
                                                                                                     3 in both
of the illiquid accounts. The analysis for naifs is essentially identical. A naif does not expect to

misspend her resources, and therefore sees no need for illiquidity. However, in period 0, she prefers

to implement her desired plan through the same strategy as the sophisticate because of the (tiny)

subsidies. For the naif, commitment is incidental but nevertheless equally eective, provided the

special accounts oer some small bonus. It is worth emphasizing that sophisticates will continue to

use the illiquid account when the returns are taxed (Îµ2 , Îµ3      < 0),   but naifs will not.



Robustness.        The strong conclusion of the previous paragraph  that illiquid accounts permit

quasi-hyperbolic consumers to achieve the rst-best allocation  hinges on several critical assump-

tions. First, we have assumed that the available investment instruments provide the consumer with

exible control over the duration of illiquidity through the mix of investments in the period-2 and

period-3 illiquid accounts. In practice, special savings accounts oer little or no exibility in this

dimension. If the government only oers an illiquid retirement account targeting period 3, the

consumer will be able to lock in her period 3 consumption as of period 0, but will not be able to

prevent herself from overconsuming in period 1 at the expense of period 2.

   Second, we have assumed that consumers have unlimited ability to borrow against future ear-

nings at the market rate of return. The existence of credit constraints can signicantly reduce the

welfare benets of oering illiquid savings accounts. To illustrate, imagine that borrowing is prohi-

bitively expensive, so that all account balances must be non-negative. In that case, the consumer

has no ability in period 0 to inuence future consumption, and therefore can no longer achieve

the rst-best allocation. In the next period, her ideal is to achieve the period-1 full-committment

allocation, dened as the solution to



                                     max [ln(c1 ) + Î² ln(c2 ) + Î² ln(c3 )]




                                                      70
                                                   s.t. c1 + c2 + c3 = Y
                                                             0          1           0     0      Î²
It is easily veried that the solution entails              c1 =      1+2Î² Y and    c2 = c3 =   1+2Î² Y .   Let's assume
 0                     0
c1 < y1         and   c3 > y3 ,   so that the period-1 full-commitment solution remains feasible even with
                                                                                0
liquidity constraints. The consumer achieves that outcome if                  c2 â¥ y2   by consuming       c1   in period 1

                                                                                                c2 < y2 .68
                           0                                                                      0
and allocating         c3 â y3   to the period-3 illiquid account, but cannot achieve it if                          Moreover,

in cases where the consumer's period-1 saving in the period-3 illiquid account is too small to crowd

out all her period-2 saving, oering illiquid accounts has no eect on her consumption.
                                                                                                                69

          As an additional wrinkle, imagine that borrowing is possible but costly. For example, it might

require the use of credit cards. A sophisticate might then become reluctant to invest too much in

the illiquid account in period 0, for fear that he would thereby induce himself to borrow in period 1.

In contrast, the naif would invest more heavily in the illiquid account in order to obtain the higher

return, and suer as a consequence. This example alerts us to the possibility that the creation of

tax-favored commitment opportunities can actually harm unsophisticated consumers.

          Third, we have assumed away all uncertainty concerning future income and cash needs, arising

for example from major or minor emergencies that require ready access to liquid funds. Uncondi-

tional commitments entail costs because they require the consumer to sacrice potentially useful

exibility.
                 70   Amador et al. (2006) show with reasonable generality that the consumer's optimal

strategy nevertheless involves commitment to a minimum level of saving.

          Fourth, we have assumed that external commitments are the only routes to self-control. As noted

in the Appendix, an alternative view holds that people often achieve self-control through internal

means, such as contingent self-reinforcement. Under that view, it is essential to evaluate the manner

in which internal and external self-control strategies interact, and in particular to consider whether

they reinforce or undermine each other. Bernheim et al. (2015c) explore these issues and draw out

implications for the structure of savings plans. They demonstrate that optimal behavior involves a

simple, intuitive, and behaviorally plausible pattern of self-reinforcement: failure to meet a self-set

standard leads the individual to briey fall o the wagon, and then return to the preferred decision

rule. A key insight from their analysis is that external strategies for exercising self-control, such as

reducing liquidity, can undermine internal self-control by limiting the scope for self-reinforcement.



Provisions pertaining to withdrawals.                      So far, we have focused on xed-term accounts that

entirely proscribe early withdrawals.              In practice, special savings accounts can oer a degree of

liquidity by providing for limited withdrawals, possibly under specied conditions, or subject to

penalties. The logic of such provisions is readily evident in settings with uncertainty, particularly

     68
          These same conclusions hold regardless of whether the consumer is a sophisticate or a naif, assuming as above
that the planner can favorably resolve the naif 's indierence through the use of tiny subsidies.
     69
          If the consumer saves in period 2, then the division of her period-1 saving between the liquid account and the
period-3 illiquid account does not aect the resulting consumption prole on the margin. Consequently, the rst-order
                                                                                             U
conditions governing her rst-period and second-period are the same as those that identify c .
     70
          These costs are avoidable if consumers can make conditional (i.e., state-contingent) commitments. As a practical
matter, most commitments are either unconditional or conditional on a limited range of events.




                                                                 71
if consumers occasionally encounter unforeseen emergencies.            An ideal approach would allow for

hardship withdrawals under conditions meeting objective criteria, but in practice it is dicult to

enumerate all meritorious hardships, and verication can be problematic. A less perfect but more

practical solution is to penalize early withdrawals, setting the penalties and withdrawal limits by

evaluating the marginal benets of improved self-control and marginal costs of reduced exibility.

   The analysis of Bernheim et al. (2015c) makes a case for policies that permit unrestricted wit-

hdrawals once consumers' accumulated savings exceed preset thresholds. Their theory implies that

eective internal self-control may be possible only when consumers have sucient liquid resources.

Those who have not yet accumulated much wealth may therefore be unable to save in the absence

of external self-control devices such as illiquid savings accounts. However, once wealth rises above

some critical threshold, continued illiquidity may prevent more eective internal self-control strate-

gies from kicking in. From this perspective, illiquid accounts are most benecial when their use is

limited to priming the pump.



4.3.2     The case for delayed implementation of decisions

We now turn our attention to commitment features that involve delayed implementation of decisions.

One possibility is to impose a delay between the contribution decision and implementation (see,

e.g., Laibson, 1996).      This feature is extremely common in practice: when an employee changes

her pension plan contribution rate, her employer typically implements the change in a subsequent

pay period rather than immediately.          Taking this idea a step further, employers could also allow

households to specify savings trajectories, or to specify conditions for escalation of contributions

to special accounts. The Save More Tomorrow plan devised by Thaler and Benartzi (2004) is an

example of this approach. A nal possibility is to allow for withdrawals with low or zero penalties

contingent on advance notication (see, e.g., Laibson, 1997).



The main idea.          To illustrate the potential benets associated with delayed implementation of

contribution decisions, we reexamine the model employed in Section 4.3.1, modied as follows: we

replace the two illiquid accounts with a one-period savings instrument requiring a one-period-in-

advance contribution election. In other words, the consumer can specify period-t contributions to

the special account in period       t â 1,   and can access the entire account balance in period       t + 1.
Importantly, the consumer cannot reverse her period-t contribution election in period         t.   Nor is she

permitted to accomplish this end indirectly by borrowing against the period          t+1   account balance

in period   t.   (The account is illiquid in that limited sense.) The liquid account pays a rate of return

of zero, while the special account pays       Îµ>0   as a result of a tiny subsidy.

   In this setting, a sophisticate achieves the rst-best allocation. Through a standard argument

involving backward induction, one can show that she commits herself to period-1 contributions of
2Y                                                           Y
 3 in period 0. The most she can consume in period 1 is then 3 , which she achieves by borrowing
y2 + y3   and spending all uncommitted resources. Given her present-focused preferences, that limit
                            Y
is binding: she spends
                            3 in period 1, and in addition commits herself to period-2 contributions of



                                                       72
Y
3 . Upon reaching period 2, she again consumes as much as she can               ( Y3 ),   leaving
                                                                                                     Y
                                                                                                     3 for period 3.
     A naif expects to achieve the same allocation as the sophisticate, and is indierent between

doing so through regular or special savings accounts when both options pay the same rate of return

(Îµ   = 0).   However, for any    Îµ > 0,    she strictly prefers special savings. Indeed, she sees the return

dierential as creating a pure arbitrage opportunity, and borrows as much as possible in order

to nance greater contributions.           As a result, despite seeing no value in commitments, the naif

undertakes the same commitments as the sophisticate, and thereby achieves the rst best.

     The foregoing conclusions do not depend on the particular structure of special savings accounts,

provided consumers have sucient opportunities to make decisions that are implemented subject to

delays. Suppose, for example, that the special account targets retirement, in the sense that account

balances become perfectly liquid in period 3. As before, consumers can commit to contributions

one period in advance. Here we assume in addition that they can schedule penalty-free withdrawals

one period in advance.         In that case, a standard backward-induction argument reveals that the
                                                          2Y
sophisticate commits to period-1 contributions of
                                                           3 in period 0. Once period 1 arrives, she borrows
                      Y                2Y
y2 + y3   and consumes
                       3 , and invests 3 in the special savings account as before, but in addition
                           Y                      Y
schedules a withdrawal of
                           3 in period 2, leaving 3 for period 3.


Robustness        We have seen above that the introduction of borrowing constraints reduces the wel-

fare benets of oering illiquid special savings accounts. In contrast, the case for delayed implemen-

tation of contribution decisions remains equally strong. To illustrate, we reintroduce the assumption

that borrowing is prohibitively expensive, so that all account balances must be non-negative, while
                        Y
assuming that    y1 â¥   3   â¥ y3 ,   so that the rst-best remains feasible. A standard backward-induction

argument reveals that the sophisticate commits to period-1 contributions of                y1 â Y3    in period 0, and
                                     Y
commits to period-2 contributions of
                                     3         â y3   in period 1, thereby achieving the rst-best allocation.

With a tiny subsidy, the naif does the same.

     That said, uncertainty concerning future income and cash needs potentially reduces the benets

of delaying the implementation of contribution decisions. The issues are essentially the same as in

the context of illiquid accounts. Likewise, the use of savings accounts with advance contribution

election requirements may undermine internal self-control strategies by delaying self-punishment.

In particular, when a consumer binges in period               t,   any period-t commitment she makes to her

contribution for period      t+1     limits her ability to self-punish starting in period      t + 1.

Commitments to consumption trajectories.                      As noted above, the Thaler and Benartzi (2004)

Save More Tomorrow plan provides consumers with opportunities to commit in advance to allocating

a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement saving. Despite the authors' informal

claims, it is not clear that their proposal is well-founded in the formal theory of self-control. What

matters for the theory is simply that decisions are made in advance, outside the window of present

focus. In the context of our simple models, allowing the consumer to lock in period-1 and period-2

saving in period 0 oers no advantage over allowing her to lock in period-1 saving in period 0 and




                                                         73
period-2 saving in period 1.      The same principle holds in a more general setting with respect to

commitments that are contingent on realizations of period-2 income.

   To make a sound conceptual case for Thaler and Benartzi's approach, one requires a rather

dierent theory of self-control. One possibility is that consumers discount hyperbolically, attaching
               1
the weight
             1+Î±t to outcomes    t   periods in the future, rather than quasi-hyperbolically (see Ainslie,

1992).   Under that assumption, decisions pertaining to periods 2 and 3 are more future-oriented

when made in period 0 than in period 1.

   An entirely dierent case for Thaler and Benartzi's approach would proceed from the premise

that consumers are imperfectly attentive: they may sometimes fail to elect higher contributions

upon receiving a salary increase simply because they neglect the decision. Locking in a contingent

plan for escalating contributions removes that possibility.



4.3.3    Implications of population heterogeneity

In contrast with taxes and subsidies, special savings accounts accommodate dimensions of population

heterogeneity pertaining to the severity of self-control problems. To illustrate, suppose people dier

with respect to   Î²,   which parameterizes the degree of present focus. In our basic models, a uniform

system of special accounts with appropriate commitment opportunities permits every consumer to

achieve her personal optimum, whereas a uniform system of taxes and subsidies does not.

   That said, more complex models may implicate additional dimensions of population heteroge-

neity that are less amenable to uniform treatment within a system of special savings accounts. For

example, in settings with uncertainty, consumers may value exibility dierently based on their

exposures to short-term income and expenditure uctuations, as well as their risk preferences. Be-

cause the costs and benets of early withdrawal penalties are consumer-specic, optimizing these

provisions for all consumers simultaneously is impossible.

   An alternative is to provide consumers with opportunities to customize account provisions go-

verning implementation delays, as well as the degree, duration, and/or conditions of illiquidity. For

example, suppose we add uncertainty concerning income and/or expenditures to our simple model,

thereby rendering commitments costly, but also allow consumers at the outset (period 0) to select

the parameters governing limits on early withdrawals and associated penalties. According to the

theory, each sophisticate will select the parameters that are optimal for her in light of her own

circumstances and preferences. Bernheim et al. (2015c) emphasize that customizability may allow

special savings accounts to complement internal self-control strategies more eectively.

   While customizability oers potential advantages, it also raises concerns. An important question

is whether consumers are sophisticated enough to make good decisions concerning the provisions of

their accounts, let alone to optimize them. Despite some of our previous observations, inducing naifs

to make optimal choices through tiny indierence-resolving subsidies is not generally possible. For

instance, a naif will actively resist optimal early withdrawal penalties in settings with uncertainty.

Additionally, optimizing account features can be mathematically complex, and consumers have little

experience with those types of choices.




                                                      74
       A second concern is that population heterogeneity usually goes hand-in-hand with private in-

formation, in the sense that each consumer knows more about her own circumstances than the

government. When oering an option targeted at a particular type of consumer, the government

has no way to prevent other types of consumers from selecting it.                    That limitation is potentially

problematic when the option entails provisions with budgetary implications, such as penalties, fees,

and subsidies. A menu of options that appears feasible (in the sense of budget balance) when each

consumer is assigned to her intended option may become infeasible when consumers are free to pick

any option on the menu. We discuss the implications of this observation in Section 4.4 below, where

we consider mixed policies involving taxes, subsidies, and special accounts.



4.3.4       Evidence on the demand for commitments

For many years, evidence of a widespread demand for commitment proved elusive.
                                                                                                  71   While anecdotes

were plentiful (Laibson et al., 1998; Caskey, 1997; Beverly et al., 2003), there was little hard evidence

concerning the prevalence of the cited practices, such as cutting up credit cards. A collection of

relatively recent papers has begun to ll that gap.
                                                                72   Some of these focus specically on nancial

choices; see, for example, Shipton (1992) on the use of lockboxes in Gambia, or Ashraf et al. (2006) on

the demand for commitment savings products in the Philippines. Likewise, Aliber (2001), Gugerty

(2007), Anderson and Baland (2002), and Ambec and Treich (2007) view ROSCA participation as

a commitment device. Perhaps the cleanest evidence of a demand for commitment to saving comes

from an experiment by Beshears et al. (2015), which documents a preference among many U.S.

households for greater illiquidity when allocating funds among commitment accounts paying the

same rate of return. Still, nagging doubts persist, partly because much of the evidence is equivocal,

and partly because its scope is limited.
                                                73   Skeptics continue to wonder why, if time inconsistency is

so prevalent, the free market provides so few commitment devices, and unambiguous examples in

the eld are so dicult to nd.
                                       74   Indeed, some suggest that the fewness of the obvious exceptions

proves the rule.

       Why might time-inconsistent consumers exhibit limited demand for external commitment de-

vices? One possibility is that they are stubbornly naive, in the sense that they fail to appreciate

their own behavioral tendencies despite repeated experience.                  A second is that, in settings with

uncertainty, commitments require consumers to sacrice valuable exibility (Laibson, 2015). This

  71
       Most of the pertinent literature through 2010 echoes this evaluation. For example, Gine et al. (2010) write that
there is little eld evidence on the demand for or eectiveness of such commitment devices. For recent surveys, see
Bryan et al. (2010); DellaVigna (2009).
  72
       Notable contributions on the use of commitment devices in non-nancial contexts include Ariely and Wertenbroch
(2002), Kaur et al. (2015) and Augenblick et al. (2015) on work eort, Houser et al. (2010) and Toussaert (2017) on
temptation, Toussaert (2016) on weight loss, Gine et al. (2010) on smoking, and Bernheim et al. (2016) and Schilbach
(2017) on alcohol consumption (which also includes a nice summary of previous work).
  73
       For example, in Ariely and Wertenbroch's experiment, students may have been motivated by a misguided desire
to signal diligence. Likewise, much of the evidence on the demand for commitment savings products in developing
countries is potentially attributable to a desire for other-control (family and friends) rather than to self-control; see,
e.g., Dupas and Robinson (2013).
  74
       Many common nancial products, such as mortgages and retirement accounts entail precommitments. However,
those products oer other advantages, and it is not clear whether their inexibility increases or reduces demand.




                                                           75
explanation assumes that consumers cannot make state-contingent commitments, which is reasona-

ble if the diculty of observing the relevant states (e.g., moods) renders them non-contractable. A

third possibility is that private pensions, mortgages, and other long-term nancial contracts happen

to satisfy consumers' demand for commitment while also addressing other needs and objectives. A

nal explanation is that externally enforced commitments may undermine internal methods of self-

regulation involving contingent self-reinforcement.             Foundations for the notion that people may

self-impose contingent punishments and rewards to establish incentives for following desired plans

of action are found in the literatures on self-regulation and behavior modication dating back to

the 1960s.
              75   Bernheim et al. (2015c) demonstrate that external constraints can undermine these

internal mechanisms.



4.4 Special savings accounts with taxes and subsidies
Actual policies, such as the statutes that establish the frameworks for specialized retirement ac-

counts, entail a mix of tax provisions and commitment features. Laibson et al. (1998), Angeletos et

al. (2001), and Laibson et al. (2003) employ simulation methods to evaluate their eects. These pa-

pers study rich environments in which QHD consumers can contribute either to conventional liquid

savings accounts or to illiquid tax-favored retirement accounts.                Illiquidity is partial in the sense

that withdrawals are permitted prior to age 60, but trigger penalties. The simulation models en-

compass other important factors such as income uncertainty, but abstract from internal self-control

strategies. The authors demonstrate that reasonably parameterized QHD models can account for a

number of otherwise puzzling behavioral patterns, such the observed comovements between income

and consumption, including the sharp decline in consumption at retirement, and heavy reliance on

costly revolving debt, such as credit cards. They also nd that the welfare benets of tax-favored

retirement accounts may be substantial.

       Ideally, we would like to determine the optimal mix of taxes, subsidies, and special savings

account provisions in light of self-control problems, uncertainty with respect to income and expen-

ditures, multiple dimensions of population heterogeneity, and asymmetric information between the

consumer and account provider. Economists have only recently begun to make meaningful progress

toward that ideal.

       Galperti (2015) considers a setting in which consumers seek to provide for future consumption

while retaining the exibility to meet shorter-term needs, which are stochastic. Population heteroge-

neity takes a limited form: consumers either have limited or perfect self-control. The ideal contract

for someone with limited self-control provides for a subsidized return on saving, an intermediate

degree of commitment, and xed fees that pay for the subsidies.                   Unfortunately, consumers with

perfect self-control are also drawn to these contracts. They end up saving more on average, and

therefore receive higher subsidies, which prevents the contract provider from breaking even. The

  75
       According to Bandura and Kupers (1964), people often set themselves relatively explicit criteria of achievement,
failure to meet which is considered undeserving of self-reward and may elicit self-denial or even self-punitive respon-
ses... See also Bandura (1971, 1976); Mischel (1973); Rehm (1977); Kazdin (2012); Ainslie (1975, 1991, 1992).




                                                            76
provider has to take this self-selection into account.

      Galperti characterizes optimal contract provision for a monopolist and for a benevolent planner.

In each case, the optimal menu species a contract for both types of consumers, and is designed

so that those with and without self-control both prefer their intended option.                       The solution has

some interesting and intuitive properties. First, the optimal contract for those without self-control

may specify minimum and maximum levels of saving. The point of these provisions is to limit the

contract's attractiveness to those with self-control. This nding suggests a possible rationalization

for the observation that contributions to tax-favored savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s

are capped. Second, the optimal contract for those with self-control typically includes an unused

detrimental alternative that those without self-control would nd irresistibly tempting. The purpose

of this provision is likewise to discourage imitation.

      The special features of Galperti's model may limit its applicability. Most notably, there are no

outside saving or borrowing options. Consumers must choose between one of the two contracts,

and have no other means of moving resources across time. The absence of heterogeneity with respect

to consumer sophistication is also likely important. Still, the crisp intuitions behind the key ndings

suggest the possibility of generalization.

      The task of implementing optimal capital income tax analyses empirically for reasonably realistic

settings with behavioral consumers would appear challenging.                   In addition to addressing various

theoretical complexities, one would need to measure the joint distribution of present-focus, savings

elasticities, and factors inuencing the demand for exibility.                The necessary inputs for such an

investigation are not found in existing empirical studies.



4.5 Special savings accounts: default options
Starting with Madrian and Shea (2001), a number of studies have found that changing the default

contribution rate for a 401(k) pension plan has a powerful eect on employees contributions, parti-

cularly compared with conventional policy instruments such as capital income taxes; see also Choi

et al. (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006); Beshears et al. (2008); Carroll et al. (2009).
                                                                                            76     Yet the selection of

default options has received far less attention. Only a few studies, discussed below, have explicitly

examined their use as policy instruments.



4.5.1      Theories of default eects

How should employers and policy makers exploit default eects, if at all? Several proposals have

surfaced in the years since Madrian and Shea (2001) rst documented the phenomenon.

      One idea is to set 401(k) defaults so as to maximize contributions (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008).

Support for this objective emanates from the belief that consumers save too little.                       While some

unabashedly defend that judgment on paternalistic grounds, others insist that the inadequacy of

saving is an objective consequence of self-control problems. The theoretical relevance of self-control

 76
      Bronchetti et al. (2013) describe a related context in which no default eect is observed.




                                                           77
is questionable, however, in light of the fact that workers make 401(k) contribution elections well

in advance of implementation, which generally occurs in a subsequent pay cycle, so that all con-

sequences of these decisions lie outside the time window usually associated with present-focused

tendencies.

   A second idea is to set 401(k) defaults with the object of minimizing the frequency with which

people opt out. Thaler and Sunstein (2003) advocate this approach, oering as informal justication

a principle of ex post validation (meaning that those who stick with the default evidently consider

it acceptable). However, they do not articulate an objective function that would rationalize this

criterion.

   A third idea is to structure 401(k)s so that all employees must make active decisions, with

the object of ensuring that contribution rates reect actual preferences (Carroll et al., 2009).   A

conceptual diculty with this approach is that the result is necessarily contrary to the preferences

of anyone who would rather avoid the costs of making a contribution election. It is also worth noting

that an active-choice requirement is equivalent to maximizing the frequency with which people opt

out of the default option. In that sense, the second and third proposals are diametrically opposed.

   To sort out the welfare eects of default contributions rates, one must rst understand the

nature of default eects.   Several theories merit consideration.   First, defaults can inuence the

choices of rational consumers in settings where opt-out entails signicant costs. However, according

to DellaVigna (2009) and Bernheim et al. (2015a), 401(k) opt-out costs would have to be implausibly

large to account for the magnitude of default eects. Second, to the extent opting out requires eort

and workers are time-inconsistent, they may procrastinate with respect to making 401(k) elections.

This theory also encounters diculties. If consumers are sophisticated with respect to their time

inconsistency, then for reasonable parameterizations of preferences, default eects would not be

much larger than for the rst theory. Naivete can rationalize much larger default eects under the

assumption that little learning occurs: workers must cling to false beliefs about the likelihood of

near-term action even though experience falsies that belief pay period after pay period.     Third,

inertia may reect inattention. While large default eects are equally problematic for theories of

rational inattention, consumers may deploy their attention suboptimally.     Finally, a default may

provide a psychological anchor in a setting where workers are unclear about their own preferences.

   Throughout most of this section, we will assume for the purpose of illustration that default

eects arise from sophisticated time inconsistency (quasi-hyperbolic discounting), even though that

is not the most plausible explanation.   Here, however, we adopt a less restrictive perspective on

welfare than in previous subsections, allowing instead for the possibility that decisions with (some)

immediate consequences may have as much normative validity as decisions with (only) delayed

consequences. We briey discuss implications of other theories in the nal subsection.



4.5.2   Optimal defaults with sophisticated time inconsistency

A simple model.      A three-period model based on Bernheim et al. (2015a) suces to illustrate the

key insights concerning optimal defaults. The worker's task is to choose the level of some period-1




                                                 78
action,      x â [xmin , xmax ].      She makes the decision either in period 0 (if commitments are allowed) or

in period 1. Either way, her options are to take no action and accept a default,                           x = D,   or expend

period-1 eort to select an alternative.                   Active choice entails an immediate utility cost of              Î³.   In

period 2, she receives           x   along with income         m,   which together deliver utility of     v(x, xâ ) + m,   where

xâ   â [xmin , xmax ],      her ideal point, varies across the population. For simplicity, we also assume each

individual's preferences are single-peaked in                   x.   The period-2 utility loss from receiving an option

other than the ideal point is



                                               â(D, xâ ) = v(xâ , xâ ) â v(D, xâ )

With respect to intertemporal tradeos, the worker is a quasi-hyperbolic discounter, with                           Î´ = 1 (for
simplicity) and        Î² â [0, 1].
         Throughout, we assume that the same value of                   xâ governs contribution elections both in naturally
occurring decision problems and within the welfare-relevant domain. As justication, we reiterate

that the consequences of these decisions lie outside the time window usually associated with present-

focused tendencies. For the purpose of this discussion, we abstract from the important possibility

that consumers may misapprehend their ideal points due to a lack of nancial sophistication.

         Conditional on opting out, the worker will plainly choose                  xâ .   Whether she opts out depends on

the timing of her decision. Her optimal choice rule takes the following form: accept the default when

â(D, xâ ) < Î³/Î²c ,          otherwise opt out.
                                                    77   When making the decision in period 0 (as a commitment),

Î²c = 1;       when making it in period 1 (contemporaneously),                    Î²c = Î² .

Evaluating outcomes.                   In Sections 4.2 through 4.4, we followed the common practice of treating

Î²   as a bias, which amounts to respecting choices made only in period 0. As noted in Section 6, the

justication for this normative perspective is subject to debate. Here we explore the robustness of

policy prescriptions by examining optimal defaults taking the welfare-relevant domain to be either

period-0 choices, period-1 choices, or both.

         To evaluate welfare, we compute equivalent variations (EVs) for changes in the default option,

using       x = xâ    (the rst-best) as the baseline outcome.                 For those who do not opt out, the EV is

ââ(D, xâ ). For those who do opt out, the EV is                      â bÎ³e , where be is the discount factor used for welfare
evaluation and         e   is the frame of evaluation. We focus here on decisions made without commitment

(that is, in period 1), and consider both possible evaluation frames:                        e = 0,   which assesses outcomes

based on period 0 choices (so               b0 = 1),     and   e = 1,   which uses period 1 choices (so      b1 = Î² ).   Letting

Notice that    EVA > EVB : the monetary equivalent of a failure to elect xâ                     is greater when evaluating

outcomes according to the period-1 frame, because the worker attaches more importance to period-1

eort costs in period 1 than in period 0.



     Optimal defaults.               First we take the welfare-relevant domain to consist of period-1 choices

(e   = 1),   so that the decision criterion and the welfare criterion agree, as in a setting with time

consistency. From an inspection of equation 10, one can see that, as a general rule,                                EVB     tends to

reach local maxima with respect to

                                                                                                                        Î³
addition, the average loss among those who accept the default,                       E â(D, xâ ) | â(D, xâ ) <          Î²       , tends

to be smaller when the density of ideal points achieves a local maximum at                       D.   Accordingly, the most

natural candidates for optimal defaults include the central point of the ideal-point distribution, the

smallest and largest allowable contributions (xmin and  xmax ), and any common kink-points in the
               â
function v(Â·, x ) (arising, for example, from caps on matching contributions by employers).

     Notably, the Thaler and Sunstein (2003) opt-out-minimization criterion, which prescribes max-
                                             
                                         Î³
imization of P        â(D, xâ ) <        Î²        , delivers similar policy recommendations.       While the two criteria

often agree in practice, they can also diverge signicantly; see Bernheim et al. (2015a). However,

the optimal policy converges to opt-out minimization as                          Î³ â 0     (Bernheim and Mueller-Gastell,

2018).

     As an illustration, consider the special case in which the loss function is quadratic (â (D, x
                                                                                                                                  â)   =
Âµ (D â   xâ )2 ) and the distribution of
                                     xâ is single-peaked and symmetric around xÌ. Then it is easy
                                        dEVB
to check that the rst-order condition,
                                         dD = 0, is satised when the default coincides with the
median bliss point (D           = xÌ),   in which case the opt-out frequency is minimized.

     Next we take the welfare-relevant domain to consist of period 0 choices (e                         = 0).       According to

equation 11, the welfare criterion                     EVA   consists of two components. The rst is simply
                                                                                                                      EVB ,      the
                                                                         â                                 Î³
criterion we applied above. The second is the opt-out frequency, P â(D, x )                            >           , multiplied by
                                                                                                           Î²
                                        
                                1
a positive weight,      Î³       Î²   â1       . The presence of the second term shifts the welfare objective in the

direction of opt-out maximization. Carroll et al. (2009) show that, for suciently low                             Î² , the solution
involves an extreme default that compels active choice. In contrast, for higher values of                             Î²,   the logic

of maximizing     EVB       takes over. As a result, in plausible special cases (e.g., with a quadratic loss

function, as dened above), the optimal policy involves either the minimization or maximization of

opt-out frequencies, depending on whether                       Î²   is above or below a threshold (Carroll et al., 2009).

     Bernheim and Mueller-Gastell (2018) argue that, with a richer and more realistic set of policy

instruments, an employer should never seek to incentivize opt-out by setting undesirable defaults.

According to their analysis, the optimal strategy is to correct the opt-out decision by imposing a fee




                                                                      80
on passive choosers while balancing the employer's budget through a general transfer, and then to

set the default rate as if no bias exists.
                                                  78   For small opt-out costs (Î³ ) and other natural special cases,

it then follows that optimal defaults minimize the opt-out frequency (conditional on the optimal

penalty) irrespective of decision bias.

       Supposing once more that the employer only sets a default contribution rate, what if one remains

agnostic about biases and treat all choices as welfare-relevant? In those settings,                  EVA   becomes an

upper bound on the aggregate equivalent variation and                  EVB   becomes a lower bound. If we assume

framing eects are large enough to account for the powerful inuence of defaults on choices, then

the region of indeterminacy between              EVA     and   EVB   is necessarily large. However, Bernheim et al.

(2015a) use empirically calibrated models to show that the shapes of the                       EVA   and   EVB   (versus

D)     functions are similar for 401(k) contribution rates below 20%. Within that range, the optimal

default is generally insensitive to the decision frame.



4.5.3       Optimal defaults under other theories

As noted in Section 4.5.1, models of sophisticated time inconsistency have diculty accounting for

the observed magnitude of the default eect for 401(k) contribution. Theories involving naive time

inconsistency, irrational inattention, and anchoring are potentially more plausible.                       Bernheim et

al. (2015a) and Goldin and Reck (2017) explore their implications for optimal defaults. Because

we view the Bernheim-Rangel framework as a generalization of the Behavioral Revealed Preference

paradigm (see Section 2.2.3), our discussion will employ the vocabulary of the former.

       For any particular theory, one must rst make the potential decision frames explicit, and then

take a stand on which frames are welfare-relevant. The current application raises no special issues

concerning the denition of decision frames for theories involving sophisticated or naive time incon-

sistency. However, the cases of irrational inattention and anchoring are more complicated. For those

theories, it is tempting to think of the default rate,               D,   as the frame, inasmuch as it may trigger

attention or serve as a psychological anchor. However, that approach is conceptually problematic.

By denition, decision frames are conditions that do not aect opportunities. Whenever opt-out

entails non-negligible costs, changing            D    changes the opportunity set. Therefore, the default rate

cannot be part of a properly dened decision frame.

       One solution to this diculty is to nest the problem of interest within a more general environment

that separates the default framing from the practical consequences of establishing a default.                        In

naturally occurring settings, one can describe those consequences by an eort-cost schedule that

drops discontinuously at the default. More generally, however, one could contrive arbitrary eort-

cost schedules, for instance by varying the processing requirements across the potential contribution

rates, and possibly introducing burdens on passive choosers.                     Equipped with a choice mapping

dened over this broader domain, one can easily identify properly dened frames and framing

eects.      Models of attention and anchoring permit one to infer this generalized choice mapping,

which in turn enables applications of the Bernheim-Rangel apparatus.

       Three of the theories we have mentioned  sophisticated time inconsistency, naive time incon-

sistency, and irrational inattention  have the property that the ideal outcome according to the

consumer's perceptions,       xâ ,   does not depend on the default framing. Bernheim et al. (2015a) show

that these theories have similar implications for optimal defaults, for similar reasons, though the

details dier. Anchoring belongs in a separate category, because it implies that                  xâ    depends on    D.
This feature of the anchoring theory potentially induces a high degree of welfare ambiguity, and may

preclude one from reaching useful conclusions absent a renement of the welfare-relevant domain.

One possible renement is to evaluate welfare in a neutral frame, corresponding to the default                      D
                       â
that induces the same x as an active choice regime (one without a default). This renement may

be particularly appealing if, for example, anchoring eects reect the incorrect belief that defaults

embody authoritative advice. According to the empirical analysis in Bernheim et al. (2015a), this

perspective leads to the conclusion that consumer surplus varies to only a small degree with the

default. Because higher contributions entail costs to employers and the government via matching

and tax breaks, the socially optimal default rate is then zero.



4.6 Financial education and choice simplication
As noted in Section 6, low levels of literacy raise concerns about the general quality of nancial

decision making. In this section, we discuss two types of policy responses: nancial education, which

aims to improve decisions by helping consumers acquire the basic knowledge and skills they need to

understand the choices they face, and choice simplication requirements, which seek to render the

consequences of nancial choices more transparent.



4.6.1       The behavioral eects of nancial education

The term nancial education subsumes a wide range of diverse interventions.                           Most of these

programs fall into two broad categories, according to whether they are employer-based or school-

based. Employers provide the lion's share of adult nancial education in the U.S.
                                                                                                   79   They typically

engage professional consultants whose oerings tend to be brief but highly polished.
                                                                                                         80   Brevity is,

in eect, a design constraint: thorough educational programs are not only costly but also time-

consuming, which makes them unappealing to workers. To compensate for brevity, these programs

generally focus on simple heuristics accompanied by highly motivating messages.                          The intent is

to make the substantive material engaging, memorable, and actionable.                     In contrast, high school

courses often span a full semester, permitting a more expansive and in-depth treatment of subject

  79
       In a 2013 survey of 407 retirement plan sponsors covering more than 10 million workers by Aon Hewitt, 77%
of providers oered on-site nancial education seminars or meetings (Austin and Evens, 2013). In the 2015 FINRA
National Financial Capability Study, 40.24% of respondents aged 20 - 65 who have received nancial education did
so through an employer.
  80
       A meta-analysis by Fernandes, Lynch Jr and Netemeyer (2014) nds that the average nancial education program
involves only 9.7 hours of instruction. That time is usually divided among a long list of complex topics. For example,
Skimmyhorn (2015) reports that a nancial education program used by the U.S. military covers compound interest,
the focus of our current study, along with a collection of several more complex topics  retirement concepts, the Thrift
Savings Plan, military retirement programs, and investments  all within a single two-hour session.




                                                          82
matter, as well as more interactive pedagogy, including practice and discussion. However, teacher

qualications and experience vary considerably from school to school (Brown et al., 2014).

   In light of this diversity, one would hardly expect all programs to aect behavior similarly. Even

educational interventions that achieve similar improvements in tested comprehension may have dis-

similar eects on behavior, depending on the particular manner in which each intervention motivates

participants, and whether it helps them learn to internalize and operationalize conceptual knowledge

rather than directional imperatives. From its inception, the literature has studied workplace and

school-based programs separately (beginning with Bernheim, Garrett and Maki, 2001a, and Bern-

heim and Garrett, 2003), but has only recently begun to explore the heterogeneity of approaches

within each category, and to examine how the eects of an intervention depend on its design and

constituent components.    Increasingly, the literature relies on controlled experiments rather than

naturally occurring data. The experimental approach oers important advantages in settings where

naturalistic interventions are highly composite and heterogeneous.     Programmatic diversity may

help to explain why dierent authors have reached dierent conclusions concerning the behavioral

eects of nancial education; see, for example, Duo and Saez (2003), Bayer et al. (2009), Bayer,

Bernheim and Scholz (2009), Goda, Manchester and Sojourner (2012), Cole and Shastry (2012),

Cole, Sampson and Zia (2011), Skimmyhorn (2012), Servon and Kaestner (2008), Collins (2010),

LÃ¼hrmann, Serra-Garcia and Winter (2014), Mandell (2009), Bertrand and Morse (2011), Drexler,

Fischer and Schoar (2014), Carlin, Jiang and Spiller (2014), Heinberg et al. (2014), Lusardi et al.

(2014), and Brown et al. (2014), as well as the chapter on personal nancial decision making in

this volume, Beshears et al. (forthcoming). Recent surveys by Hastings, Madrian and Skimmyhorn

(2013) and Lusardi and Mitchell (2014a) underscore the mixed nature of the available empirical

evidence.



4.6.2   The welfare eects of nancial education

The welfare eects of nancial education are far from obvious.      Discussions of this issue often

proceed from preconceptions, such as the notion that people would be better o with high saving and

balanced portfolios, or that a better understanding of nancial concepts necessarily promotes better

decisions. Yet it is also possible that particular interventions alter behavior through mechanisms

that involve indoctrination, exhortation, deference to authority, social pressure, or psychological

anchors. If so, their benets are unclear.

   These concerns are particularly acute for workplace interventions. As noted above, employer-

sponsored programs typically compensate for brevity by oering simple heuristics and emphasizing

motivational rhetoric.   Compelling rhetoric may distract from substance and promote a one-size-

ts-all response, which may be excessive for some and even directionally inappropriate for others.



Methods for evaluating the quality of nancial decision making             In principle, one can em-

pirically evaluate the quality of decision making in the nancial domain using any of the strategies

discussed in Section 2.2.4. For example, Ambuehl et al. (2017) deploy the strategy of implementing




                                                 83
reframed decision problems.       They introduce a measure of nancial competence based on discre-

pancies between choices in equivalent valuation tasks.               Specically, they compare a consumer's

willingness to accept (WTA) for two equivalent claims on future income, where one is a simplied

version of the other. The simple version states the future claim transparently. The complex version

packages the claim as an income-generating asset, designed so that the consumer requires a kno-

wledge of targeted nancial principles to infer the claim, and hence to understand the equivalence

between the simple and complex versions. Someone who both possesses and fully operationalizes

that knowledge will consistently ascribe the same value to both claims regardless of their preferences

and/or other decision biases. When consumers' WTAs for equivalent claims dier, the magnitude of

the discrepancy provides an intuitively appealing measure of her competence to make good decisions

in contexts involving the pertinent principles. Subject to the second-best considerations discussed

in Section 2.2.6, it also has a precise welfare interpretation: it indicates the extent to which the

consumer's incomplete operational command of the principles that govern the equivalence exposes

her to losses.

      To illustrate, say one is concerned that people poorly understand the concept of compound

interest, and that this limitation causes them to make suboptimal investment decisions. To evaluate

this possibility, one might assess the consumer's WTA for pairs of equivalent claims such as the

following: the complex claim represents a $10 investment that promises a return of 6% per day

compounded daily for 15 days while the simple claim simply promises $24 in 15 days. Ordinarily,

a consumer will be willing to choose each asset over a xed sum of money if and only if the sum

does not exceed some threshold value, call it      pâ   for the rst claim and     qâ   for the second. A quick

calculation reveals that the two claims are equivalent, subject to rounding.               Thus, swapping out

one for the other in a decision problem changes framing while leaving opportunities intact. As a

general matter, any education intervention that successfully provides subjects with an operational

understanding of compound interest should bring              pâ   into closer alignment with   qâ.   Furthermore,

|pâ   â   q â | bounds the magnitude of the welfare loss resulting from the consumer's poor comprehension
of the complexly framed decision problem.

      As discussed in Section 2.2.4, this method allows the analyst to measure decision-making quality

in settings that implicate preferences without making strong assumptions about behavioral or cog-

nitive processes. Also, as mentioned in Section 2.2.6, one can defend the resulting welfare measure

against second-best critiques. The portability of the approach may be limited, however, because

complex naturally occurring investment tasks do not necessarily lend themselves to transparent

simplications.

      The literature on nancial education has also explored other methods mentioned in Section

2.2.4. For example:


      â¢   Song (2015) deploys structural methods to evaluate the welfare eects of changes in retirement

          contributions resulting from an educational intervention targeting compound interest.               His

          analysis hinges on the accuracy with which a particular life-cycle model, calibrated with data

       and true preferences.


   â¢   A variety of studies, including Ernst et al. (2004), Calvet et al.    (2007, 2009), Agarwal et

       al. (2009), Baltussen and Post (2011), and Choi et al. (2011) gauge the quality of nancial

       decision making using dominance methods. Aufenanger et al. (2016) deploys this approach

       (and others) to evaluate the eects of nancial education.


   â¢   Choi, Kariv, Mueller and Silverman (2014) assesses the quality of nancial decision making by

       measuring the extent to which choices violate revealed preference axioms. The suitability of

       this method for evaluating nancial education is unclear, because educational interventions do

       not target conformance with WARP directly, and non-conformance may result from a variety

       of considerations that are unrelated to the consumer's understanding of specic nancial

       principles.



Welfare evaluations of nancial education interventions               Ambuehl et al. (2017) evaluate

the welfare eects of an educational intervention on compound interest, one of the fundamental

concepts in personal nance. It resembles typical employer-sponsored interventions with respect to

its brevity, as well as its emphasis on heuristics and motivational messages. It also appears to be

highly eective according to conventional outcome measures: treated subjects perform substantially

better on an incentivized nancial literacy test, they report applying their newly gained knowledge

when performing the decision tasks we assign them, and their average WTAs for interest-bearing

assets change in a direction that counteracts the previously documented tendency to underestimate

compounding (exponential growth bias). Nevertheless, they nd that the intervention does not, on

average, improve the quality of decision making, because its eects are poorly correlated with initial

biases.

   A possible explanation for this nding is that subjects may interpret motivational rhetoric as

substantive advice and, even when their tested knowledge improves, emerge with an insucient

operational understanding of nancial concepts to make appropriate adjustments. To explore this

hypothesis, the authors implement two additional variants of the intervention, one that retains its

substantive elements but omits the motivational rhetoric, and another that retains the motivational

rhetoric but omits almost all of the substance. They show that the eects on nancial literacy and

self-reported decision strategies are primarily attributable to the substantive elements of instruction,

as one would hope. However, in sharp contrast, the eects on nancial choices are primarily at-

tributable to the non-substantive elements. In particular, the intervention's motivational rhetoric

increases subjects' WTA for interest-bearing assets regardless of the extent to which any particu-

lar individual initially understates or overstates the eects of compounding.      This indiscriminate

response is benecial in some cases and harmful in others; on average, there is no benet. When

stripped of motivational rhetoric, exclusively substantive instruction has some eect on behavior,

and it does reduce reliance on simple interest calculations (the most common type of mistake), but

it fails to promote reliance on correct compound interest calculations, instead increasing the preva-




                                                  85
lence of other mistakes. As a result, its impact on WTAs for interest-bearing assets is directionally

haphazard and, on average, welfare-neutral.

   Other studies have reached similarly discouraging conclusions concerning the welfare eects of

nancial education.   For instance, using the structural approach, Song (2015) also nds that the

eect of an educational intervention involving compound interest is indiscriminate: the impact on

measured saving is not closely related to the gap between actual and optimal rates implied by a

parameterized life-cycle consumption model, and the intervention induces some people to oversave.

See also Aufenanger et al. (2016) and Bruhn et al. (2016).



4.6.3   Choice simplication

Choice simplication requirements aim to mitigate the consequences of low nancial sophistication

by rendering the consequences of nancial choices more transparent. In the language of Ambuehl et

al. (2017), such policies amount to replacing naturally occurring, complexly framed decision tasks

with their simply framed counterparts on a widespread basis in the real world, rather than on a limi-

ted basis merely for the purpose of diagnosis and evaluation. As noted in Section 2.2.6, second-best

considerations arising from the possible existence of other decision-making biases can undermine the

general case for transparency. Consequently, formal justications for choice simplication implicitly

hinge on the perspective of idealized welfare analysis.

   Field evidence on the eects of choice simplication is mixed.      Beshears et al. (2013) show

that simplied options for retirement plans that collapse a highly multidimensional problem into a

simple binary choice can increase enrollment rates by 10 to 20 percentage points. It does not follow,

however, that the increase reects an improved understanding of consequences.       Instead, it may

simply involve an aversion to complexity. Indeed, in another context, Beshears et al. (2011) nd

no evidence that the providing information concerning mutual fund features through a simplied

Summary Prospectus rather than a statutory prospectus meaningfully inuences portfolio choices.

   The main challenge facing advocates of choice simplication is the problem of determining

which presentations of information actually render the consequences of complex, real-world choices

more comprehensible to consumers. The welfare eects of ostensibly simpler presentations that

are in fact contrived to nudge consumers in predetermined directions are unclear.       Perhaps the

most promising strategies for achieving neutral improvements in transparency involve the use of

visualization tools that provide consumers with free reign to explore the consequences of available

options (Lusardi et al., 2014).



4.7 Mandatory saving
The previous sections focus on policies that seek to induce good nancial decision making by mo-

difying consumers' incentives, information, and/or motivations. As an alternative, the government

could simply take these choices out of consumers' hands and save on their behalf. This approach

is widely used: developed economies generally mandate participation in public pension programs,




                                                 86
which exist side-by-side with opportunities for private saving. An important branch of the literature

explores the design of these programs.

       When devising a universal system of mandatory saving, it is essential to bear in mind that

the population is highly heterogeneous. Some dimensions of this heterogeneity are unobservable.

People dier with respect to important characteristics that the government cannot directly measure,

such as the degree of susceptibility to the cognitive biases that motivate the mandate. A simple

saving requirement that employs a one-size-ts-all structure treats everyone identically, which is

plainly not ideal. Other dimensions of heterogeneity are observable. Conditioning on measurable

characteristics allows the government to achieve distributional objectives. The literature explores

the ways in which the corrective and distributional aims of mandatory saving programs interact.

       Cremer et al. (2008) study settings in which people earn dierent wages and exhibit diering

degrees of myopia (dened as an assumed discrepancy between the discount rates governing decisions

and normative judgments).
                                   81   They choose labor supply and saving when young, and consume the

returns to saving when old, possibly subject to a liquidity constraint. The government observes and

taxes earnings to nance a public pension benet, which is linear in earned income. At one extreme

(a Bismarckian system), each individual receives the returns to the taxes they paid. At the other

extreme (a Beveridgean system), everyone receives the same benet. The planner's problem is to

determine the size of the program (the tax rate) and the degree of redistribution (the slope of the

linear function relating pension benets to earnings). The authors investigate the manner in which

the prevalence of myopic consumers aects the optimal policy parameters. Numerical simulations

show that, in the absence of liquidity constraints, both the generosity and redistributiveness of the

program increase as myopics become more numerous.                    However, only the rst of those results

survives when liquidity constraints are introduced. The degree to which these results depend on

assumptions about functional forms is unclear.

       A signicant limitation of the Cremer et al. (2008) analysis is that it does not contemplate

the relative merits of addressing the government's objectives through mandatory saving rather

than through the various incentive strategies discussed in the preceding subsections.                    Moser and

de Souza e Sivla (2015) ll this gap by examining a related model that likewise depicts heterogeneity

in earnings as well as in the degree of present focus.
                                                                82   They demonstrate that the optimal policy

oers low-income individuals a one-size-ts-all savings instrument resembling social security.                     In

contrast, it oers high-income individuals a set of policies resembling specialized savings accounts

that accommodate heterogeneous preferences.                The system uses exibility for high earners as a

reward in order to generate the revenues required for redistribution. Moser and Silva conclude that

the design of the existing U.S. system of retirement saving is inecient.

       Other papers explore additional dimensions of the design problem in settings with behavioral

agents.     For instance, Cremer et al. (2009) and Tenhunen and Tuomala (12) allow for nonlinear

lapping generations framework (see also Fehr et al., 2008); Pestieau and Possen (2008) add incentive

problems arising from ex post altruism (rational prodigality, also known as the Samaritan's di-

lemma); and Cremer et al. (2007) examine the political economy of program design. For surveys of

this literature, see Findley and Caliendo (2008) and Cremer and Pestieau (2011).



4.8 Other policies
The preceding discussion of policies targeting saving is by no means complete.                     Here we briey

mention a few other classes of policy levers.

      Some analysts argue that low levels of saving in the U.S. are at least partially attributable to

policies that promote ready access to credit. Easy credit removes a consumer's ability to accumulate

illiquid assets. Consequently, its eects are opposite those of providing commitment opportunities

(see Section 4.3). Laibson (1997) analyzes the eects of access to credit for QHD consumers, limiting

attention to Markov-perfect behavior. He demonstrates that an increased ability to borrow against

otherwise illiquid assets reduces the steady-state capital-output ratio, and causes a substantial

reduction in welfare. He points to the 1980s as a period of rapid expansion in U.S. consumer credit

due to the spread of credit cards and ATM machines, and suggests that these developments may

have undermined self-control.          However, Bernheim et al. (2015b) demonstrate that easier access

to credit can enhance a consumer's ability to self-regulate through personal strategies involving

contingent reward and punishment.             Karlan and Zinman (2010) present empirical evidence that

calls Laibson's conclusions into question. They conducted a eld experiment that expanded access

to costly consumer credit in South Africa, and found that on average the intervention improved

economic self-suciency, intra-household control, community status, and overall optimism.

      Policies aecting the composition of income may also inuence overall rates of saving. Shefrin

and Thaler (1988) argue that the tendency for people to think of their assets and income streams as

belonging to dierent mental accounts, and to associate dierent accounts with dierent purposes,

causes the marginal propensity to consume to dier according to the nature of the resources. As an

example, imagine that people view dividends as spendable income and capital gains as long-term

saving. A policy that induces corporations to reduce their dividend-payout rates will shift investors'

earnings from the former category to the latter, thereby increasing saving under the Shefrin-Thaler

hypothesis. Other policies that change the form and/or timing of cash receipts, such as bonuses

and income tax withholding, may have similar eects. For example, Jones (2012) concludes that

changes in withholding are likely non-neutral.
                                                       83

      To the extent consumers are periodically inattentive to nancial decisions, policies that promote

reminders may also improve their outcomes. Karlan et al. (2016a) provide evidence that reminders

are indeed eective at improving follow-through on intentions to save.                    It is unclear, however,

whether the mechanism involves attention or some form of social pressure (e.g., brow-beating).

      Bernheim (1991) mentions the possibility that governments could also attempt to enhance the

 83
      Jones (2012) attributes these non-neutralities to consumer inertia rather than mental accounting.




                                                            88
salience of saving decisions and the psychological appeal of future-oriented behavior through pro-

motional campaigns. Unfortunately, evidence concerning the eectiveness of these policies is mostly

limited to anecdotes, such as the experience of Japan after World War II. Even so, related evidence

suggests that these types of promotional eorts may be eective. For example, a eld experiment by

Bertrand et al. (2010) shows that non-substantive promotional content, such as including a photo

of an attractive woman, signicantly increases the take-up rate for loan oers. See Sections 2.4 and

3.5 for discussions of how one might evaluate the welfare eects of these types of nudges.




5    Policies Targeting Earnings
Although studies of optimal income taxation constitute one of the oldest and largest literatures in

Public Economics, the eld of BPE has only recently begun to explore these questions. We introduce

a simple model of taxes on earnings in Section 5.1, which we use to study the implications of biases

that intrinsically aect how people trade o labor costs against consumption (Section 5.2), or that

involve misperceptions of the taxes (Section 5.3). The latter biases create important methodological

diculties for standard approaches to optimal income taxationnamely, the mechanism design

approachwhich we discuss in Section 5.4. The existence of perceptual and attentional biases can

also overturn the classical Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) results about the optimal use of commodity

taxes in the presence of nonlinear income taxation, as we explain in Section 5.4.

    We end by applying lessons about income taxation to questions concerning social insurance in

Section 5.6, and by discussing other miscellaneous questions such as tax ling and tax compliance

in Section 5.7.



5.1 A Stylized Model of Income Taxation with Behavioral Consumers
We formulate a behavioral extension of the Sheshinski (1972) model of social insurance, which

simplies the standard mechanism design problem (e.g., Mirrlees 1971; Saez 2001) by assuming

that the tax-transfer schedule is linear.               Farhi and Gabaix (2015) provide a general analysis of

optimal nonlinear income taxation with behavioral agents, and generalize the basic lessons learned

from an analysis of linear income taxation.

    There is a continuum of individuals with diering skill levels                  Î¸,   distributed according to a

probability measure        Âµ.   Type       Î¸   must work     x/Î¸   hours to generate (before-tax) income      x.   The

government imposes a linear tax rate                Ï   on income, which it uses to fund a lump-sum grant           R.
Consumption is therefore            c = (1 â Ï )x + R.       Welfare-relevant choices are governed by the utility

function   V (c, x; Î¸) = v(c â h(x/Î¸)).         In the naturally occurring decision frame, type     Î¸   chooses a level

of earnings   xÎ¸ (Ï )   that may not maximize           V.
                                    R
    The expression       xÌ(Ï ) =       xÎ¸ (Ï )dÂµ represents average earnings, and ÎµxÌ,1âÏ   denotes the elasticity of

average earnings with respect to the net-of-tax-rate. This response reects moral hazard: consumers

work less if they must pay high taxes and/or are provided with a generous social safety net. It is

analogous to moral hazard arising from health insurance (e.g., people buy more medication than




                                                               89
they should, or invest less in staying healthy) and unemployment insurance (e.g., people exert less

eort to maintain or nd employment), and thus the insights from this model apply to those settings

as well.
                                                                                              h0 (xÎ¸ (Ï )/Î¸)
       As in Section 3 on commodity taxation, we dene                           Î³Î¸ :=             1âÏ       â1 as the price-metric measure
bias. Because          xâÎ¸ (Ï ) is a function of the tax-rate Ï ,              so is   Î³Î¸ ,   but we will typically omit the argument

for brevity.

       Because a taxpayer gets to keep the fraction                        (1 â Ï )    of the marginal unit of income, she chooses
                        0
earnings xÎ¸ to satisfy h (xÎ¸ (Ï )/Î¸)                 = 1 â Ï.          Thus, positive         Î³Î¸   means labor supply is too high, and

there are welfare gains from discouraging work. Conversely, negative                                         Î³Î¸   means that labor supply is

too low, and there are welfare gains from encouraging work.

       As before,       Î³Î¸   has a simple interpretation. Because                      h0 (xÎ¸ (Ï ))/Î¸ = (1 â Ï )(1 + Î³Î¸ ), Î³Î¸       measures

the proportionate increase in the income retention rate,                                 1 â Ï,      that would induce a taxpayer who

maximizes welfare,             V,   to choose the same level of labor supply that he chooses in the naturally-

occurring (bias-inducing) frame.

       The policymaker chooses the tax rate                        Ï   to maximize

                                                    Z

by some small amount,                  dÏ .   This variation has the following eects, where                          ÎµÎ¸   denotes a type   Î¸'s

                      Moral hazard
    We can decompose formula (12) into three key terms that determine the optimal marginal tax

rate. As indicated by the labels, one term represents the value of redistribution (or social insurance

more generally): higher tax rates allow for more redistribution from those with high wages/wealth

and therefore low marginal utility of income to those with low wages/wealth and therefore high

marginal utility of income. Another term captures the eects of moral hazard: higher taxes and

therefore higher levels of redistribution disincentivize taxpayers from working.                These two terms

capture the standard economic forces that shape the optimal level of income taxation and social

insurance more generally.

    The third term reects behavioral considerations: it is the gain from counteracting taxpayers'

biases.     When people work too little, increasing the tax rate has the additional cost of reducing

their labor supply even more. When they work too much, increasing the tax rate has the additional

benet of reducing their hours. As in the case of commodity taxes, what matters is not only the

average bias, but also the extent to which those with large biases i) have high marginal utilities of

income (leading the policy maker to care more about their mistakes) and ii) exhibit high elasticities

with respect to the tax.



5.2 Intrinsic biases in the consumption-labor tradeo
We rst discuss consumption-based biases under which people improperly trade o consumption

and laboror, in richer environments, make improper tradeos between multiple dimensions of

consumptionbut correctly understand the tax system. For example, studies such as Kaur et al.

(2015), DellaVigna and Paserman (2005) and Augenblick et al. (2015) suggest that time inconsis-

tency may be present in labor supply.               Incorrect beliefs about returns to labor may also play a

role.

    Building on this literature, Lockwood (2016) observes that present bias has important implica-

tions for optimal income taxation, since labor generates a more immediate cost than the delayed



                                                             91
benets accrued from consuming the earned income. Lockwood (2016) presents a model in which

people maximize        U = Î²c â Ï(l),          where     Î²   is the degree of present focus and   Ï(l) is the cost of labor.
The policymaker believes that they should be maximizing                            V = c â Ï(l);   that is, the normative

criterion corresponds to long-run utility.

    Formulas (12) and (13) are easily adapted to such labor-supply biases. Under present-bias, choi-

ces satisfy   h0 (xâÎ¸ /Î¸)/Î¸ = Î²Î¸ (1 â Ï ).        In the absence of present-bias, they would satisfy            h0 (xâÎ¸ /Î¸)/Î¸ =
(1 â Ï ).   Thus for this particular bias,               Î³Î¸ = Î²Î¸ â 1.      Because consumers under-supply labor, a tax

increase is particularly costly, so the optimal tax rate is lower than in the standard model.

    To see the implications of present bias most clearly, suppose that                        Î²   and that elasticities are

homogeneous. Then formula (13) becomes

                                                     ï£®                                               ï£¹

                                    Moral hazard

The simplied formula shows that the marginal tax rate is increasing in the present bias                            Î².   In fact,

if the taxable earnings elasticity             ÎµxÌ,1âÏ   is suciently high and the present bias      Î²   is suciently low,

then the optimal tax rate           Ï    may be negative.

    Gerritsen (2015) provides more general formulas for an optimal nonlinear income tax rate that

allow for other consumption-based biases.



5.3 Biases induced by tax misperceptions
While there is currently little direct evidence that quasi-hyperbolic discounting or limited self-

control more broadly contribute to misoptimized earnings, a growing literature documents prevalent

confusion, use of heuristics, and inattention in the context of income taxation.

    Formally, for any given             Ï,   suppose people behave as if the tax rate is actually         ÏÌ (Ï, xâÎ¸ , Î¸).   As we

discuss later,   ÏÌ   may depend not only on                 Ï,   but also on factors such as the individual's average tax
                                     â
rate, which varies with her income xÎ¸ . Each taxpayer chooses labor supply to satisfy the rst-order
           0                                             1âÏÌ     Ï âÏÌ
condition h /Î¸ = 1âÏÌ . This condition implies that Î³Î¸ =
                                                         1âÏ â1 = 1âÏ . Substituting Î³Î¸ into formula
(13) yields an expression for the optimal income tax rate as a function of the misperceptions.

    To glean more intuition via a concrete example, suppose consumers underreact to tax rates by

a factor    1 â Ï,    perhaps because the taxes are not always salient, as discussed in Section 3.4. Then

ÏÌ = ÏÏ ,   and equation (12) becomes


                                                                Ï Â¯0                ÏÏ

                                                               Moral hazard
which implies that the optimal tax rate satises


                                                   Ï      1 âCov[v 0 , xÎ¸ ]
                                                      =                      .                                                (14)
                                                  1âÏ   1 â Ï xÌvÌ 0 ÎµxÌ,1âÏ

                                                                      92
Equation (14) formalizes the intuition that moral hazard costs decrease when people underreact to

the income tax, which allows the policymaker to set a higher tax rate and thereby achieve greater

redistribution.

      Next we survey the empirical literature on tax perception biases.
                                                                                 85


Confusion

When surveyed about the key parameters characterizing their federal income tax burdens, such as

their marginal tax rates, taxpayers regularly report values that deviate signicantly from the truth

(Fujii and Hawley, 1988; Blaufus et al., 2013; Gideon, 2014; Rees-Jones and Taubinsky, 2018a).

      Analysis of observational data reveals that knowledge of the tax code varies widely: comparing

across geographic neighborhoods, Chetty et al. (2013) nd signicant dierences in bunching at

the refund-maximizing kink point of the earned income tax credit (EITC) schedule.                      Moreover,

those who move from low-bunching to high bunching neighborhoods increase their EITC refunds,

apparently due to improved information.

      Taxpayers also leave signicant tax benets on the table every tax year through, for example,

failures to claim itemized deductions (Benzarti, 2016) or the EITC (Bhargava and Manoli, 2015).

Attempts to teach the tax code are largely ineective on average, but can work when paired with

expert advice (as in, e.g., Chetty and Saez, 2013).

      Feldman et al. (2016) show that taxpayers also confuse changes in lump-sum transfers with

changes in marginal tax rates. They examine the eect of the Child Tax Credit (CTC), a transfer

given to households that include a child younger than 17 during the calendar year. The age-17 cuto

introduces a discontinuity in the average tax credit received, as a household whose child ages out

on December 31, 2010 could not claim the CTC for 2010, whereas a household whose child ages

out on January 1, 2011 could. Using a regression discontinuity design, the authors nd that the

loss of the CTC is associated with a relative decline in reported wage income of roughly 0.5 percent.

They also show that this eect is not driven by eorts to time earnings strategically. This eect is

notable because the CTC is a lump sum, which means it does not aect incentives to work on the

margin. The income eects generated by the loss of this lump-sum transfer would lead individuals

to work more, not less.

Adoption of heuristics

Liebman and Zeckhauser (2004) describe two heuristics for approximating a convex schedule such

as the US income tax.

      People who use the rst heuristic, ironing, know their average tax rates and assume that taxes

are proportional to income. The forecasted tax at income           x is then given by TÌ (x|xâ , Ï) = A(xâ |Ï)Â·x,
where    xâ   denotes the individual's own income,      Ï   denotes all individual-specic characteristics that
                                              â
determine the applicable tax schedule, and A(x |Ï) denotes the individual's average tax rate. This

 85
      The discussion here borrows from Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018b).
 86
      Although income eects are generally estimated to be small. See, e.g., Gruber and Saez (2002).




                                                         93
heuristic leads to reasonably accurate beliefs about the levels of taxes when considering small

deviations from one's current income.

       Feldman et al. (2013) argue that this rst heuristic potentially accounts for confusion over mar-

ginal tax rates, which they document, and de Bartolome (1995) documents similar responsiveness

to average tax rate shocks in the laboratory . In a survey experiment directly eliciting perceptions

of tax schedules, Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) nd that 43% of US tax lers adopt the ironing

heuristic.

       People who use the second heuristic, spotlighting, know their own marginal tax rates (as well

as their total liabilities), and assume the tax schedule is linear. Using the spotlighting heuristic,

the forecasted tax at income           x   is given by   TÌ (x|xâ , Ï) = T (xâ |Ï) + M T R(xâ |Ï) Â· (x â xâ ),   where

xâ again denotes the individual's own income,               M T R(xâ |Ï) denotes the marginal tax rate at that
income, and        T (xâ |Ï)   denotes the true tax due at that income. Within one's own tax bracket, this

heuristic leads to correct beliefs about the level and slope of the tax schedule. While this heuristic

has received some theoretical attention, Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) nd little experimental

evidence that people adopt it. However, more empirical work on the spotlighting heuristic is needed.

       Signicantly, Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) nd that the ironing heuristic explains most

of the systematic misperceptions of the federal income tax that they document, including unde-

restimation of marginal tax rates. For example, when they estimate the ironing propensity using

only questions about incomes outside of the respondents' own tax brackets, the estimated model

accurately predicts respondents' underestimation of marginal tax rates within their own tax bracket.

       A nuance of formalizing the implications of biases such ironing and spotlighting involves the

interdependence between perceptions and behavior. In the case of ironing, for example, perceived

marginal tax rates depend on one's own average tax rate, which is a function of taxable income,

which in turn depends on how the individual perceives the federal income tax code. This circularity

between perceptions and choices necessitates the application of a solution concept. The simplest

possible solution concept, as formalized by Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a), assumes that beha-

vior and perceptions are in equilibrium: behavior is optimal given the perceptions that follow from

the behavior. In dynamic settings, other possibilities arise, such as supposing that the perception

in period     t   reects the average tax rate (and thus behavior) in period           t â 1.87

Salience Bias

While most of the evidence on tax salience involves commodity taxes, as summarized in Section 3.4,

the core ndings appear to apply to the income tax code as well. Miller and Mumford (2015) examine

a salient and highly visible change to the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC) introduced

in 2003 that, when considered in isolation, increased the subsidization of child and dependent care

administered through the income tax. This policy also interacted with provisions of the existing

Child Tax Credit in a non-salient but osetting manner, in many cases creating an overall reduction

in subsidization. Miller and Mumford demonstrate that taxpayers respond as if they were aware of

  87
       See Ito (2014) for evidence supporting this mechanism for the case of tiered electricity pricing.




                                                             94
the salient incentives and ignorant of the arguably non-salient interactions. The lack of bunching at

kink points (Saez, 2010; Chetty et al., 2011) in the tax schedule could also reect salience bias or the

ironing and spotlighting heuristics discussed above, but there are other conventional explanations,

such as adjustment costs (see Chetty et al., 2011).



5.4 Mechanism design approaches and implementation non-invariance
The growing evidence on perceptual biases violates a core assumption underlying standard optimal

tax analysis: that behavior only depends on the choice set induced by the tax system. According to

this assumption, behavior should not vary across the tax systems that could implement any given

choice set. Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018b) call this assumption implementation invariance, and

explain that it underlies the mechanism design approach to optimal taxation.

   Various studies have used the mechanism design approach to characterize fully exible tax

systems that generate distortions due to taxpayers' private information (see, e.g., Mirrlees, 1971, for

a static model and Golosov et al., 2006, for a review of applications to dynamic models). The classical

optimal income tax problem, as formulated by Mirrlees (1971), allows the policymaker to select an

arbitrarily nonlinear tax schedule, but assumes that taxpayers' skill levels,     Î¸,   are unobservable,

so that the tax can only depend on earned income.         Instead of optimizing over all possible tax

schedules, it is often useful to restate this problem in terms of direct revelation mechanisms: each

individual makes an announcement about his type (which does not have to be truthful), and receives

the consumption and labor bundle specied for that announcement. The optimal direct mechanism

maximizes welfare while satisfying i) the incentive-compatibility constraint that each type must wish

to make a truthful announcement, and ii) the budget-balance constraint that total consumption must

not exceed total before-tax earnings.

   After nding the optimal direct mechanism, the second step is to solve an implementation

problem: select a tax system that creates the same opportunities as the direct mechanism. Typically,

implementation is non-unique in dynamic settings (Golosov et al., 2006).

   Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018b) argue that the existence of perceptual and attentional biases

implies that the implementation invariance assumption cannot hold in practice. Using the ironing

and salience biases as examples, they formalize three implications. First, the presence of these biases

precludes an application of the revelation principle, which is what normally allows the analyst to

separate the task of identifying the optimal direct mechanism from problem of nding a tax system

that implements the mechanism. As a result, the level of welfare attained under the optimal direct

mechanism neither approximates nor bounds the welfare attainable with the optimal tax schedule.

Second, some biases can preclude implementation of the optimal direct mechanism through taxes,

and also preclude mimicking the optimal tax solution with a direct mechanism. Third, the presence

of these biases can mitigate the role of information rentsa central concept in the mechanism design

literatureand consequently yield results resembling those that follow from frameworks in which

information asymmetries play no role, such as the Ramsey approacha point we illustrate next in

Section 5.5.



                                                  95
   Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018b) argue that a more fruitful way forward is to optimize directly

over the available tax instruments, which makes it feasible to account for non-standard responses to

the specic tax instruments under consideration. This method is consistent with a modied version

of the sucient statistics approach, as exemplied by formulas (12) and (13). Farhi and Gabaix

(2015) use this approach to characterize an optimal nonlinear-income tax, generalizing the sucient

statistics formulas of Saez (2001). Because they focus on a nonlinear income tax, their formulas

provide a number of important nuances absent from (12) and (13); for example, that a change

in the top marginal tax rate can aect everyone's perceptions of their tax rates, and thus change

the behavior of low-income consumers, or that the optimal marginal tax rate may be negative for

low-income consumers (but not high-income earners), in contrast to classical results. Such formulas

generalize standard characterizations of the optimal tax rates, which involve conventional statistics

such as elasticities, by adding a behavioral term that involves an empirically implementable price-

metric measure of bias.



5.5 Consumption taxes versus income taxes
Allcott et al. (2018a) revisit a classic question in public economics: whether revenue generation

and redistribution are best achieved through direct taxationi.e., the income taxor indirect

taxatione.g., commodity taxes or capital income taxes.       Their starting point is the Atkinson

and Stiglitz (1976) theorem, which demonstrates that for a broad class of utility functions, the

optimal tax system uses income taxation to achieve all distributional objectives. That is, the use

of dierential commodity taxes to redistribute from rich to poor is suboptimal.

   The logic of the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem is that a tax on (say) some luxury good reduces the

appeal of attaining high earningssince one cannot purchase as much of that goodand thereby

distorts labor supply in the same way as an income tax targeted at the high earners who consume

that good.   It is better to employ an income tax directly, which avoids distorting consumption

choices.

   Key to this reasoning is the assumption that all commodity taxes are fully salient when con-

sumers make the decisions that determine income.        As Allcott et al. (2018a) show, when this

assumption is relaxed, consumer behavior depends not only on actual opportunity sets, but also on

the particular combination of income and commodity taxes that generates those sets.

   A key result of Allcott et al. (2018a) is that the canonical Ramsey-style formulas turn out

to be relevant in the context of non-salient commodity taxes.      Specically, they show that the

optimal commodity tax follows the Diamond (1975) Many-person Ramsey tax rule,with a scaling

adjustment for the degree of inattention. That is, dierential commodity taxes are useful when they

are not fully salient, and their optimal magnitudes follow two intuitive principles that routinely

surface in policy debates: commodity taxes should be lower when the price-elasticity of the taxed

good is higher, and they should higher when the taxed good is more heavily consumed by the rich.

With standard consumers, optimal commodity taxes have these properties only when an optimal

income tax is unavailable.



                                                 96
   This result contributes in an interesting way to the evolution of thinking concerning direct versus

indirect taxation. The Ramsey framework once had a profound impact on Public Economics, but is

now widely discounted because it ignores income taxation. The Allcott et al. (2018a) result shows

that the rejection of the Ramsey framework may have been a premature consequence of rigidly

adhering to the assumption of perfect rationality.



5.6 Social insurance
While we have thus far interpreted   Î¸ in our baseline model as a xed characteristic (earnings ability),
we can also interpret it as the realization of state of nature, as in a social insurance problem.

We briey discuss two important types of social insuranceunemployment insurance and health

insuranceas they relate to the broader themes of this chapter. We refer the reader to the chapters

in the upcoming second volume of this Handbook on behavioral issues in Labor Economics and

Health Economics for further discussion. We also note in passing that social insurance problems

sometimes introduce an additional wrinkle that is not present in optimal tax problems, in that

private markets may also provide options for protection.



Unemployment insurance

In the case of unemployment insurance, moral hazard occurs because insurance diminishes the

returns to searching for a new job and/or reduces incentives to keep a current job (Baily, 1978;

Chetty, 2008). The literature has incorporated three dierent themes from behavioral economics.

Spinnewijn (2015) studies incorrect beliefs about the returns to search (a slope eect) and about

the likelihood of nding a job (a level eect). The former primarily distorts search eort, while

the latter distorts precautionary savings. Spinnewijn (2015) derives a modication of Baily-Chetty

formula that allows for incorrect beliefs, and that is conceptually similar to (13).

   Two other papers have emphasized the role of quasi-hyperbolic discounting and reference-

dependence in job search, while not oering characterizations of optimal policies. DellaVigna and

Paserman (2005) note that workers who are more impatient search less intensively but set lower

reservation wages, and thus the overall eect of impatience on rates of exit from unemployment

is generally unclear. However, the latter eect dominates for exponential agents, while the former

dominates for quasi-hyperbolic agents. They provide evidence for the quasi-hyperbolic discounting

model by showing that measures of impatience are negatively correlated with search eort and the

unemployment exit rate, and are orthogonal to reservation wages.

   DellaVigna et al. (2017) use Hungarian data to study how workers' hazard rates of exiting

unemployment respond to changing benet schedules. They show that the data support a reference-

dependent model in which the reference point is a function of past consumption. They also argue

that the data are most consistent with a model featuring high levels of impatience, which strongly

suggests quasi-hyperbolic discounting.

   Exploring the normative implications of these ndings is a useful next step for future research.

The implications of quasi-hyperbolic discounting accord with the principles discussed in Section



                                                   97
5.2, but the implications of reference dependence are not easily captured by the static frameworks

discussed in this section.



Health insurance

In the case of health insurance, a classic consequence of moral hazard is the over-use of medical

services, which insurance subsidizes. Various behavioral biases may lead patients to further overuse

some medications such as painkillers but underuse others such as statins (Baicker et al., 2015). The

formula for the optimal copay thus features all of the same tradeos introduced in the simple model

studied in Section 5.1. See Baicker et al. (2015) for further details and implications.

   An important issue not studied by Baicker et al. (2015) is that patients may misunderstand the

price of utilization. As Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) show, for example, people misunderstand the

complicated dynamic incentives induced by deductibles and other provisions. With underestimation

of utilization costs, the logic of formula (14), which we developed in the context of income taxation,

would imply that the optimal amount of insurance is lower than with perfectly rational consumers.

However, if people overestimate utilization costs because, for example, they react to spot prices

rather than the eective prices in plans with deductibles, then the logic of formula (14) would imply

that the optimal level of insurance is higher than with perfect rationality. These observations imply

that plan features such as deductibles, which help to reduce moral hazard in classical models, may

have additional eects associated with changing price perceptions, perhaps in a socially benecial

direction.

   Another important topic concerns biases aecting choices of health insurance plans. A growing

body of evidence suggests that people routinely make mistakes at the plan-choice stage (see, e.g.,

Abaluck and Gruber, 2011; Handel, 2013; Handel and Kolstad, 2015; Ericson, 2014; Bhargava et al.,

2017). Handel et al. (2016) explore the implications of these information frictions for the eciency

of competitive insurance markets, and show that the mistakes can sometimes increase welfare by

counteracting adverse selection.   These results can have important implications for the design of

subsides and other government interventions in health insurance markets.



5.7 Other issues
5.7.1   Correcting tax misperceptions

Common complaints that the U.S. tax code is so notoriously complex regularly lead to calls for

simplication. A related question is whether teaching the tax code, as in Chetty and Saez (2013),

might be desirable.

   While the intuitive justication for helping people formulate more informed responses to the

tax code may seem compelling, our discussion of nudges in Section 3.5 suggests that the issue is

more nuanced. If the complexity of the tax code makes people underreact to the the disincentives

that taxes create, then eliminating consumers' mistakes might lead to lower labor supply and an

undesirable reduction in tax revenue.




                                                 98
    An additional consideration is that greater taxpayer competence could aect the progressivity of

the tax burden. Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018a) analyze this possibility formally by simulating

the eects of a hypothetical educational intervention that eliminates reliance on the ironing heuristic.

Using their empirical estimates of the propensity to iron, they calculate the equivalent variation

associated with eliminating misconceptions. Although the propensity to iron does not vary across

the income distribution, it leads to greater underreaction among higher income taxpayers, because

they face a higher discrepancy between the marginal and average tax rates. Thus, an intervention

that eliminated ironing would be equivalent to a tax reform that reduced tax burden on the rich

but not on the poor. In other words, an educational intervention that eliminated misconceptions

about the tax schedule would have a highly regressive impact.

    An analogous theme in recent studies on health insurance is that behavioral biases can improve

market outcomes by combatting adverse selection (Handel, 2013; Handel and Kolstad, 2015; Handel

et al., 2016; Spinnewijn, 2017) or moral hazard (Baicker et al., 2015).



5.7.2      Tax ling and tax compliance

In practice, taxpayersespecially the self-employedhave some control over the taxable income they

report. They can reduce their liabilities either through tax evasion (deliberate misreporting) or tax

avoidance (choices, such as charitable donations, that legally reduces their liabilities).

    The classical compliance model of Allingham and Sandmo (1972) may fail to describe evasion

and avoidance activities accurately for at least four behavioral reasons. First, taxpayers may hold

incorrect beliefs about the likelihood of being audited (Chetty, 2009). Bergolo et al. (2017) provide

suggestive evidence for this proposition by showing that IRS letters that provide information on

audit statistics versus those that do not signicantly aect rm-level tax reporting in Uruguay.

Firms that hold correct beliefs about audit probabilities should disregard the information in these

letters.

    Second, social norms, feelings of duty, and the desire to avoid guilt or shame may motivate

tax compliance above and beyond the threat of audits (Luttmer and Singhal, 2014). For example,

Perez-Truglia and Troina (2016) show that increasing the salience of shame for tax delinquents

signicantly increases their compliance. Dwenger et al. (2016) nd that taxpayers are intrinsically

motivated to comply with a church tax in Germany.

    Third, loss aversion may inuence a taxpayer's motivation to pursue avoidance or evasion. If a

positive balance due at the end of the year feels like a loss, while a negative balance due feels

like a gain, people will be especially likely to engage in avoidance when their balance due is positive.

Rees-Jones (forthcoming) estimates that taxpayers facing a payment on tax day reduce their tax

liability by $34, relative to taxpayers owed a refund.

    Fourth, because some forms of tax avoidance are costly, people may not take full advantage

of opportunities to reduce their tax burdens, and behavioral biases such as procrastination may

amplify this tendency. Benzarti (2016) studies taxpayers' propensities to reduce their tax burdens

by itemizing deductions. A standard revealed preference analysis puts the total cost of ling at $200




                                                  99
billion (â¼1.2% of GDP). However, Benzarti (2016) also provides evidence that much of the implied

cost reects procrastination, arguably from quasi-hyperbolic discounting.



5.7.3     Toward more general welfare criteria

The standard utilitarian criterion used for analyzing the optimal tax system throughout this section

may be inconsistent with the nature of other-regarding preferences and attitudes toward redistribu-

tion among the general population. The literature on social preferences oers a variety of theories

that could in principle inform the construction of more representative social objective functions.

    Saez and Stantcheva (2016) provide a general theory of optimal taxation that is exible enough to

capture more nuanced preferences for redistribution via generalized social marginal welfare weights.

A generalized weight captures the value that society places on increasing a particular individual's

consumption by a unit, but is not necessarily tied to the individual's marginal utility of income, as

are utilitarian weights. Instead, the generalized weights can depend on individual and aggregate

characteristics, some of which result from the tax system itself. These weights allow for alternatives

to utilitarianism such as libertarianism, equality of opportunity, and poverty alleviation. The weig-

hts can also capture nuanced preference such as a disdain for freeloaders who would work absent

means-tested transfers.




6       Concluding Remarks
This chapter has reviewed basic conceptual frameworks for evaluating the welfare eects of public

policies and for optimizing policy design, as well as empirical strategies for implementing these

evaluations, when consumers do not behave in accordance with classical theories. Our discussion

demonstrates the feasibility of extending the methods of public economics to allow for principled,

quantitative policy evaluation under a wide variety of hypotheses about decision making.

    As we have explained, choice-oriented methods of welfare analysis reduce each normative ques-

tion to three basic positive questions:


    â¢   What is the scope of consumers' concerns?


    â¢   Which choices are welfare-relevant (i.e., free from characterization failure)?


    â¢   What is the choice mapping?


In applications, answers to the rst two questions do not always receive as much careful consideration

as warranted. We recommend attending to them as thoroughly as to the third when there is potential

for controversy.

    Choice-oriented formulas for welfare eects and optimal policies follow directly from the answers

one provides to the three preceding questions. Conditional on those answers, neither the formulas nor

the conclusions that ow from them are sensitive to assumptions about the underlying mechanisms.

Thus, despite the aforementioned relationship between normative and positive analysis, welfare



                                                   100
evaluation frequently does not require the type of nely nuanced understanding of mechanisms

commonly sought in studies that pursue purely positive objectives. Normative analysis depends on

these nuances only insofar as they aect answers to the three questions stated above.

       While it is true that psychological mechanisms determine which choices are welfare-relevant,

large classes of mechanisms have essentially the same implications concerning the scope of characte-

rization failure, and hence there is no need to distinguish among them for this purpose. Often, one

can rene the welfare-relevant domain based on general qualitative evidence  for example, accor-

ding to whether the consumer properly understands some feature of a decision problem, rather than

according to precisely how or why she misunderstands it.
                                                                       88   Returning to one of our applications,

one could formulate many cognitive models of underreaction to sales taxes when stores only post

pre-tax prices. However, from a normative perspective, what matters is the existence of underre-

actions (which justies removal of the associated choices from the welfare-relevant domain), rather

than the particular mechanism that produces them.
                                                                 89

       Finally, when conducting normative analysis, we do not require the type of broadly generalizable

understanding of behavior commonly sought in studies that focus on positive questions. For nor-

mative purposes, it does not matter that two disparate behavioral phenomena may share the same

underlying psychological cause, or that an understanding of cognitive mechanisms in one context

may help us anticipate behavior in another. Rather, what matters is the incidence of characteriza-

tion failure and the nature of the choice mapping within the context of interest. Of course, in some

settings one cannot extrapolate the full choice mapping from limited data without adopting a spe-

cic cognitive model. However, better data would in principle render those structural assumptions

superuous. The assumptions of a specic cognitive model are thus best thought of as necessary

compromises in the face of data limitations.

       It follows from the preceding observations that the prevalent mode of analysis in positive beha-

vioral economics, which emphasizes the broad (cross-domain) predictive and/or explanatory power

of parsimonious models that depict specic psychological mechanisms one at a time, may be coun-

terproductive in Behavioral Public Economics.                Robust normative analysis requires a somewhat

dierent mindset.         Focusing on a particular mechanism, rather than a class of mechanisms that

justify a particular welfare-relevant domain while rationalizing a given choice correspondence, can

obfuscate the economic logic behind one's conclusions, as well as their robustness.

       It goes without saying that there are numerous unresolved issues in Behavioral Public Economics.

Below is a brief synopsis of a few open questions that strike us as particularly important.

       Evaluating welfare. Identifying mistaken choices using objective evidence-based criteria is a criti-

cal component of choice-oriented behavioral welfare economics. Skeptics of this paradigm often point

to what they see as weak and sometimes ad hoc justications for particular normative perspectives.

The process of systematizing principles and methods for identifying instances of characterization

mechanisms is needed for policy analysis, and when it is not.

       A parallel point arises in the literature on rational inattention; see the discussion of welfare in Caplin et al.
(2018)..




                                                           101
failure is still in its infancy, and the feasibility of building a parallel empirical apparatus around

the notion of optimization failure remains speculative. Fortunately, creative theoretical approaches

to the problem of identication hold out the promise of signicant progress; see, e.g., Benkert and

Netzer (forthcoming) and Goldin and Reck (2015).             Separately, the Non-comparability Problem

(discussed in Section 2.2.2) potentially limits the applicability of choice-oriented welfare analysis to

settings in which consumers either do not care about the conditions of choice, or only care about

those conditions in well-dened circumstances. New methods that address these limitations would

prove valuable.

      Sin taxes. While it is commonly asserted that smokers overconsume cigarettes because of self-

control problems, under-appreciation of nicotine's addictive properties, or incorrect beliefs about

health risks, there is essentially no direct measurement of this tendency in the smoking domain,

and no domain-specic estimates of the price-metric biases that one would need to implement an

optimal tax formula. The same observation holds for most unhealthy foods and alcohol. There is

also little evidence concerning the ideal level of incentives for physical exercise. This omission is

unfortunate given the growing number of studies that examine various price and non-price levers for

motivating exercise, and that proceed from the presumption that people do not exercise enough. The

economics of optimal exercise incentives is further complicated by the fact that exercise facilities are

often priced far below marginal costs in response to individuals' biases (DellaVigna and Malmendier,

2004; DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2006).

      Policies aecting saving.        We have seen that present focus can have strikingly dierent im-

plications for the optimal treatment of capital income depending on whether it is always on or

intermittently triggered by environmental cues. Yet as far as we know, existing empirical studies

attempt to measure the average degree of present focus, rather than the extent to which it varies

across decisions for a given subject, or the causes of that variation. We have also seen that certain

policy approaches presuppose a demand for commitment. Yet there is almost no direct evidence

concerning the existence or strength of this demand within the context of personal saving (Beshears

et al., 2015, being an important exception).          Finally, we have seen that consumers often fail to

understand all the likely consequences of the various complex nancial decisions that are integral

to life-cycle planning, and that they frequently fail to act on pertinent knowledge even when they

acquire it. Economists have not yet focused on the problem of identifying eective strategies for

overcoming that failure.

      Income taxes. While there is growing evidence that complicated income tax schedules confuse

taxpayers, there is little understanding of how this confusion would evolve with possible income tax

reforms and little quantitative measurement of the type that is necessary to implement optimal tax

formulas. An improved understanding of the sources of confusion can aid with the former challenge.

Moreover, while present-focus can in principle aect labor supply,
                                                                         90   there is little understanding

of what role, if any, it plays in determining individuals' incomes in developed economies, since

the outcomes of many income-determining decisionssuch as what job to takeare delayed. Other

      See, e.g., Kaur et al. (2015).




                                                      102
theoriessuch as the focusing model of Koszegi and Szeidl (2013)might imply excessive work eort

because the benets (e.g., annual salary) may attract more attention than the costs (e.g., required

hours of work each day).         Another unaddressed question is whether people are fully attentive to

income taxes when they make the choices that determine their incomes.                                 Motivated by work on

sales tax salience, one might conjecture that when, for example, choosing which job to take, people

might simply compare before-tax salaries.

       The many open questions and challenges remaining in Behavioral Public Economics are both

conceptually fascinating and practically important.               Beyond being a productive area for further

research, we anticipate that this line of inquiry will generate lasting impact on public policy and

social welfare.




Appendix: Behavioral themes pertaining to saving
Imperfect self-control
The notion that people exercise imperfect self-control resonates with experience and casual em-

piricism.     While the idea is intuitive, formalizations involve conceptual subtleties.                           The literature

provides two broad approaches, one based on the notion of time inconsistency, and another that

posits the existence of internal goods.



Imperfect self-control with time-inconsistent preferences.

One leading school of thought associates imperfect self-control with time-inconsistent preferences

dened over otherwise conventional goods. In the main text, we illustrated this idea through the

example of a consumer, Norma, who chooses salad over pizza for lunch when deciding early in the

morning, but reverses this decision at lunchtime.



Formalizations.          The theory of time-inconsistent preferences originated with Strotz (1955-1956).

Other early contributions claried the appropriate notion of optimal planning within Strotz's fra-

mework (Pollak, 1968), resolved questions about existence (Peleg and Yaari, 1973; Goldman, 1980),

and began to explore applications (Schelling, 1984). The framework gained considerable momentum

in the 1990s based on the work of David Laibson (1997; 1998), who popularized a particular class

of time-inconsistent preferences known as quasi-hyperbolic discounting (QHD, or, more colloquially,

the    Î²Î´   model), which he borrowed from a related experimental literature in psychology (Chung and

Herrnstein, 1961).
                       91   The QHD model encapsulates a desire for immediate gratication, or present

focus, within an elegant and simple framework that departs minimally from standard formulations

of intertemporal preferences, and as a result has become one of the main workhorses of behavioral

economics. That said, the literature has also explored other interesting preference formulations in

the tradition of Strotz, including the possibilities that self-control problems arise only in particular

  91                                                                    PT
       The period-t objective function for a QHD consumer is   ut + Î²    s=t+1   Î´ sât us ,   where   (ut , ..., uT )   represents ow
utility.




                                                        103
states of nature (Bernheim and Rangel, 2004; Dekel and Lipman, 2012), and that consumers apply

dierent rates of discount to the experiences associated with dierent goods (Banerjee and Mullai-

nathan, 2010). The Strotz framework may be particularly descriptive of household decision making,

inasmuch as interpersonal aggregation naturally yields time inconsistency even when individual

household members are time-consistent (Bernheim, 1999; Jackson and Yariv, 2014).



Choice reversals.           One empirical hallmark of time inconsistency is the tendency to make sys-

tematically dierent choices among a xed set of alternatives as the earliest consequences become

more imminent. However, one can often contrive other explanations for these same patterns. To

illustrate, suppose Norma prefers to eat salad when she is happy and pizza (a comfort food) when

she is sad. When lunchtime arrives, she knows her mood and chooses accordingly. Assuming she

is time-consistent and has the opportunity to form a mood-contingent plan, she selects the same

options when making the decision a few hours in advance. Yet when we ask her to choose a single

lunch option at 10am without stating contingencies, she performs an expected value calculation

based on her anticipated mood. It is straightforward to construct examples in which those calcula-

tions systematically favor salad over pizza. In those cases, Norma chooses salad more frequently in

advance than at lunchtime, even though she is time-consistent.



Methods of self-regulation.              For sophisticated consumers  those who understand their own

behavioral tendencies  the more telling hallmarks of time inconsistency involve strategies for exer-

cising self-control. These fall into two broad categories, according to whether they involve externally

enforced commitments or internal methods of self-regulation.

       Analyses of externally enforced commitments originate with Strotz (1955-1956). We discussed

this strategy at some length in the main text (Section 4.3).

       Bernheim et al. (2015c) formalize notions of internal self-regulation through self-punishment

and self-reward. They depict intertemporal choice as a dynamic game played by successive incarna-

tions of a single decision maker with quasi-hyperbolic preferences, and interpret subgame-perfect,

history-dependent equilibrium strategies as methods of exercising self-control through the credible

deployment of contingent punishment and reward.
                                                             92   They explore the nature of optimal internal

self-control, demonstrating that it has a simple and behaviorally plausible structure that is im-

mune to self-renegotiation: in eect, if a consumer fails to meet her personal standard (falls o

the wagon), she responds to her lapse with a temporary binge (gets it out of her system) before

rededicating herself to her original objectives. Their main result demonstrates that, in the presence

of credit constraints, low initial assets can limit self-control, trapping people in poverty, while people

with high initial assets can accumulate indenitely. They also show that external commitments can

undermine internal self-regulation by limiting opportunities for self-reward and self-punishment. We

mentioned these implications in Section 4.3.1.

  92
       In contrast, other studies of quasi-hyperbolic discounting and time inconsistency focus almost exclusively on
Markov-perfect equilibria, which involve no history dependence, and hence cannot capture the phenomenon of con-
tingent self-reinforcement. Exceptions include Laibson (1994) and Benhabib and Bisin (2001).




                                                         104
Normative interpretations.         The most common normative interpretation of the QHD model is

that   Î²<1   represents a cognitive bias. We provided a critique of that perspective in Section 2.2.5.

   An alternative normative interpretation of the QHD model holds that the consumer has a

distinct true preference relation at each moment in time. Laibson et al. (1998) adopt this view

and apply the Pareto criterion (as mentioned in Section 2.2.2). A conceptually problematic feature

of their analysis is the assumption that the date-t self  does not care about past consumption. In

reality, most of us care about our memories of past consumption, but there is no way to elicit those

preferences through choices, inasmuch as date    t0   consumption is xed at all dates   t > t0 .
   Bernheim and Rangel (2009) apply their framework to the QHD model and explore its implica-

tions under various denitions of the welfare-relevant domain. Among other results, they provide a

precise characterization of normative ambiguity when all choices are deemed welfare-relevant.

   Some additional normative issues arise in the context of naive time inconsistency. The choices of

naive consumers depend on two aspects of the decision frame: timing (whether it is contemporaneous

or forward-looking) and transparency. Models of naive choice generally depict an obscure frame

in which the decision maker must infer her future actions, but such models also allow one to deduce

the choices she would make with transparent framing that renders the actual continuation paths,

and hence ultimate consequences, readily apparent. Taking this interpretation literally, one would

rene the welfare-relevant domain by excluding decisions with obscure framing, and retaining only

those with transparent framing.

   That said, caution may be warranted.       Models are simply lenses through which we interpret

and rationalize choice patterns. If we treat a model of naivete as an as-if representation that may

happen to t the choice data rather than as a literal depiction of cognitive processes, the argument

for ignoring supposedly naive choices becomes less compelling. One may then wish to apply the

Bernheim-Rangel framework in an agnostic manner, respecting all choice frames, irrespective of the

model's labeling.



Imperfect self-control with internal goods.

A second important school of thought explains the notion of imperfect self-control by invoking

unconventional internal goods, such as the psychological costs of exercising willpower or of expe-

riencing temptation. Under this view, apparent choice reversals are in fact not reversals at all, but

rather consequences of subtle changes in the available consumption bundles.

   To illustrate, let's return to the example of Norma's lunch choices.       Here we account for her

behavior by positing the existence of a latent psychological good, call it yearning, that depends

on a comparison between the option she chooses and any available alternative that tempts her, and

thereby encapsulates the internal costs of exercising willpower.      When she expresses a preference

for salad rather than pizza two hours before lunchtime, she has in mind a comparison between two

bundles, one consisting of pizza with no yearning, the other consisting of salad with no yearning.

When lunchtime arrives and she examines a menu listing both salad and pizza, the only available

bundles consist of pizza with no yearning and salad with yearning (for pizza). Assuming yearning is




                                                  105
suciently costly, she prefers the rst to the second. A casual observer might make the mistake of

inferring that she is time-inconsistent, choosing salad in advance and pizza in the moment. In fact,

her preferences are entirely consistent, and appearances to the contrary simply reect our inability

to observe internal goods.

   A potential limitation of this approach is that it cannot rationalize certain types of attitudes 

for example, the possibility that, as of 10am, Norma wishes she could get herself to choose salad

at lunchtime even if pizza is on the menu, regardless of how she expects to feel about the choice

once lunchtime arrives. If one takes the view that such intertemporal disagreements are central

to the psychology of self-control, then all theories of time-consistent choice are problematic, even

when they incorporate internal goods.



Externally enforced commitments and internal self-regulation.                Like time inconsistency,

theories with internal goods naturally generate a demand for externally enforced commitments.

Here the purpose of a commitment is to change the nature of the consumption bundles available

in the future. In our example, Norma makes a social commitment to meet a friend at a restaurant

that only serves salad, rather than one that serves both salad and pizza, in order to replace the

options (salad, yearning) and (pizza, no yearning) with the single option (salad, no yearning).

   With time inconsistency, Norma prefers to make a commitment only if it changes her behavior.

In contrast, with internal goods, she may do so even when her behavior is unaected  for example,

when she prefers (salad, no yearning) to (salad, yearning), and prefers (salad, yearning) to (pizza,

no yearning). In that case, her behavior indicates a preference for regulating her behavior through

external rather than internal methods.



Formalizations.     Some economists have attempted to formalize the preceding ideas by modeling

internal goods explicitly, thereby providing explicit psychological microfoundations for the cognitive

processes governing self-control.   This approach originates with Thaler and Shefrin (1981), who

formulated a dual-self  representation of decision making in which behavior reects two separate

motivational systems.   One system operates as a patient forward-looking planner, the other as

a myopic present-focused doer.    In the Thaler-Shefrin framework, the planner is in charge and

controls the impulses of the doer by exercising willpower at a psychological cost. Behavior reects

the planner's time-consistent preferences over bundles that include both conventional goods and

willpower expenditures. The doer's inclinations simply modify an otherwise standard optimization

problem.   Focusing only on the conventional goods, the consumer's choices appear to be menu-

dependent, but that appearance is misleading because it ignores the internal goods. In this setting,

the planner can reduce future willpower costs without encountering resistance from the present-

focused doer by restricting future opportunities. Thus, the model generates a robust demand for

commitment. Subsequent articulations and extensions of this approach include Shefrin and Thaler

(1988) and Fudenberg and Levine (2006).

   A possible criticism of the preceding approach is that its central assumptions concerning cogni-

tion may not be amenable to direct empirical investigation. An alternative strategy is to formulate



                                                 106
the theory entirely in terms of observable choices by dening preferences over menus of conventi-

onal consumption bundles and the options selected from them, rather than over bundles of both

conventional and internal goods. One can think of a preference ordering over menu/consumption

pairs as a reduced form for preferences over the mental states the pairs induce.
                                                                                                93   In Norma's case,

instead of saying she prefers (S , no yearning) to (P , no yearning) to (S , yearning), where                       S   and

P   represent salad and pizza, respectively, we say she prefers           (S, {S})   to   (P, {S, P })   to   (S, {S, P }).
This is the approach taken by Gul and Pesendorfer (2001), who propose a collection of preference

axioms that characterize the following class of utility functions:

                                                                         
                                        U (X, x) = u(x) â max v(y) â v (x) .
                                                               yâX


Here,       X   is the menu and     x   is the chosen option.    One can interpret    u(x)    as the utility derived

from       x,   and   v(x)   as a measure of the extent to which      x   tempts the consumer.           In that case,

maxyâX v(y) â v (x)           represents a temptation penalty, which the consumer incurs when she fails to

choose the most tempting alternative. We mentioned the Gul-Pesendorfer model in Sections 2.2.2

and 4.2. See also Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini (2001; 2009) for a related theory.

         One can potentially criticize the latter approach by questioning the validity of evaluating the

plausibility of preference axioms without theorizing explicitly about the cognitive processes gover-

ning self-control. Arguably, their axioms are reasonable if and only if they are consistent with a

sensible model of process. A second potential criticism concerns the stability of the reduced-form

preferences. To illustrate, compare two scenarios: in the rst, Norma chooses between two restau-

rants, one that serves only salad, and a second that serves salad and pizza; in the second, her

options are limited to a single restaurant, where she must choose upon arrival between two menus,

one listing only salad, the other listing pizza and salad. Both scenarios provide Norma with the

same       (X, x)     options. Yet it seems likely that, in the second scenario, temptation will adhere not

only to the selection of an entree, but also to the choice of a menu. The Gul-Pesendorfer framework

contains no element that could account for the hypothesized dierence in behavior across these

scenarios. In contrast, the doer-planner model can attribute behavioral discrepancies to the length

of the doer's evaluation horizon.



Normative interpretations.                   Taking the Thaler-Shefrin model literally in the spirit of Be-

havioral Revealed Preference, welfare is arguably ambiguous because we can evaluate it from the

perspective of either the planner or the doer. While one could attempt to argue directly that the

doer's preferences are normatively invalid, it is hard to imagine a route to that conclusion involving

empirical evidence and objective criteria.           Alternatively, one can abandon literal interpretations,

treat the doer-planner model as an as-if representation, and apply the Bernheim-Rangel framework.

There are then two ways to proceed.

         One approach is to assume that people actually care about the psychological costs associated

    93
         This same perspective is implicit in standard consumer theory:   one can think of a preference ordering over
bundles of conventionally dened goods as a reduced form for preferences over the mental states the bundles induce.



                                                          107
with phenomena such as yearning and temptation. Because the model implies coherent choices (in

the sense of WARP) over consumption bundles that subsume those internal goods, it delivers (in

principle) an unambiguous welfare criterion, one that coincides with the hypothesized preferences of

the as-if planner. Whether we can implement that criterion empirically is another matter: because

the Thaler-Shefrin model implies that internal goods depend not just on what is chosen but also

on the conditions of choice, it introduces the Non-comparability Problem, which can render welfare

unrecoverable, at least without additional structure (see Section 2.2.2).

   The other approach is to assume that consumers' concerns are limited to conventional goods,

and to treat the internal goods as as-if representations.      Because the model implies inconsistent

choices over conventionally dened consumption bundles, one then arrives at an ambiguous welfare

criterion, one that reects the hypothesized conict between the as-if doer and planner.

   Normative ambiguity seems to disappear in the Gul-Pesendorfer framework, which posits a single

coherent preference ordering over   (X, x) pairs.   We have seen, however, that preferences of this form

also implicate the Non-comparability Problem, which means that welfare is unrecoverable without

additional structure. Moreover, if we interpret this model as a reduced form for preferences over the

mental states those pairs induce, potentially as the result of conicts between opposing motivational

systems, then its use simply obscures the normative ambiguity that exists in the Thaler-Shefrin

framework without resolving it.



Limited nancial competence
Another branch of the literature challenges the notion that the typical consumer makes deliberate

nancial decisions based on an accurate understanding of the relationship between choices and

consequences. Reservations concerning this premise fall into the following categories.



Low nancial literacy.

Many consumers appear to lack the knowledge and skills necessary for sound life-cycle planning.

Early work in this area documented important deciencies in both pertinent factual knowledge

(Bernheim, 1988, 1995, 1998; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004, 2005), for instance concerning pensions

and Social Security, and comprehension of important nancial principles, such as ination, asset

diversication, and compound interest (Bernheim, 1998). Subsequent research on nancial literacy

has corroborated these concerns; for reviews, see Lusardi, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014b. In a few

cases, research has identied specic biases, such as the tendency to underestimate compounding, a

phenomenon known as exponential growth bias (Wagenaar and Sagaria, 1975; Eisenstein and Hoch,

2007; Levy and Taso, 2016; Stango and Zinman, 2009; Almenberg and Gerdes, 2012).

   Financial literacy is strongly correlated with nancial choices such as rates of saving (Bernheim,

1998; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2011).      In principle, these correlations could reect the causal

eect of knowledge, reverse causation (e.g., those who save more have greater incentives to acquire

nancial information), or common causation (e.g., those with nancial interests both save more and

acquire more knowledge).    Unfortunately, it is dicult to identify correlates of nancial literacy



                                                    108
that are independent of tastes, and that inuence behavior only through knowledge.        Financial

education is a potential instrument, but it may aect the motivation to save through channels other

than nancial literacy.   Consequently, while one can use instrumental variables to immunize the

measured correlation against reverse causation, common causation is more problematic. Eorts to

establish causation are therefore not entirely convincing.



Limited reliance on experts and use of planning tools.

Low nancial literacy need not imply poor decision making. In principle, consumers can compen-

sate for gaps in knowledge and analytic skills by relying on nancial professionals, or by employing

appropriate tools, such as planning software and nancial calculators. However, in practice, rela-

tively few consumers deploy these resources. In one survey, a majority of baby boomers reported

relying primarily on parents, relatives, friends, or simply their own judgment, when making nancial

choices, while only 15% said they relied primarily on nancial professionals (Bernheim, 1998; see

also Lusardi, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). Observed correlations between nancial literacy

and behavior, mentioned above, are more troubling in light of these ndings.



The superciality of decision processes.

A large fraction of the population engages in no serious nancial planning, and members of that

same group tend to be low savers (Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007). Instead, households

appear to fall back on simple heuristics and rules of thumb when making critical nancial decisions,

despite (or perhaps because of ) their complexity. In one study (Bernheim, 1994), 62% of respondents

said they formulated savings targets in terms of percentages of income, but nearly three-quarters of

those reported targets that were even multiples of 5%. This pattern was equally prevalent among

those who claimed to have formal nancial plans. Moreover, stated targets were unrelated to critical

economic variables such as earnings growth. Even professional nancial advisors sometimes make

rough-and-ready recommendations, such as maintaining an emergency fund equal to six months of

household income, or saving 20% of gross income (Doyle and Johnson, 1991).



Problematic choices.

Another branch of the literature attempts to document limited nancial competence by identifying

mistakes in decision making.   Early work in this area focused on behavioral patterns that either

seem peculiar, such as the absence of a relationship between age and rates of saving among Japanese

households (Hayashi, 1986), or that experts deem inadvisable, such as low rates of saving (Bernheim,

1993), low enrollment in pension plans that oer generous matches, naive diversication strategies,

and the tendency for employees to invest in their employers' stock (Benartzi and Thaler, 1999, 2001,

2007). More recent work along these lines focuses on evidence of excessive inertia, suggestibility,

and inattention (e.g., Madrian and Shea, 2001; Bernheim et al., 2015a; Karlan et al., 2016b).

   In most of these cases, it is dicult to rule out all taste-based explanations for the observed




                                                109
phenomena (see, for example, Scholz et al., 2006, concerning wealth accumulation). This limitation

has prompted the development of other methods for identifying nancial mistakes; see Section 4.6.2

of the main text.
