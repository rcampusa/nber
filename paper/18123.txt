Tall or Taller, Pretty or Prettier: Is Discrimination Absolute or Relative?

NBER Working Paper No. 18123

JEL No. J71,J78

                                             ABSTRACT

Using several microeconomic data sets from the United States and the Netherlands, and the examples
of height and beauty, this study examines whether: 1) Absolute or relative differences in a characteristic
are what affect labor-market and other outcomes; and 2) The effects of a characteristic change when
all agents acquire more of it—become taller or better-looking. Confronted with a choice among individuals,
decision-makers respond more to absolute than to relative differences among them. Also, an increase
in the mean of a characteristic’s distribution does not alter market responses to differences in it.

   1   Introduction

       The literature on the economics of discrimination is immense, going back at least to

Becker (1957).    While research in the area has mostly been empirical—concerned with

measuring the ceteris paribus impact of an ascriptive characteristic on some economic outcome,

often earnings or wages, a small theoretical literature has made additional fundamental

contributions (see the summaries by Cain 1986; Altonji and Blank 1999). With only one

exception (Fryer and Jackson 2008), however, the theoretical literature appears to have been

unconcerned about how agents form their views of the characteristic against which they

discriminate—how they organize their impressions of the characteristic that in turn affect their

treatment of members of other groups. The lack of concern with this question in the empirical

literature seems to have been complete.

       That the question is generally important seems clear. How do wage differences respond

to differences in height in the work force if new cohorts of workers are taller than their

predecessors? How would earnings differentials that arise from differences in workers’ beauty

be altered if workers generally became better-looking? How does the impact of looks on

electoral success change if the distribution of candidates’ looks changes? Persico et al (2004),

Case and Paxson (2008), Hamermesh and Biddle (1994), Möbius and Rosenblat (2006),

Benjamin and Shapiro (2009) and Berggren et al (2010) have studied the market responses of

these outcomes to differences in the characteristics. None of these studies, nor any other, has

considered the general question of how perceptions of the characteristic affect the outcome. With

Americans, and especially northern Europeans, becoming taller, the treatment of height as an

earnings-enhancing labor-market characteristic may change. To the extent that the distribution




                                               1
of looks is changeable by an increasingly affluent and beauty-obsessed public, how those

possible changes would affect the returns to beauty is also important.

        In this study I examine these issues on a number of data sets covering several different

characteristics and outcomes, with the data coming from the United States and the Netherlands.

In several cases I run a “horse race” between models specifying the characteristic as absolute and

those specifying it as relative—in percentiles. Where possible I estimate the kernel density of

the characteristic and use kernel estimation to obtain a nonparametric representation of its impact

on the outcome, thus obviating spurious results that might arise from the imposition of a

particular functional form on the relationship. Whether there is a general answer—a consistent

way in which agents form the perceptions that affect how a characteristic alters labor- and other

market outcomes—is not clear. But by examining several characteristics in a variety of contexts

I may be able to shed light on the two general questions posed above.

    2   Modeling the Nature of Responses to Personal Characteristics

        Write a general statistical relationship between some characteristic X~f(X) and an

outcome Y as:

(1) Y = g(X) ,

where I ignore the error term and any conditioning variables in a vector Z that might also affect

Y. Throughout I assume that X is solely ascriptive and that the response of Y to it reflects

discrimination. I do not inquire (and, indeed, the literature only very rarely considers) whether

the response of Y to X reflects market discrimination or the productivity-enhancing effects of X.

I follow the literature and assume the former.

        The focus throughout is on ∂Y/∂X and how it changes in response to changes in f(X). In

particular, I first examine:



                                                 2
(2) ∂(∂Y/∂X)/∂σX│μX ,

that is, how the responsiveness of Y to changes in X is altered when there is a mean-preserving

spread in X. The world does not appear to have generated any exogenous shocks on which we

can obtain data that would allow examining this change directly. I thus need to formulate

proxies for the shock in (2) that can capture the change.

          One way to do this is to note that one could estimate a linear (or log-linear) specification

of (1) to obtain (∂Y/∂X), as is standard practice. If a mean-preserving spread in X leaves ∂Y/∂X

unchanged, a re-specification of (1) with X defined as C(X), the centiles of X, would be an

inferior description of g(X) compared to the linear (or log-linear) specification. In other words,

does the relationship g(X) describe the responses of Y to absolute changes in X or to changes in

an agent’s rank in the distribution of X? In the empirical sections, absent the desired exogenous

shocks to f(X), I follow this approach to infer the shape of (2).

          The second issue is the estimation of:

(3) ∂(∂Y/∂X)/∂μX│σX ,

that is, how the responsiveness of Y to X changes when there is a variance-preserving increase in

the mean of X. In this case there are three examples in which shocks unrelated to Y generated

such changes. It is a simple matter either to compare estimates of (1) obtained from times when

μX differs or to examine (1) in the presence of simultaneous exogenous shocks to μX across

groups.

          The difficulty with this entire approach is that g(X) may not be linear, not based on

centiles or any other simple transformation of X, but may instead be some high-powered, non-

monotonic and perhaps even discontinuous function of X. While I cannot solve this difficulty




                                                   3
generally, in some of the examples the distribution of X has sufficient support to allow kernel

estimation of g(X) and thus to enable me to examine these potential problems.

    3   The Impact of Changing Variance of a Characteristic

        In this Section I study the responses in (2) using the example of beauty. I examine how

changes in the distribution of beauty affect the impacts of looks on the success of fund-raisers for

a charity, on retention as a participant in a television game show and on electoral success in a

professional organization.

3.1. The Beauty of Charitable Solicitors

        Landry et al (2006) conducted a field experiment in which solicitors for a charity went

door-to-door seeking funds, with different treatments applied randomly to potential target

households. As part of the experiment the impacts of solicitors’ characteristics, including their

physical attractiveness, BMI and personality traits, were also assessed (separately, not by those

being solicited). In their published study the authors estimated linear regressions over all the

households surveyed, of which over two-thirds contributed nothing. Here I estimate probits

describing whether or not a household contributed, then tobits describing that and the amount

donated. In the first set of estimated equations I use exactly the same variables as Landry et al, a

vector that includes solicitors’ beauty as evaluated by ten raters whose assessments were

normalized and then averaged. (Thus the mean beauty was 0.06, the standard deviation 0.61.1)

In the second set of estimates I replace each male solicitor’s beauty by his percentile in the

distribution of male solicitors’ looks, and similarly for the female solicitors.

        Table 1 presents the estimates of the two sets of equations, with Columns (1) and (3)

containing the estimates that follow Landry et al by including absolute beauty measures,

1
 The mean differs slightly from zero because better-looking solicitors appear to have contacted more households,
and each observation is a household.


                                                       4
Columns (2) and (4) reporting the results with the beauty variables re-specified as percentiles in

the distribution of own-sex beauty. The probit estimates present derivatives showing the impacts

of one-unit increases in the independent variables. The estimated standard errors are clustered

on the solicitors’ identification numbers. As in the original study, male beauty has negative, but

quite insignificant effects, while female beauty has significant and quite large positive impacts.2

(E.g., a one-standard deviation increase in female beauty in this sample raises the probability that

a household contributes to the charity from 0.30 to 0.38.)                     The explanatory power of the

equations containing the absolute measures of beauty exceeds that of the equations containing

percentiles, although the differences are small. In this example using market-wide data there is

some weak evidence that the absolute effects of the relevant characteristic dominate its relative

impacts.

3.2 Beauty in a Dutch Game Show, 2002

         Belot et al (2012) describe a television game show in which groups of five people answer

questions posed by the quizmaster. At the end of the first round of questions the contestant who

earned the most points selects one of the other four group members for expulsion from the group

(and from further participation in the show). Belot et al demonstrate that, holding “productivity”

(questions answered) constant, those contestants who were rated (on a 7 down to 1 scale,

averaged over ten raters) as being worse-looking were more likely to be expelled. Using these

data we can analyze whether the likelihood of expulsion in this round of five players was greater

if being relatively worse-looking had the same effect on the probability of expulsion regardless

of absolute differences in looks among the players.




2
 There is no effect of solicitors’ beauty on the size of the contribution conditional on it being positive. The impact
of female solicitors’ beauty in these data works through its inducements to make some contribution.

                                                          5
       The first column in Table 2 shows the average absolute rating of the beauty of contestants

who did not “win” in the first round of the game and were thus eligible for expulsion. The

average beauty ratings of these players ranged from 5.73 down to 1.70 on the seven-point scale.

Since productivity and/or the “winner’s” preferences for expelling other players may depend on

characteristics other than beauty, I control for each player’s score in the round of questions, a

quadratic in the player’s age, and an indicator of gender.         Column (2) of this table lists

conditional logit estimates of the impact of a one-unit increase in the absolute beauty rating on

the probability of expulsion. Column (3) shows the estimated impact of moving up one in the

ranking of beauty among the four “losers” in the round.

       There is a substantial difference in the explanatory power of the absolute as opposed to

the relative differences in the “losing” contestants’ looks on their likelihood of expulsion. The

pseudo-R2 is noticeably higher in the conditional logits based on the specification of differences

in beauty as absolute. Column (4) presents estimates with both measures (and the controls)

included. A likelihood-ratio test comparing this to the conditional logit in Column (2) yields

χ2(1)=0.62 (p=0.43); the same test compared to the estimates in Column (3) yields χ2(1)=2.66

(p=0.10).   Although not highly significant statistically, the estimates clearly show that the

“losers’” absolute beauty, not their standing in a ranking of beauty, determines how the “winner”

of a round in this game treats them.

       Figure 1 shows the kernel density of the average beauty ratings of the “losing”

contestants in the first round of the game, and Figure 2 presents the kernel estimates of its effects

on the probability of expulsion. The density is slightly right-skewed, due entirely, as the points in

Figure 2 show, to the presence of one outlier whose beauty was one standard deviation above

that of the second best-looking among the 276 “losing” contestants. That this outlier contestant



                                                 6
was expelled from the show explains the strange upturn in the expulsion-beauty kernel estimate

in Figure 2. Ignoring this individual, the kernel estimate implies an especially large penalty to

being very bad-looking, so that it is unsurprising that absolute differences in looks describe the

relationship better than relative differences.

3.3 Economists’ Beauty and AEA Elections, 1966-2004

       Another example that allows examining the roles of absolute position and rank in the

distribution of a characteristic is provided by the data collected and analyzed by Hamermesh

(2006). The looks of each candidate in the 78 elections for office (vice-presidents and members

of the Executive Committee) in the American Economic Association that were held from 1966 to

2004 were rated by a panel of four incoming economics graduate students, with the average for

each rater normalized and then averaged across the four raters. In each four-person election the

two candidates obtaining the most votes from the Association’s membership won the election.

Since candidates’ pictures were mailed out with the ballots, the voters at least had the

opportunity to choose (discriminate?) on the basis of the candidates’ looks. The question is

whether they did, and whether any impact of looks worked through the candidate being among

the better-looking of the four in his/her election, or whether the absolute extent of differences

among the candidates’ looks is what mattered for voters’ electoral choices.

       Column (1) in Table 3 shows the mean, standard deviation and range of the average

ratings of each candidate. That the range of the average beauty ratings is large shows that the

raters were able to make fairly sharp distinctions among the candidates’ looks. Figure 3 presents

the kernel density of the distribution of the average ratings and suggests that the distribution of

the averages (of the four standardized ratings) has an extended right tail.




                                                 7
        As in the previous sub-section, Column (2) of the table shows the conditional logit

estimates of the impact of a one standard-deviation increase in absolute beauty, in this case on

the probability of winning the election; Column (3) shows the estimated impact of a one-unit

increase in the rank of the beauty distribution in the election; and Column (4) includes both of

these variables. Also contained in each equation is a set of controls including, most importantly,

the candidate’s rank in scholarly productivity among the candidates (measured by lifetime

citations in the Social Science Citation Index up to the election year), an indicator of gender and

whether the candidate had previously held or currently holds high public office.3

        The results are qualitatively remarkably similar to those in the previous sub-section.

Again the specification of beauty as absolute describes the outcome better than does the

candidate’s position in the ranking of beauty. The differences are not, however, as large as in the

previous example. Likelihood-ratio tests comparing the conditional logit in Column (4) to the

estimates in Column (2) yields χ2(1)=0.21 (p=0.64); the same test compared to the estimates in

Column (3) yields χ2(1)=1.64 (p=0.20).

        That the results indicate that voters respond to absolute differences in the candidates’

looks is also suggested by the kernel estimates shown in Figure 4.                            The response is

monotonically increasing over the entire range of the average beauty ratings. It is especially

strong, however, as a response to increases in beauty as one approaches the upper tail of looks.

This result suggests that here too, and more generally than is possible in the conditional logits,

absolute beauty rather than relative position in the distribution of looks determined the outcome.




3
 Estimates of these equations that did not include these controls, and other estimates that include the share of
citations instead of the rank in this measure, yield the same conclusions about the relative importance of absolute
and relative differences in beauty.

                                                        8
        4    The Impact of a Variance-Preserving Increase in a Characteristic’s Mean

        In this Section I examine three natural experiments that allow inferring the impact of an

increase in the average of some characteristic that occurs without any change in its variance. I

use these to examine whether and how the agents’ treatment changes in order to estimate the

cross-partial derivative in (3). The first experiment—a change in height in a population—

occurred naturally over a period of several decades. The other two—differences in average

beauty across small groups of people—were generated by apparently random mixing of the

individuals to form those groups.

        4.1 The Increasing Height of Dutch Men, 1981-2010

        Two striking facts stand out about international differences in the distributions of human

heights over time: 1) During the first half of the 20th century American males were the tallest in

the world; 2) In the early 21st century Dutch males are the world’s tallest; and American men

have fallen (actually, gained only very slightly in height) far behind their counterparts in most

northern European countries.4 To examine how this striking change altered the relation between

earnings and height in the labor market we use two Dutch data sets that allow us to study this

question.    The focus on the Netherlands is due to the availability of data and to the unusually

large and rapid shift in the distribution of heights that occurred there.5

        In this sub-section I use Dutch data for 1981-82, 1995 and 1996, and 2006-2010 from

two sources: 1) The POLS (Permanent Onderzoek Leefsituatie), a household survey from which

data are available beginning in 1981, which continued to collect earnings data through the mid-



4

 We restrict the analysis here to men to avoid concerns about the changing labor force participation of Dutch
women. Suffice it to note, however, that Dutch women’s heights in these samples also rose significantly and sharply
over these periods.

                                                        9
1990s and which also included anthropometric data. Here I use the first two years of the POLS,

1981-82, which like later years only presented data on height in five-centimeter categories. I also

merge the 1995 and 1996 POLS data to enlarge the sample for the middle of this nearly thirty-

year time period; and 2) The DNB Household Survey, a panel study begun in 1993 and

continuing through today. I use data from the 1995 wave, to match the POLS data for that period,

and independent observations from the most recent waves of the DNB panel, 2006-10. The

samples are restricted to men who are at least 150 cm tall and who are between the ages of 25

and 59 inclusive. 6

        Some evidence on the startling change in Dutch men’s heights is provided in Table 4,

which presents summary statistics for men 25-59 from the POLS and the DNB for each of the

three periods, 1981-82, 1995-96 and 2006-10. Over this period the average heights of men in

this age group increased by a highly statistically significant 4.3 cm (1.7 inches), an increase in

the median height over this period to what would have been about the 75th percentile of Dutch

men’s heights in 1981-82. It is also worth noting that the means for the two different samples in

the mid-1990s are very similar (although the DNB estimate is statistically significantly above the

POLS estimate).

        The variances are nearly the same in both POLS samples; they are also identical, but

lower, in both DNB samples. It is thus fairly likely that that the variance in men’s heights did

not increase over this period. Assuming that all the information is correct (and the fact that

average heights in both 1990s samples are quite similar is encouraging), comparing the 1981-82



6
 In the four years of the POLS that are used here this restriction excludes seven men. It excludes seven men from the
DNB in 1995, and one man from the DNB in 2010. I supplement the 2010 sample going backward through 2006
with men who did not appear in the 2010 wave. No individual appears more than once in the 2006-10 sub-sample
that we use here. Of the 872 men used in that sub-sample, 449 are observed in 2010, 136 in 2009, 83 in 2008, 109
in 2007 and 95 in 2006.


                                                        10
POLS to the 2006-10 DNB we can conclude that the assumption of a constant variance is

reasonable.7

        To examine the earnings-height relationship I estimate log-(annual) earnings regressions,

controlling for vectors of indicators of educational attainment, a quadratic in age, and marital

status, with the results presented in Table 5. The estimates for both samples from the mid-1990s

are nearly identical. Also, they are remarkably similar to those for 1981-82—there was very

little change in the earnings-height relationship in the POLS data between the early 1980s and

the mid-1990s. As a comparison of the two set of results using the DNB data shows, however,

the strong relationship observed in the mid-1990s had become smaller by 2010 (although not

significantly so due to the larger standard error on the estimate for 2006-10). The earnings-

height elasticity dropped from 0.85 to 0.30 in these data over this period.                  With a linear

specification the evidence suggests that the variance-preserving increase in men’s heights in the

Netherlands sharply reduced the impact of height on earnings.

        Is the linear specification correct, however? Because information on height was provided

in five-centimeter ranges in the POLS data, there are insufficient support points in those data to

present meaningful kernel densities and estimates. There are sufficient support points in the

DNB data, and Figure 5 shows the kernel density of the height measure in the 1995 DNB

sample. Comparing it to Figure 6, which presents the kernel density for these data for 2006-10,

the densities are shaped fairly similarly, with the 2006-10 density shifted rightward, as is also

suggested by a comparison of the means and standard deviations in Table 4.                       The kernel

estimates of the log-earnings-height relationship for the mid-1990s, shown in Figure 7, do not

look at all like those shown in Figure 8 for 2006-10. In the recent period the relationship rises up


7
 We can reject the hypothesis that the means of the two distributions are the same (t=23.54). Given the sample
sizes, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the variance of the distribution was unchanged over this period.

                                                     11
to just short of 180 cm—below the mean height, falling thereafter over most of the density in the

rest of the range.      In the mid-1990s the relationship was increasing much further up the

distribution of heights.

        Without any further considerations the results suggest that an increase in the mean of the

distribution of this characteristic reduced the cross-partial derivative in (3). It is, however, worth

noting that the earnings-height relationship weakened in the most recent sample because it turned

flat or even slightly negative at a height slightly above a level that in the early 1980s would have

been just above the mean. One explanation for the change might be that in 2006-10 we are

observing a market that had not yet adjusted to the long-run equilibrium. It seems likely that

employers, presumably those making decisions that led to an earnings-height relationship in

2006-10, were older (and thus shorter) than the average Dutch male ages 25-59. If they did not

perceive, or at least did not react to differences in height among potential workers who are

substantially taller than they, we would observe an earnings-height relationship shaped exactly

like that shown in the kernel estimation shown in Figure 8.

        To examine this possibility I separated the 2006-10 DNB sample into sub-samples of

workers age 25-42 and ages 43-59 and re-estimated the equation for which results were shown in

the last column of Table 5. Of course, the men in the sub-sample of older workers are shorter

than those in the younger sub-sample (181.05 cm vs. 184.28 cm), and, indeed, the variance is

higher in the younger sub-sample. The crucial thing to note is that the parameter estimate of the

impact of height on log-earnings in the older sub-sample is 0.0049, nearly identical to the

estimates shown in Table 5 for the mid-1990s for all men ages 25-59.8 Among workers in the

younger sub-sample the estimated impact of height on log-earnings is -0.0039 in 2006-10.

8
 Re-estimating the model for the DNB 1995 sample only on workers ages 29 through 45 (presumably a random
sample of those who would reach 43 through 59 in 2009, the average year in which members of the 2006-10 sample
were observed), the estimated impact of height is even larger than it was for this cohort in 2009.

                                                     12
Apparently the market only rewarded the height of older workers, those whose distribution of

heights matched more closely that of the people who were likely to have been their employers

than did the right-shifted distribution of the heights of younger workers.

 4.2 Varying Average Beauty in the Dutch Game Show and the AEA Elections

       The winner’s decision about whom to “send away” in the Dutch game show and the

results of the four-person elections for office in the American Economic Association analyzed in

Sections 3.2 and 3.3 provide natural experiments for inferring how a one-unit increase in a

characteristic, in this case beauty, alters an outcome when the characteristic’s mean changes.

Columns (1) and (3) of Table 6 indicate that there is substantial variation in the average looks of

“losing” contestants across games and of candidates across elections. In the game show the

range of average looks is nearly five times the standard deviation of the averages, and the range

of average looks in the AEA elections is also roughly that relatively large.

       I assume that the average looks of participants in an individual game are independent of

the outcomes. Indeed, one might imagine that, if anything, the television producers who

considered the issue would attempt to keep the averages as close as possible in order to maintain

audience interest in the game. That consideration suggests that any inter-game differences in the

mean of looks are unplanned. The average looks of candidates in a particular AEA election are

almost certainly exogenous: It is difficult to believe that the AEA’s Nominating Committee,

which selects the candidates, chooses sets of especially good- or bad-looking candidates to match

up in a particular election in order to affect the outcome or generate additional voter interest in

the process.

       I expand the equations whose estimation underlay the results shown in Tables 2 and 3 to

include interactions of the average looks of the candidates in the game or election with the



                                                13
individual participant’s or candidate’s looks. The focus is on the interaction term—does the

impact of a given difference in the looks of candidates change when the average looks in the

game or election change?9 The same controls as before are included, so that only the addition of

the interaction terms distinguishes the results of estimating these equations from the results

reported in Columns (2) of Tables 2 and 3.

        As the estimates in Columns (2) and (4) of Table 6 show, the impacts of differences in

beauty on the probability of being “sent away” are somewhat smaller when the average beauty in

a game increases. The interaction term is, however, statistically insignificant (t=0.92). The

impact of individual beauty on the probability of election in the AEA is slightly larger when the

average candidate is better looking. The change is, however, also quite insignificant statistically

(t=0.51) and substantively very minor. The appropriate inference from these results is that, if all

the participants’ or candidates’ beauty increases by the same amount, the impacts of differences

in their looks remain unaltered. A change in the mean beauty among the choices facing agents

does not change the impact of differences in beauty among those choices.

5   Inferences and Conclusions

        We have examined two distinct variations on the usual specifications of models

measuring the impacts of personal characteristics that can be viewed as eliciting discriminatory

responses by other agents in markets: 1) Whether the responses stem from agents comparing

absolute or relative differences in others’ characteristics; and 2) Whether changes in the average

of a characteristic shared by agents who may be discriminated against affect the responses of the

discriminating agents to the remaining differences. The differences between the ability of

absolute and relative differences in the characteristic to characterize behavior were not large, but


9
 Since the average probability of being sent away is always 0.25, and that of election is always 0.5, the main effect
of average looks in a game or an election cannot be included in the specification of the conditional logits.

                                                        14
absolute differences in the characteristic consistently described agents’ discriminatory responses

better than did relative differences. On the second question the results are somewhat ambiguous,

although the evidence does indicate that responses to remaining differences are not changed

when the average of a characteristic increases.

        I have shown that, in the context of choices that discriminating agents make between

well-defined small sets of individuals among whom they make simultaneous distinctions, i.e., in

the studies of the impacts of beauty, the conclusions are unambiguous. The results suggest that

the nature of responses to differences in ascriptive characteristics is discernible when we can

examine the explicit comparisons that discriminating agents make among those against whom

they discriminate. So too, the effects are fairly well determined when the distribution of a

characteristic shifts with no change in its variance.

        Is there any way to distinguish between the alternatives in these two questions in the

more interesting context of labor markets generally rather than in the narrower contexts of

charitable solicitations, a game show, elections in a professional organization or the unusually

large and rapid increases in height that occurred in one country? Studies based on secondary

data describing large national random samples of workers cannot make the required distinctions,

as a number of attempts not reported here demonstrate.10 One possibility would be to construct

audit studies in which the characteristics of various lists of job applicants are manipulated to

allow inferences about these two issues.11 Another alternative would be to create laboratory



10
  I examined the impacts of absolute and relative rankings of heights on earnings in the Dutch data and the
American Time Use Survey, with nearly identical results for specifications of height as absolute or relative.
Similarly ambiguous results were produced for the impact of beauty on earnings in recent German data, and for
estimates of the impact of immigrants’ skin color on earnings (using data on skin color previously used by Hersch
2008).
11
 See, however, Heckman (1998) for a discussion of audit studies and some of their difficulties. Despite concerns
about whether asking businesspeople to spend time evaluating resumés of phony applicants is even ethical, there

                                                       15
experiments in which groups of agents with appropriately manipulated different characteristics

confront other “buying” agents (although the generalizability of any results would be

questionable). Yet a third possibility would be econometric case studies of promotion choices

(tournaments) in which small numbers of candidates who differ along one of the dimensions

analyzed here are included. Overall, given the importance of such characteristics in determining

labor-market outcomes, it would be worthwhile to understand more about how the structure of

differences and changes in these characteristics alter individuals’ labor-market success.




seems to be no shortage of researchers willing to undertake this type of study, and it is approved by the U.S. federal
government.
