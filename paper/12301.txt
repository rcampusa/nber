                                            ABSTRACT

        The goal of this paper is to identify key issues concerning the nature of competition in health
care markets and its impacts on quality and social welfare and to identify pertinent findings from the
theoretical and empirical literature on this topic. The theoretical literature in economics on
competition and quality, the theoretical literature in health economics on this topic, and the empirical
findings on competition and quality in health care markets are surveyed and their findings assessed.
        Theory is clear that competition increases quality and improves consumer welfare when
prices are regulated (for prices above marginal cost), although the impacts on social welfare are
ambiguous. When firms set both price and quality, both the positive and normative impacts of
competition are ambiguous. The body of empirical work in this area is growing rapidly. At present
it consists entirely of work on hospital markets. The bulk of the empirical evidence for Medicare
patients shows that quality is higher in more competitive markets. The empirical results for privately
insured patients are mixed across studies.

will depend on its relative impacts on firms’ price and
quality elasticities of demand. Future research can
focus on trying to recover estimates of these key ele-
ments. Additionally, studies of price regulated mar-
kets can refer back to theory to specify econometric
models that include the regulated price and marginal
cost (or its determinants). These sorts of studies will
allow for more precise positive analysis of the impact
of competition on quality in health care.
   We need more detailed models, however, in order
to perform normative analysis. Thus, an important,
although formidable task, for future work is to pursue
the estimation of more complete econometric models
of quality determination in health care markets. This
means trying to recover preferences and costs (i.e.,
demand and supply). The benefit of this approach is
the ability to make clearer inferences about welfare,
since estimates of preference and cost parameters are
in hand. The drawback is that such estimates are
not easily obtained. In particular, they usually can
only be obtained at the cost of making untestable
assumptions. The quantity, and detail, of health care
data may make some of the assumptions employed in
settings with sparser data unnecessary, however.
