Consumption Risk and the Cost of Equity Capital
Ravi Jagannathan and Yong Wang
NBER Working Paper No. 11026
January 2005
JEL No. G12

                                            ABSTRACT

We demonstrate, using data for the period 1954-2003, that differences in exposure to consumption

risk explains cross sectional differences in average excess returns (cost of equity capital) across the

25 benchmark equity portfolios constructed by Fama and French (1993). We use yearly returns on

stocks to take into account well documented within year deterministic seasonal patterns in returns,

measurement errors in the consumption data, and possible slow adjustment of consumption to

changes in wealth due to habit and prior commitments. Consumption during the fourth quarter is

likely to have a larger discretionary component. Further, given the availability of more leisure time

during the holiday season and the ending of the tax year in December, investors are more likely to

review their asset holdings and make trading decisions during the fourth quarter. We therefore match

the growth rate in the fourth quarter consumption from one year to the next with the corresponding

calendar year return when computing the latter's exposure to consumption risk. We find strong

support for our consumption risk model specification in the data.

1       Introduction
There is general agreement in the literature that the cost of equity capital, i.e., the
expected return on stocks, varies across diﬀerent types of firms in a systematic way.
For example, investors appear to require a lower return on average for investing
in growth firms when compared to value firms, and a higher return for investing in
smaller firms when compared to larger firms. A substantial part of the research eﬀort
in finance is directed toward understanding why we would observe such heterogeneity
in expected returns. In an ideal world with perfect capital markets where there are
no arbitrage opportunities, investors would require a higher return on an asset only
if it has a larger exposure to systematic economy wide pervasive risk. According to
standard economic theory 1 , in such a world with rational investors, the covariance
of the return on an asset with aggregate consumption growth, hereafter referred to
as exposure to consumption risk, determines the asset’s systematic risk. Hence, to
the extent that the perfect market assumption is not unreasonable, we should find
growth firms to be engaged in activities that have less exposure to consumption risk
than value firms; and smaller firms to be exposed to higher consumption risk when
compared to larger firms. In this paper we empirically demonstrate that it is indeed
the case. We find that a substantial part of the variation in the historical average
returns across diﬀerent firm types can be explained by diﬀerences in their historical
exposure to consumption risk.
     There are a priori reasons to believe that the support for the standard theory would
be stronger at longer horizons. Brainard, Nelson and Shapiro (1991) recommend
the use of longer horizon returns when examining the relation between consumption
risk and expected returns in order to minimize the eﬀect of measurement errors in
consumption data. Bansal, Ditmar and Lundblat (2004) find that the long run
covariance between consumption and dividends account for a large fraction of the
variation in average returns across commonly studied equity portfolios2 . Parker and
Juliard (2004) examine the data in an ingenious way to minimize the influence of
measurement errors in consumption and possible lagged response of consumption to

     Hansen, Heaton and Li (2004) explore the statistical challenges involved in empiricially exam-
ining the relation between riskiness of cash flows far into the future and expected returns, and
provide a general framework such analysis. Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) find empirical support for
a conditional version of the standard model.

changes in wealth, and conclude that the diﬀerence in returns across assets are due
to diﬀerences in their covariance with consumption growth during the quarter of the
return measurement and several quarters that follow.
    We contribute to this literature by showing that exposure to consumption risk
over a one year horizon can also explain the cross section of stock returns. We obtain
results that are diﬀerent from those reported elsewhere in the literature because we
measure an asset’s exposure to consumption risk over a time interval chosen in such
way as to (a) minimize the eﬀect of transactions costs on an investor’s savings, con-
sumption and investment decisions, and (b) integrate over calendar month seasonal
patterns in stock returns.
    The empirical literature in finance and macro economics document pronounced
calendar month and calendar quarter seasonal eﬀects in stock returns and macro
economic aggregates. For example, Keim (1983) documents that smaller stocks earn
most of their risk adjusted return during the first week of January. Roll (1983) and
Reinganum (1983) find support for the view this may be due to investors selling stocks
to realize losses for tax purposes. Bouman and Jacobsen (2002) find that stocks earn
a higher return during the November through April than other months. Miron and
Beaulieu (1996) find that the seasonal behavior of GDP is dominated by fourth quarter
increases and first quarter declines. They argue that the Christmas demand shift
is an important factor in producing seasonal fluctuations. Braun and Evans (1995)
provide evidence supporting the view that the observed seasonal shifts in aggregate
consumption is more due to seasonal shifts in preferences and not technology. Ait-
Sahalia, Parker and Yogo (2004) point out that consumers have more discretion over
their consumption of luxury goods than essential goods, and consumption of the
former covaries more strongly with stock returns.
    We therefore match calendar year returns with growth rates in fourth quarter
consumption of nondurables and services from one year to another in order to generate
the most support from the data for standard theory. The use of calendar year
returns would avoid the need to explain the January eﬀect, and the sell in May
and go away eﬀects documented in stock returns. Working with longer horizon
attenuates the errors that may arise due to ignoring the eﬀect of habit formation on
preferences3 . Further, fourth quarter consumption may be less subject to habit-like

   3
    Sundaresan (1989), Constantinides (1990), Abel (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999) take
the stand that there are important time variations in eﬀective risk aversion due to habit formation.

behavior induced by the need to commit consumption in advance4 , and more subject
to discretion since investors have more leisure time to review their consumption and
portfolio choice decisions during the holiday season.
    According to the standard theory5 , E(Ri ) ∝ Cov(Ri , gc−γ ), where Cov(.) denotes
the covariance operator, E(.) denotes the expectation operator, Ri is the excess return
over the risk free return on an arbitrarily chosen financial asset, i, gc is the growth in
contemporaneous consumption, and γ is the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion of the
economy’s representative investor. When deviations in the realized values of the con-
sumption growth, gc , from its mean ḡc ,are not large, Cov(Ri , gc−γ ) ' −γCov(Ri , gc ).
In that case E(Ri ) ' λCov(Ri , gc ) where λ denotes the risk premium for bearing
consumption risk. When consumption is measured with error, or when systematic
stochastic variations induce variations in the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient of the
representative agent due to habit, |E(Ri ) − λCov(Ri , gc )| is likely to be smaller than
|E(Ri ) − Cov(Ri , gc−γ )|, since in the latter, errors in gc are likely to be accentuated
since they are raised to the (−γ)0 th power. We therefore follow Breeden (1979) and
Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989), and examine whether Cov(Ri , gc ) can
explain cross sectional variation in E(Ri ) across diﬀerent assets.
    Related Literature
    Several measures of systematic risk have been proposed in the literature for ex-
plaining cross sectional diﬀerences in average returns on financial assets. They can
be grouped into two broad categories. In models belonging to the first category,
commonly referred to as consumption-based asset pricing models, systematic risk is
represented by the sensitivity of the return on an asset to changes in the intertemporal
marginal rates of substitution (IMRS) of a representative investor. Models within
this class diﬀer from one another based on the specification for IMRS as a function of
observable and latent variables6 . The primary appeal of consumption-based models
comes from their simplicity, and their ability to value not only primitive securities
like stocks, but also derivative securities like stock options. The disadvantage is
that the models in this class make use of macro economic factors that are measured
with substantial errors. In the standard consumption-based model, the IMRS of the

   4
     See Chetty and Seidel (2004) who show that consumption commitment will induce habit like
features in the indirect utility function.
   5
     The standard model assumes that there is a representative agent who maximizes expected utility
for lifetime consumption subject to budget constraints; the agent’s intertemporal preferences can
be represented by time separable utility function where the utility for consumption in any period
exhibits constant relative risk aversion.
   6
     See Cochrane (2000) for an excellent review of this extensive literature.

representative investor is a function of only the growth rate in aggregate per capita
consumption. This model has the advantage that its validity can be evaluated using
sample analogues of means, variances and covariances of returns and per capita con-
sumption growth rates without the need for specifying how these moments change
over time in some systematic stochastic fashion. In this paper we will examine a
particular specification of the consumption-based CAPM that assumes that investors
revise their consumption plans infrequently.
    Models in the second category are commonly referred to as portfolio-return-based
models. In these models systematic risk is represented by the sensitivity of the return
on an asset to returns on a small collection of benchmark factor portfolios7 . These
models have the advantage that they make use of factors can be constructed from
market prices of financial assets that are measured relatively more accurately, if only
they are available. In the case of the CAPM and the ICAPM belonging to this
category, the shortcoming is that the aggregate wealth portfolio of all assets in the
economy is not observable and a proxy must be used. The common practice is to
use the return on all exchange traded stocks as a proxy for the market portfolio; but
as Jagannathan and Wang (1996) point out that the stock market forms only a small
part of the total wealth in the economy while human capital forms a much larger part
and the return on that part is not observed. The return on aggregate human capital
has to be inferred from national income and product account numbers, and they
are subject to substantial measurement errors. In contrast, the linear beta pricing
models in this category, need only find a method for identifying factor portfolios that
capture economy wide pervasive risk. Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) show that
factor constructed through principal component analysis of returns on primitive assets
would serve as valid factors. Connor and Korajczyk (1986) develop a fast algorithm
for constructing factors based on principal component analysis of returns on a large
collection of assets. Fama and French (1993) construct factors by taking long and
short positions in two asset classes that earn vastly diﬀerent returns on average. Zhi

   7
    In the standard Sharpe-Lintner CAPM, the benchmark portfolio is the return on the aggregate
wealth portfolio in the economy; in empirical studies of the CAPM the return on a portfolio of all
exchange traded stocks are used as its proxy. Merton (1973) derived an intertemporal version of
the CAPM (ICAPM) showing that the expected return on an asset would in general be a linear
function of its several factor betas, with the return on the market portfolio being one of the factors.
Campbell (1993) identified the other factors in Merton’s ICAPM as those variables that help forecast
the future return on the market portfolio of all assets in the economy. Ross (1976) showed that
Merton’s ICAPM like beta pricing model would obtain even when markets are incomplete provided
returns have a factor structure, and the law of one price was satisfied. Connor (1984) provided
suﬃcient conditions for Ross’ results to obtain in equilibrium.

                                                  4
Da (2004) shows that the Fama and French three factor beta pricing model would
obtain when cash flows of firms have a conditional two factor structure, with the first
factor being the return on a well diversified portfolio and the other two factors being
excess returns on well diversified long-short portfolios.
    The Fama and French (1993) three factor model has become the premier model
within this class. We will therefore use the Fama and French three factor model as
the benchmark for comparing the standard consumption-based model.


2       A consumption-based asset pricing model
We assume that there is a representative investor in the economy with time and state
separable Von Neumann — Morgenstern utility function for lifetime time consumption
from the vantage point of time t given by:
                                       "Ã ∞             !          #
                                         X
                                   E           δ s u(cs )   | Ft                              (1)
                                         s=t

where, cs denotes consumption expenditure over several types of goods during period
s, u(.) denotes a strictly concave period utility function, δ denotes the time discount
factor, and Ft denotes the information set available to the representative agent at time
t. We assume that the representative investor reviews her consumption policy and
portfolio holdings at periodic intervals in time, for some exogenously given reasons8 .
Such reviews take place once every k periods, and at the same point in time for every
investor.
    Consider an arbitrary point in time, t, where the representative investor re-
views her consumption-investment decisions. Such points will occur at times t =
0, k, 2k, 3k, ... i.e., t will be an integral multiple of the decision interval, k. The in-
vestor will choose consumption and investment policies at t, t = 0, k, 2k, 3k, ... so as
to maximize expected life time utility, that gives rise to the following relation that

    8
      Lynch (1996) and Gabaix and Laibson (2001) examine economies where investors make
consumption-investment decisions at diﬀerent but infrequent points in time.       They show that
in such economies aggregate consumption will be much smoother relative to consumption of any
one investor. Marshall and Parekh (1999) examine an economy where infrequent adjustment of
consumption arises endogenously due to transactions costs. They show that the aggregation prop-
erty fails; aggregate consumption does not resemble the optimal consumption path of a hypothetical
representative agent with preferences belonging to the same class as the investors in the economy.
In our economy all agents review their consumption-savings decisions infrequently, but at the same
predetermined points in time. Hence there is a representative investor in our example economy.

               Et Ri,t+j                              = 0, t = 0, k, 2k, ...; j = 1, 2, ...   (2)
                                    u0 (ct )
     In equation (2) given above Ri,t+j denotes the excess return on an arbitrary asset,
i, from date t to t + j; ct+j denotes consumption flow during t + j, u(.) denotes the
period utility function and u0 (.) denotes its first derivative, δ denotes the time discount
factor, and Et [.] denotes the expectation operator based on information available to
the investor at date t. For notational convenience define the stochastic discount
                            δj u0 (c    )
factor (SDF) as mt,t+j ≡ u0 (ct+j    t)
                                          . Substituting this into equation (2) gives:

                                         Et [Ri,t+j mt,t+j ] = 0                              (3)

    In our empirical study we will work with expected returns that can be estimated
using historical averages. Therefore work with the unconditional version of equation
(3), after rewriting it in the more common covariance form given below:


                   Cov[Ri,t+j , mt,t+j ]    V ar[mt,t+j ] [Cov[Ri,t+j , mt,t+j ]
  E[Ri,t+j ] = −                         =−                                      ≡ λm β im,j (4)
                      E[mt,t+j ]             E[mt,t+j ]      V ar[mt,t+j ]

where β im,j , the sensitivity of excess return, Ri,t+j , on asset i to changes in the
stochastic discount factor, mt,t+j , will in general be negative, and the market price
for SDF risk, λm should be strictly negative. When the period utility function
exhibits constant relative risk aversion with the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ,
the stochastic discount factor is given by:
                                                     µ          ¶−γ
                                                 j       ct+j               −γ
                                mt,t+j = δ                            ≡ δj gc,t+j             (5)
                                                          ct
where, gc,t+j is the j period growth in per capita consumption from t to t + j.
Substituting the expression for mt,t+j given by equation (5) into equation (4) and
simplifying gives:



                                  E[Ri,t+j ] = λgγj β igγ,j ,                                 (6)
                                                                         −γ
                                                           Cov(Ri,t+j , gc,t+j )
                            where, β igγ,j =                           −γ           ,
                                                                 V ar(gc,t+j )


                                                           6
and λgγj is a strictly negative constant representing the risk premium for bearing the
           −γ
risk in gc,t+j . For most assets, i, β igγ will be strictly negative.
    Typically consumption growth, gc,t+j , is observed with measurement error, i.e.,
we observe ĝc,t+j = gc,t+j + εg,t+j , where εg,t+j denotes the measurement error in the
growth in consumption from t to t + j. When γ is large, say in the 10 to 20 range,
                             −γ
the percentage error in gc,t+j   will be larger when compared to the percentage error in
gc,t+j . For example, with γ = 20, gc,t+j = 1.04, and εg,t+j = 0.005, ĝc,t+j = 1.0045,
 −γ                     −γ
gc,t+j  = 0.4564, and ĝc,t+j = 0.4146, i.e., a 0.48% measurement error in gc,t+j translates
                                          −γ
into a 9.15% measurement error in gc,t+j       . Since the approximation error is likely to
have a smaller eﬀect than the measurement error, there may be an advantage to
                                                                      −j
working with a first order Taylor approximation of the function, gc,t+j    . We therefore
consider the following linear version of equation (6), generally referred to as the
consumption capital asset pricing model (CCAPM):



                               E[Ri,t+j ] = λgj β igj ,                                 (7)
                                            Cov(Ri,t+j , gc,t+j )
                             where, β igj =                       ,
                                                V ar(gc,t+j )

                V ar(g   )
                      c,t+j
and λgj ' γ 1−γE(gc,t+j    −1)
                               is the market price for consumption risk; note that the
consumption beta for most assets, as well as the market price of consumption risk
will be strictly positive.
    In general, the ratio of the first and second moments of the measurement er-
ror, εg,t+j , to the corresponding moments of gc,t+j will be decreasing in j. Hence
measurement errors in consumption will have less influence on the conclusions when
the return horizon, j, is increased, provided E[Ri,t+j ], and β igj are known constants.
When E[Ri,t+j ], and β igj are not known and have to be estimated using data, increas-
ing the return horizon, j, decreases the precision of those estimates. Ideally we would
like to choose j so as to minimize the eﬀect of measurement errors as well sampling
errors on our conclusions. Given insuﬃcient information to assess how measurement
error and sampling error depend on j, we decided to set the return horizon, j, to equal
the review period, k. We assume that k is a calendar year, i.e., investors review their
consumption and investment decisions in the fourth quarter of every calendar year.
While these choices are somewhat arbitrary, measuring returns over the calendar year
enables us to overcome the need to model and explain well documented within year
deterministic seasonal eﬀects in stock returns.

                                               7
    We examine the specification in equation (7) using the two stage cross sectional
regression (CSR) method of Black, Jensen and Scholes (1972) and Fama and Mac-
Beth (1973). Following Berk (1995) and Jagannathan and Wang (1998), we examine
possible model misspecification by checking whether the coeﬃcient for firm charac-
teristics like book to market ratio and relative market capitalization are significant in
the cross sectional regressions.


3       Data and Empirical Analysis
We assume that time period is measured in quarters. We use annual and quarterly
seasonally adjusted9 aggregate nominal expenditure on consumer nondurables and
services for the period 1954-2003 from National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)
table 2.3.5, and monthly nominal consumption expenditures from NIPA table 2.8.5.
We use population numbers taken from NIPA tables 2.1 and 2.6 and price deflator
series taken from NIPA table 2.3.4 and 2.8.4 to construct the time series of per capita
real consumption figures for use in our empirical work. The returns on the 25 size
and book/market sorted portfolios, the risk free return, and the values for the three
Fama and French (1993) factors for the period 1954-2003 are taken from Kenneth
French’s website. We construct the excess return series on the 25 portfolios from this
data. To check the robustness of our conclusions, we also examine the performance
of the model specifications when time period is measured in months.
    In what follows we will first discuss the results obtained using calendar year excess
returns and growth rate in per capita real consumption in the fourth quarter of a
calendar year from one year to another. Table I gives the summary statistics for
the consumption data we use in the study. Note that the means and the standard
deviation of the four quarter consumption growth rates do not depend much on which
quarter of the year we start with. However, the Max minus the Min is larger for
Q4-Q4 when compared to other quarters, providing support for our conjecture that
Q4 consumption bundle is less subject to rigidity due to prior commitments.
    Table II, panel A shows substantial variation in the average excess returns across
the 25 portfolios. For example, small growth firms had an average excess return of
6.19% per year whereas small value firms earned 17.19% per year over the riskless

    9
    We used seasonally adjusted data since we were unable to obtain seasonally unadjusted data
on consumption deflator. The seasonal adjustment process can be viewed as another source for
measurement error.

rate. The value-growth eﬀect is more pronounced among small firms and the size
eﬀect is more pronounced among value firms. Firms that earn a lower return on
average tend to have smaller consumption betas. Small growth firms which earn the
lowest return on average have a consumption beta of 3.46 whereas small value firms
have a consumption beta of 5.94, i.e., 1.72 times as large. Further, the estimated
consumption betas are statistically significantly diﬀerent from zero. Figure 1 provides
a scatter plot of the mean excess return on the 25 portfolios against their estimated
consumption betas. We find a reasonably linear relation.
    Table III provides the results for the CSR method. When the model is correctly
specified the intercept term should be zero, i.e., assets with zero consumption beta
should earn zero risk premium. The intercept is 0.14% per year, which is not sta-
tistically significantly diﬀerent from zero after taking sampling errors into account.
The slope coeﬃcient is significantly positive consistent with the view that consump-
tion risk carries a positive risk premium. There is some evidence that the model is
misspecified; when log book to market ratio is introduced as an additional variable in
the cross sectional regression, its slope coeﬃcient is significantly diﬀerent from zero.
Notice however that a similar phenomenon occurs with the Fama and French three
factor model as well. When log size and log book to market ratio are added as ad-
ditional explanatory variables in the Fama and French three factor model, they take
away the statistical significance of the slope coeﬃcients for the three risk factors10 .
The point estimate of the intercept term for the Fama and French 3 factor model is
10.43% per year, which is a rather large value for the expected return on a zero beta
asset when compared to the risk premium of 5.83% per year for the HML factor risk.
Figure 2 gives plots of the realized average excess returns against what they should be
according to each of the three fitted models. Notice that while the points are about
evenly distributed around the 45 degree line for the CCAPM specification, there is
a U-shaped pattern for the Fama and French three factor model; assets with both
high and low expected returns according to the model tend to earn more on average.
    In order to compare the two models further, we also estimated them after imposing
the restriction that the intercept term in the cross sectional regression equation, λ0 ,
is zero. The results are given in Table IV. The estimated value of the consumption
risk premium for the restricted model is 2.59, not much diﬀerent from the estimate
of 2.56 obtained using the unrestricted model. The cross sectional R-Squares for

    In contrast, Jagannathan, Kubota and Takehara (1998) find that the book to market ratio is
not significant when added as an additional variable in the Fama and French three factor model.

the consumption risk model and the Fama and French three factor model for the
restricted model are the same, 73%. The estimated risk premiums for the HML and
the SMB factors do not change much when the restriction that the intercept term in
the cross sectional regression equation is zero. However, the estimated risk premium
for the stock market factor changes substantially; it increases to 9.71% per year from
-3.26% per year, which is consistent with a flat relation between market factor beta
and average return in the sample.
    Let αi = E(Ri ) − λ0 − λ0 β i denote the model pricing error, i.e., the diﬀerence
between the expected return on asset i and the expected return assigned to it by the
asset pricing model. Let λ̂0 and λ̂ denote estimates obtained using the unrestricted
models and λ̃ denote the estimates obtained with the restriction that λ0 = 0. Define
                                                                             0
the corresponding estimated values for the alphas as α̂i ≡ E(Ri ) − λ̂0 − λ̂ β̂ i , and α̃i ≡
            0
E(Ri ) − λ̃ β̂ i . Table V gives the pricing errors for the constrained and unconstrained
models. For the CCAPM the average value of |α̂i | is 1.41% per year and the maximum
value of |α̂i | is 3.45% per year. These values do not change when the intercept term
in the cross sectional regressions are restricted to be zero. The average value of |α̂i |
is 1.09% per year, and the maximum value of α̂i , however, is 2.73% for the Fama and
French three factor model, a substantial improvement over the CCAPM.
    When the intercept term is constrained to be zero, however, the maximum value
of α̃i for Fama and French three factor model increases to 3.30% per year, not much
diﬀerent from the corresponding value for the CCAPM model. While the Fama and
French model does better on average, for the most mispriced asset, both models are
about equally good or bad. The average value of alpha does not comedown when the
two models are combined, suggesting that both models may be capturing the same
types of economy wide pervasive risks, to a large extent. Table VI gives the model
misspecification measure, pricing error for the most mispriced portfolio, suggested by
Hansen and Jagannathan (1997). That measure is smaller for the CCAPM than for
the Fama and French three factor model. On balance, it therefore appears that there
is fairly strong empirical support for the consumption risk model.
    Implied Coeﬃcient of Relative Risk Aversion
    Consider the slope coeﬃcient, λ1 , in the cross sectional regression equation given
by:

                               Ri,t+4 = λ0 + λ1 β i,gc + εi,t+4

   If the standard consumption-based asset pricing model holds, the intercept, λ0 = 0

and the slope coeﬃcient, λ1 =    1−γ[E(gc,t+4 )−1]
                                                      γ denotes the coeﬃcient of rela-

tive risk aversion. The estimated slope coeﬃcient, λ  b1 = 2.56, therefore corresponds
to an implied coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion of 31 when the model is correctly
specified. The large estimate for the risk aversion parameter of the representative
investor on the one hand and the ability of the CCAPM to explain the cross section
of stock returns well on the other hand is consistent with the explanation given by
Constantinides and Duﬃe (1996) and Heaton and Lucas (2000). It is also consistent
with the specification suggested by Campbell and Cochrane (1999). For example,
suppose the period utility function is given by Abel’s external habit model, i.e., the
period utility function is given by, u(Ct − Xt ), Ct denotes the date t consumption
as before, and Xt represents external habit level that the consumer uses as reference
point. In that case, as Campbell and Cochrane (1999) show, the stochastic discount
factor that assigns zero value to an excess return is given by:
                                           µ               ¶−γ
                                               St+k Ct+k
                                mt,t+k =                                            (8)

                     t
                       , denotes the surplus consumption ratio. We can approximate
mt,t+k given above around St = St+k and Ct = Ct+k using Taylor series to get:

                              µ       ∙                         ¸¶
                                        St+k − St Ct+k − Ct
                   mt,t+k   '   1−γ                +                                (9)
                                            St            Ct
                            = (1 − γ [(gs,t+k − 1) + (gc,t+k − 1)])

where gs,t+k and gc,t+k are the growth in surplus consumption ratio and consumption
respectively, from date t to date t + k. Substituting the above expression for mt,t+1
into equation (3) and simplifying gives:



             E[Ri,t+k ] = λc β ic + λs β is                                        (10)
                          Cov(Ri,t+k , gc,t+k )          Cov(Ri,t+k , gs,t+k )
            where, β ic =                       ; β is =                       ,
                               V ar(gc,t+k )               V ar(gs,t+k )

with λs and λc being the risk premium for bearing the risk associated with surplus
consumption ratio growth and consumption growth respectively. In general St will
be a stationary random variable, whereas Ct will be growing. This can be seen
from the fact that St = CtC−X

                              t
                                , and Xt will be some average of past consumptions,

                                                          V ar(g   )
and extreme case of which will be, Xt = Ct−1 . Hence V ar(gs,t+kc,t+k )
                                                                        will become small as
k becomes large. The rather large implied value for the coeﬃcient of relative risk
aversion indicates that setting k to 4 quarters may be due to ignoring the eﬀect due
to St+kSt−St . The high cross sectional R-Square, on the other hand, indicates that the
eﬀect due to possible omission of St+kSt−St is likely to be the same for all the portfolios.
    Alternative model specifications
    Table VII gives the results when we use the monthly consumption data and mea-
sure the annual growth rate in consumption from December of one year to December
of the following year. To the extent monthly consumption is measured less precisely,
we should expect the performance to worsen when compared to our earlier specifica-
tion. That is what we find. The cross sectional R-Square drops from 71% to 38%;
and the intercept term becomes larger in absolute value, though still not statistically
diﬀerent from zero.
    We take the stand that all investors review their consumption investment decisions
during the last quarter of the calendar year. They may also review at other points
in time, but such reviews may not occur during the same period for all individuals.
Given this view, we would expect to find most support for the CCAPM when matching
consumption growth from the fourth quarter of one calendar year to the next with
asset returns for the corresponding period. We would expect less support when
we examine consumption growth from one month to another, or from one quarter
to another, or from one year to another. We would also expect less support for
the CCAPM when we examine the growth in consumption from the last month of a
calendar quarter to the last month in the calendar quarter that follows. As can be
seen from the figures reported in Table VIII, that is exactly what we find.
    Table IX gives the results when we measure annual consumption growth starting
from other than the 4th quarter in a year. Notice that the consumption betas of
small growth and small value firms are closer to each other when consumption growth
is measured from Q1-Q1, or Q2-Q2, or Q3-Q3. The cross sectional R-Squares drop
substantially, to as low as 14% when consumption growth is measured from Q2 on
one year to Q2 of the next year. The estimated intercepts are large and significantly
diﬀerent from zero. Given the sequence, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2,..., in which
calendar quarters occur over time, Q2 is the farthest from quarter Q4. Hence, we
should expect the empirical support for the CCAPM to be weakest when we match
consumption growth in quarter 2 in one year to another with asset returns for the
corresponding period. Our findings are consistent with this view.


                                            12
    In deriving our consumption based asset pricing model specification we assumed
that all investors revise their consumption decision at the same time. As Lynch (1996)
and Gabaix and Laibson (2001) show, when investors review their consumption-
investment plans infrequently, but at diﬀerent points in time, aggregate consumption
will exhibit substantially less variability than individual consumption. In that case,
while the linear relation between expected return and consumption covariance will
hold approximately, the implied risk aversion coeﬃcient will be much larger.
    Other portfolios
    We also examined the robustness of our findings using the six size and book to
market sorted portfolios constructed by Fama and French. The asymptotic theory
we rely on for statistical inference may be more justified in this smaller cross section
of assets. The results are given in Table X. The slope coeﬃcient for consumption
growth is 2.81, not much diﬀerent from the 2.56 for the cross section of 25 assets we
examined earlier. The cross sectional R-squares for the CCAPM and the Fama and
French three factor model specifications, again, are comparable.
    Table XI gives the results for several other set of assets: 18 portfolios sorted on
size, 18 portfolios sorted on B/M, 19 portfolios sorted on E/P, and 19 portfolios sorted
on CF/P, taken from Kenneth French’s website. The consumption model performs
almost as well as the Fama and French three factor model for the Size and B/M
portfolios, but not for the E/P and CF/P sorted portfolios. However, the estimated
slope coeﬃcients for consumption growth in the cross sectional regressions are not
much diﬀerent across the diﬀerent set of assets.
    To check whether our conclusions critically depend on the use of seasonally ad-
justed data on expenditures of nondurables and services, we evaluated the model
using nonseasonally adjusted consumption data. Since the price deflator for personal
consumption expenditures are only available in seasonally adjusted form, we followed
Ferson and Harvey (1992), and used nonseasonally adjusted CPI to deflate nominal
consumption expenditures. As can be seen from the results reported in Table XII,
the use of seasonally unadjusted consumption data does not change the results in any
significant way.


4    Conclusion
In this paper we examine the ability of the consumption based asset pricing model
to explain the cross section of average returns on the 25 benchmark equity portfolios


                                          13
constructed by Fama and French. We find surprisingly strong support for the model.
The single consumption factor model performs almost as well as the widely used Fama
and French (1993) three factor model. Most of the variation in average returns can
be explained by corresponding variation in exposure to consumption risk. The model
performs well in other test assets as well.
    In deriving the econometric specifications for the consumption based asset pricing
model we assumed that all investors review their consumption-investment plans once
a year at the same time during the fourth quarter of every calendar year. We find
more support for this assumption than the standard specification that follows from the
assumption that investors review their consumption-investment plans every month.
    While the consumption-based model is able to explain the cross section of average
return on stocks, there is evidence indicating that the model specifications used in
our empirical study misses some important aspects of reality. While the model can
explain the cross section of returns on stocks, it has diﬃculty explaining the equity
premium. The implied market risk premium for bearing consumption risk is rather
high. When book to market ratio is introduced as an additional variable in the cross
sectional regressions, its slope coeﬃcient is significantly diﬀerent zero, indicating that
it would be possible to construct a set of interesting test assets that pose a challenge
to the consumption based model by following Daniel and Titman (1997). That would
help future research in identifying what is missing in consumption based models.

                      Table I: Consumption Growth Summary


    This table reports summary statistics of consumption growth. Consumption is measured
by real consumer expenditure per capita on nondurables and services. For notational con-
venience, let ∆c denote the growth rate in consumption, (gc − 1). Then, the consumption
growth rate is given by
                                         Ct+4
                                 ∆c = (        − 1) × 100%.
                                          Ct
    Q1-Q1 consumption growth is calculated using Quarter 1 consumption data. Q2-Q2, Q3-
Q3, and Q4-Q4 consumption growth are calculated in the similar way. Q4-Q4 consumption
growth is calculated using 4th quarter consumption data. Annual consumption growth is
calculated using annual consumption data. Dec-Dec consumption growth is calculated from
December consumption data. Sample period of quarterly and annual data is 1954-2003.
Sample period of monthly data is 1960-2003.

          Table II: Annual Excess Returns and Consumption Betas

   Panel A reports average annual excess returns on Fama-French 25 portfolios from 1954-
2003. Annual excess return is calculated from January to December in real term. Panel B
reports these portfolios’ consumption betas estimated by time series regression:

                                Ri,t = αi + β i,c ∆ct + εi,t

where ∆c is Q4-Q4 consumption growth calculated using 4th quarter consumption data.

            Table IV: Cross Sectional Regression without intercept

   This table reports Fama-MacBeth cross sectional regression (CSR) estimation results
with restrictions :
                                   E[Ri,t ] = λ0 β
   Betas are estimated by the time-series regression of excess returns on the factors. Test
portfolios are Fama-French 25 portfolios, annual return from 1954-2003. The estimation
method is Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regression procedure. The first row reports the
                     e
coeﬃcient estimates (λ).   Fama-MacBeth t-statistic are reported in the second row, and
Shanken corrected t-statistic are in the third row. The last column gives the R2 and
adjusted R2 just below it.

    This table compares pricing errors of Fama-French 25 portfolios generated by CCAPM,
Fama-French three factor model, and the nesting four factor model (FF 3 factor +∆c).
When the model is estimated without restrictions, then pricing errors are calculated by
b i = Ri − λ
α               b0 β
           b0 − λ  bi ; when the model is estimated with restrictions, then pricing errors are
calculated by α           e0 β

   Asset returns are value-weighted annual returns on Fama-French 25 portfolios. Sample
period is 1954 — 2003. The model is estimated by HJ-GMM, in which the inverse of the
second moments of asset returns is used as weighting matrix. The coeﬃcient estimates
are reported in first row. Second row reports t-statistic. The last two columns give the
J-statistic and corresponding p-value.

        Table XII: CCAPM based on Not Seasonally Adjusted Data


    This table reports results of CCAPM test using not seasonally adjusted consumption
data. Nominal seasonally unadjusted consumer expenditure data on nondurables and ser-
vices are from NIPA table 8.2. We use not seasonally adjusted CPI to deflate the nominal
expenditure. Q4-Q4 consumption growth is calculated using 4th quarter real consumption
data. Sample period is 1954-2003. Panel A reports statistics summary of C4nsa (Q4-Q4
consumption growth calculated using Not Seasonally Adjusted consumption data). The cor-
relation coeﬃcient between C4nsa and C4sa (Q4-Q4 consumption growth calculated using
seasonally adjusted consumption data) is also reported. Panel B reports cross sectional
regression estimation results for asset pricing model :

                                E[Ri,t ] = λ0 + λ1 β i,C4nsa

   Betas are estimated by the time-series regression of excess returns on C4nsa .   Test
portfolios are Fama-French 25 portfolios, annual return from 1954-2003.
