           Monetary Policy Under Exchange Rate Flexibility


                                 SUMMARY




     The paper presents an evaluation of exchange rate theories and the
empirical evidence :in the field.   The analysis is extended to sketch the
role of flexible exchange rates :in a macroeconomic context, :in particular
for the case of the U. S .
     Among exchange rate theories "asset-market" models are now recognized
as the most attractive formulation.    These models emphasize the determination
of exchange rates as part of short-run asset market equilibrium.       Prom:inent
aIIDng these theories is the "monetary approach".     A review of the evidence
f:inds the empirical support for the view quite weak.      An alternative
approach emphasizes the imperfect substitutability of assets and views
exchange rate determination as linked to the relative supplies of financial
assets denom:inated :in domestic and foreign currency.     EmpiriCal support
for this view is only start:ing to come :in now.
     The paper offers a criticism of the manner :in which empirical tests
of exchange rate models have been conducted.       I t is shown that, along
l:ines familiar from macroeconomics or f:inance, only unanticipated changes
in the determinants of exchange rates should affect the deviations of
exchange rates from the :interest parity trend.     Such a formulation suggests
that the explanatory variables are the innovations -- such as unanticipated
money -- :in the determinants of exchange rates, not their actual levels.
     There is a brief review concern:ing the evidence of exchange rate effects
on :inflation and trade flows.   The review concludes that exchange depre-
ciation does exert a significant effect on domestic :inflation, given the
rate of unemployment, but that there do remain effects on competitiveness.
Changes in real exchange rates :in turn do exert an important long-run
effect on trade flows, although the lags are quite pronounced.

INTRODUCTION

       The continuing depreciation of the dollar stands out as one of the big policy

issues.    It has started to impinge on   us   monetary policy, it influences the chances

for international commercial diplomacy and it is enhancing the move toward

European monetary integration.    Above all it leaves most observers, with a

puzzle as to the causes of the ongoing depreciation.

       This paper will, of course, not resolve the puzzle.      It rather attempts to

layout the basic analytical framework that has been developed for the analysis

of exchange rate questions and to relate it to the question of monetary policy.

Part I concentrates on the development of the relevant theoretical framework.        The

main    points to be made here are: (i) exchange rates ,are primarily determined in asset

markets with expectations playing a dominant role.        (ii) the sharpest formulation of

exchange rate theory is the "monetary approach", Chicago's quantity theory of the

open economy, (iii) purchasing power parity is a precarious reed on which to

hang shortterm exchange rate theory, (iv) the current acc,ount has just made it

back as a determinant of exchange rates.

       In Part II we review the main strands of empirical research on exchange rate

determination.    The review concentrates mainly on the monetary approach where

work has been quite plentiful, but also looks at some alternative formulations.

       Part III pulls together these elements to form some co?jectures about the

working of monetary policy under flexible rates and about the dollar

depreciation.   In particular we draw attention to the trade-off between

increased net exports and the inflationary impact induced by a

depreciation.

     The topic covered in this paper has received an extraordinary amount

of professional attention in the last few years and much fruitful

research has been accomplished.   The fine surveys by Isard (1978),

Kohlhagen (1978) and Schadler (1977) will place our sketchy review

in the perspective of the literature and the books by Black (1977) and

Willett (1977) help relate our topic to the ongoing policy discussions.

               I.   THEORY

                     In this part we review the main strands of exchange rate theory.       We

               start off with two rock-bottom models that, in an oversimplified manner

               perhaps, represent exchange rate theory as viewed by the person in "the

               Street".   These models, purchasing power parity and a balance of payments

               theory of the exchange rate, each contain of course more than a germ of truth

               and thus serve as a useful introduction to our review.

                     We proceed from there to more structured models that emphasize

               macroeconomic interaction or the details of asset markets.     These theories

               can be described as asset market theories of the exchange rate.     Extensions

               ·of these models are then considered in an effort to add realism.    These

               extensions deal with expectations, questions of dynamics and of indexing

               and policy reaction.

               1.   Purchasing Power Parity and the Quantity Theory:

                     Purchasing power parity theory of the exchange rate is one of those

               empirical regularities that are sufficiently true over long periods of

               time to deserve our attention but deviations from which are pronounced

               enough to make all the difference in the short run.     Clearly, purchasing power parity

                (PPP for short) is much like the quantity theory of money and indeed can

               be viewed as the open economy extension of quantity theory thinking. I

               i.   PPP Theory

                     PPP theory argues that exchange rates move over time so as to offset

               divergent movements in national price levels.    A country that experiences

               a hyperinflation, for example, will experience at the same time a

               corresponding external depreciation of its.currency.

                     The theory leaves open two important operational questions.    The first

               deals with the channels through which this relation petween inflation

differentials and depreciation will come about.       The second question

concerns the extent to which PPP is complete, -- does it hold in

the shortrun and is there no possibility for trend deviations over time?

     The extent to which PPP holds exactly, at every point in time, and

without trend deviation has been an important issue in trade theory.

There is no question that in theory the p9ssibility of systematic

deviation has   been established that arise from the existence of nontraded

goods.   Specifically Balassa and Samuelson have argued that because

services tend to be nontraded, labour intensive and show low technical

progress as opposed to traded manufactures we would expect fast-growing

and innovating countries to experience an increase in their real price

level over time.    With prices of tradeables equalized/the productivity

growth in the traded sector would raise wages and the relative price of

nontraded goods and thus the real price level in the fast growing countries.

     A second source of systematic deviation has been pointed to by the

earlier literature, including Viner, that dealt with the effect of capital

flows· or current account imbalance.     Here it was argued that a borrowing

country has a relatively high (real) price level.        The argument here relies

on the fact that an increase in aggregate demand, financed by borrowing

and a current account deficit, would raise the relative price of nontraded

goods and thus .the real price level.     There are thus two reasons for

trend deviations or systematic deviations from ppp that serve as important

reservations to the generality of the theory.

     Settinq these reservations aside we are still left with the issue

of how rapidly and completely we expect ppp to hold and through what

channels it comes about.     Here the literature is considerably more diffuse.

A hard core theory, associated with     ~hat   Marina Whitman (1975) has

aptly called "global monetarism ll asserts the IIlaw of one price ll •   Goods
                                                      - 5 -


produced by us and by our competitors behave as if they were perfect substitutes.

Simple arbitrage by market participants will establish uniformity of price in

closely integrated markets.

      This hard core view is no longer very fashionable except, of course, for

raw materials, commodities and food.                  A more differentiated view would argue

that in the shortrun and perhaps even in the longrun there is substantial

scope for product differentiation.                   Under these conditions price adjustment is

no longer a matter of arbitrage but rather becomes a question of substitution.

When our prices get out of line with those of our competitors so that we

become more competitive ,then we would expect demand to shift toward our goods,

and in a fully employed economy, start putting upward pressure on costs and

ultimately prices.           The price adjustment here is certainly time consuming; it

depends not only on substitutability between supply sources--Okun's

distinction between customer and auction markets is important here--but

also on the state of slack in the economy and on the expected persistence

of real price changes.            The description of this mechanism suggests that

deviations from PPP are not only possible, but may persist for some time.

      The empirical content of PPP theory can be summarized as in equation (1):

(1)           k..   = (l-a1 Jk   + a 1 k-1 + a 2 z     ;   O<a <l,a >0
                                                              1    2

where k and         ~l   measure the current and lagged deviation from PPP, k

is the equilibrium real price level that has perhaps                   ~   time trend and z

measures the systematic effect of borrowing or current account imbalance

on the deviation from PPP.              We would expect a         to be positive thus showing
                                                              1
some serial correlation or persistence in deviations from PPP.

ii.   Money, Prices and the Exchange Rate:

      We turn now to a development of the 'monetary approach' of exchange

rate theory.         This model or approach combines the quantity theory of
                                      - 6 -

JI1oney--fully flexible prices determined by real money demand and nominal

money supply--with strict PPP to arrive at a theory of the exchange rate.

        The approach can be simply formulated in terms of a combined theory

of monetary equilibrium and exchange rate determination.     Let M,P,V and Y

be the nominal quantity of money, the price level, velocity and real income.

Then the condition of monetary equilibrium can be written as:

(2)           M
              -V(r,Y)
               P
                        =Y
where our notation indicates that velocity may be a function of other

variables, such as interest rates, r, or income.

        We can rewrite equation (2), solving for the price level, as:

                  M
(2) •          p=v-
                  y

which states that for a given velocity an increase in money leads to an

equiproportionate rise in the price level.     A rise in velocity likewise raises

,the price level while an increase in real income, by raising real money demand,

would lower the equilibrium level of prices.

        To go from here to a theory of the exchange rate we draw on a strict

version of PPP which states that our price level is equal to foreign prices,

 P*, converted at the exchange rate,E:                                  /



 (3)         P = P*E

where'E is the domestic currency price of foreign exchange.     Substituting

 (3) in (2)' yields an expression for the equilibrium exchange rate:

 (4)         E = (l/P*) V   ~
                            Y


The equilibrium exchange rate depends on nominal money, real output and

velocity.     An increase in nominal money or'in velocity will depreciate

 the exchange rate in the same proportion.    A rise in real income will lead

 to appreciation•. What is the mechanism?
                                                                  - 7 -


             The theory argues that domestic                           l?ric::~~ .CU'e       fully flexible, but are

     linked to world prices by PPP.                           Given the nominal quantity of money any

    variations in the demand for money must be offset by compensating

     changes in the level of prices and thus in the exchange rate.                                                        An

     increase in real money demand, because say of an increase in real income,

    will be accommodated by a decline in                              ~e     level of prices so as to raise

     the real value of the existing nominal money stock.
                                                       I
                                                                                                      with a decline in our

    prices, though, we are out of line with world prices and thus require

    .appreciation of the exchange rate.

             To complete the theory we note two extensions.                                           First there is

     symmetry in that the foreign price level, p*, is determined by foreign

    money demand and supply so that we can write (3) as

     (4) ,


     Clearly then, what matters for exchange rate determination in this view

     is relative money supplies, velocities and real incomes in the two countries.

     Our     exchang~_.':'~::'.~~~l            depreciate if, other thinC]'sE!qual, our nominal money.

     stock rises relative to that abroad.

              The second extension is a specification of a velocity function.                                                     Here.

•    the tradition has been to assume that velocity depends on real income
     and tlle alternative cost of                     hold~ng        money:

     (5)                  V   = y A-I
                                   . exp(8r)


     where r is the nominal rate of interest.                                    The functional form is a matter

     of expositional convenience and monetary tradition.

              Substituting (5) in (4)' and taking logs we obtain the standard
                                                                      1
     equation of the "monetary approach":

      (6)                 e   = m-m*      -A(y-y*) + 8(r-r*)

    1 The literature of the monetary approach has predominantly used the forward
    premium rather than the interest differential. See for example Frenkel and
    Clements (1978). The theoretical rationale is, I believe, the idea that the
    relevant substitution is between domestic and foreign monies rather than

where e, m, m*,y,y* are logarithms of the corresponding capital letter
variables.

       In the final f0rIll't:Cluation (6) shows that an increase in our relative

money stock or a decline in our relative income will lead to depreciation

as would a rise in our relative interest rate.            The last conclusion is
particularly interesting since it certainly is the opposite of the

conventional wisdom that a     r~se   tn           interest rates will lead to
appreciation.      We return to the question below when we compare the relation

between interest rates and the exchange rate in alternative theories.              We

note here the explanation;      an increase in interest rates reduces the demand

for real money balances.     Given the nominal quantity of money the price

level has to rise to reduce the real money stock to its lower equilibrium

level.    With our prices thus getting out of line internationally a

depreciation is required to restore PPP t

2.    Balance of Payments Theory of Exchange Rates

      A   textbook      view of exchange rates will argue that the exchange

rate adjusts to balance receipts and payments arising from international

trade in goods, services and assets.          The current account is affected by

the exchange rate because it changes relative prices and thus competitiveness,

the capital account is affected to the extent that expectational consider-

ations are important.      The theory can be formulated with the help of

equation (7):

(7)          BoP   = 0 = C(EP*/p,Y,Y*)     + K(r, r*,sl

where BoP denotes the balance of payments, EP*/P measures the relative

price of foreign goods and thus serves as a measure of our competitiveness,

C denotes the current account, K the rate of capital inflow and s is a

speculative variable which we disregard for the present.

       Figure 1 shows the schedule BB along which our balance of payments

is in equilibrium, given prices,foreign income,and interest rates.               A rise

in E or a depreciation of the exchange makes us more competitive and

thus improves the current account.       To restore overall balance of payments

equilibrium lower interest rates are required so as to generate an

offsetting rate of capital outflow.       We can readily sho\o1 that in this

framework the exchange rate depends on interest rates/activity levels,

relative price levels and the exogeneous determinants of the composition

of world demand:

(8)            E   = E(Y,Y*,r,r*,P*/p)

Specifically, an increase in our income, because of sayan autonomous

increase in spending, will worsen the currentcaccount and thus requires

an offsetting depreciation.      An increase in foreign prices leads to a
                                      - 10 -



precisely offsetting appreciation and an increase in our interest rate

leads to an appreciation.    The mechanism through which higher interest

rates at home lead to an appreciation can.be illustrated with the help

of Figure 1.    In the first place the increase in interest rates will lead

to a net capital inflow or a reduced rate of outflow and thus causes the

overall balance of payments to move into surplus.    The exchange rate

will accordingly appreciate--assuming the right elasticities--until we

have an offsetting worsening of the current account.    This is shown by

the move from A to AI on BB.

     We may not want to stop at this point but rather recognize that the

higher interest rates and the exchange appreciation will exert subsidiary

domestic effects.    With higher interest rates aggregate demand declines

and thus output will fall.     The same effect arises from the appreciation

and the resulting deterioration of the current account.    Thus we have

a second round of adjustments to the decline in income which shifts the

BB schedule inward over time.     The longrun balance of payments schedule

that incorporates the equilibrium level of income implied by the real

exchange rate and interest rate is the steeper schedule BB.     In the

longrun we have further appreciation until point A" is reached.

     Two   points deserve emphasis here.   First, the approach views changes

in exchange rates as changing (almost one for one) relative prices and

competitiveness.    It in this respect represents a view opposite to that

embodied in the monetary model.     Second, it contradicts the monetary

model in predicting that an increase in interest rates will lead to an

appreciation.    I will not pursue this model further, but rather take a

specialized version and embody it in a macroeconomic setting.

3.   The Mundell-Fleming Model:

      The balance of payments model has drawn attention to the role of
                                      - 11 -




capital flows in the determination of exchange rates.     This is also

the perspective adopted by the modern macroeconomic approach to exchange

rate determination that originated with the pathbreaking work of

Mundell (1968) and Fleming (1962).     Their theorY argues that the exchange

rate enters the macroeconomic framework of interest and output determination

because changes in exchange rates affect competitiveness.     Depreciation

acts much in the same way as fiscal policy by affecting the level of

demand for domestic goods associated with each level of output and interest

rate.    A depreciation shifts world demand toward our goods and thus acts

in an expansionary manner.

        The Mundell-Fleming model is illustrated in Figure 2 for the case of

perfect capital mobility.     Perfect capital mobility means that there is

only one rate of interest at which the balance of payments can be in

equilibrium.     If the rate were lower there would be outflows that would

swamp any current account surplus and conversely if it was higher.        This is

illustrated by the horizontal BB schedule.     The LM schedule is the conven-

tional representation of monetary equilibrium.     Higher income levels

raise the demand for money.     Given the money stock, interest rates will

have to rise to contain money demand to the existing level of supply.

Finally the IS schedule       resembles that of a closed economy except that

it includes as a component of demand net exports as determined by income

and competitiveness.     That is why a depreciation will shift the IS

schedule out and to the right.

     Consider now a monetary expansion indicated by a rightward shift of

the LM schedule.    The impact effect is of course to lower interest rates

and thus to exert an expansionary effect on demand.            The decline in

interest rates, however, leads to exchange depreciation because of

incipient ·capital outflows. "The depreciation in turn enhances our

competitiveness raising demand and shifting the IS curve to the right

                        until we reach point A'. Here output and income have

risen sufficiently for the increased money stock to be held at the initial

rate of interest.

     The framework has an important lesson for exchange rate theory and

monetary policy.    First, under conditions of perfect capital mobility and
                                        - 13 -



given the world rate of interest, monetary policy works not by raising

the interest sensitive components of spending, but rather by generating a

depreciation and thereby a current account surplus.         Monetary policy works

not through the construction sector but rather through the net export

component of demand.      This is of course a striking result, due in part

to the small country assumption.        It draws attention to the central role

of net exports in aggregate demand and to the link between interest

rates and exchange rates.       It is the latter link that has become central

to recent exchange rate models.

       The theory implies an equilibrium exchange rate which we can obtain
                                                              l
either from the condition of goods market equilibrium:

(9)            E   = E(r,Y,Y*,P*/p, ••• )
or as a reduced form equation of the full system:

(lO)           E   = E(M,Y*, ••• }
where the dots denote fiscal policy variables and other exogeneous

determinants of goods and money demand.          It is interesting to note that

in ,( 91 an increase in the (world) interest rate, because it reduces        ~~~re~ate


demand and thus creates an excess supply of goods, requires an offsetting

depreciation that increases competitiveness and gives rise to a trade

surplus.

       In its present form the model has three limitations;       First, there is

no role whatsoever for exchange rate expectations.         This point is important

because it implies that strict interest equality must obtain internationally.

Second, the model allows for no effect from the depreciation on domestic

prices.    The depreciation is not allowed to affect either the general price


1 The condition of goods market equilibrium is: Y = A(r,Y) + C(EP*/P,Y,Y*)
where A( ) denotes aggregate spending by domestic residents and C is
the trade balance. We solve the equation for the exchange rate to obtain ( 9) •

            level, and therefore the real value of the money stock, or the price of

            our output and therefore our competitiveness.           It is quite apparent that in

            fact we should expect at least some spillover into domestic prices and

            that the extent to which the real effects of a monetary expansion are

            dampened.   We return to this question in section 5 below and in part II

            where we look at the empirical evidence.           The third limitation concerns

            the absence of any dynamics.      This limitation is important not only in

            respect to the price adjustment that we just noted but also for the

            adjustment of trade flows.      The existence of adjustment lags, reviewed

            below in part II, implies the possibility that monetary policy in the

            shortrun may fail to be expansionary.


             4.   The Portfolio Balance Model:

                   The Mundell-Fleming model emphasizes the high substitutability

             between domestic and foreign assets.        Capital mobility is perfect so that

             the slightest deviation of interest rates from the world level unleashes

____________~unb==~o~unded incipient capital flows.    An alternative formulation emphasizes

             a more limited substitutability between domestic and foreign assets and in-

             troduces the level of the exchange rate as a variable that along with

             asset yields helps achieve balance between asset demands and asset supplies. l

            The model concentrates on asset markets but can readily be extended to

            include the allocational effects of exchange rates in affecting the

            current account.
                                             - 15 -




       Consider now the basic model as shown in equations (11)-(13) and

Figure 3.    In equation (11) we show the condition of monetary equilibrium

where W denotes nominal wealth and where ¢(r,r*) is the fraction of wealth

people wish to hold in the form of domestic money:

(11)               M = jiS'(r.r*)W             ¢.r ,¢r * < 0
       Equilibrium in the market for domestic assets requires that the

existing supply, X, equal the demand:

(12)

where W(r,r*) is the desired ratio of domestic assets to wealth.               The

ratio is assumed to increase with the own rate of return and to decline

with the return on foreign assets. Equations (11) and (12) together with

the wealth construint;




imply an equilibrium condition in the market for net external assets;

(13)              EF   =   (111 - ¢)W = P(r,r*)W

where F denotes net holdings of foreign assets measured in terms of foreign

exchange.    Note that since net external assets can be        ne~ative,   p   c~    be

n.cgative.   We   Cl::5SmnC   that assets are substitutes so that ilsset demands respond
positively to their own yield and negatively to yields on il1ternatiye assets,




1 Portfolio balance models as discussed here have been developed among others by
by Boyer (i977) , Dornbusch (1975), Dornbusch and Fischer (1978), Flood (1976)
Henderson and Girton (1975) r Kouri (1976,1977), Branson (1976), and Porter U977).

         In figure 3 we show the money and domestic asset market equilibrium

    schedules for given stocks of each of the assets.                  Along MM the domestic

 money market is in equilibrium.                      Higher interest rates reduce money

    demand so that equilibrium requires a depreciation and thus a rise in the

    domestic currency value of foreign assets and hence wealth.                      The exchange

    rate thus plays a balancing role by affecting the valuation of assets.

    Along XX the domestic asset market is in equilibrium.                       Higher interest

    rates raise the demand for domestic assets and thus require an appre-

    ciation to reduce wealth and asset demand thus restoring equilibrium.

        We want to establish next the effect of                  ch~nges   in   for~i<]n   interest

rates, changes in domestic money or net external assets.                          In terms of

Figure 3 an increase in the foreign interest rate creates an excess supply

of domestic money and domestic securities thus shifting the MM schedule

down and to the 'right and the XX schedule up and to the right.                            Without

question the equilibrium exchange rate depreciates.

        Consider. next an increase in the domestic money stock.                      At the initial

equilibrium there will be an excess supply of money and an excess demand

for domestic (and foreign) securities.                      Accordingly the MM schedule will

shift down and to the right while the XX schedule shifts down and to the

left.     It is readily established that the net effect is unambiguously

a depreciation of the exchange rate. 1

        Finally we consider an increase in net external assets.                       Now both the

money market and the domestic security market schedules shift to the left.

     Using equations (11) and (12) along with the definition of wealth we have:
                             'l:' (l-ep)+'l:'q,
         dE/dM   = ( F1 )      r

They will shift in the same proportion, as inspection of (11) and (12)

together with the wealth constraint will reveal.                   Accordingly the equilibrium

exchange rate appreciates in proportion to the increase in foreign assets.

         The implications of the portfolio balance model are summarized in

equation (14) which shows the reduced form equation for the equilibrium

exchange rate:

         Furthermore since (14) is homogeneous in domestic nominal money and
     . .
secur1t1es            .
           we can rewr1te t h e equat10n

         In this form we emphasize that the equilibrium exchange rate depends

on relative asset supplies.           In particular an increase in domestic nominal

assets--money and securities--relative to external assets will lead to

an equiproportionate depreciation.                This homogeneity property is, of course,

desirable since it corresponds to an ongoing, neutral inflation process.

         The portfolio balance model draws attention to the substitution

possibility between domestic and foreign assets.                  Domestic and foreign

securities are no longer perfect substitutes and accordingly their relative

supplies determine, along with the nominal money stock, equilibrium interest

rates and the exchange rate.          A link with the current account is established


1 The effect of an increase in domestic securities on the equilibrium
exchange rate is ambiguous.

2 To derive (14)' we note that taking the ratio of (11) and (12) and
solving for the equilibrium interest rate we have: r = h(r*, X/M).
From (13) and the wealth definition we obtain: E                  = --e---(M/F
                                                                    1 - p
                                                                                 + X/F)   =
(M!F)      1 ~ P    (1 + X/M).    Substituting the equilibrium interest rate

r   = h(         ) yields (14)', where Y(r*, X/M)         =1   p(r*, h(r*, X/M)
                                                               - p(r*, h(r*, X/M)

by virtue of the fact that external assets are acquired over time through

the current account surplus.   Accordingly~   as Kouri (1976, 1977) and

others have emphasized,the current account determines the evolution of

the exchange rate over time.   In particular a current account surplus

which implies accumulation of net external assets leads to an appreciating

exchange rate.

      What makes this model potentially attractive for the analysis of exchange

rate questions is the direct relation between asset market disturbances

and movements in exchange rates.   It extends    .the monetary model because

we do not have to rely on shifts in money demand or supply as sole

determinants of exchange rate movements but rather can consider shifts

between domestic and foreign assets, for example, as motivated by say

expectations.

5.   Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics

      We have so far concentrated on models of the exchange rate that are

largely static and that do not emphasize the role of expectations.     We

extend the analysis now to questions of dynamics and to the place of

expectations.   The role of expectations is central to exchange rate

determination, and therefore to policies under 'flexible exchange rates.

The spot exchange rate

is almost entirely dominated by the course the public expects it to take

in the near future.   These expectations, of course, are influenced by

. the structure of the economy and institutional features such as

indexing or systematic policy responses.     We will in this section first

review a fairly general model of exchange rate expectations and dynamics

and then extend the analysis to discuss the idea of a virtuous and vicious
 . 1e. 1
cJ.rc

1.   Expectations:

      We return to the assumption of perfect capital mobility to establish


1 This section draws on Dornbusch (1976).
                                          -   20 -



a relationship between interest rates, current exchange rates and expected

exchange rates.       With perfect capital mobility asset holders would find

themselves indifferent between holding domestic or foreign assets provided

they carry the same yield, that is provided the interest differential

matches the anticipated rate of depreciation:

(15)           r-r*     =   (E/E -   1)


where r-r* is the interest differential, and where (E/E -1) is the expected

depreciation of the domestic currency which is defined as the percentage

excess of the expected future spot rate, E, over the current spot rate, E.

We can rewrite (15) to yield an equation for the spot rate:

(15) ,         E   = --=--
                        E
                     1 + r-r*

Equation (15)' is central to a correct interpretation of exchange rate

movements.      It argues that movements in the spot rate are due either to

changes in interest differentials, given expectations or to changes in

expectations over the future course of exchange rates.        Specifically, an

increase in our interest rate will lead to an appreciation.        The anticipa-

tion of depreciation, given interest rates, will lead to an immediate

depreciation in the same proportion.




         We close the model of exchange rate determination with a theory

of nominal interest rates and a theory of how exchange rate expectations

are formed.        This is the point where our model ties in with the earlier

theories.      Thus we can appeal, for example·, to the Keynesian model to

argue that interest rates are determined by income, the terms of trade and

the real money stock.        Suppose the foreign interest rate is given.   The

·domestic interest rate, using the condition of money market equilibrium as
                                                       - 21 -



implicit in an LM schedule, will depend on income and real money:

(16)        r   = r(M/P,Y)
The expected future or longrun equilibrium exchange rate, E can be written

as a function of the teJ:ms of trade, cr, and longrun price levels, P/P*

                                t5"

which in turn are proportional to longrun money stocks M, M* with the

factors of proportionality,              11'   and 11'*, deteJ:mined by exogeneous real variables.

Substituting (16) and (17) in (15)' gives us a reduced fOJ:m equation for

the equilibrium exchange rate:

                        cr (    ) (7IM/1I'*M"*)

monetary policy.         The analysis is helped by Figure 4.             The schedule QQ

shows the equilibrium exchange rate of (18) for given longrun money, teJ:ms

of trade and price levels              and a given foreign interest rate.
       The QQ schedule is downward sloping since, given money, a higher

price level, say a move to point A"'- raises the equilibrium interest

rate at home and thus creates a differential in favor of the home

country.    To offset the differential the spot rate must appreciate--

E must decline--to the point where the anticipated rate of depreciation

matches the interest differential.

       HoW will a peJ:manent increase in the money stock work itself out in

this framework?          An increase in money in the longrun, with all prices

flexible will increase prices and exchange rates in the same proportion.

This implies that the QQ schedule shifts out to Q'Q' and that in the final

longrun equilibrium we will be at point A' with all real variables unchanged.'

In theshortrun, though, an increase in nominal money is an increase

in the real money stock.               Prices are unlikely to jump and therefore a
                                           - 22 -



lower rate of interest is required for the public to hold the higher real

money stock.        With a decline in interest rates there will be an incipient

capital outflow until the exchange rate has depreciated enough to

create the anticipation of appreciation exactly at the rate of the

interest differential.        This is true at point A" where the exchange rate

has depreciated beyond its new longrun level.         This overshooting of

exchange rates is an essential counterpart of permanent monetary changes under

conditions of shortrun price stickiness         and perfect capital mobility.

       By how much will exchange rates overshoot?       That depends on the nature

of the price adjustment process.          If prices rise very rapidly because

interest response of money demand is low and that of goods demand is

high or because demand is highly responsive to relative prices--then the

overshooting will tend to be small.         Conversely, if the adjustment process

of prices is slow then the overshooting is large.

       The adjustment, following the impact effect of an increase in money,

is shown in Figure 4 by the movement along Q'QI.         The exchange rate has

depreciated thus making domestic goods more competitive.          Interest rates

at home have declined thereby raising demand.         Both factors work to put

upward pressure on our price level.         Prices will rise, real money declines

and interest rates rise back up until the new longrun equilibrium at

Al    is reached.

iie    Virtuous and Vicious Cycles

       The framework we have laid out here helps-understand a controversy

that has developed about the working of a flexible rate system.          It

has been argued that flexible rates make inflation stabilization more

difficult in soft currency countries and more easy in hard currency countries.

  The virtuous and vicious cycle has been discussed arnoung others by
Krugman (1977), Sachs (1978), Basevi and de Grauwe (1977) and Willett (1977).

The reason is that monetary policy, through the rapid reaction of exchange

rates and through the overshooting, exerts rapid inflationary pressure

in expanding countries and inflation-dampening in relatively tight

countries.        Monetary policy bedomes quite possibly ineffective if one

recognizes that the inflationary pressure of depreciation is quite soon

translated into domestic price increases.        These price increases limit

the gain in competitiveness from a depreciation.

                           In these circumstances monetary policy is primarily

inflationary, it has very little if any effect on real aggregate demand.

All that would happen is that renewed attempts at stimulating aggregate

demand would translate into increasing inflation rather than more employment.
                                    - 24 -




     What institutional factors would check or enhance such an ostensibly

unstable process? It has been argued with force that the virtuous and vicious

cycle is entirely a matter of monetary determination.       Unless monetary

policy validates the depreciation it will ultimately undo itself.       There

can be little disagreement with this conclusion, except that it is

fundamentally irrelevant as an observation about policy.       The relevant

policy setting is one where wide-spread indexation, for example, will

immediately translate depreciation into wage and price inflation with
                                                 ~




the consequence of growing unemployment if the central bank fails to

accommodate through further monetary expansion. The central bank may in

practice have very little power to stop this inflationary process and

the right starting point is incomes policy not monetary policy.       At the same

time it is, of course, true that the prospect 'of an effective stabilization

program will immediately receive the side benefit of an appreciation and a

consequent bonus in terms of inflation reduction.

6.   Swmnary:

     We have now reviewed a wide spectrum of exchange rate theories.

There is little purpose in endorsing one particular formulation since each

of these models seeks to capture a special effect and thus is more or less

suitable for a particular instance of policy analysis.       Some models view
the place" of the exchange rate mainly in its shortterm effects on

competitiveness and its longterm role        in keeping in line prices inter-

nationally.     Monetary and portfolio models assign importance to exchange

rate movements through valuation effects, exchange rate movements change

the real value of the money stock or the relative supplies of domestic and

foreign assets.

      If a choice has to be made between models then I do see a difference

between Quantity Theory oriented models that leave for the exchange rate the
                                            - 25 -



purely passive role of keeping the current stock of real balances just

right    and expectations oriented asset market models in which the current

level of the exchange rate is set primarily by reference to its anticipated

path. . In this latter perspective changes in current rates bring about an

adjustment dynamics the details of which depend on the differential speeds

of adjustment in goods and money markets and where the adjustments that

are taking place are quite possibly directed toward events that have not

yet materialized but are already anticipated.

        Monetarist models, of course, also recognize the importance of

expectations.       In those models, however, the spot rate is influenced by the

effect of anticipated depreciation on real money demand.               The anticipation

of depreciation would reduce real money demand thus raising the price level

and therefore, via PPP, lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate.                 The

extent of the      d~preciation   depends on the interest responsiveness of

money demand.       By contrast in the present model the anticipation of depre-

ciation leads directly, as of given prices and interest rates, to an

equiproportionate depreciation of the spot rate.

        From the   ~erspective   of monetary policy these two strands of modelling

differ of course quite radically.          The Quantity Theory model assumes quite

literally that      ~rices   are fully, instantaneously flexible.        It thus cannot

have any use for monetary        ~olicy,   except   ~erhaps   to stabilize the price

level in the face of money demand fluctuations.               All other models, of

course share a macroeconomic--as opposed to monetarist--persuasion where

monetary policy works, more or less, because the central bank can move the

real money stock.       In this perspective exchange rates become a vehicle for

monetary policy.       One of the chief channels of monetary policy is the direct

effect of money on interest rates and on the exchange rate and thereby on
                                    - 26 -



relative prices and aggregate demand.   The empirical problem is of course

whether this link makes price adjustment more rapid, or to put it differently,

whether flexible rates make the Phillips curve steeper.

    II.   SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

          In this part we will look at some of the empirical evidence that

    has a bearing on the exchange rate models· discussed above.    We will

    start with the evidence on PPP.     From there we turn to the monetary

    model of exchange rates which is reviewed in section 2.     The asset market

    model is considered in section 3.     A discussion of the two key issues

    for monetary policy--the inflationary impact of import price changes

    and the response of trade flows to relative prices--is presented in .

      the dollar appreciated relative to the DM by nearly ten percent and we see

      in the chart associated increase in the real exchange rate.                           Conversely,

      the depreciation of the dollar in late 1977 and early 1978 is reflected

      in a declining real exchange rate.

                 Can these deviations from PPP be modelled in a simple fashion?                         In

      particular are these deviations from PPP shortlived and self-liquidating?

      A for.mulation that tests this hypothesis regresses the log of the real

      exchange rate, k           = e+p*-p,          on its own lagged value and a constant: Using

      monthly data for the period March 1974-May 1978 we obtain:

           To make that point we can rewrite ( 19 ) in terms of its longrun value E:

           (19) ,           k = .3lk + .69k_
                                                          l

           so that the real exchange rate depends to the extent of one third on its

           longrun value and two-thirds on its recent history.l

                    One strand of literature, referred to earlier, views deviations

           from PPP that are associated with current account imbalance and capital flows.

           To the extent that an increase in interest rates will draw in capital flows

           we would expect the interest" differential to help explain deviations •

           from PPP.        In (20) we report a PPP equation that includes the interest

           differential as an explanatory variable:

           (20)                 k   = .19       + .8lk_
                                                          l

                    The equation shows that an increase in the· interest differential in

           favor of Germany would cause the real exchange rate to decline.                                       That would

           correspond to the case where the interest differential appreciates the mark

           at unchanged prices.                  While the interest differential thus has the

           expected sign it is very imprecisely estimated and contributes little to

           explaining the behavior of the real exchange rate.

                    We have now seen the evidence on                           subst~tial     and   ~ersistent   deviations

           from PPP.        I believe there is no surprise, i.f only because of the impo:rtant

           role of nontraded goods.                   Consider for example the :rates of i.nflation for

           different price indices reported in Table 2.                                We limit ourselves to Japan

import prices (as opposed to unit values).           The table reveals persuasively

the very substantial changes in relative prices.                Export prices systematically

rise at lower rates than the GNP deflator thus lending impressive support

to the Balassa-Sarnuelson hypothesis.        The terms of trade--the ratio of

export to import prices--change by more than half a percent per year.

     In addition to sectoral changes in relative prices over time we have

to recognize that pricing strategies differ across industries, across

countries and across the business cycle.            In the US pricing in manufac-

turing has been based on standard unit labor costs with little impact of

aggregate demand or competitors' prices.            Abroad there is evidence for

substantially more flexible prices.         The asymmetry reduces but does not

eliminate the scope for exchange rate changes to affect relative prices

and thus bring about deviations from PPP.

2.    The Monetary Approach

      The sharpest formulation of exchange rate determination ~s the I'~oneta~

approach" that is associated with the University of Chicago.                It is represented

in work such as Bilson (1978a, b, c)Dornbusch (1976b), Frenkel (1976),

Frenkel and Clements (1978)and Hodrick (1978).              The approach assumes, as we

have seen, perfect price flexibility as well as ppp.l                With these assumptions
monetary equilibrium here and abrQad implies an equilibrium exchange rate

that can be written as in (6) and is repeated here             ~or   convenienceJ


(6)            e   = m-xn*   - A(y-y*) + 6(r-r*)

The theory predicts that an increase in our income will appreciate the

exchange rate and that monetary expansion or higher interest rates will

depreciate the exchange rate.              Equations such as (6) have been estimated
for   Fr~nce   in the 20's, Germany in the hyperinflation period, the UK and

Germany and the US and Germany in the 70' s.             Table 3 reports in equations

1. and 4. estimates for such an equation.               In each case the coefficient on

relative money supplies was restricted to unity.              The estimates for the

period March 1974-May 1978 show that the coefficients have the expeeted

sign, although the           coeffic~ent   on interest rates is not statistically

significant.        We also note the very high estimate of serial correlation

and the low level of the Durbin Watson even after correction for serial

correlation.        In sum, the equation is not very satisfactory.




1 PPP is not ~lways assumed to be instantaneous.              Bilson (1978) allows for
autoregressive adjustment such as in (19').
                                       - 33 -




     There are several :i,mprovements       on the basic formulation that

deserve attention.      A first one recognizes that the demand for money is

poorly specified.      There is no recognition of adjustment lags,

although they have been found significant in domestic studies of money
          l
demand.       Nor does the equation include a longterm interest rate or deposit

rate that measures the alternative cost of holding money rather than

longterm assets.

     In eqUation 2. and 4. we show equations that include both a shortterm

and a longterm interest differential.       The coefficient of the longterm rate

is of the expected positive sign and is statistically significant.

     In equations 3. and 6. we complete the specification of money demand

by allowing for partial adjustment so that our exchange rate equation

becomes:




This specification shown in Chart 2 substantially improves the equation

by reducing the standard error and raising the Durbin Watson.        The lagged

coefficent is of the expected sign and magnitude and is statistically

significant.       At the same time, however, the adjustment changes the sign

of the shortterm interest differential which now becomes negative,




  1 In Bilson (1978b) the possibility of lagged adjustment of real
  money demand is explicitly recognized. In the empirical implementation,
  however, only a lagged exchange rate is used.

            although it remains insignificant.                   This change of sign is maintained

            when instrumental variables estimation is used as in 6.                     In fact the

             shown in 2. or 4. is a reduced form equation from a system where we have

            both shortterm real effects of monetary changes and longerterm inflation

be matched by depreciation to generate an offsetting expectation of

appreciation.      Changes in the longterm interest differential, by contrast,

are a proxy for changes in longterm inflation differential.          Increased

inflation thus raises longterm interest rates and leads to a depreciation

of the spot rate.

3.   A Criticism of the Monetary Model:

         A serious criticism of the monetary approach would start from the

recognition that PPP does not hold as any direct test will show.         Therefore

an equation like (6), which explicitly relies on PPP, cnanot be derived

or expected to hold.     This leaves expectations as the only direct link

between exchange rates and the monetary sector.      The argument returns us
                                                      1
to equation (lS) , written for convenience in logs:

(15) ,


where the prefix denotes the time at which expectations are formed and

where tdt+l denotes the one period interest differential starting at time t.

         We now want to sketch what the implications for empirical testing

of an expectations based approach would be.      For that purpose we subtract
                                                                 2
from (lS) ,                     last   period's exchange rate:




1 Equalizing the expected return from an investment at home and abroad we
have the.following relation between the dollar returns:
                         (l+r*}E/E = (l+r)
where E is the exchange rate at which we anticipate to convert foreign
exchange earnings~ We can rewrite this equation as: E = E(l+r*}~l+r) or,
taking logs, e = e - d where d :: log (l+r> I (1+r*) IX r-r*.   .
2 For subsequent reference we als9 define the log of the two period interest
rate starting last year:t_ld t + l :: t-ldt + t-1Vt+l where t-1Vt+l is the
expected one period rate differential between t and t+l, expectations being
formed at t-l.With these definitions we can define the term n :: tdt+l -.t-1Vt+l
as the unanticipated change iri the one-period interest rate., The term
Et :: tet+l - t-let+l represents new information about the future exchange rate.

        Thee;planation for our equilibrium exchange rate as written here will

rely on the rational use of information.                     I   will argue that today's

equilibrium exchange rate is equal to last periods' adjusted for the

one-period interest differential that prevailed between last period and

this period.      The remaining determinants of the exchange rate are white

noise or fresh news or unanticipated events.                       They represent respectively

the change in the expected future spot rate between last period and this

.period, e: , and the reassessment of the one period interest differential

 starting today, that is news about the term structure, Tl • 1

        The emphasis on exchange rate movements as embodying new information

is of course an essential aspect of assets market theories of the

exchange rate.       This is particularly recognized in the work by Mussa

 (1976, 1977).

        In this formulation the exchange rate will depreciate today relative

 to its previous level for one of three reasons:

        (a) the depreciation was anticipated and already reflected in the

 one period interest differential t_ldt which in this case would have

 been positive.


 lA closely related question, the' efficency of the forward market, has been
 extensively tested by running regressions of the fo~ e t = a o + alft~l + u t
 where f     is the forward rate at t-l.The test involves ehe Joint
 hypothe~I~ of a =0 and al=l. See Levich (1978) • The focus of interest here,of
  course, is that°the serially uncorrelated innovations should be explained in
  terms of a structural model.
                                  - 38 -




     (b) There is news about interest rates.      The one-period differential,

starting"today, had been incorrectly predicted and the reassessment of

the interest differential leads to a depreciation in the one period rate

starting today is above the rate that was implicit in last periods two

period differential.   An unanticipated increase in interest rates with

unchanged expectations about future exchange rates will lead to a

appreciation of the spot rate.

     (c)   The last piece that leads to a change in the exchange rate is

news about next periods equilibrium exchange rate.      Again here we look

solely at a change in expectations due to new information.       It is apparent

that rationality requires that E and   n be   serially uncorrelated. l




i Since n t j s observable there may be a temptation to run an equation
e t = e t _ l + t-ldt + nt + Et' treating Et as the error term. The procedure
is not appropriate since the revision of interest rates is likely to be
correlated with E as the case of unanticipated money, for example, makes
clear.           t

       This model of the equilibrium exchange rate draws attention to the

right variables in an exchange rate equation.                              -The right variables, in

addition to the lagged rate and the one period differential and change of

differential are the unanticipated components of the variables that

systematically affect exchange rates.                        Thus an unanticipated, permanent

increase in money will depreciate the exchange rate in the same proportion

if interest rates remain unaffected and more than proportionately if

interest rates transitorily decline.                        A change in the terms of trade,

with unchanged price trends and output will immediately depreciate the

exchange rate in the same proportion.

       From the perspective of the monetary approach this formulation suggests

that we need both a structural model that will tell us about longterm

determinants of exchange rates and the dynamics of the economy and we need

a model of the unanticipated component of the exogeneous variables.                               The

model differs, of course, from the monetary approach since the latter

could be written as:

where the   ~       denotes first differences.                 In contrast to (6)" we have in

(21) the unanticipated components of these first differences but we have

in addition other structural determinants of exchange rates as they

arise in a world not bound by strict PPP.                            To implement an equation like

(21) the procedure clearly parallels work on interest rates or·ou:tput

determination where the implications of rational expectations have

started to be tested.

4. The Portfolio Balance Model

       The portfolio balance model has received relatively less attention

than the simple monetary model.                   This is due, in part, to the data

requirements and in part to the fact that the theory is less structured
                                         - 40 -



in its predictions.        Nevertheless, drawing on work by Branson, Halttunen

and Masson (1977) and Porter (1977) we can report some results for the $/DM

exchange rate.

       We recall from equation (14)' that the equilibrium exchange rate is

determined by relative asset supplies.            More particularly, an increase

in the ratio of money to domestic assets           w~ll   lead to a depreciation

as will an increase in the ratio of domestic assets to foreign assets.

The tests that have been performed have excluded domestic assets entirely

and thus focus     on~y   on money and net foreign assets where the latter are

optained by cumulating current account surpluses.

        In the Branson-Halttunen-Masson (BHM) model the $/DM exchange rate

is estimated for the period 1971:8-1976:12:

                                                                                  2

                (-.1)   (-1.7)   (2.8)   (1.7)    (-1.9)

where    t-statistics are given in parenthesis, and where M, M*- F arid F*
denote German and       u.s.   monimal money stocks and net external assets.

The equation supports the theory in that the coefficients of
money and foreign assets have the correct signs.              The corresponding

elasticities are respectively: -.73, 1.85, .05 and -.22.

        These elasticities with respect to money very broadly support a

monetary view•. The interesting novelty, however, is the inclusion of

net foreign assets which here have an unambiguous effect.             A current

account surplus, by leading to accumulation of external assets, gives rise

to an appreciation •. This is an important link tha~ had been neglected by

earlier asset market views and for which support is therefore all the more
important.

      I see the chief interest of the       portfolio model    as a direction of

research that moves exchange rate theory away from money and PPP toward

a perspective that   emphasi~es   increasingly real variables: relative asset

suppliesJexchange rate expectations, the terms of trade and the current account.

5. The Impact of Traded Goods Price Movements

      In this section we study briefly the impact that movements· in traded

goods prices exert on the economy.      Two questions concern us here.      One

is the extent to which an increase in import prices increases consumer

prices and the GNP deflator.      That question is important because it

measures the inflationary impact of exchange depreciation as brought

about, for example, by expansionary monetary policy.          The second question

concerns the responsiveness of trade flows to relative price changes.

That question is of interest because it measures the extent to which

depreciation induced movements in competitiveness create net exports and

thus aggregate demand.    B9th que~t~Qns. ~~e e~sent~al ~s~ects o~ the

dynamic extension of the Mundell-fleming model in section 5 above.

i.   The Inflationary Impact of Import Prices:

     An exchange rate depreciation will, for given world prices raise the

domestic price of imports.   There is thus a direct impact on consumer

prices to the extent that the CPI includes importables.         There are

additional effects, however, to the extent that prices of closely

competing goods will tend to rise.     Finally there may be a more time

consuming adjustment as money wages rise in response to the induced
                                                - 42 -




CPI inflation.       We have tried to capture all these effects in a rough

way by a price equation that relates the rate of CPI and GNP deflator

inflation to their own lagged levels,                     the prime male unemployment, u,

        The equations strongly support the idea that an increase in import

prices spills over into increased domestic inflation.                   In the shortrun

an increase in import price inflation of two percentage points will

raise domestic inflation by about a third of one percent.                  The longrun

effect is about double that figure.              It is perhaps interesting to note that

the maqnitude of the short and longrun effects of import prices sub-

stantia~y       exceed the share of imports in GNP or expenditure and thus

demonstrate that there is substantial spillover.

        The impact of import prices on domestic prices can thus be determined

with considerable accuracy.           The harder question is the impact of
depreciation on import prices.             Here we have substantial differences

across commodities.          A reasonable approximation would be to assume that

an across the board one percent depreciation in the effective exchange

Orate would raise import prices by between a third and a half percentage
                                        - 43 -




point.    The difference is made up in part by a decline in prices abroad

and in part by a reduction in foreign profit margins.

       If we combine these numbers with those in Table 1 we conclude that

a five percentage point depreciation in the effective exchange rate

would in the shortrun raise inflation by about four tenths of a percent

and in the longrun by about double that amount.        For the US there is

thus clearly an inflationary impact but it really is not very substantial

in magnitude.

       The experience of Germany, Switzerland or Japan is of course quite

different.    With substantially more open economies import prices exert

a more sizeable effect on domestic prices.        Accordingly the large.

appreciations which these countries have experienced have made a large

contribution toward stabilization of inflation.        Table 5 shows inflation rates
of consumer          and import prices for these countries.    Chart 3 looks at the case

of Japan.     With import prices actually declining there is a powe;r:ful check on

domestic wage and price movements and thus a possibility of reducing inflation
without a major recession.

iL   The Responsiveness of Trade Flows:

        To complete our framework of reference we briefly look at the

responsiveness of trade flows to changes in relative prices.           We noted

earlier that an expansionary monetary policy will depreciate the exchange

rate and thus change relative prices.         We now ask how much of a change

in net exports can be expected.         There is of course a wide body of

empirical studies to draw on.       We limit ourselves here to some recent

estimates by Deppler and Ripley (1978), Goldstein and Khan (1978) and

Hooper (1978).

        Table 6 summarizes the elasticities with respect to relative prices

that emerge from these studies for the case of the         us:

~ote:     On the export side estimates a. and" b. are from Goldstein and
          Khan (1978). The estimates for manufactured goods are from
          Deppler and Ripley (1978). The shortrun for the former is a
          quarter, for the latter a year. The non-oil import elasticity
          estimates are from Hooper (1978) using equations without a
          time trend.
                                    - 46 -



     The table reveals two by now well established facts.     First, that

there is substantial longrun adjustment to relative price changes.      The

cumulative response of world demand to a reduction of five percent in

the relative price of US export goods is about ten percent.     Similarly on

the import side we have evidence for substantial elasticities in the

longrun response.

     The second fact concerns adjustment lags.    These lags are very

pronounced as can be seen from the difference between shortrun and

longrun elasticities.    The exact time shape of the response is very hard

to determine with    any precision but can readily be summarized by saying
that full adjustment is a matter of years, not quarters.

     The evidence then suggests that a reduction in the relative price

of OS goods will increase net exports and thus improve the current account

and add to demand.     In this direction there is some compensation for

the inflationary effect of monetary policy through increased prices.        It

is important to recognize, though, that the trade adjustment is slow

and that accordingly this channel of monetary policy may be a poor instrument

of cyclical stabilization policy.

III.   CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS

       The theoretical framework and the empirical evidence allow us to

form some tentative conclusions about the determination of exchange rates

and the scope for monetary policy under flexible rates.     The conclusions

must remain tentative because the theory itself remains very much in flux -

much as the domestic counterpart in macroeconomics, and because the empirical

evidence is! only starting to come in and to receive proper scrutiny.

With these caveats in mind here are some conclusions:

       A first conclusion must concern the "right" model of exchange rate

determination.     I take the evidence, theoretical and empirical, to reject

the monetary approach in the narrow way in which it has been empirically

implemented.     The portfolio approach is important because it draws

attention to the current account but the empirical work remains largely

to be done.    My own preference remains with an extended Mundell-Fleming

mOdel that recognizes the determination of exchange rates in assets

markets, the differential speeds of adjustment of assets and goods markets

and the central role of expectations of the future exchange rate in

influencing the current rate.     PPP in this model is a longrun tendency,

although of course the terms of trade may have to change secularly to

accomodate biased growth.patterns.     Given such a framework, what are our

conclusions about monetary policy?

       (i). Monetary policy under flexible rates and high capital mobility

works not only by affecting the interest sensitive components of

aggregate demand but also by increasing net exports.    Expansionary

monetary policy will depreciate the exchange rate and thereby, at least

temporarily, improve our competitiveness.
                                    - 48 -




     (ii)   Will expansionary monetary policy improve the current account?

The gain in competitiveness that is at least transitorily gained by an

expansionary monetary policy will no doubt by itself improve net exports

and thus add to aggregate demand.    There is, however, a potentially

Offsetting increase in imports arising from the domestic expansion in

demand due "to lower interest rates and thus higher investment and con-

sumption spending.   The net effect on the current account remains uncertain

since it depends on the relative magnitudes of the decline in interest

rates and the response of aggregate demand to interest rates and the

composition of spending to relative prices.    It is certainly not a

foregone conclusion (except when interest rates cannot at all decline

                                                                -
from the world level) that monetary expansion and depreciation must
                                                .

improve the current account.   To the extent, though, that the interest

rate effects in the first place affect construction one would not expect

the adverse absorption effects on the current account to' arise early

compared to the relative price effects.
                                        - 49 -




     (iii)       Monetarr policy has an immediate effect on exchange rates.

A change in the nominal quantity of money in the shortrun is a change

in the real quantity of money which will bring about a change in interest

rates.     With changed interest rates and unchanged expectations spot

rates have to move to maintain yields in line internationally.         If

monetary policy affects exchange rate expectations then the exchange

rate adjustments have to be even more pronounced.

     (iv)       The instability or volatility of exchange rates arises from

two sources.       The first is the very low interest elasticity of money

qemand which implies that fluctuations in the demand or supply of money

produce large fluctuations in interest rates and therefore require

large movements in exchange rates to maintain yields internationally.

The second source is instability in the exogeneous variables--there is

plenty of news.

     (v)        Movements in exchange rates affect the level of import prices

directly and spillover into consumer, wholesale and producer prices.

The extent and speed of this spillover       ~s   an essential question from

the perspective of monetary policy.        While the incz:ease in import prices

is helpful in establishing a gain in competitiveness it of course hurts

from a point of view of inflation.        The more rapid and the more substantial

the spillover of import prices into domestic prices the more inflationary

is monetary policy and the less effective it is with respect to

aggregate demand.

         (vi)    The-empirical evidence indicates that the changes in real

exchange rates and competitiveness induced by nominal exchange rate
                                   - 50 -




movements persist for a considerable length of time.   The reaction of

trade flows and direct investment to these changes in relative prices

are, however, slow to come about so that the net export channel cannot

be. counted upon as one of the more rapid responses to monetary policy.

     Having reviewed in a broad manner the implications of theory and

evidence for the role of monetary policy under flexible rates we conclude

with another aspect of the same question:    to what extent do monetary

factors account for the ongoing depreciation of the dollar?     There is

a worrying temptation, in this connection, to look to monetary factors

as the dominant explanation.   Thus the Wall Street Journal in a

continuing public education effort has reminded us once more:

           " ••• And surely the price of the dollar depends on supply
           and demand for the dollar. It declines because the
           Federal Reserve supplies more dollars than are demanded.
           For all the talk of swap networks, gold sales and so on,
           the only way the decline will be reversed is for the Fed
           to constrict the supply of dollars."l

Table 7 summarizes monetary growth rates for M for some of the major
                                              I
industrialized countries and the US.   The table also shows the

behavior of the effective dollar exchange rate.    Note that for the

 last five quarters the dollar has been depreciating, although US

monetary growth has been among the lowest.    Note in particular German

monetary growth which surely must be reckoned high.    No doubt the

 lesson of the monetary approach--the exchange rate is the relative

price of two moneys--must have been overlooked.

        If monetary factors do not account for the full extent of the

depreciation what factors should we look to for an explanation?                  Of

course we should remember that real factors do have an impact on

exchange rates.        Suppose a given trend of monetary policies in the US

and abroad and therefore a given trend of prices.                  Suppose now that a

current account deficit arises and that there is no expectation that

it will close in the near future of itself.                  A change in the terms of

trade will be required to restore competitiveness and thus help

achieve full employment current account balance.                 A deterioration

of our terms of trade, of course, with a given path of prices will

require a depreciation of the exchange rate.

        Now let me argue why I believe this story to be the major

explanation for the dollar depreciation.                I see two main reasons for
                                      - 52 -


a "structural"    u.s. current account deficit. One is the medium-term
reduced growth rates in other industrialized countries, in particular

Japan and Germany.     This implies that with .unchanged    u.s. growth (I take
it a 3.5-4% growth path will be maintained) and given the evidence on

u.s.   and foreign income elasticities in trade there will be continuing

if not growing imbalance.

       The second and possibly more important reason is the growing competitiveness

of LDCs in manufacturing trade.      These countries have achieved substantial

industrialization in their domestic markets and have to look to the world

market for continuing growth.     They have already shown impressive performance

in the   u.s. market as evidenced by the fact that their share in our manufactured
imports in the last five years has risen from 15% to more than 20%.          I

suspect that this trend will be substantially accelerated as the large

European and Japanese direct investment in these countries starts to

bear fruit.     The U.S. market will increasingly prove to be the testing

ground for newcomer's export drives.      The resulting effect for our

current account is unquestionably a deterioration unless we manage to

outpace with new products and innovations the rate at which the rest of

the world imitates    u.s. techniques.
       At present there is no evidence of a restructuring of the economy

toward a dynamic., trade oriented stance.        Accordingly there is no surprise

that the market should anticipate deteriorating terms of trade and ongoing

depreciation.     The anticipation of course translates into an immediate

depreciation.     The depreciation   p~esents,   of course, a conflict.   It is

directly and immediately inflationary and to that extent interferes

seriously with an attempt to contain inflation.         At the same time, though,

it contributes to a restoration of U.S. competitiveness and thus helps
                                 - 53 -



maintain or increase aggregate demand.    Since the medium term deterioration:

in the terms of trade is largely inevitable it is important not to interfere

with the depreciation but rather to concentrate on a more basic macroeconomic

reorientation toward fiscal restraint for an improvement in the current

account combined with monetary and fiscal policies conducive to investment

and growth.
