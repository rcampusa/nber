Some Evidence on Secular Drivers of U.S. Safe Real Rates
Kurt G. Lunsford and Kenneth D. West
NBER Working Paper No. 25288
November 2018
JEL No. E43

                                         ABSTRACT

We study long run correlations between safe real interest rates in the U.S. and over 30 variables
that have been hypothesized to influence real rates. The list of variables is motivated by an
intertermporal IS equation, by models of aggregate savings and investment, and by reduced form
studies. We use annual data, mostly from 1890 to 2016. We find that safe real interest rates are
correlated as expected with demographic measures. For example, the long run correlation with
labor force hours growth is positive, which is consistent with overlapping generations models.
For another example, the long run correlation with the proportion of 40 to 64 year-olds in the
population is negative. This is consistent with standard theory where middle-aged workers are
high-savers who drive down real interest rates. In contrast to standard theory, we do not find
productivity to be positively correlated with real rates. Most other variables have a mixed
relationship with the real rate, with long run correlations that are statistically or economically
large in some samples and by some measures but not in others.

                                           1. INTRODUCTION


         It is well known that the safe real rate in the U.S. has declined over the last several decades. This
decline poses difficulties for monetary policy because of the effective lower bound (Yellen (2016)), and
may also signal secular changes in growth prospects (Summers (2016)). Hence it is vital to understand
the reasons for this secular decline. In this paper we present some reduced form evidence on the decline,
via estimation of long run correlations between the safe real interest rate in the U.S. and some variables
that have been posited to move with safe rates.

         There are broadly three approaches to thinking about long term movements in safe real interest
rates or its close cousin the natural rate of interest.1 The approaches are not inconsistent, and can and do
coexist in a given model. But they differ in which factors receive pride of place. One approach looks to
secular movements in growth. Downward trends in real rates are tied to downward trends in growth (e.g.,
Laubach and Williams (2003), Yi and Zhang (2017)). This can be motivated from an intertemporal IS
equation consistent with Weil (1989) and Epstein and Zin (1991) preferences, or the constant elasticity
specialization familiar from both asset pricing (e.g., Nason and Smith (2008)) and New Keynesian models
(e.g., Galí (2011)). A second approach looks to aggregate desired savings and investment. Outward
shifts in the supply of savings or inward shifts in investment demand will result in lower real rates.
Factors that have been posited to be important shifters include labor force (Baker et al. (2005)), age
distributions (e.g., Lisack et al. (2017)), the price of investment goods relative to consumption goods
(e.g., Sajedi and Thwaites (2016)), flight to quality (e.g., del Negro et al. (2017)) and government saving
or dissaving (e.g., Ball and Mankiw (1995)). Rachel and Smith (2015) provide a recent application of the
aggregate supply and demand approach. Finally, some reduced form work has looked at some additional
factors associated with the Mundell (1963)-Tobin (1965) effect. For example, Rapach and Wohar (2005)
argue that regimes with higher inflation tend to have lower real rates.

        We, too, take a reduced form approach. Using the literature outlined in the previous paragraph,
we construct a list of over 30 variables hypothesized to be correlated with safe real rates. We call these
variables “correlates.” We apply frequency and time domain techniques to estimate long run correlations
between the safe real rate and each correlate. To estimate these long run correlations, we have collected
long time samples of our correlates, most of which span 1890-2016. Because of the influence of the
world wars, as well as possible drift in moments, we also present results for a 1950-2016 subsample.

         Our data and econometric approach have benefits relative to much of the literature that accounts
for trends in safe real rates. First, we look at an unusually broad set of correlates, allowing us to compare
a comprehensive set of variables that have previously been analyzed only in various subsets. Second, our
120+ years of data has an unusually long span. For inference about long run phenomena, a long data span
is useful and perhaps essential. Finally, our econometric techniques are not tied to parametric models or
even a particular assumption about the order of integration of the data. We rely on Müller and Watson
(2018) to supply confidence intervals for long run correlations that are robust to a range of orders of
integration. This range allows (but does not require) the safe rate to have a different order of integration
than a correlate. The possibility of different orders of integration seems important to allow, because the
safe rate is very persistent but some correlates, such as per capita GDP growth, are not.

        The estimates of long run correlations yield four notable results. First, growth in aggregate labor
hours co-moves with the real rate as predicted by growth models or models of aggregate saving and
investment. Second, demographic variables generally co-move with the real rate as predicted by

                                                      1
overlapping generations models or models of aggregate saving and investment. For example, there is a
negative long run correlation between the safe rate and the fraction of the population aged 40-64 and a
positive long run correlation between the safe rate and the dependency ratio (percentage less than 20 or
older than 65). These two results are consistent with much recent literature that points to working age
population growth and age distributions as major factors in our current run of low safe real rates (Gagnon
et al. (2016), Kara and von Thadden (2016)).

         Third, we find a negative rather than a positive long run correlation between the safe rate and
TFP growth and thus, presumably, between the safe rate and trend growth. Fourth, other variables
suggested by the three approaches listed above deliver a mixed picture. Examples include GDP growth,
the current account and interest rate spreads (correlated with the real rate as expected in the 1950-2016
subsample but not in the 1890-2016 sample as a whole) and inflation and money growth (correlated with
the real rate as expected in the 1890-2016 sample but not the 1950-2016 subsample).

         Much current conventional wisdom views trend GDP growth as the primary driver of the secular
trend in safe real rates (Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016), Fischer (2016, 2017)). However, the results
in this paper and in research such as Leduc and Rudebusch (2014) and Hamilton et al. (2016) suggest that
GDP growth and real rates do not show a reliably positive low frequency correlation. Now, GDP growth
is driven by both productivity and labor hours growth. We find negative low frequency correlations
between productivity growth and real rates, but positive low frequency correlations between labor growth
and real rates. That is, labor growth shows a low frequency correlation with real rates that is reliably of
the sign predicted by the economic models cited above. Hence, if forced to rely on a growth variable,
labor hours growth seems preferable to GDP growth or TFP growth as a low frequency correlate of real
rates.

        Beyond the previous paragraph’s decomposition of GDP growth into productivity growth and
labor growth, we do not attempt to tease out reasons for mixed results noted in our fourth result. We do
conclude that even with over a century of data, it is difficult to eliminate all but one or two variables as
especially important correlates of safe real rates. This may be because of limited data span, or regime
change, or of course it may be because in fact there are many important correlates.

        A semantic note: we use “low frequency,” “long run” and “trend” interchangeably.

        Section 2 outlines the models that motivate our list of correlates. Section 3 describes our
empirical methods, section 4 our data, section 5 empirical results. Section 6 concludes. Two on-line
appendices contain some results omitted from the paper to save space.

                                       2. UNDERLYING MODELS

         Here we outline models that motivate the variables that we examine in our reduced form
approach. We refer to these variables as potential “correlates” of the safe real interest rate rt. The models
that we are about to describe generally determine these variables jointly with rt, and we do not attempt to
rationalize causality from correlates to rt. As well, some of these models relate rt to the correlates not just
at low frequencies but at each instant. But our interest in secular movements in rt causes us to focus on
low frequencies.

        We draw on three approaches. The first relies on a first order condition that relates consumption
growth to the real interest rate–the Weil (1989) and Epstein and Zin (1991) version of an intertemporal IS

                                                       2
equation. The second involves an informal denumeration of factors affecting aggregate savings supply
and aggregate investment demand. The third uses reduced form VARs. The three approaches are of
course not inconsistent, and determinants suggested by one are often also suggested by another.

2.1 Intertemporal IS: We begin with the Weil (1989) and Epstein and Zin (1991) intertemporal condition
for optimal consumption. With some abuse of terminology, we will refer to this as “the intertemporal IS”,
though this term is generally confined to the constant elasticity specialization given in (2.5) below.

        Let Ct = consumption. Preferences are

(2.1)   Ut = { (1-β)Ct[(1-γ)/θ] + β[EtU1t +- γ1]1/θ }[θ/(1-γ)].

where

(2.2)   β=discount factor;
        γ=relative risk aversion;
        θ = (1-γ) / (1-ψ –1), with
        ψ = intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

Per period utility of the familiar form C1t –σ is a special case in which ψ –1=γ (so θ=1) and σ/ψ –1 (=γ).

         Let 1+it = known gross return on a nominally safe asset (issued in period t, payoff in period t+1),
Pt = price level, Pt+1/Pt = stochastic gross inflation, Rmt+1 = gross stochastic return on the market
portfolio. Then the first order condition for purchase of a nominal one period bond (Campbell et al.
(1997, p319)) is
                                                /
                       1  it       Ct 1 
(2.3)   1 = βθEt[                                    (Rmt+1)θ-1]
                    ( Pt 1 / Pt )  Ct 

Let πt+1 = ln(Pt+1/Pt), Δct+1 = ln(Ct+1/Ct), rmt+1 = ln(Rmt+1). The on-line appendix shows how a second
order log linearization of (2.3), in conjunction with a second order log linearization of the comparable
first order condition for purchase of a share in the market portfolio, leads to
                                                                 1
(2.4)   ln(1+it) - Etπt+1 . -lnβ + (1/ψ)EtΔct+1 - 2 [(θ/ψ 2)vartΔct+1 + vartπt+1 + 2(θ/ψ)covt(Δct+1,πt+1)]
                                               1
                                        + 2 (θ-1)[vartrmt+1 + 2 covt(rmt+1,πt+1)].

Here, “vart” and “covt” denote conditional variance and covariance. In the isoelastic case, with γ=ψ –1 and
σ / ψ –1, (2.4) is the familiar intertemporal IS equation
                                                             1
(2.5)   ln(1+it) - Etπt+1 . -ln(β) + σEtΔct+1 - 2 [σ2vartΔct+1 + vartπt+1+ 2σcovt(πt+1,Δct+1)].

        The left hand side of (2.4) and (2.5)–the real rate of interest on a nominally safe security–is our
variable of interest. After approximating ln(1+it) . it, our empirical counterpart to the left hand side,
which we call rt, is constructed via

(2.6)   rt = it-Etπt+1.


                                                                     3
We use rolling regressions to construct Etπt+1 (details below).

         The well known Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016) model for the natural rate of interest relies
in large measure on (2.5). That model focuses on trend output growth as a determinant, with trend growth
motivated by the EtΔct+1 term. Trend output growth in turn suggests TFP growth as a determinant. Other
research that has pointed to TFP growth as a long run determinant of real rates includes Yi and Zhang
(2017). The second order terms in (2.5) have received attention in Nason and Smith (2008).2 The
additional second order terms in (2.4) have been an element in models that solve Weil’s (1989) “risk free
rate” puzzle (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)). We measure the return on the market portfolio as the real
return on the S&P 500.

         From this literature, we are motivated to consider the set of potential correlates listed in lines
(1)-(3) in Table 1. “Aggregate growth” will be measured by per capita consumption growth (per (2.3)),
per capita GDP growth, and TFP growth. Apart from the two terms in (2.4) involving rmt+1, the entries in
the “expected sign” column come directly from (2.4): positive for aggregate growth, negative for second
moments. The terms involving rmt+1 in principle have ambiguous expected signs, since θ-1 may be either
positive or negative. We take both calibration (Bansal and Yaron (2004)) and estimation (Rapach and
Tan (2018)) studies as arguing that θ<1. Hence we give “-” as the expected sign for these two variables.

        Of course, (2.4) is an equilibrium relationship and the entries under “expected sign”
unambiguously follow from (2.4) only if we hold all other variables constant. But here and throughout
Table 1, we present the sign relevant if the variable is a dominant determinant of r and thus displays an
unconditional correlation whose sign is consistent with the conditional correlation delivered when other
variables are held constant.

2.2 Aggregate savings and investment Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1990) is an early example and Rachel and
Smith (2015) is a recent example of research that considers trends in r when r is determined by the
intersection of aggregate desired savings and aggregate desired investment. Factors that might shift the
aggregate savings schedule include: demographics, such as the dependency ratio; inequality; government
savings or dissavings; the emerging market savings glut; the spread between safe and risky rates. Factors
that might shift the aggregate investment schedule include labor force growth and the falling relative price
of capital goods.

        Lines (4)-(10) in Table 1 list the correlates we consider. For brevity, we limit ourselves to one or
two cites for each of our assertions.

•Baker et al. (2005) observe that in the steady state of certain overlapping generations models (and in the
Solow model) interest rates are positively related to the rate of labor force growth.3 Kara and von
Thadden’s (2016) numerical results illustrate that the positive relationship also obtains in Blanchard’s
(1985) and Gertler’s (1999) multiperiod finite lived model. Hence the “+” in line (4a). Those models
typically have labor inelastically supplied. We use labor hours to allow for fluctuations in labor hours per
individual. In a standard production function, an increase in the capital labor ratio is associated with a
lower return to capital (all else equal). Hence the “-” in line (4b). We measure capital deepening as
growth in capital per hour.

•Define the dependency ratio as the percentage of the population younger than 20 or older than 64. An
increase in the dependency ratio will shift the savings schedule in, thus raising r (Gagnon et al. (2016));
an increase of the fraction middle aged will work in the opposite direction. Geanakoplos et al. (2004)

                                                      4
argue that changes in what they call the middle to young ratio will be positively correlated with r; we
conclude from their study that the change in the fraction middle aged will also be positively correlated
with r. Carvalho et al. (2016) argue that an increase in life expectancy will lower r, because workers will
save more expecting a longer retirement period.

•Transitory decreases in government saving–i.e., increases in government purchases or decreases in taxes
financed by borrowing–have been argued to push up real rates (Ball and Mankiw (1995)). If those
transitory decreases happen every couple of decades, say because of wars, then there will be a low
frequency link between government saving or dissaving and real rates. And even with lump sum taxes, in
non-Ricardian models there can be a long run relation between government debt and real variables, with
higher debt/GDP associated with higher interest rates (Gertler (1999)). Hence the “+” in line 6 (higher
deficits and higher debt mean higher r).

•U.S. current account deficits have an ambiguous effect. Bernanke (2005) argues that these deficits
reflect an inflow of savings to the U.S. so that increased deficits are associated with lower real rates. In
contrast, if current account deficits are driven by increased local demand, then an increased deficit is
associated with higher real rates.4 We view Bernanke’s (2005) global savings glut hypothesis as more
widely endorsed, so there is a “+” in the “current account” line.

•A falling relative price of investment also has ambiguous effects–a smaller expenditure on capital is
needed to produce a given amount of output, but firms have an incentive to shift into capital.
Eichengreen (2015), citing the IMF (2014), argues that the empirical evidence indicates that the sign is
positive.

•Since higher income families have lower marginal propensities to consume (Dynan et al. (2004)), an
increase in inequality will shift the saving schedule out, lowering r.

•Finally, an increase in spreads that results from a flight to quality will depress safe rates as savings are
shifted from risky investment to Treasury debt (del Negro et al. (2017)).

2.3 Mundell-Tobin effect Here we add variables not directly suggested by the previous two literatures. In
particular, some reduced form studies find that inflation regimes or inflation expectations regimes are
correlated with r (Koedijk et al. (1994), Rapach and Wohar (2005)). So we add the rate of inflation and
the rate of money growth to our list of potential correlates. Consistent with the Mundell (1963)-Tobin
(1965) effect, the studies just cited find that higher inflation is associated with lower r. Hence we posit
money growth and inflation will show a negative correlation with r.

2.4 But what about DSGE models? Our list of variables includes ones consistent with the logic of DSGE
models that dominate monetary economics today. For example, a first order condition similar to (2.1) is
ubiquitous in such models; even when (2.1) is generalized to allow features such as habit persistence there
is still a link between trend growth and low frequency movement in r (see Hamilton et al. (2016)). Some
such models include technology shocks that lead to a trend in the relative price of investment (e.g.,
Justiniano et al (2011)). On the other hand, such models typically do not have a life cycle component,
nor, so far as we know, do they tie secular movements in real rates to movements in inflation or money.
Hence our decision not to motivate our list from a DSGE model.

2.5 r vs. r* We are interested in long run determinants of the safe interest rate rt. A related though
distinct object is the “equilibrium” or “natural rate” of interest, call it r*t . A question raised by early

                                                         5
readers of this paper is the implications of our study for r*t . Of course an answer to that depends on
exactly how one defines r*t . For the purposes of this subsection, let us understand r*t as the real rate
consistent with output being at potential. In New Keynesian models, this is the level of output consistent
with flexible goods prices and wages and constant markups in goods and labor markets.

        Now, some of the models cited above, such as overlapping generations models, are real models
with competitive markets. Hence, the interest rate in those models is the natural rate, and those models
have no need to separately define and reference rt and r*t . Insofar as one interprets the steady state of such
models as being compatible with the steady state of related New Keynesian models, one could reasonably
suppose that low frequency movements in correlates suggested by those models–labor hours growth, for
example–will be associated with low frequency movements in rt and r*t in the same direction. This is
because in the typical New Keynesian model, the steady state values of rt and r*t , which are determined by
purely real forces, are the same (see Galí (2011)). Of course, there may be New Keynesian models in
which a primitive shock causes labor hours growth or another correlate to have low frequency
associations with rt and r*t of opposite sign–hence our use of the phrase “reasonably suppose.”

        In other models cited above (e.g., Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016)), rt and r*t do both appear.
As just noted, in the typical New Keynesian model, the steady state values of rt and r*t are the same;
moreover, both respond similarly to growth in technology. So one can state unambiguously that for low
frequency movements in TFP growth, predictions for rt are also applicable to r*t in those models. That
need not be true for all correlates that appear in New Keynesian models. For example, in the basic new
Keynesian model monetary shocks affect rt (transitorily) but not r*t (even transitorily). Thus if there is a
low frequency component to monetary shocks or to inflation caused by money shocks, that model
predicts a low frequency association with rt but not r*t .5

            In sum, the reader should understand that while our study will shed light on the correlates of trend
r*t , that is a byproduct of our study of the correlates of trend rt. But it is not the central purpose of our
study. Indeed, we will have no further occasion to discuss r*t .


                                        3. EMPIRICAL METHODS

         Let xt be one of our potential correlates of rt. We do not perform tests for stationarity. In some
respects we rely on the literature cited above to decide whether to difference a variable before relating it
to rt. For example, we use growth rates of TFP but levels of the relative price of investment goods. As
described below, we also present results robust to r and a given correlate being I(0) or I(1) or even
fractionally integrated.

        For a given correlate, we measure the strength of the long run correlation with rt via both
frequency and time domain techniques. The frequency domain technique produces an estimate of the low
frequency correlation between xt and rt. The time domain technique simply averages xt and rt over long
periods (with 10 years as our window) and computes a correlation using the averages as observations.

        In the end, the two approaches yielded qualitatively similar results. Hence we will sometimes use
“low frequency correlation” or “long run correlation” to encompass both types of correlations.

3.1 Low frequency correlation For rt and a given correlate xt, we rely on Müller and Watson (2018) to
filter out frequencies higher than 10 years and compute the low pass correlation between the resulting low

                                                       6
frequency series. One can think of this as a band spectral regression applied to frequencies lower than 10
years (Engle (1974)), with the regression coefficient renormalized to be expressed as a correlation rather
than a regression coefficient. The confidence interval that comes with the point estimate relies on
asymptotic arguments and procedures for inference quite different from preceding literature on band
spectral regression (see Müller and Watson (2018) and below).

       We compute the low pass correlation first under the assumption that rt and xt are I(0), letting
  LP
“ρ -I(0)” denote the resulting correlation. Here, “LP” stands for low pass.

        We also compute the low pass correlation under Müller and Watson’s (2018) procedure that
produces a confidence interval robust to rt and xt each being I(d) for any value of d between -0.4 and 1.6
They refer to this as the (A, B, c, d) model, and supply code (used by us). Using a uniform prior on d, the
code first executes Bayesian estimation of the low pass correlation from this model. We report the
posterior mean correlation, denoted as “ρLP-I(d) .” Posterior median correlations are reported in the
appendix. The code then adjusts the equal-tailed Bayes credible set to produce a confidence interval that
enforces coverage over the entire set of values of d considered, according to what Müller and Watson call
an approximate least favorable distribution.7 For additional details, see Müller and Watson (2018).

         As well, for a band spectral regression of rt on the correlate, we report the R2 for ρLP-I(0) and the
posterior mean R2 for ρLP-I(d). The R2 for ρLP-I(0) is merely the square of the estimate of the long run
correlation. The posterior mean R2 for ρLP-I(d) is not the square of the posterior mean of ρLP-I(d) but
instead is a weighted average of the posterior squared correlations where the weights are the posterior
probabilities. We do not necessarily endorse R2 as a measure of how much of rt is explained by a given
correlate. Rather, and recalling that in a bivariate regression such as ours R2 is a monotonic function of
the t-statistic on the correlate, R2 supplements the confidence interval as an indicator of the statistical
strength of the relationship.

3.2 Correlations of 10 year moving averages: Suppose we have annual data on xt and rt running from say
1890 to 2016. We compute 10 year moving averages 1890-1899, 1891-1900, ..., 2007-2016. We date
these 1899, 1900, ..., 2016. Let xtMA and rtMA be the resulting series of 118 observations, 1899-2016,
where “MA” is short for “moving average.” We use these observations to estimate the correlation
between xtMA and rtMA,

(3.2.1) corr(xtMA,rtMA ) / ρMA.

In initial work, all our computations were repeated with non-overlapping 10 year samples, with very little
change in point estimates. (That is, if we only use the 12 observations dated 1906, 1916, ..., 2016 to
compute the correlation, the value is very close to that computed from all 118 observations.)

         Confidence intervals are constructed from standard asymptotic theory, using Newey and West
(1994) to construct the relevant asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. See the on-line appendix for
details.


                                                  4. DATA

        We describe construction of real rates and briefly describe other sources of data. We use annual
data throughout. We aim to use samples that start in 1890, though some samples start later because of

                                                      7
limited data. We use long samples because of the limited information available about low-frequency
patterns or trends. For example, our 10 year moving averages yield only 12 non-overlapping
observations between 1890 to 2016. Hence, even though we use up to 127 years of data, which is long by
typical time series standards, the number of observations of the trend is limited.

        We note that using long samples comes with a cost since longer samples have greater possibility
of breaks and regime shifts. In particular, as we discuss below, the world wars have a large influence on
the behavior of real rates. But the world wars may not be informative about the movement in real rates in
the post-World War II decades. As well, unconditional moments and hence long run correlations may
have drifted over time. Hence, we also estimate long run correlations on a 1950-2016 sample.

4.1 Real rates For a nominally safe rate we use call money rates for 1870-1917, the discount rate for
1918-19, 3 to 6 month Treasury notes and certificates 1920-1933 and the three month T-bill for
1934-2016. These were obtained from the NBER Macro History Database and FRED. In the early years,
we use call rates rather than commercial paper because Homer and Sylla (2005) indicate that call loans
became more liquid in the late 19th century and because the call rates had lower average rates (suggesting
greater safety). In each case the year t value was the monthly average of January rates in year t+1. We
chose January in t+1 rather than December in t because of pronounced seasonality in call money rates.
For inflation we use the GNP/GDP deflator, from Romer (1989) for 1870-1929 and from the BEA (line 1
of NIPA table 1.1.4) for 1930-2016. We set expected inflation to zero through 1914. (See Barsky
(1987).) For 1914-present, we compute expected inflation from an AR(1) using rolling samples of 20
years, setting the AR(1) coefficient to 0.999 if it is estimated to exceed 1. In some initial work we
experimented with constructing expected inflation from an AR(1) for 1890-1913. Results were hardly
changed.

        Figure 4.1A plots the resulting real rate. One can see that rt is quite trendy, broadly trending
down until the mid 1940s, then trending up until around 1980, and then trending down again. There is a
very large negative spike in 1917 and another, not quite as large, in 1946. One can see in the plot in
Figure 4.1B that this reflects sharp positive spikes in expected inflation. Actual inflation (not plotted)
rose from 1% (1914) to 20% (1917) and was still in double digits (13%) in 1920; it rose from 1% (1940)
to 12% (1946) and remained elevated (5%) in 1948. (We comment on implications for trend real rates
below.)

        Figure 4.1C repeats the Figure 4.1A plot of rt along with both of our trend measures of rt.
Because the 10 year moving average series (labeled r-MA in the figure) is a backward average and the
low pass filtered series (r-LP) is two sided, the moving average series is shifted forward relative to the
low pass filtered series. But, that point aside, here and throughout almost all our analysis, the two trend
measures are very similar. The two slide downward together through the mid-1940’s. They then move
upward until the 1980s, with the Müller and Watson (2018) filtered series (labeled r-LP in the figure)
peaking a little earlier than does the 10 year moving average (r-MA). Finally, both move downward from
the mid-1980s to the present.

       Table 2 has basic statistics on the real rate, for a sample starting in 1890 along with the familiar
postwar period (1950-). The real rate is volatile, though it became less volatile in the postwar period.

        In the 1950-2016 column, the mean of 0.97% is below the conventionally presumed value of 2%.
This partly reflects our choice of nominal interest rate, the 3 month T-bill. Over the period of overlap
with the Federal Funds rate (1954-2016), the 3 month T-bill rate was 0.44% below the Fed funds rate on
average. As well, the beginning part of our 1950-2016 sample perhaps reflects financial repression that
lingered on after the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord, and the end of our sample of course includes the period
in which rates well below 2% inspired research such as ours. A shift in the interest rate measure and a
focus on the 1954-2007 period would yield a figure of about 2%.

         A similar comment applies to the longer sample period in Table 2. Our choice of nominal interest
rate (the call rate) was generally below a possible alternative, the commercial paper rate.

4.2 Correlates. For the most part, our correlates are constructed from U.S. data. When correlates were
expressed per capita, the data source for population was Carter et al. (2006).

•Real GNP/GDP growth, per capita. (a)U.S.: Romer (1989) prior to 1929, BEA (line 1 of NIPA table
1.1.3) 1930-2016. Romer and the BEA were also the sources for nominal GDP used in the denominator
of series described below that are expressed relative to GDP. (b)World: 23 countries, GDP measured at
purchasing power parity rates.8 Maddison Project 1890-2010, the IMF (GDP) and the UN (population)
2011-2015.

•Growth of real per capita consumption spending. (a)In the 1890- sample, we used total consumption
spending: Kuznets (1961) 1890-1929, (line 2 of NIPA table 1.1.3) BEA 1930-2016. (b)In the 1950-
sample, nondurables and services spending was available and hence was used (lines 5 and 6 of NIPA
Table 1.1.5).

•Growth in total factor productivity. Gordon (2016) 1890-1948, FRED series MFPNFBS 1949-1987, the

•Return on the market portfolio: S&P 500, with nominal December prices and January to December
nominal dividends from Robert Shiller’s web site (www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm); real annual
returns computed by deflating nominal prices and dividends.

•Conditional second moments in (2.2). Constructed from the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals
of a bivariate VAR(1) in a measure of inflation and a measure of either (a)aggregate growth or (2)the
market return. The VAR was estimated using 20 year rolling regressions.

•Growth in labor hours and in capital per hour. We used hours in private business: Kendrick (1961)
1890-1947, BLS series PRS84006033 (average of quarterly figures) 1948-2016. Capital growth is from
Gordon (2016) 1890-1948, and from the BLS (capital services in private business) 1949-2016.

•Demographic measures. (a)US: 1890 and 1900-1959 from Carter et al. (2006); 1891-1899 obtained by
linear interpolation of the 1890 and 1900 data. Life expectancy: 1960-2016 from FRED series
SPDYNLE00INUSA. Other US demographic variables: 1960-2000 from Carter et al. (2006); 2001-2016

                                                     10
from Haver Analytics. (b)World, 1950-2015: The UN’s World Population Prospects, using data for the
several dozen countries defined as high income in 2015 (United Nations (2017a,p156)).

•Income inequality. Share of income that goes to the top 10% of the income distribution. From the
World Wealth and Income Database, 1913-2015.

•Relative price of investment. Relative to total consumption. Kuznets (1961) 1889-1929, BEA (lines 2
and 7 of NIPA table 1.1.4) 1930-2016.

•Government dissaving. (a)Federal government primary deficit relative to GDP. Carter et al. (2006) for
1869-1939; FRED series FYFSD for 1940-2016 (multiplied by -1 so that a positive value means deficit).
(b)Federal debt/GDP. Carter et al. (2006) for 1869-1938; FRED series FYGFD for 1939-2016.

•Current account, expressed relative to GDP. Jordà et al. (2017) for 1870-1928; BEA (line 33 of NIPA
table 4.1) for 1929-2016.

•Spread between public and private borrowing rates: BAA minus 10 year Treasuries. FRED series BAA
1920-2016, with Treasury rates from Homer and Sylla (2005) 1920-1953 and FRED series GS10
1954-2016.

•Money growth. M1 1916-1947 and M2 1869-1947 from Carter et al. (2006); both series 1948-1958
from Rasche (1987); both series 1959-2016 from FRED (series M1NS and M2NS), average of monthly
figures.

         To keep tables of manageable length, we put in the on-line Appendix results with correlates that
in our view serve mainly to establish the robustness of the results presented here. Those correlates are:
labor productivity growth; growth in per capita capital; conditional moments with the price level
measured by alternative deflators; the change of the U.S. and world dependency ratios and the level and
difference of U.S. and world values of Geanakoplos’s (2004) MY ratio; Federal deficit/GDP and world
debt/GDP.

        The Appendix also contains the following plots for each of our correlates: scatterplots of 10 year
moving averages of r vs. the correlate, one with all observations 1890-2016 and one with every 10th
observation (the latter to give an uncluttered look at the progression of the relationship over time);
bivariate time series plots of Müller and Watson (2018) filtered r and filtered correlate, 1890-2016 and
1950-2016 sample. We present some time series plots of 10 year moving average data in our discussion
below.


                                       5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

5.1 Correlations: Overview Estimated correlations are in Table 3 (1890-2016) and Table 4 (1950-2016),
with 68% confidence intervals. We present 68% confidence intervals because as discussed above we only
have a small sample of observations on 10 year intervals. With a small sample, power is low. So a less
stringent standard for rejecting a correlation of zero seems warranted. (See the discussion in Müller and
Watson (2018).) Our on-line Appendix presents 90% confidence intervals.

        As stated in notes to Table 3, due to data availability, a few series end in 2015 or (in Table 3) start

                                                     11
later than 1890. Estimates whose confidence interval excludes zero are marked with a “*”, and will be
referred to as significant. The “(+)” and “(-)” in column (1) repeats, for convenience, entries in Table 1.
In interpreting the estimated sign of a correlation, we refer to “expected” and “unexpected” signs, though,
as noted above, the models described above generally make predictions about signs holding all other
correlates constant rather than an unconditional prediction. We defer discussion of economic significance
to a brief illustration, using conditional forecasts, at the end of this section; we do note that that analysis
suggests that correlations whose absolute values are 0.20 or larger can be economically significant. We
use ρMA, ρLP-I(0) and ρLP-I(d) to denote the population values of the estimates in columns (2), (3a) and
(4a).

         Some general comments, before discussing specific entries. First, for a given correlate, the
estimates of ρMA, ρLP-I(0) and ρLP-I(d) are similar. The signs of the all three point estimates are the same
in 19 of the 25 rows in Table 3 and 23 of the 28 rows in Table 4. (There are three more entries in Table 4
than in Table 3 because of world demographic variables.) When signs conflict across measures, it is
generally the case that all three point estimates are insignificant.

        Second, the three measures tend to agree not only in sign but in relative magnitude. We use rank
order correlation to summarize concordance of relative magnitude:

(5.1)    Rank order correlation of estimates       ρMA vs. ρLP-I(0)   ρLP-(0) vs. ρLP-I(d)   ρMA vs. ρLP-I(d)
               1890-2016                               0.94                   0.94              0.88
               1950-2016                               0.88                   0.94              0.77

The high rank order correlations of the estimates of course means that a correlation that is relatively large
by one measure also tends to be relatively large by the other two measures.

         Thus our discussion for the most part will not have need to distinguish between measures of
correlation, for either sign or relative magnitude.

5.2 Intertemporal IS In rows (1a)-(1c) of Table 3, we see that GDP and consumption growth have
correlations with safe real rates that are small in magnitude and in one case negative over the 1890-2016
sample. However, the same rows in Table 4 show that GDP and consumption growth fare better over the
1950-2016 sample. These findings that positive correlations between economic growth and real rates are
episodic corroborate earlier research (Leduc and Rudebusch (2014), Hamilton et al. (2016)). Further, in
our view, the mixed picture of signs and significance is consistent with the large literature that finds the
intertemporal IS equation wanting, absent second order terms considered below (e.g., Canzoneri et al.
(2007)).

         Figure 5.1A presents a time series plot of 10 year moving averages of r (identical to the r-MA
plot in Figure 4.1C) and of GDP growth. The positive correlation in the 1950-2016 sample is evident.
That the two series generally did not move together prior to 1950 is also evident, with the two series
moving in opposite directions almost every year from throughout the period from 1914 to 1945.

         Figure 5.1B replaces GDP growth with TFP growth (again, 10 year moving averages), with the
plot of trend r repeated.9 It is patently obvious that the correlation is (unexpectedly) negative. The two
series move in opposite directions not only during the Great Depression and World War II–when real
rates were low and TFP growth was high–but more generally. For example, during the period from the
mid-1980’s to the mid-2000’s, trend TFP growth rose and trend r fell. This striking result is quantified in

                                                      12
Tables 3 and 4 in row (1d): all six estimated correlations are unexpectedly negative (6 = 2 sample periods
× 3 estimates of long run correlations). Moreover, these estimates are usually significant.

                   Figure 5.1B. Real rate rt and TFP growth, 10 year moving averages




——————————————————————————————————————————


         We are not aware of prior use of TFP data to examine the low frequency relationship between the
safe real rate and TFP growth. Our finding of a negative correlation is inconsistent with earlier work that
has emphasized trend growth as a positive correlate of real rates (Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016), Yi
and Zhang (2017)). It is also inconsistent with standard economic theory (Baker et al. (2005)). To
explain persistently negative real rates following the 2008-09 recession, some economists have given
pride of place to persistently low productivity growth (e.g., Fischer (2016)). But the recent combination
of low real rates and low TFP growth is not reflective of the overall historical pattern of low frequency
movement between the two variables. We leave explanation of our finding to future research.

       The results for GDP and TFP growth may seem to conflict with the well-known work of
Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016), which uses a stripped down macro model and gives pride of place to

                                                    13
trend GDP growth as a determinant of the natural rate of interest. Laubach and Williams do not use TFP
data, however, so our negative TFP results are not in conflict with theirs in the narrow sense of yielding
different results for the same correlate. As well, GDP growth works as expected in our postwar sample,
and Laubach and Williams rely on postwar data. Thus in a narrow sense our results are consistent with
theirs. But in a broader sense, our results for TFP growth, and for GDP growth over the 1890-2016
sample, suggest that Laubach and Williams should not be interpreted as finding that trend growth
explains real rates. Indeed, we shall shortly offer evidence that some other correlates, which do not even
appear in Laubach and Williams’s model, have stronger low frequency ties to the real rate than does GDP
growth.

         While the mixed results for economic growth and the negative results for TFP growth suggest
that the intertemporal IS equation is wanting, the signs of the second moment variables in rows 2 and 3
are generally as expected in both samples. Further, by one or more measures of long run correlation the
estimates are significant. This is consistent with the view that time varying second moments are an
essential part of the intertemporal IS equation (Campbell and Cochrane (1999) or Bansal and Yaron
(2004)).

        For the intertemporal IS equation, then, the picture is mixed. For further insight, see the on-line
Appendix where we execute some low frequency regressions of rt on the linear combination of correlates
given on the right hand side of the intertemporal IS equation (2.4). The results are consistent with those
in Tables 3 and 4.

5.3 Aggregate savings and investment We now move to correlates suggested by models of aggregate
saving and investment. Across the two samples in Tables 3 and 4, the results in rows (4)-(10) can be
divided into three categories: the variable produces correlations of expected sign, sometimes significant,
in both sample periods (labor force growth, demographic variables); signs are sometimes as expected,
sometimes not (current account, relative price of investment goods, top 10% income share, Baa-10 year
spread, inflation/money growth); signs are not as expected (growth in capital per hour, measures of
government dissavings).

         The first of several correlates to produce correlations of expected sign is labor hours growth in
row (4). It is strongly positively correlated with r in both sample periods.10 The strong positive
correlation is evident in Figure 5.2A, which plots 10 year moving averages of r and of labor hours
growth. In contrast to GDP growth or TFP growth, labor hours growth trends down with r in the last
decades of the sample. Indeed, with the exception of the 1930’s, trend labor hours growth tends to move
in the same direction as trend r through the entire sample.

        We are not aware of previous reduced form research that has quantified a link between labor
hours growth and r. However, changes in trend employment growth associated with demographic change
are important for understanding real interest rate trends in the structural models of Gagnon et al. (2016)
and Kara and von Thadden (2016). As well, the informal calibration in Bullard (2017) uses trend labor
force growth as one of the determinants of trend r.

        Demographic variables comprise a second set of aggregate saving and investment correlates to
produce estimated correlations with the expected sign. There are 33 entries for demographic variables in
rows (5a)-(5d) in Table 3 and (5a)-(5g) in Table 4. 29 of these have expected sign, about half of which
are significant. In terms of support for demographic variables as correlates of real rates, these results fall
roughly midway between the regression results of Poterba (2001) on the one hand, who finds modest

                                                      14
support for demographic variables, and Geanakoplos et al. (2004) and Favero et al. (2016) on the other,
who find exceptionally strong support.

                Figure 5.2A. Real rate rt and labor hours growth, 10 year moving averages




                Figure 5.2B. Real rate rt and percent aged 40-64, 10 year moving averages




——————————————————————————————————————————


        Figure 5.2B plots 10 year moving averages of r and the percent aged 40-64. The expected
negative correlations presented in line (5b) of Table 3 and line (5c) of Table 4 reflect long periods when
the two moved in opposite directions: the mid-1900’s-mid 1920’s, 1930-1970, and the mid-1980’s-2016.
Note that the trend value of this correlate moves quite slowly. This perhaps suggests that one put more
weight on the I(d) estimates, or on the first difference estimates in lines (5c) (Table 3) and (5e) and (5f)
(Table 4). The dependency ratio is the only other correlate whose trend value appears equally slow
moving.

        The remaining aggregate saving and investment correlates do not consistently work as expected.
We begin with measures of government dissaving–Federal deficits and debt, in rows (6a) and (6b). These
correlates consistently yield estimates that have unexpected signs, and often are significant, especially in
the 1890-2016 full sample. This seems to reflect in part the two world wars, periods in which r was quite
low (indeed, negative) even though debt and deficits were high. As noted above, inflation and expected

                                                     15
inflation rose during those wars. But nominal rates did not rise commensurately. This likely reflects
financial repression as defined in Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015): nominal rates were kept low and
government debt was sold in large part to a captive market.11 In addition, our recent bout of negative real
rates came with large increases in federal deficits and debt following the 2008-09 recession. Thus our
results suggest that government dissaving may be of second order importance for trends in real rates and
that other factors, such as demographics, may dominate.

         Growth in capital per hour is a second correlate that consistently yields estimates that have
unexpected signs, though in this case the estimates are generally insignificant. Inspection of a plot of the
series of 10 year moving averages (not shown) indicates two extended periods when this correlate and r
moved down together: from the mid 1930s to the mid 1940s and the last 10 years. If we drop the last 10
years of the sample, the estimated correlation in the post-War sample changes from 0.10 (Table 4) to
-0.16, for example. The anemic growth of fixed investment in recent low interest rate years has of course
been often noted (e.g., Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017)); apparently, such growth was also weak for 10
year averages from the Depression through World War II, at least relative to labor growth.

         The final set of aggregate saving and investment correlates, in rows (7)-(10), display mixed
results. Estimates for the current account, relative price of investment goods, top 10% income share, and
Baa-10 year spread generally have unexpected signs for the 1890-2016 sample in Table 3, but expected
signs for the 1950-2016 sample in Table 4. However, even when the signs are as expected, the point
estimates are generally small and insignificant. Since our sample is unusually long, these results need not
contradict the evidence in research that focuses on relatively recent years (e.g., Bernanke (2005), Sajedi
and Thwaites (2016) or Del Negro et al. (2017)).

5.4 Mundell-Tobin effect The variables in rows (11) and (12) work as expected, and strongly so, in the
1890-2016 period. They do not work as expected in the 1950-2016 period. Over the longer sample, it
seems the correlations are dominated by trend rises in the nominal variables in the two World Wars and
the 1970s, periods in which the trend safe real rate was low. During the 1950-2016 period, behavior over
the last four decades gets more weight: trend real rates and trend inflation have drifted down, while trend
money growth has stayed more or less flat.

5.5 Summary As noted in the introduction, much current conventional wisdom views trend GDP growth
as the primary driver of the secular trend in safe real rates. The results reported here and in earlier
research (e.g., Hamilton et al. (2016)) suggest that in the data the low frequency link with GDP growth is
episodic, and the link with TFP growth is negative. A reduced form result that, so far as we know, is new
to this paper is that labor hours is a strongly positive low frequency correlate of the safe real rate. Hence,
if forced to rely on a growth variable, labor hours growth seems preferable to GDP growth as a low
frequency correlate of real rates.

        In the standard overlapping generations model, labor hours growth and TFP have a symmetric
effect on the real rate in steady state. Hence, our finding of oppositely signed correlations for labor hours
growth and TFP is unexpected. We suspect that labor hours works as expected because it partly reflects
the age variables that are conventionally captured by our other demographic variables. Specifically,
hours growth is the same as population growth in standard overlapping generations models. Thus,
increases in aggregate investment that are needed to match capital with labor are met with equal increases
in aggregate savings due to a larger population of savers. However empirically, hours growth also
captures low frequency trends in labor force participation and in the length of the work week. This will
cause low frequency fluctuations in the demand for capital without corresponding changes in population

                                                      16
of savers, generating an extra source of fluctuation in real rates from labor hours growth.

         Overall, labor hours growth and demographic variables seem to evidence the most reliable long
run correlation with the safe rate, with estimated long run correlations that come with expected signs and
generally are significant. Most other variables deliver a mixed picture in terms of such correlations.
Because of this, we view trends in labor hours growth and in demographic variables as being most
appealing if one is looking to use a small number of correlates to explain the trend the decline in safe real
interest rates over the past four decades.

5.6 Economic significance We have focused on statistical significance. We close with concise evidence
on economic significance, illustrated by the numerical magnitude of the change in a forecast of the trend
real rate when one makes a plausible change in the forecast of the trend value of the change in the
percentage of the population aged 40-64. Our illustration uses this correlate because of its good
performance in Tables 3 and 4.

            MA        MA
       Let r2026 and x2026 denote the 2026 trend values of the real rate and the percentage aged 40-64,
measured via the 10 year moving average. Define:

(5.2a) r^2026
         MA
              and x^2026
                    MA                              MA
                         are “direct” forecasts of r2026      MA
                                                         and x2026 ;

(5.2b) xN2026
         MA
              is an external forecast for the change in the percentage of the population aged 40-64, with
       N MA
       r2026 a forecast of the trend real rate conditional on xN2026
                                                                MA
                                                                    .

The direct forecasts in (5.2a) rely on coefficients from a regression of rtMA             MA
                                                                                10 and xt 10 on the current and first
lagged values of rt and xt; the regression sample runs from t+10=1960 to t+10=2016. In (5.2b), the
external forecast of the trend value of the percentage of the population aged 40-64 xN2026      MA
                                                                                                    comes from the
Social Security Administration (2017) and the United Nations (2017b). To construct Nr2026          MA
                                                                                                      , we follow
literature such as Clark and McCracken (2015), relying in part on an estimate of the correlation between
the residuals of the regression used to obtain the direct forecasts r^2026 MA
                                                                              and x^2026
                                                                                    MA
                                                                                        . Details on the construction
    ^ MA   ^ MA N MA        N MA
of r2026 , x2026, r2026 and x2026, are in the working paper version of this paper (Lunsford and West (2017)).

        We consider both x^2026
                            MA
                                and xN2026
                                      MA
                                           to be reasonable forecasts of the trend value of the change in the
percentage of the population aged 40-64. We ask whether moving from x^2026     MA
                                                                                  to xN2026
                                                                                       MA
                                                                                            results in an
economically significant change in trend forecasts of the real rate. The answer is yes. Equations (5.3a)
and (5.3b) illustrate for US and world Δpercentage aged 40-64.

                                                                                        N MA

(5.3a)       Δpercentage aged 40-64                       1.74         -0.19           1.47          -0.24
                                                       (0.69,2.79)                   (0.73,2.20)

The implied elasticies are large. From (5.3a), we see that a 0.05 fall from -0.19 to -0.24 in the the forecast
for trend Δpercentage aged 40-64 in the U.S. lowers the forecast of the trend real rate by 0.27%
(=1.74-1.57). From (5.3b), the comparable figures for the world demographics are a 0.11 fall in the
correlate and a 0.95% fall in the forecast of the trend real rate. The 68% confidence intervals indicate that
there is a lot of uncertainty about these forecasts. Nonetheless, the point estimates suggest considerable

economic significance for these two correlates. The working paper version of this paper has additional
results showing economic significance for other correlates.12


                                           6. CONCLUSIONS

         Motivated by the decline in the safe real interest rate over the last several decades, we study long
run correlations between the safe real rate and over 20 variables that have been posited to move with safe
rates. We find that the safe real rate in the U.S. has statistically and economically important long run
correlations with aggregate labor hours and demographic variables. For most other variables, we found
substantive long run correlations in some samples and measures but not in others. Based on these results,
we view demographic change as a reasonable starting point for understanding the recent secular decline in
real rates. Further, we prefer labor hours growth to GDP growth or TFP growth for modeling trends in
safe real rates.

        Our reduced form analysis did not attempt to provide a structural explanation for the results we
found. One priority for future research is better understanding why some correlates work as expected
while others do not.

1. In our discussion of related literature, we will not distinguish between papers that have considered the
safe real rate r (our paper) versus those that have considered the natural rate r* (some of the papers we are
about to cite). In models in which r* appears, trend determinants of the two are generally the same. See
section 2.5.

2. Some literature has extended the utility function to allow habit persistence. As explained in Hamilton
et al. (2016), such an extension does not have important implications for trend real rates.

3. This is in contrast to the infinitely lived model underlying the intertemporal IS. In overlapping
generations models, each generation faces the usual intertemporal condition (equation (2.3)) trading off
first versus second period consumption. But higher labor force growth leads to lower capital per worker
and a higher marginal product of capital (higher interest rate). See Romer (2012, ch. 1 and ch. 2).

4. We thank a referee for pointing this out.

5. More generally, some research motivated by New Keynesian literature assumes that rt -r*t is I(0) (e.g.
Del Negro et al (2017), who, more generally, work under the presumption that rt might be similar to r8t).
Post-World War II evidence consistent with this assumption may be found in Justiniano and Primiceri
(2010). Our work is also consistent with, but does not require, that rt -r*t is I(0).

6. To clarify what we are estimating, some additional notation is required. Let dr and dx be differencing
parameters between -0.4 and 1.0, so that (1-L)drrt ~ I(0) and (1-L)dxxt ~ I(0). The object estimated is the
same for all dr and dx: as we vary dr and dx we are always estimating the low pass correlation between rt
and xt and not the low pass correlation between (1-L)drrt and (1-L)dxxt.

7. In any given sample, the enforcement of coverage over all values of d may not produce a confidence
interval that is larger than the confidence interval for ρLP-I(0), even though d=0 is accounted for in the
construction of the robust confidence interval.

8. The countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay. These are the countries for which the Maddison
data goes back to 1890.

9. The plot for TFP growth begins in 1899 because the underlying data start in 1890. Thus the first
possible observation on 10 year moving averages is 1899.

10. The point estimates for 1950-2016 are, however, quite different for ρ^ MA and ρ^ LP-I(0)–two measures
that ordinarily yield very similar estimates. This appears to result from ρ^ LP-I(0) surprisingly (to us)
producing a sharp rise in trend labor hours growth at the end of the sample, while ρ^ MA produces a more
plausible low estimate.

11. Unfortunately, there is no obvious quantitative measure of financial repression, so we have not
included it as a correlate.

12. That working paper also constructs direct forecasts of r2026 using bivariate regressions in (rt, xt) for
each correlate xt. This produces 25 forecasts for the 1890-2016 sample and 28 forecasts for the

                                                      19
1950-2016 sample. The median across the 25 and 28 forecasts is 0.45% and 1.13% respectively. Since
                              MA
our end of sample value is r2016 = –1.33, this suggests a considerable rise in the trend real rate, with a
partial or perhaps full return to the 0.97% mean given in Table 2.

Notes:

1. Annual data, computed as nominal rate minus expected inflation: rt=it-Etπt+1 . The nominal rate it is the
average of January rates in t+1: call rates 1890-1917, the discount rate 1918-19, three month treasury bills
1920-2016. Inflation πt is measured by the GNP/GDP deflator, using Romer (1989) prior to 1929, BEA
data 1930-present. Expected inflation Etπt+1 is set to zero 1890-1913. For 1914-2016, Etπt+1 is computed
from an AR(1) in inflation using rolling samples of 20 years.

Notes:

1. In lines (1)-(3): GDP and consumption are real and per capita; consumption is total consumption;
π_GDP is GDP inflation. World GDP is constructed from 23 countries given in a footnote in the text.
“mkt return” is the real return on the S&P 500. The second moments in lines (2) and (3) are constructed
from rolling samples of 20 years as described in the text. The dependency ratio in line (5a) is defined in
Table 1. Lines (6) and (7) are ratios of nominal variables. In (8), the GNP/GDP deflator for business
fixed investment is expressed as a ratio to the deflator for total consumption. In line (11b), π_PCE is PCE
inflation. All data are annual.

2. Asymptotic 68% confidence intervals in parentheses. “10Y moving avg.” reports correlations of 10
year moving averages of rt and the indicated variable. “Lowpass filter” uses Müller and Watson’s (2018)
lowpass filter to cut off frequencies higher than 10 years. The point estimate ρ^ LP is the correlation
between the filtered series, while the R2 is described in section 3 in the text. Column (3) applies Müller
and Watson (2018) assuming the data are I(0). Column (4) reports Müller and Watson’s (2018)
confidence interval that controls coverage allowing r and the correlate to be I(d) for any d between -0.4
and 1.0; the point estimate in this column is the posterior mean from a Bayesian procedure whose prior
allows r and the correlate to be I(d) in the range just given. See section 3 for further discussion.

3. Data end in 2015 for the correlates in rows (1c) and (9). The sample start for the lowpass filter is 1890
except for the correlates in the following rows: (2a), (2b), (3a)–1891; (2c), (3b)–1893; (5c) and
(5d)–1891; (9)–1913; (10)–1920; (12a)–1916. The sample start is 9 years later in the “10Y” column.

Notes:

1. See notes to Table 3. Consumption is nondurables and services, with π_NDS the corresponding
inflation rate. In (5b), (5d) and (5f), world demographic variables are constructed from the several dozen
countries that are labeled high income by the UN in 2016 (United Nations (2017a,p156)).

2. For the lowpass filter correlation, the sample period is 1950-2016. For 10Y moving averages, the
sample period is 1959-2016. Data end in 2015 for the correlates in rows (1c), (5b), (5d), (5f) and (9).
Data start in 1951 for the correlates in rows (2b), (3b), and (5f).
