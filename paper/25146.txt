                                         ABSTRACT

This paper exploits a tax reform on manufacturing firms in China to study the impact of taxes on
firm innovation. The reform switched the corporate income tax collection from the local to the
state tax bureau and reduced the effective tax rate by 10%. The reform only applied to firms
established after January 2002, allowing us to use regression discontinuity design as the
identification strategy. The results show that lower taxes improved both quantity and quality of
firm innovation. Moreover, the reform has a bigger impact on firms that are financially
constrained and firms that engage more in tax evasion.

1. Introduction

    Innovation has been increasingly recognized as the main engine for economic

growth (Solow (1957); Romer (1990); Grossman and Helpman (1991); Aghion and

Howitt (1992); Aghion, Akcigit, and Howitt (2014)). Policy makers in both developed

and developing countries have started to use tax incentives to encourage investment in

innovation. But we know very little about the impact of such policies on firm

innovation and the underlying mechanisms.

    Theoretically, taxes can have either positive or negative impacts on firm

innovation. On the one hand, lower taxes can increase the after-tax profit of firms, so

that they have better capacity to invest in new technologies or products; moreover,

lower taxes may reduce resources that firms spend on tax evasion, such as costs of

bribing tax officers, which can be instead used on innovation activities. On the other

hand, lower taxes may also have a negative impact on innovation because they

decrease government revenue, and in turn may reduce government spending on public

goods such as research, education, and infrastructure. As a result, whether providing

tax incentives can improve firm innovation is ambiguous.

    This paper investigates the impact of taxes on firm innovation using a natural

experiment in China. In November 2001, China implemented a tax collection reform

on all manufacturing firms established on or after January 2002, which switched the

collection of corporate income taxes from the local tax bureau to the state tax bureau.

Because of differences in management and incentives of those two types of tax

bureaus, the reform changed the enforcement of tax collection, resulting in a reduction

    	                                       2	  
of effective corporate income tax rates by almost 10% among treated firms. Since

firms registered before 2002 were not affected by the reform, the policy change

created exogenous variations in the effective tax rate among similar firms established

before or after 2002. We can thus apply a regression discontinuity design (RD) and

use the generated variation in the effective tax rate to identify the impact of taxes on

firm innovation.

           To test the impact of taxes on innovation, we combine a comprehensive dataset

of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2007 with patent data

from the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) including all patents applied in

China by the year 2014. We use the data to measure three dimensions of innovation

activities: input (R&D expenditure and skilled labor ratio), output (number of patent

application), and quality (type and characteristics of patent application).

           The key assumption of the RD analysis is that firm cohort should have a

significant impact on the effective corporate tax rate; however, all other unobserved

determinants of firm innovation are not correlated with firm cohort. We provide three

pieces of evidence to validate the estimation strategy. First, the reform did

significantly reduce the effective tax rate: the tax rate is almost 10% lower among

firms establisehd after 2002 compared with those registered before 2002. Second,

there’s no significant difference in firm entry around 2002, suggesting that the reform

was a surprise to firms and they did not selectively postponed the registration date.

Third, we don’t see significantly higher firm re-registration after 2002.




    	                                          3	  
    Our analysis yields several interesting results. First, we show a strong and robust

causal relationship between tax rate and firm innovation: decreasing the effective tax

rate by one standard deviation (0.01) increases the average number of patent

application by a significant 5.7%. The reform also stimulated R&D expenditures and

increased the skilled-labor ratio by 14%. Second, the impact of the reform on

patenting mainly comes from its effect on invention and utility patents, suggesting

that the improvement in innovation outcomes is not merely driven by the low-quality

design patents. Third, we provide suggestive evidence that a low tax rate can

stimulate firm’s innovation by alleviating financial constraints and by reallocating

resources from tax evasion activities.

    Our work builds on and contributes to three main literatures. First, this paper

sheds light on the impact of taxes on firm decision-making and economic growth.

Existing research studied the influence of tax policies on economic growth (Romer

and Romer (2010); Barro and Redlick (2011)), firm investment (Auerbach and

Hassett (1992); Hines and Rice (1994); Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard (1996);

Devereux, Griffith, and Kelmm (2002); Hasset and Hubbard (2002); Djankov et al

(2011); Mertens and Ravn (2012); Zwick and Mahon (2017)), corporate financial

policy (Auerbach (2002)), entrepreneurial risk-taking (Cullen and Gordon (2007);

Haufler, Norback, and Persson (2014)), and location decisions (Devereux and Griffith

(2003); Moretti and Wilson (2017)). However, the impact of taxes on firm innovation

is not well explored. Mukherjee, Singh, and Zaldokas (2017) and Atanassov and Liu

(2014) exploit the effect of staggered changes in state-level corporate tax rates on


    	                                       4	  
innovation behavior of publicly listed firms in the United States, and find significant

impact of taxes on innovation, mainly through relieving firms’ financial constraints.

In two recent working papers, Akcigit et al (2018) uses data on both inventors and

firms and shows that higher personal and corporate income taxes negatively affect

innovation; Chen et al (2018) finds that cutting corporate taxes for high-tech

companies significantly improved firm productivity and R&D investment in China.

Our paper differs from those papers in several ways. First, we are the first paper to

look at the impact of changes in tax enforcement rather than explicit tax reduction on

firms’ innovation behavior. Second, out data covers a broad range of firms and a

comprehensive set of innovation outcomes, and we answer the question in a

developing-country’s context.

    Second, the paper relates to the literature on the determinants of innovation.

Existing evidence shows that product market competition (Aghion et al (2005)),

institutional ownership (Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales (2013); Ferreira, Manso,

and Silva (2014)), laws (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014)), investors’

attitudes towards failure (Tian and Wang (2011)), managerial incentive (Manso

(2011)), and financial development and regulation (Hsu, Tian, and Xu (2014); Amore,

Schneider, and Zaldokas (2013); Fang, Tian, and Tice (2014); Cornaggia et al (2015)),

all affect innovation. Another branch of papers study the effect of an R&D tax credit

on R&D investment (Hall and Van Reenen (2000); Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen

(2002); Wilson (2009); Rao (2016)). We contribute to this literature by showing that

corporate tax policies are also a first order determinant of firm innovation.


    	                                        5	  
    Third, the paper also contributes to the literature on tax enforcement. The

tax-to-GDP ratio is substantially lower in poor countries compared with developed

countries (Gordon and Li (2009); Besley and Torsten (2014)). One important reason

of low tax revenue is weak tax enforcement, and several theory papers suggest that

policy-makers can use tax enforcement instead of explicitly changing tax rates as a

tax instrument (Kaplow (1990)). There are a growing number of papers showing that

tax enforcement can be improved by providing performance pay incentives to tax

inspectors (Besley and McLaren (1993); Khan, Khwaja, and Olken (2016)),

introducing third party reporting to improve information available on tax payers

(Kleven et al (2011); Kumler, Verhoogen, and Frias (2015); Naritomi (2016);

Pomeranz (2015); Kopczuk et al (2016)), and offering auditing (Slemrod, Blumenthal,

and Christian (2001). However, another important but not well-explored factor

affecting tax enforcement is the incentive of local governments and tax agencies.

Chen (2017) uses China’s 2005 agricultural tax abolition as a natural experiment to

study the impact of county governments' incentives on tax enforcement, and shows

that the revenue loss is largely offset by tougher tax enforcement on value-added

taxes. Our study adds to this literature by showing that the management and

incentives of tax collection agencies play an important role in tax enforcement and the

tax capacity of a country.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the background

of China’s tax collection system and the reform. Section 3 presents data and summary




    	                                       6	  
statistics. Section 4 explains the identification strategy. Section 5 presents the results,

and Section 6 concludes.




2. Institutional background

2.1. China’s Tax collection system

     Before the economic reform started in 1979, tax administration in China was

simple because there were no personal or corporate income taxes. Most of the tax

revenues came from profit remittance of state-owned enterprises. Local governments4

were in responsible for tax collection, but all revenues were consolidated to the

central government, who sets spending priorities and redistributes the revenue based

on local spending needs. Such a system, called “unified revenue collection and unified

spending” (also known as “eating from one big pot”), provides very little incentives

for the local government to develop their local economies.

     In 1980, the “fiscal contracting system” (also known as “eating from separate

kitchens”) was introduced. Under this system, local revenue was divided between the

central and local governments based on pre-determined sharing schemes. The new

system not only guaranteed the central government a certain flow of revenue from

local governments, but also provided local governments with incentives to build up

local economies and the revenue base. The share of local expenditure increased from

     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
     4
                  China’s government administration has five levels: central, provincial, municipality, county,

and township. In this paper we refer to all subnational governments as local governments.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       7	  
45% of the total in 1981 to 72% in 1993. However, since the sharing rule can be

continuously negotiated and changed, local governments view this as a lack of

commitment from the central government and they tend to divert funds from

budgetary to extra-budgetary revenues, which were not subjected to sharing with the

central government. Since the central government relies on local authorities to collect

tax, it is hard to monitor and correct such manipulation. From 1980 to 1992, the

extra-budgetary revenue to budgetary revenue ratio increased from 48% to 120%.

This greatly dampened the central government’s fiscal capacity.

    In order to strengthen the central government’s control on taxation, a major fiscal

system reform was introduced in 1994. In the reform, taxes were classified into

central, local and shared taxes, which explicitly specified the tax sharing rules

between the central and local governments. Specifically, the central taxes include

customs duties and consumption taxes; the local taxes include corporate income taxes,

real estate and property taxes; and the shared taxes include value-added taxes (75%

central, 25% local) and personal income tax.

    Moreover, the central government also established its own tax-collection

department to centralize the revenue system, preventing the local governments from

intervening central and shared taxes. Since then, the tax collection system is divided

into two bureaus: the state tax bureau and local tax bureau. The state tax bureau

collects central taxes and shared taxes, while the local tax bureau collects local taxes.

Both bureaus have branches on the province, city, and county levels. The most

significant difference between these two bureaus is in the management system. The


    	                                         8	  
state tax bureau adopts a vertical reporting model: each state tax bureau is directly

responsible for the tax bureau at level above. For example, the director of a

province-level state tax bureau is appointed by the director of the State Bureau of

General Taxation (headquarter of the state tax bureau); the provincial government

does not have any power on the state tax bureau of any level. In contrast, the local tax

bureau is managed by the local government: the provincial government manages the

province-level local tax bureau, appoints their director and provides funding for

operation. Under such a system, the interference of local governments in the

collection of central and shared taxes is minimized.




2.2. The corporate income tax collection reform in 2002

     Since the 1994 tax reform, the local tax bureau collects the corporate income tax

of all firms except for foreign and state-owned enterprises, and all the revenue goes to

local government. In January 2002, a corporate income tax collection reform was

implemented, which switched corporate income tax collection of all domestic private

firms established on or after January 1, 2002, to state tax bureau. However, the tax

collection for firms registered before 2002 did not change5.	   The reform was a shock

for firms, because the decision was not made until December 2001. This is very


     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
     5
                  The government was planning to switch corporate income tax collection to the state tax bureau

for all firms. However, because local and state tax bureaus use completely different tax collection and

record systems, it was very difficult to transfer the tax collection on existing firms. As a result, only

new firms established after 2002 were covered by the reform.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       9	  
important for our identification: it ensured that firms did not have enough time to

manipulate their registration time.	  

     The reform has two main objectives. First, although the local government did not

have the right to change the tax rate6, they could offer unnecessary tax exemptions or

relax tax enforcement to lower the effective tax rate for local firms, in order to protect

local firms and improve their competitive power. Second, the central government

needed additional tax revenue to support the “western development strategy”

proposed in the year 1999. The plan was to promote the growth of the underdeveloped

western provinces, which would need financial transfers from the east.

     After the reform, similar firms established before or after 2002 could pay very

different effective tax rates because of the following reasons. First, the incentives of

corporate tax collection were different between the local and central tax bureaus. Just

as the target of GDP growth rate is set by the central government every year, tax

collection agencies are also assigned with a targeted tax growth rate, and whether the

target can be achieved or not may influence the promotion of the tax bureau leaders.

For the state tax bureau, value-added tax accounted for 62% of the total tax collected

in 2007, while local tax agencies mainly rely on corporate taxes to fulfill the target.

Second, the local tax bureau is managed by the local government, so they have more
     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
     6
                  During our sample period (1998-2007), the corporate income tax rate in China was consistent.

From 1994 to 2007, all domestic firms faced a corporate income tax rate of 33%. Foreign firms enjoyed

different kinds of tax reduction depending on their industry and location. For example, the tax rate for

firms in special economic zones was only 15%. In 2008, China adjusted the corporate income tax rate

to 25% for both domestic and foreign firms.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10	  
power and information on local firms, which may help enforcing tax collection.

However, although local tax bureaus have more incentives and information

advantages to enforce corporate tax collection, local governments may protect local

firms for long-term growth by encouraging local tax bureaus to loosen the

enforcement of tax collection or by offering favorable tax policies7. As a result, the

tax collection reform may have either positive or negative effects on firms’ effective

tax rate.




3. Data and Summary Statistics

     The empirical analysis is based on two main data sources. The first one is the

annual firm survey data developed and maintained by the National Bureau of

Statistics of China (NBS). The NBS data contain annual survey data of all “above

scale” industrial firms with annual sales of more than 5 million RMB. On average,

around 220,000 firms per year from 1998 to 2007 are included in the dataset,

spanning                                                          37                                          two-digit                                                                                         manufacturing                                          industries   and   31   provinces   or

province-equivalent municipal cities. Firms included in this survey accounted for

almost 50% of China’s industrial value-added, and 22% of China’s urban employment

     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
     7
            	   Local governments face targets of GDP growth to fulfill each year. Cities and provinces are also

ranked by GDP growth. Whether the local government leaders can meet the growth target and their

rankings is an important factor influencing promotion. This leads to intense horizontal competition

between local governments across regions (Li and Zhou (2005)). Local governments thus have

incentive to protect local firms by lowering their effective tax rate. 	  

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       11	  
in 2005.	   The original dataset includes 2,226,104 firm-year observations. Since this

paper focuses on manufacturing firms, we eliminate non-manufacturing observations.

Moreover, because only firms established in and after the year 2002 were covered by

the tax collection reform, we only use firm survey data from 2002 to 2007. To further

clean the sample, we deleted observations where firm identifiers, county code, sector

id, or year of establishment are missing, as well as observations whose value of fixed

assets or total sales is below RMB 5 million, or if the number of employees is smaller

than 30. In addition, observations are dropped if total assets are less than liquid assets

or total fixed assets, if inputs are larger than output, if the firm is less than one year

old, or if key variables such as corporate tax, input and total wages are negative or

zero. After implementing these data cleaning procedures, we obtain a sample of

472,180 observations for analysis.

           The second data source is patent data from the State Intellectual Property Office

(SIPO). We purchased all the records of patents approved as of May 1, 2014, from

SIPO. The database contains 4,060,392 observations covering all patents applied in

China, including 1,097,000 invention patents, 1,620,069 utility model patents, and

1,343,323 design patents. A typical patent entry includes the following information:

application number, patent name, applicant, inventor, application date, publishing

date, granting date, main International Patent Classification (IPC) number, filing

agent’s name and institution, applicant address, patent origin (provinces in China or

other countries), and a short description of the patent. We also have characteristics of

patent including number of characters in the application file, number of claims and


    	                                            12	  
exclusivities, number of figures. We don’t have citation data because only in recent

years has SIPO begun to track citations. We use firm name, address, and CEO name

to merge the patent data with the firm survey data.

     In Table 1, we provide summary statistics for key variables. In our sample, about

45.3% firms are private firms established after January 2002, and thus received the

policy treatment. Panel A on firm characteristics shows that in the year 2007, average

firm age was about 8.09 years, and that 76.4% of firms were domestic private

enterprises. We also have about 1.4% State-owned enterprises and 22.2% foreign

firms in the sample, who are not influenced by the reform regardless of whether they

were registered before or after 2002. The average firm size was about 184 employees,

and firms export about 16.7% of their sales.

     Panel B presents data on accounting measures of firm performance. Average

sales were 66.76 million RMB (about 10 million USD), and the average output was

68.46 million RMB. While firms pay three major types of taxes, including

value-added tax, corporate income tax, and business tax, only corporate income tax

was affected by the tax collection policy reform. We thus focus on this type of tax in

the paper and define the tax rate as the corporate income tax to sales ratio8. In the year

2007 the average tax rate was about 1.13%.
     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  

     8
                  We use sales instead of profit to measure the effective tax rate for two reasons. First, there are


many zero or negative values of profit; second, some firms may under report profits in order to pay less


tax. Differences in tax enforcement could affect the possibility of misreporting; nevertheless, sales are


much harder to manipulate.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       13	  
    Panel C reports measures of innovation. We use three indicators of innovation.

The first and main indicator we look at is firm-level patent applications. The data

shows that during the three years 2007 to 2010, 7.1% firms applied for patents; and

among those firms, the average number of patent application was about 8.86 and the

approved number of patent was around 2.52 (25% approval rate). The second

indicator is the R&D expenditure. In the NBS firm survey data, information on R&D

expenses is only available in years 2005-2007, and the average R&D-to-sales ratio in

year 2007 was around 0.002. Lastly, we also look at the skilled labor ratio, defined as

the share of workers with an above-college-level degree. Information on worker

education is only available in the year 2004, and the average skilled labor ratio is

0.11.




4. Empirical Strategy

    The main challenge of identifying the causal impact of tax rates on firm

innovation is that tax policies can be endogenously determined. Some unobserved

factors could affect both tax rate and innovation. For example, high-tech firms are

more likely to innovate and normally can get an R&D tax reduction from the local

government; more productive firms are more advanced in technology and may also be

more skillful managing taxations. Reverse causality is also a problem: more

innovative firms charge higher product prices and make more profits at the same sales

level.


    	                                      14	  
    The introduction of the corporate income tax collection reform was only targeted

on private firms established after the year 2002. If the reform indeed changed tax

enforcement, two firms established before or after January 2002 but which are

otherwise similar should face significantly different effective tax rates. In that case,

we can use the regression discontinuity (RD) design to identify the impact of taxes on

firm innovation. The key assumption of the RD analysis is that firm cohort should

have a significant impact on the effective corporate tax rate; however, all other

unobserved determinants of firm innovation are not correlated with firm cohort. With

this assumption held, causal inference could be achieved after adjusting for a

sufficiently flexible polynomial of cohort.

    We firstly check whether the policy reform has any impact on firm effective tax

rate. In Figure 1, we restrict the sample to firms established right before (2001) and

after (2002) the reform and compare their tax rates. The figure suggests that firms

established after the reform pay lower taxes in all years after 2003. We then plot the

effective tax rate by firm birth month, normalized by setting January 2002 as 0, using

the 2007 data and focusing on firms that were born two years before or after the

policy change. As shown in Figure 2, the tax rate paid by firms formed after 2002 is

significantly lower than that of firms established before 2002. To check whether such

discontinuity in tax rate was driven by the tax collection reform rather than other

policy changes, we also plot the figure using a sample of foreign firms, who are not

supposed to be affected by the reform. Figure 3 shows that among foreign firms, the

tax rate is not influenced by firm establishment year.


    	                                        15	  
    To show whether the impact of the reform on tax rate is statistically significant,

we estimate the following equation:


                   𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" = 𝛼! + 𝛼! 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡! + 𝛼! 𝐹 𝐴𝑔𝑒      !"   + 𝛼! 𝑋!" + 𝜖!"   (1)


Here 𝑖 indexes firms, 𝑡 indexes years, and 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" is the corporate income tax

to sales ratio. 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡! is an indicator for the policy treatment, which is

time-invariant and equals one if the firm was established after January 2002.

𝐹 𝐴𝑔𝑒         !"   is a polynomial function of firm birth month, where birth month is

normalized by setting January 2002 as zero. We also include the interactions of the

treatment variable with polynomial terms. 𝑋!" is a set of firm characteristics

including capital to labor ratio, number of employees, export to sales ratio, and

foreign share.

           Table 2 reports the results. The three columns presents results using a 60-, 48-, or

24-months window, respectively. As we discussed in the background section, the

reform may have either a positive or negative effect on tax enforcement. Results

suggest that the negative impact dominates: the tax rate is about 0.1% lower among

firms establisehd after 2002. Since the average tax rate was about 0.011 before 2002,

this suggests that the reform reduced the effective tax rate by almost 10%.

           Although we observe a significant discontinuity in tax rate around the policy

cutoff on firm birth month, this could be driven by the fact that firms anticipated the

policy change and selectively postponed their registration date. To check whether that

is the case, we use the 2007 data to plot the density of firm birth month in Figure 4.

The result shows that there’s no significant difference in firm entry around 2002. In

    	                                             16	  
addition, we also check whether firms re-registered after the reform to take advantage

of the policy. We define re-registration by firms with the same name and owner but a

different ID in different years. Figure 5 plots the distribution of re-registration for

firms observed in 1998. We don’t see significantly higher re-registration after 2002.

            Lastly, another identification assumption is that all unobserved determinants of

firm innovation are continuously related to the firm birth month. Figure 6 graphically

assesses this by testing whether the predicted number of patents, calculated as the

fitted value from an OLS regression of patenting on all covariates in subsequent

regressions9, differs between firms born before or after January 2002. The figure

suggests that there is no significant discontinuity in the predicted number of patent at

the firm cohort cutoff. Based on the above evidence, we believe that in our context

RD is a valid identification strategy.

       Since the policy rule relating firm birth time to treatment is not deterministic but

only changed the probability of tax enforcement changes, we apply a fuzzy regression

discontinuity estimation, instrumenting firm tax rate by the policy reform. Specifically,

to estimate the impact of the tax reform on firm innovation, we run the following

2SLS regression10:


                       𝐼𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛!"    = 𝛽!    + 𝛽!   𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" + 𝛽!   𝐹   𝐴𝑔𝑒                                                                                                                                                                                         !"    +    𝛽!   𝑋!"    +    𝑢!"

5. Results

5.1. Effect of Taxes on Firm Innovation

    We firstly provide graphical evidence in Figure 7, which plots the number of

patent applications against firm birth month. The figure shows that there is a discrete

increase in patent applications at the firm age cutoff, which mirrors the decrease in the

effective tax rate as shown in Figure 2. Figures 2 and 7 reveal a sharp decrease in

taxes and a sharp increase in patenting at precisely the cutoff of firm cohort that was

influenced by the tax collection reform.

    Table 3 reports the 2SLS estimation results for patent as the indicator of firm

innovation11. Starting with columns (1)-(3), where the outcome is the probability of

applying for a patent, results show that a higher tax rate has a significantly negative

effect on innovation, and the effect becomes stronger as time evolves. We mainly

focus on the patent applications for the next 3 years because innovation is a process

                          In all the following tables we use firms established two years before or after the reform

(2000-2003). We will also show robustness checks using an extended sample.

    	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        18	  
that needs long-term investment, and many innovating firms do not apply for patents

every year. Specifically, column (3) suggests that, increasing the effective tax rate by

one standard deviation (0.0122) can decrease the probability of having any patent

application in the next 3 years by more than 10%. Similarly, columns (6) shows that

the average number of patent application increased by a significant 5.7% if the

effective tax rate decreased by 0.0112.

    In Table 4, we explore another two indicators of firm innovation: R&D

expenditure and human capital. Results suggest that firms facing higher corporate

taxes spend less money on R&D and hire less skilled labor, although the impact on

R&D expenditure is not statistically significant. Please note that the sample size is

smaller in this table because we only have R&D expenditures in years 2005-2007 and

worker education information in the year 2004. The impact of tax on skilled-labor

ratio is quite big: the reform decreased the effective tax rate by 0.1%, which in turn

increased the skilled-labor ratio by 14%.

    Although we have controlled the year trend term in all regressions, the effect

could be driven by confounding variables or pre-trend. We use pseudo regressions to

test those possibilities. In practice, we generate policy dummies and replicate the

regressions in Tables 3 and 4. The results in Appendix table A2 suggest that if the

cutoff is not 2002, we don’t see a drop in the effective tax rate, suggesting that the

policy effect is not just by chance.

     In summary, the results show a strong and robust causal relationship between tax

rate and firm innovation. The tax collection reform reduced tax enforcement, and the

resulting lower effective tax rate stimulated both input (measured by R&D

expenditure and human capital) and output (measured by the number of patent

application) of firm innovation13.

     While the quantity of innovation is important, the quality of innovation is also

crucial. We use two ways to measure the quality of innovation14. First, the type of

patent is a good indicator of the value of patent. There are three main types of patent

in China: invention, utility, and design patent. The invention patent is the most

difficult one because it needs to contribute very original ideas. For a utility patent,

there must be some significant improvement to an existing product or technology. The

design patent only requires a modification in product appearance 15 . Among the

merged data we have, 16.6% are invention patents, 35.0% are utility patents, and

48.4% are design patents. We use the same 2SLS specification in equation (2) to test

     	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
     13
                       We also did a heterogeneity test (unreported), which shows that firms with lower productivity

(so that the return of innovation investment is higher) are more likely to be affected by the policy

change.
     14
                        One commonly used indicator for patent quality is citation but that information is not available

for Chinese patents until recently.
     15
                       Taking innovation on cellphones for example, inventing a new material for battery to improve

its endurance involves heavy R&D input and requires an original contribution. It is usually patented as

an invention patent; changes in circuit design are less valuable and are not fundamental improvements

and are usually be patented as a utility patent; changes in the shape of the cellphone screen can only

apply for a design patent.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       20	  
the impact of taxes on the likelihood and number of different types of patent

applications. Table 5 presents the results. The impact of tax reform on patent

applications mainly comes from its effect on invention and utility patents: decreasing

the effective tax rate by one standard deviation (0.0122) improves the probability of

having an invention patent application by 4.4% and increases the number of utility

patent applications by 4.7%. This suggests that the improvement in innovation

outcomes is not merely driven by the low-quality design patents.

     Second, we also use the detailed information of patent applications as proxies for

the patent quality, including number of claims, number of independent claims16, and

the amount of effort that was spent on the patent application (length of the application

document, number of figures, and length of abstract). In our patent data, only

invention and utility patents have the above information, and results in Table 6

suggest that a reduction in tax rate significantly improved patent quality, and the

effect is significant for both invention and utility patents.

     Overall, the above results show that the tax reform not only increased the quantity

of patents, but also improved the quality of innovation activities.

                        Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004) point out that “the claims in the patent specification

delineate the property rights protected by the patent. The patentee has an incentive to claim as much as

possible in the application. The patent examiner may require that the claims be narrowed before

granting.”

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       21	  
5.2. Mechanisms

       After seeing a positive and significant impact of an effective tax rate reduction on

firm innovation, the next question is: Why is firm innovation affected by the tax

reform? We test two potential mechanisms here.

    First, if firms are under financial constraints so that they do not have enough

funding to invest on innovation, reducing tax cost can help by alleviating financial

constraint, and firms can use the money saved to carry out innovation activities.

Under a neoclassical framework, if R&D expenditure is fully deductible, the tax rate

should not affect innovation since it does not change the after-tax marginal benefit

and cost of innovation. However, when the financial market is incomplete or

inefficient and a firm mostly relies on its own after-tax profit, a lower effective tax

rate could affect innovation investment.

    One challenge to test this channel is that it is hard to measure financial constraint.

We use the interest payment to asset ratio as the indicator for financial constraint.

From the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, although the Chinese economy had been

growing at a very fast pace and firms’ credit demand grew rapidly, the banking sector

and stock market had not developed quickly enough to keep pace with this growing

demand. Thus Chinese firms were usually facing severe credit constraints. At the

same time, banks in China have little discretion over interest rates they can charge and

the corporate bond market is thin due to strict regulations. Therefore, the amount of

interest payments reflects mostly how much a firm manages to borrow, not its

endogenously chosen optimal capital structure.


    	                                         22	  
       We test the financial constraint channel using the following estimation equation:


                                             𝐼𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛!"    = 𝛾!    + 𝛾!   𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" + 𝛾! 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡!" + 𝛾!   𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" ∗

                                                                                                                      𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡!" + 𝛾!   𝐹   𝐴𝑔𝑒                                                                                                               !"    +   𝛾!   𝑋!"    +    𝑢!"   (3)


Where 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!" is instrumented by the policy treatment, 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡!" is the

measure of financial constraint, calculated by the ratio of interest payment to total

assets. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛾! , which measures the variation of the policy

impact by firm financial constraint. Results in Table 7 suggest that firms which face

more severe financial constraint are more hindered by a higher high tax rate. The

coefficient in front of the interaction between effective tax rate and interest payment

is positive for all three measures of innovation, although it is only statistically

significant when using R&D expenditure as the innovation outcome. This result

provides suggestive evidence that a low tax rate can stimulate firms’ innovation by

alleviating financial constraints.

            Second, a lower effective tax rate could also release resources that firms spend

on tax evasion, which firms can in turn use on innovation. In that case, firms that are

doing more tax evasion can release more resources for innovation. To test this channel,

we define tax evasion by the difference between imputed and reported profit17, and

               We follow Cai and Liu (2007) to calculate the imputed profit. Specifically, we compute firm i’s

Imputed  Profit !"   in year t according to the national income accounting system as follows: Imputed

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡!" = 𝑌!" − 𝑀𝑒𝑑!" − 𝐹𝑐!" − 𝑊𝑎𝑔𝑒!" − 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑑!" − 𝑉𝑎𝑡!" . Here 𝑌!" is the firm’s gross output;

𝑀𝑒𝑑!" measures its intermediate inputs excluding financial charges; 𝐹𝑐!" is its financial charges

(mainly interest payments); 𝑊𝑎𝑔𝑒!" is the firm’s total wage bill; 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑑!" is the amount of current

depreciation, and 𝑉𝑎𝑡!" is the value added tax.

     	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        23	  
assume that firms spend more on tax evasion if the gap is larger. Following the same

estimation strategy as in equation (3), we then estimate the heterogeneity of the tax

impact by tax evasion. Results in Table 8 show that for all the three measures of firm

innovation, the coefficient of the interaction between the effective tax rate and the tax

evasion measure is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that that lower

effective tax rate has a stronger positive impact on innovation if firms are doing more

tax evasion. This is in line with the tax evasion mechanism.




6. Conclusion

           In this paper, we offer new evidence on the impact of corporate taxes on both the

quantity and quality of firm innovation, and the underlying mechanisms. To estimate

the causal impact of taxes on innovation, we take advantage of a tax collection reform

applied to manufacturing firms in China established after the year 2002, which

switched the collection of corporate income taxes from the local tax bureau to the

state tax bureau. Based on a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large

enterprises combined with the universal patent application data in China, we use a

regression discontinuity design to study the policy impact.

           Our results suggest that, first, the reform effectively changed tax enforcement

and reduced the effective tax rate by 10%. Using the number of patent applications,

R&D expenditure, and skilled labor ratio as indicators of firm innovation, we then

show that there is a strong and robust causal relationship between tax rate and firm


    	                                            24	  
innovation: decreasing the effective tax rate by one standard deviation (0.01) can

increase the average number of patent applications by a significant 5.7%. The reform

also improved R&D expenditures and increased the skilled-labor ratio by 14%.

Moreover, the impact of the reform on patenting mainly comes from its effect on the

invention and utility patent, suggesting that the improvement in innovation outcomes

is not merely driven by low-quality design patents. Lastly, we provide suggestive

evidence that a low tax rate can stimulate firm’s innovation by alleviating financial

constraints and reallocating resources from tax evasion activities.

Note: This table uses sample of firms established three years before or after the policy reform and reports the impact of the
tax reform on patent application. The tax to sales ratio is instrumented by the policy treatment dummy (=0 for firms
established before 2002, and =1 otherwise). Firm characteristics including capital to labor ratio, number of employees, export
to sales ratio, and foreign share are controlled for in all regressions. Age, square of age, and their interactions with the
treatment dummy are also included. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
