                                         ABSTRACT

We empirically and theoretically examine how consumer credit access affects displaced workers.
Empirically, we link administrative employment histories to credit reports. We show that an
increase in credit limits worth 10% of prior annual earnings allows individuals to take .15 to 3
weeks longer to find a job. Conditional on finding a job, they earn more and work at more
productive firms. We develop a labor sorting model with credit to provide structural estimates of
the impact of credit on employment outcomes, which we find are similar to our empirical
estimates. We use the model to understand the impact of consumer credit on the macroeconomy.
We find that if credit limits tighten during a downturn, employment recovers quicker, but output
and productivity remain depressed. This is because when limits tighten, low-asset, low-
productivity job losers cannot self-insure. Therefore, they search less thoroughly and take more
accessible jobs at less productive firms.

    Recent research by Kaplan and Violante [2014] has shown that many households, even
those with large amounts of wealth, have very little liquid assets. At the same time, many
of those households have significant amounts of credit access (Herkenhoff [2013]). This gen-
erates a potentially important consumption smoothing role for consumer credit if ‘hand-to-
mouth’ households lose their jobs. While much is known about the impact of unemployment
benefits on employment outcomes (inter alia Katz and Meyer [1990], Ljungqvist and Sar-
gent [1998], Acemoglu and Shimer [1998], Chetty [2008], Mitman and Rabinovich [2012], and
Hagedorn et al. [2013]), little is known about the role consumer credit plays in the search
decisions of unemployed households, and even less is known about how this interaction af-
fects the macroeconomy.1 How does consumer credit affect job finding rates, replacement
earnings, or the types of jobs workers take? How does access to consumer credit affect the
allocation of workers to firms, and what does this imply for labor productivity, output, and
employment dynamics?

    We examine these questions empirically and theoretically. Empirically, we link individual
credit reports with administrative employment records. We use this dataset to measure the
impact of consumer credit access on job finding rates and re-employment earnings of displaced
workers. We find that being able to replace 10% more of prior annual labor earnings with
personal revolving credit allows medium-tenure displaced mortgagors to take .15 to 3 weeks
longer to find a job, and, among those who find a job, they obtain a 0 to 1.7% greater annual
earnings replacement rate. Moreover, individuals with greater access to credit find jobs at
larger firms and more productive firms.

    Our results are consistent with individuals using personal credit to fund longer unem-
ployment spells so that they can search and find better job matches. These results show that
independent of realized borrowing, the potential to borrow affects search decisions regardless
if credit lines are actually drawn down. To our knowledge, we are the first to measure the
elasticity of non-employment durations and the elasticity of earnings replacement rates with
respect to consumer credit access.

   Theoretically, we develop a general equilibrium labor sorting model with consumer credit.
We use the model to structurally estimate the impact of credit limits on job search behavior
and to assess the impact of consumer credit on the aggregate economy. In our model,
   1
    The nascent but growing literature on the topic has focused on two mechanisms, the self-insurance role of
credit (e.g. Athreya and Simpson [2006], Herkenhoff [2013], Athreya et al. [2014]) and labor demand effects
of credit (e.g. Bethune et al. [2013], Donaldson et al. [2014]). The equally sparse empirical literature on
unemployment and borrowing is limited due to data constraints (Hurst and Stafford [2004], Sullivan [2008]
among others) but recent inroads are being made with new account data (Baker and Yannelis [2015], Gelman
et al. [2015], Ganong and Noel [2015], Kolsrud et al. [2015] among others).




                                                     2
heterogeneous credit-constrained workers accumulate human capital while working. When
unemployed, they direct their search, as in Menzio and Shi [2010, 2011], for jobs among
heterogeneous firms.2 Firms differ with respect to capital and produce output by combining
the human capital of workers with their own physical capital (for simplicity we refer to
firm capital as physical capital, but this may also be thought of as intellectual capital).
We assume supermodularity, meaning that firms with greater amounts of physical capital
produce more with workers who have greater amounts of human capital. We therefore
measure sorting in the model as the raw correlation coefficient between worker human capital
and firm physical capital.3 Which worker matches with which firm determines both output
and labor productivity in this economy, and therefore the ability of unemployed households
to self-insure, either through saving or borrowing, and search for higher physical capital jobs
has the potential to change the path of a recovery.

    Using this new theoretical framework, we make two quantitative contributions. First,
we estimate the model using public data in order to provide a set of independent structural
estimates of the elasticity of the duration of unemployment and the earnings replacement
rate with respect to consumer credit access. We find an elasticity of duration with respect
to unused credit of .61 (implying about a .7 week longer non-employment duration with a
credit line worth 10% of prior income). This estimate falls in the middle of our reduced form
estimates. We also estimate an elasticity of earnings with respect to unused credit, among
those who find a job, of approximately 1.8%.

    Second, given that the model produces earnings and duration elasticities that are consis-
tent with the data, we use the model as a laboratory to examine the impact of credit on labor
sorting, productivity, and the ensuing employment recovery during a recession. The main
experiment we conduct using the model is to tighten borrowing limits during the 2007-2009
recession and then study the subsequent recovery. In particular, we simulate the 2007-2009
recession by feeding actual total factor productivity residuals into the model. During the
recession, we permanently tighten borrowing limits, delivering roughly a 3 percentage point
   2
     Related theoretical work includes sorting models with frictions (inter alia Bagger and Lentz [2008],
Eeckhout and Kircher [2011], Hagedorn et al. [2012], Bonhomme et al. [2014]), frictionless assignment models
with borrowing constraints (Fernandez and Gali [1999], Legros and Newman [2002], and Strauss [2013]), and
occupational choice under credit constraints (inter alia Neumuller [2014], and Dinlersoz et al. [2015]).
  Our work is also related to Lentz [2009], Krusell et al. [2010] and Nakajima [2012a] who have studied the
impact of savings on search decisions, and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni [2011] among others have looked at the
role household borrowing constraints play in models with frictionless labor markets.
   3
     This measure is highly correlated with the Spearman Rank correlation coefficient. We also report the
Spearman Rank correlation coefficient for completeness.




                                                     3
reduction in the fraction of households borrowing, and a 1 percentage point reduction in
the aggregate debt to income ratio. Upon impact and throughout the recovery, the tighter
credit limit depresses output per worker (labor productivity) by .28 percentage points and
decreases overall output by .11 percentage points.

    We find that when debt limits tighten, however, standard measures of sorting improve and
remain elevated throughout the recovery. This happens as constrained households, who are
also more likely to have low human capital, take jobs with low physical capital. Households
with savings, who are more likely to have high human capital, are able to continue to search
thoroughly for jobs with higher physical capital. Since sorting measures the correlation
between human capital and physical capital, and since this correlation actually increases
when debt limits tighten, standard measures of sorting improve. Sorting improves while
output falls because the jobs that are being created during periods of tight debt limits are
less-physical-capital-intensive jobs. What disconnects the positive comovement of sorting
with labor productivity and output is the presence of firm investment and household credit
constraints, both of which are typically absent in sorting models.

    Lastly, when debt limits tighten during the recession, employment recovers more quickly.
The mechanism is that when credit limits tighten, unemployed low-human-capital-borrowers
lose their ability to self-insure and take relatively abundant jobs at less-capital-intensive
firms. Constrained households take lower quality jobs relatively quickly, causing a tradeoff
between the speed of the labor market recovery and the health of the recovery, measured by
labor productivity and output.

    Our contributions are both empirical and theoretical. Empirically, we build the first
dataset to merge individual credit reports with administrative employment records and mea-
sure the impact of consumer credit access on job finding rates and re-employment earnings
of displaced workers. Using several different instruments, we show that with increased credit
displaced workers search longer and replace a higher fraction of their pre-displacement in-
come. Theoretically, we develop the first labor sorting model with consumer credit. We
build on existing labor sorting models such as Marimon and Zilibotti [1999], Shimer and
Smith [2000], Shi [2001], Shimer [2001], Lise and Robin [2013] and Eeckhout and Sepahsalari
[2014], by generating interactions between heterogeneous credit histories and the allocation
of workers to firms. We build on the influential work of Lise and Robin [2013] who consider
sorting over the business cycle with risk neutrality, and we complement the recent innovative
work of Eeckhout and Sepahsalari [2014], who study assets and sorting, by allowing for bor-



                                             4
rowing and productivity differences among workers. Our framework is tractable enough that
it can be used by future researchers to study a variety of questions related to misallocation
and credit access, including credit access among firms.

   The paper proceeds as follows. We first describe our conceptual framework in Section
1. Section 2 describes the data. Sections 3 and 4 contain our empirical results. Section 5
presents the model, Section 6 describes the model estimation and structural estimates of the
duration elasticity, Section 7 conducts the main counterfactual exercise of tightening debt
limits, and Section 8 concludes.



1    Job Finding and Unsecured Credit

Unsecured credit allows unemployed households to augment today’s liquid asset position
by borrowing against future income. In McCall models of search, such as those studied by
Athreya and Simpson [2006] and Chetty [2008], access to liquid assets allows households to
search more thoroughly for higher wage jobs. While this mechanism is at the heart of the
unemployment insurance literature, there is limited evidence linking access to liquid assets
and job search decisions. In an influential paper, Chetty [2008] shows that workers who re-
ceive unemployment benefits take longer to find jobs, with the effect being strongest among
low wealth households. He also shows that unemployed households who receive severance
payments take significantly longer to find jobs. However, to our knowledge, there are no
existing studies documenting the way consumer credit limits impact unemployment dura-
tions, subsequent wage outcomes, or the characteristics of the firms where these households
ultimately take jobs. To fill this gap in the empirical literature, we test two hypotheses:

   Hypothesis 1: Ceteris paribus, greater credit access among the unemployed increases
non-employment durations.

   Hypothesis 2: Ceteris paribus, greater credit access among the unemployed increases
subsequent re-employment earnings.

   It is important to note that because durations increase with greater credit access, the
theoretic prediction of credit access on earnings (including zeros) is ambiguous since those
who have more credit are taking longer to find jobs and so they are more likely to have zero
earnings. However, conditional on finding a job, we test whether unemployed workers with




                                             5
greater credit access find higher wage jobs.



2       Data and Definitions

Our main data source is a randomly drawn panel of 5 million TransUnion credit reports
which are linked by a scrambled social security number to the Longitudinal Employment
and Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. All consumer credit information is taken from
TransUnion at an annual frequency from 2001 to 2008. The TransUnion data includes
information on the balance, limit, and status (delinquent, current, etc.) of different classes
of accounts held by individuals. The different types of accounts include unsecured credit as
well as secured credit on mortgages.

    The LEHD database is a quarterly matched employer-employee dataset that covers 95%
of U.S. private sector jobs. The LEHD includes data on earnings, worker demographic
characteristics, firm size, firm age, and average wages. Our main sample of earnings records
includes individuals with credit reports between 2001 and 2008 from the 11 states for which
we have LEHD data: California, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Since job dismissal and reason of dismissal
are not recorded in the LEHD, we follow Jacobson et al. [1993] and focus on mass layoffs.4

   We then define several labor market variables of interest. First, we define non-employment
duration to be the number of quarters it takes an individual to find a job following a mass
displacement.5 Non-employment duration therefore takes values ranging from 0 (indicating
immediate job finding) to 9 (all spells longer than 9 quarters of non-employment are assigned
a value of 9).6

    Second, we define replacement earnings as the ratio of annual earnings 1 year after layoff
over annual pre-displacement earnings. Suppose a worker is displaced in year t, then we
define the replacement earnings ratio to be the ratio of annual earnings in the year after
layoff, in year t + 1, to the pre-displacement annual earnings, in year t − 1. To avoid
    4
     Online Appendix A includes details on the identification of mass layoffs.
    5
     We follow Abowd et al. [2009] (Appendix A, Definitions of Fundamental LEHD Concepts) to construct
our measures of job accessions and employment at end-of-quarter. See Online Appendix A for more discus-
sion.
   6
     Very few workers in our sample of displaced workers remain non-employed for longer than 4 quarters.
Changing the censored value to 8 or 10 has no impact on the results.




                                                   6
confounding the duration of non-employment with replacement earnings, when we measure
replacement earnings, we condition on individuals who have a full year of earnings in year
t+1. We consider longer-term measures of replacement earnings (e.g. in year t+2) in Online
Appendix C.

    We focus on revolving credit from TransUnion because it can be drawn down on short no-
tice following job loss and paid-off slowly over time without any additional loan-applications
or income-checks. Our main measure of credit access is therefore an individual’s unused
credit limit across all types of revolving debt (excluding mortgage related revolving debt)
over annual earnings, measured prior to displacement.7 We call this ratio the ‘unused re-
volving credit limit ratio.’8 The main components of revolving credit include bank revolving
(bank credit cards), retail revolving (retail credit cards), and finance revolving credit (other
personal finance loans with a revolving feature). In Online Appendix B.5 we use alternate
measures of credit access prior to layoff including (i) credit scores, (ii) unused revolving credit
inclusive of HELOCs, and (iii) total secured and unsecured unused credit.



3       Empirical Approach

The goal of this section is to estimate the impact of credit access on employment outcomes of
displaced workers. While many authors, including Jacobson et al. [1993], have argued that
mass layoffs are exogenous to worker characteristics, credit access upon layoff certainly is
not. To solve this issue, we need to find a characteristic of workers that impacts credit limits
and only impacts employment prospects through its impact on credit limits. To isolate such
exogenous variation in credit limits, we use three sets of orthogonal instruments which we
discuss in detail in the following sections: (i) bankruptcy flag removals, (ii) individual-specific
account ages and (iii) geography instruments.
    7
     The reason that our main measure of credit access excludes mortgage related credit is because we want
to isolate the impact of credit access on employment, independent of housing wealth. To control for the
component of housing wealth that can be drawn down upon job loss, we include directly HELOC limits and
home equity proxies as controls in our empirical analysis.
   8
     Online Appendix A includes details on the construction of this ratio.




                                                    7
3.1     Bankruptcy Flag Removals

Our first strategy is to follow Musto [2004] who exploits the fact that bankruptcy flags are
removed, by law, after ten years, and this gives rise to a large exogenous increase in credit
access which does not reflect changes in underlying credit worthiness or unobserved quality
of the individual.9 Consider the set of displaced workers who have a bankruptcy flag on their
record prior to displacement, and let Removali,t equal 1 if the worker has their bankruptcy
flag removed in the year of displacement. Our empirical approach is to compare those who
have their bankruptcy flag removed in the year of displacement (the treatment group) to
those whose flags remain on their record in the year of displacement (the control group). We
therefore implement the following specification in order to isolate the impact of increased
credit access on outcome variables such as duration, Di,t ,

                                   Di,t = γRemovali,t + βXi,t + i,t                                     (1)


    In this specification γ represents how much longer displaced workers take to find a job if
their flag is removed relative to the control group of workers whose flags are not removed.
The key identifying assumption for this specification is that the treatment and control group
have identical outcomes if no treatment had occurred. We formally test this assumption in
Online Appendix B.1 by showing that the main outcome variables for the treatment and
control group are statistically indistinguishable prior to the flag removal. In particular, we
show that mean earnings growth, time spent non-employed, firm size, and firm wage prior
to layoff are statistically indistinguishable across the treatment and control group prior to
layoff.


3.2     Gross and Souleles Instrument

Our second approach is based on the identification strategy of Gross and Souleles [2002] who
exploit the fact that credit card limits increase automatically as a function of the length of
time an account has been open.10 We exploit these time-contingent changes in credit access
   9
     Chapter 7 Bankruptcy flags (the most pervasive type of bankruptcy) remain on a worker’s credit report
for a statutory 10 years, whereas Chapter 13 flags are removed after 7 years. We cannot differentiate between
these types of flag removal, but what matters for us is that the removal is statutory.
  10
     As we discuss in Online Appendix B.4, the general mechanism is that credit issuers revise account limits
based on set time intervals. The subsequent limit revision is a function of credit scores, and credit scores,




                                                     8
by using the age of the oldest account as an instrument for credit limits.

   More formally, let i denote individuals and t denote years. The first-stage regression is
to predict the unused credit limit ratio prior to layoff (li,t−1 ) as a function of the age of the
oldest account, si,t , and a vector of controls Xi,t .

                                      li,t−1 = πsi,t + BXi,t + ui,t                           (2)

These first-stage estimates of π and B are used to isolate the exogenous component of the
unused credit limit ratio, ˆli,t−1 . The second stage regression is then used to estimate how
this exogenous variation in credit impacts employment outcomes such as duration, Di,t .

                                      Di,t = γ ˆli,t−1 + βXi,t + i,t                         (3)

The main challenge to exogeneity for this instrument is that account ages are related to
physical ages. Unlike credit scoring companies, however, we observe physical age. We argue
and provide supporting evidence with over-identification tests that, after controlling for
physical age as well as a host of other individual characteristics, that account age satisfies
the exclusion restriction. In Online Appendix B.4 we discuss this instrument and the over-
identification tests in more detail.


3.3     Saiz Instrument

Our last approach is based on Mian and Sufi [2012] who show that geographic constraints,
such as the Saiz [2010] housing supply elasticity, significantly impact house price growth
as well as leverage and are orthogonal to labor markets except through their impact on
leverage (excluding real estate related sectors). Our analysis relies on the arguments made
in Mian and Sufi [2012], but, rather than focusing on realized leverage (realized borrowing),
the channel we emphasize is that geographic constraints impact house price growth, and
house price growth is a determinant of credit access, and in particular, credit limits. We
therefore use the MSA-level housing supply elasticity as the instrument, si,t , in the first
stage regression (2) for credit limits.

    There are two reasons why house prices determine access to revolving credit: (i) workers
by construction, positively weight account ages.




                                                    9
have more access to capital and are less likely to default, increasing the propensity of lenders
to extend any type of credit, and (ii) lenders expect workers to consume more, and therefore
offer more credit cards since they profit from transaction volume (not just balances). In the
first-stage regression, from a purely statistical point of view, we show that the Saiz [2010]
geographic constraint instrument is a strong predictor of the unused credit limit ratio of
individual workers for the 38 MSAs present in our sample. In the second stage regression,
the predicted unused credit limit ratios from the first stage are used to measure the impact
of credit on non-employment durations and annual earnings replacement rates.

    The two main challenges to exogeneity of the Saiz [2010] instrument are (i) aggregate
conditions, and (ii) housing wealth. We conduct a thought experiment to address the first
challenge. While Mian and Sufi [2012] argue that there is no correlation between the supply
elasticity and aggregate conditions except through leverage, if there is a correlation, it should
bias our results toward zero. Suppose MSAs with low supply elasticities have quickly rising
house prices and have better labor markets, then credit should expand and non-employment
durations should be shorter in those MSAs. As we will show below, our IV estimates imply
the opposite relationship.

    To mitigate concerns about housing wealth, we include an equity proxy (the highest
mortgage balance ever observed less the current balance) and HELOC limits (home equity
lines of credit) in all specifications. We argue that HELOCs isolate the amount of home
equity that can be used as an ATM immediately following a job loss. In other words, the
HELOC credit limit just prior to a job loss is a good proxy for access to liquid housing assets
during the non-employment spell. Furthermore, we do not see workers disproportionately
take out new mortgages (which would indicate potential cash-out refinancing) or pay off
mortgages (indicating a sale) during or after layoff.

   To further address concerns over housing wealth and wealth more generally, we conduct
two additional exercises. First, in Online Appendix B.2, we report OLS regressions of unem-
ployment duration on unused credit, directly controlling for the OFHEO house price index.
We show that the inclusion of house prices does not affect our point estimates. Second, in
Online Appendix B.3, we use the 1998 to 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) surveys,
and we show that the relationship between non-employment duration and unused credit card
limits (the only limit available in the SCF) is similar to our IV estimates and unaffected by
the direct inclusion of self-reported home values, liquid assets, or illiquid assets.




                                               10
   Lastly, in Online Appendix B.4 we provide the closest possible test of whether or not the
Saiz instrument is exogenous by using Hansen’s J-test (over-identification test). The over-
identification tests show that the level component of unused credit which is being isolated
by the Saiz instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction.


3.4     Sample Descriptions and Summary Statistics

Based on these identification strategies, we use two samples in this paper.

  i. Displaced Bankrupt Sample: Our first sample includes all displaced households who
     had a bankruptcy flag on their record in the year prior to displacement. We then split
     this sample into a treatment group of 1,000 individuals (to the nearest thousand) whose
     flags are removed in the year of displacement, and a control group of 17,000 individuals
     whose flags remain on their records throughout the displacement.11 In order to garner
     enough observations to disclose this sample, we could only impose a tenure requirement
     of 1 year. Given the way we identify displacements, and our use of lagged credit prior
     to displacement, this sample covers the years 2002-2006.

 ii. Displaced Mortgagor Sample: Our second sample includes displaced workers with
     mortgages who had at least 3 years of tenure at the time of displacement, and worked
     in a non-real-estate industry. These are standard restrictions used in the literature,
     e.g. Davis and Von Wachter [2011], to mitigate any issues associated with seasonal
     employment or weak labor-force attachment. Given these criteria we end up with a
     sample of 32,000 individuals (to the nearest thousand). This sample covers the years
     2002-2006.

   Table 1 includes summary statistics for both samples. All variables are deflated by the
CPI, and the top 1% (and bottom 1% if the variable is not bounded below) of continuous
variables are winsorized. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 1 summarize the displaced bankrupt
sample. Our displaced bankrupt sample is split into a treatment and control group. On
average the demographic characteristics between these two groups are quite close: imputed
years of education is 13.8 years for those who have their flag removed (the treatment group)
  11
     Census requires sample numbers to be rounded off to the nearest hundred to ensure no individual data
is disclosed or can be inferred. We round to the nearest thousand to allow for quicker disclosure of results.




                                                     11
and 13.6 for those who do not have their flag removed (the control group) and average tenure
is 4 years in the treatment group and 3.9 in the control group.

    Individuals whose flags are removed are naturally older, with an average age of 44 in the
treatment group and an average age of 42.4 in the control group. The treatment group earned
$49k before displacement whereas the control group earned $43.5k. While there is a level
difference in earnings, in Online Appendix B.1, we show that the main outcome variables
for the treatment and control group, including wage growth and time spent non-employed,
are statistically indistinguishable prior to the flag removal. The treatment group takes
1.73 quarters to find a job on average after displacement, and their earnings replacement
rate is 83%, whereas the control group takes 1.53 quarters on average to find a job after
displacement, and their earnings replacement rate is 88%. We show in the regression analysis
that follows that the difference in durations is significant after adjusting for composition,
whereas the difference in earnings replacement rates is not.

   Turning to the displaced mortgagor sample, Column (3) of Table 1 shows that average
annual labor earnings prior to layoff was about $56k and that the average worker could
replace 45% of their prior annual labor earnings with unused revolving credit.12 After layoff,
they took roughly 1.67 quarters to find a new job, and their annual earnings replacement
rates were 81% one year after mass displacement, including zeros, similar to what Davis and
Von Wachter [2011] find. Finally, the age of the oldest account is approximately 15 years
on average in our sample. Column (4) of Table 1 shows that if we condition on displaced
mortgagors who have a job in the year following displacement (i.e. in period t + 1), the
average duration is .56 quarters, and the average earnings replacement rate is 1.02 (meaning
a full recovery of earnings). By conditioning on employment, this sample drops earnings
replacement rates equal to zero and thus parses out any effects of duration on earnings.

    To summarize the raw correlations in the displaced mortgagor sample, Figure 1 plots
the duration of non-employment by unused revolving credit to income deciles prior to layoff.
Figure 2 plots the earnings replacement rate by unused revolving credit to income deciles
prior to layoff for those individuals who found a job in the year following displacement. The
deciles of unused revolving credit to income range from approximately zero to roughly 200%.
Those in the top decile can approximately replace 2x their annual income with revolving
credit. Both figures reveal a generally monotone increasing relationship between unused
  12
    The distribution of available credit is skewed. In the SCF, unused credit card limits to annual family
income among the unemployed peaks at 38% in 1998, and among the employed it peaks at 33% in 2007.




                                                   12
credit prior to layoff and both durations and earnings replacement rates, with a pronounced
rise in the last decile of unused credit.



4      Empirical Results

For each dependent variable, we show four sets of results corresponding to (1) OLS for the
displaced bankrupt sample, (2) OLS for the displaced mortgagor sample, (3) the account
age IV (GS-IV) for the displaced mortgagor sample, and (4) the geography IV (Saiz-IV) for
the displaced mortgagor sample. Column (1) therefore relies on the bankrupt sample, and
Columns (2) through (4) rely on the mortgagor sample. In every specification, our vector
of controls (Xi,t ) includes quadratics in age and tenure as well as sex, race and education
dummies, lagged annual income, cumulative lagged earnings (to proxy for assets), 1-digit
SIC industry dummies, lagged characteristics of the previous employer including the size,
age, and wage per worker, a dummy for the presence of auto loans, an equity proxy (the
highest mortgage balance observed less the current balance), HELOC limits (to proxy for
available housing wealth upon layoff), as well as year dummies, the MSA unemployment
rate, and MSA income per capita.


4.1     Duration Results

Table 2 illustrates the impact of unused credit on durations. Column (1) uses the displaced
bankrupt sample, and shows the impact of a derogatory flag drop on duration. The point
estimates imply that if an individual’s bankruptcy flag is dropped in the year of displacement,
they take on average .178 quarters longer to find a job (about 2 weeks longer), relative to
the control group. Column (2), which uses the displaced mortgagor sample, illustrates the
results from a simple OLS regression of duration on unused credit limits. The estimates
reveal a duration elasticity of .25, which implies that being able to replace 10% more of prior
annual income with unused credit is associated with an increase in duration of .3 weeks.13

    In Column (3) we instrument the unused credit limit with the Gross and Souleles [2002]
instrument. We find a duration elasticity of .5 which implies that being able to replace 10%
  13
    .3 weeks comes from multiplying the 10% increase in credit access to income by the OLS coefficient and
then multiplying again by 12 weeks per quarter (i.e. .3 weeks=.1*.25*12).




                                                   13
more of prior annual income with unused credit allows workers to take roughly .6 weeks
longer to find a job. In Column (4), we instrument the unused credit limit with the Saiz
[2010] instrument. We find a duration elasticity of 1.5 which implies that being able to
replace 10% more of prior annual income with unused credit allows workers to take roughly
1.8 weeks longer to find a job.

    To convert the bankruptcy flag removal result into an elasticity, Table 3 shows that a
bankruptcy flag is associated with a contemporaneous increase in revolving credit limits
equal to 7% of prior annual income and an increase in credit scores of 140 pts. This implies
that being able to replace 10% of prior annual income allows displaced workers to take nearly
3 weeks longer to find a job (=.1*.178*12/.07). The size of this point estimate suggests that
there are non-linear effects of credit access on durations since credit constrained households
are reacting more per dollar of credit than less constrained households. In Section 4.4 we
discuss these non-linearities in more detail.

    Our estimates imply that $1 of additional unused credit limit is about half to three-
quarters as potent for unemployment durations as $1 of unemployment benefit. Being able
to replace 5% of annual earnings on a credit card is equivalent to a 10% increase in UI re-
placement rates for the typical 6-month duration of unemployment benefits. In the empirical
UI literature, the impact of a 10% increase in the UI replacement rate for 6 months is to
increase unemployment durations by .3 to 2 weeks with the modal estimate lying between
.5 and 1 for the US (see Nakajima [2012b] and Card et al. [2015] for a summary of recent
empirical and quantitative elasticities). Our estimates imply an equivalent elasticity with
respect to credit of .15 to 1.5 weeks.

    For robustness, Online Appendix C.1 merges our sample with Schedule C tax records
to adjust the non-employment spells for self-employment. Online Appendix C.1 also uses
the earnings gap method to infer partial quarters of non-employment. Under either of these
definitions of non-employment duration, we find that the main results hold.


4.2    Earnings Replacement Rates

Earnings Replacement Rates Excluding Zeros: To avoid confounding annual replace-
ment earnings with durations, in Table 4 we isolate the set of households who have positive
earnings in each quarter during the year after layoff. Table 4 reveals that conditional on




                                             14
finding a job, those with greater credit access find higher wage jobs.

   Column (1) of Table 4 shows that if an individual’s bankruptcy flag is dropped in the
year of displacement, there is a small negative, but statistically insignificant impact of credit
access on earnings replacement rates. On the other hand, Columns (2) through (4) of Table
4 show that being able to replace 10% more of prior annual income increases the earnings
replacement rate of job finders by .3% in the OLS regressions, by .8% using the Gross and
Souleles instrument, and by 1.72% using the Saiz Instrument.

Earnings Replacement Rates Including Zeros: Table 5 illustrates the impact of unused
credit on replacement rates of annual earnings, including zeros for those who do not find
a job. The point estimates in Column (1) through (4) of Table 5 show that the impact of
additional credit access on replacement earnings is statistically indistinguishable from zero.
There are two competing forces generating this result: (i) durations increase with more credit
access, depressing replacement earnings, (ii) of those who find a job, those who have more
credit access find higher wages, increasing replacement earnings. In the sections that follow,
we show that the model’s self-insurance mechanism generates the same offsetting forces.

    These results are, in general, in line with US estimates in the UI literature. Studies that
have considered the impact of unemployment benefits on re-employment earnings have found
positive and significant but mixed-magnitude effects in US data (see Addison and Blackburn
[2000] for a summary), whereas European studies have found both positive and insignificant
effects, as well as negative effects in one case (see Nekoei and Weber [2015] for a summary).
In Online Appendix C, we explore earnings replacement rates at longer horizons for this
sample.


4.3    Size and Productivity of Firms

We show that among individuals who find a job in the year after displacement, those with
greater credit access are more likely to work at larger and more productive firms. Our main
dependent variables include an indicator function if the worker finds a job at a firm in the 99th
percentile of the firm size distribution or better (‘Large Firm Dummy’), measured 1 year after
displacement, as well as an indicator function if the worker finds a job at a firm in the 75th
decile of the wage-per-worker distribution (aggregate wage bill divided by total employees),




                                               15
which is our proxy for productivity.14 These deciles were chosen for comparability: i.e. firms
in the 99th percentile of the size distribution comprise approximately 1/3 of employment,
and firms in the 75th percentile of the wage-per-worker distribution comprise approximately
1/3 of employment. While not reported here, we find similar effects using alternate cutoffs
that are either narrower or broader.

    Table 6 illustrates the impact of unused credit on the odds that a worker finds a job at
a firm in the 99th decile of the size distribution or greater. Column (1) of Table 6 shows
that displaced workers whose flags are removed are 3.9% more likely to work at a large firm
relative to the control group. Columns (2) through (4) show that being able to replace 10%
more of prior annual income increases the odds that a worker finds a job at a large firm by
an insignificant amount in both the OLS and Gross and Souleles regressions, and by 4.7%
using the Saiz Instrument.

    Table 7 illustrates the impact of unused credit on the odds that a worker finds a job at a
firm in the 75th decile of the wage-per-worker (our proxy for labor productivity) distribution
or greater. Column (1) of Table 7 shows that displaced workers whose flags are removed are
2.95% more likely to work at a productive firm relative to the control group. Columns (2)
through (4) show that being able to replace 10% more of prior annual income increases the
odds that a worker finds a job at a productive firm by an insignificant amount in the OLS
and Saiz regressions, and by 1.5% using the Gross and Souleles instrument.

    While these results have mixed significance levels, the modal estimates are positive and
significant, implying that those with greater credit access prior to layoff are more likely to
be re-employed at larger and more productive firms.


4.4    Non-Linear Impact of Credit on Employment Outcomes

Our results reveal differences in responses to similarly sized increases in credit, suggesting
that there are important non-linearities in both duration and earnings replacement rate
elasticities. We construct several sets of results (available upon request) which stratify our
samples by terciles of income and indebtedness. The lowest debt terciles exhibit the greatest
sensitivity to credit, consistent with our finding that previously bankrupt households (who
have very little debt and are credit constrained) have the greatest duration elasticities.
 14
   What we call firms in the text are State Employment Identification Numbers (SEINs) in the LEHD.
SEINs aggregate all plants within a state.




                                               16
    When we split the sample by income, we find more evidence of non-linearities. The middle
tercile of the income distribution exhibits the strongest duration and earnings replacement
rate elasticities, i.e. they are the most sensitive to credit. With any type of non-homothetic
preferences (like Stone-Geary), very low income households must find a job immediately,
which could rationalize this type of non-linearity at the low-end of the income distribution.
In contrast, very high income households are probably unconstrained to begin with, and so
additional credit access will not induce any type of response.


4.5     Borrowing by Displaced Workers

One important point of our empirical section is that regardless of realized borrowing, the
potential to borrow affects job search decisions regardless if the credit line is actually drawn
down. Workers know that if their buffer stock of liquid assets is depleted, they can borrow,
and this affects their job search decisions even if they never borrow. Existing work by
Sullivan [2008] using the PSID and SIPP has shown that about 20% of workers borrow during
unemployment, and it is precisely low wealth workers who borrow during unemployment.
Recent work by ? has updated Sullivan [2008] through the great recession and found similar
results, with greater borrowing occurring among low wealth households in the crisis.

    We plot the distribution of bankcard borrowing among displaced workers. Figure 3, which
is a smoothed density, plots the change in bankcard balance among displaced workers in the
year of layoff relative to one year before layoff. The graph reveals significant heterogeneity
in borrowing responses among displaced workers. Some workers borrow, consistent with
Sullivan [2008], whereas some workers save, also consistent with Sullivan [2008]’s regression
results. As a result, the net amount borrowed among displaced workers is close to zero,
consistent with recent findings (e.g. Gelman et al. [2015], Ganong and Noel [2015], Kolsrud
et al. [2015]). However, this masks quite large and economically significant heterogeneity in
borrowing by displaced workers.

   We further explore the role of borrowing by displaced workers in Figure 4 which illustrates
the change in real revolving debt in the year of layoff relative to 1 year before layoff as a
function of duration.15 Figure 4 shows that borrowing is a weakly increasing function of
unemployment duration, which suggests that those who were able to take the longest to find
  15
    To obtain more power in the graph, durations are recoded to increase sample sizes, (i.e. durations of
length 0 or 1 are coded as 1, durations length 2 to 3 are coded as 3, 3-4=4,5-6=6,7-8=8, 9=9).




                                                   17
a job were those who were able to borrow the most. The graph is a raw mean, and the
standard error is a standard error for the mean, so there is significant composition bias still
present in the graph. To address these concerns, Table 8 illustrates regression results for
the relationship between non-employment duration and borrowing, controlling for as many
characteristics of workers as possible. Column (1) omits controls, and Column (2) includes
controls. The coefficient in Column (2) implies that for every additional quarter of non-
employment, workers borrow on average $200, which is a relatively small average amount.
As discussed above, however, this regression masks the significant heterogeneity of how much
displaced workers borrow, which we are exploring in future research.



5     Model

Given our IV estimates are inherently local estimates, we build a structural model that we
use to obtain independent ‘global’ estimates of the unemployment duration and earnings
replacement rate elasticities. We then use the model to conduct our main experiment which
is to consider how changes in aggregate borrowing limits impact the allocation of workers to
firms, output, and productivity.

    Let t = 0, 1, 2, . . . denote time. Time is discrete and runs forever. There are three types of
agents in this economy. A unit measure of risk averse finitely-lived households, a continuum
of risk neutral entrepreneurs that run the endogenously chosen measure of operating firms,
and a unit measure of risk neutral lenders.

    As in Menzio et al. [2012], there are T ≥ 2 overlapping generations of risk averse house-
holds that face both idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. Each household lives T periods deter-
ministically and discounts the future at a constant rate β ∈ (0, 1). Every period households
first participate in an asset market where they make asset accumulation, borrowing, and
bankruptcy decisions. After the asset market closes, households enter the labor market
where they direct their search for jobs.16 Let ct,t+t0 and Lt,t+t0 respectively denote the con-
sumption and hours worked of an agent born at date t in period t + t0 . The objective of a
household is to maximize the expected lifetime flow utility from non-durable consumption
and leisure.
  16
     The way directed search is modeled in this paper rules out the possibility that wage gains may simply
reflect differences in bargaining power and outside options.




                                                   18

                                           t0 =1


    From this point on we will drop time subscripts and focus on a recursive representation
of the problem. We assume that labor is indivisible, such that the household consumes its
entire time endowment while employed L = 1, and vice verse for the unemployed.

    Households are heterogeneous along several dimensions. Households are either employed
or unemployed, where employed value functions are denoted W and unemployed value func-
tions are denoted U . Let e ∈ {W, U } denote employment status. Let b ∈ B ≡ [b, b] ⊂ R
denote the net asset position of the household, where b > 0 denotes that the household is
saving, and b < 0 indicates that the household is borrowing. Let h ∈ H ≡ [h, h̄] ⊂ R+
denote the human capital of the worker. Workers also differ with respect to the capital
k ∈ K ≡ [k, k̄] ⊂ R+ of the firm with which they are matched, and with respect to their
credit access status a ∈ {G, B} where a = G denotes good standing, and a = B denotes bad
standing. Let NT = {1, 2, . . . , T } denote the set of ages.

    The aggregate state of the economy includes three components: (i) total factor productiv-
ity (TFP) y ∈ Y ⊂ R+ and (ii) the borrowing limit b ⊂ R− , and (iii) the distribution of agents
                          
across states µ : W, U × G, B ×B ×H ×K ×NT → [0, 1]. Let Ω = (y, b, µ) ∈ Y ×R− ×M
summarize the aggregate state of the economy where M is the set of distributions over the
state of the economy. Let µ0 = Φ(Ω, b0 , y 0 ) be the law of motion for the distribution, and
assume productivity and the borrowing limit follow a Markov process. It is important to
note that even though there is an exogenously imposed borrowing limit b, debt will be indi-
vidually priced as in Chatterjee et al. [2007], and many workers will have ‘effective borrowing
limits’ where the bond price reaches zero well before b.

    Let M (u, v) denote the matching function, and define the labor market tightness to
be the ratio of vacancies to unemployment. Since there is directed search, there will be
a separate labor market tightness for each submarket. In each submarket, there is a job
finding rate for households, p(·), that is a function of the labor market tightness θt (h, k; Ω),
such that p(θt (h, k; Ω)) = M (ut (h,k;Ω),v         t (h,k;Ω))
                                            ut (h,k;Ω)
                                                               . On the other side of the market, the hir-
ing rate for firms pf (·) is also a function of the labor market tightness and is given by
pf (θt (h, k; Ω)) = M (ut (h,k;Ω),v t (h,k;Ω))
                            vt (h,k;Ω)
                                               . When households enter the labor market, they choose




                                                            19
which capital intensity (k) submarket to search in.17 Once matched with a firm, a worker
produces f (y, h, k) : Y × H × K → R+ and keeps a share α of this production.18

    At the beginning of every period, households with debt positions b < 0 make a default
decision. In the present formulation, the default punishment is similar to Ch. 7 bankruptcy
in the United States. A household in bankruptcy has a value function scripted by B and
cannot save or borrow. With probability λ, a previously bankrupt agent regains access to
asset markets. If a household is in good standing (i.e. they have regained access to asset
markets), its value function is scripted with a G, and the household can freely save and
borrow.

   The problem of an unemployed household in good standing is given below. To suppress
an additional state variable, we allow unemployment benefits z(k) to be a function of the
worker’s prior wage, but only through its dependence on k.19

We assume that human capital abides by the following law of motion (note that the process
is indexed by employment status U ):

                                                   h0 = H(h, U )
  17
     This is the only dimension along which households optimize since their own human capital h and age t
are predetermined states.
  18
     This a similar assumption to Kaplan and Menzio [2013], and is only made for tractability purposes.
Directed search models with commitment to one submarket, including Shi [2001], find that firms optimally
post unique wages that are monotone in workers’ types, but other models in which firms do not commit to
any given submarket, such as Shimer [2001], find non-monotone wages in workers’ types within any given
job, in some cases. Empirically, wage profiles are concave in education and decreasing for higher levels of
education. We can allow for this by introducing flexible functional forms for production.
  19
     Shocks to k during unemployment could proxy expiration of unemployment benefits.




                                                        20
And the shock processes and aggregate law of motion are taken as given:

                y 0 ∼ F (y 0 | y),     b0 ∼ F (b0 | b),    µ0 = Φ(Ω, y 0 , b0 ),   Ω0 = (y 0 , b0 , µ0 )   (4)

For households who default, they are excluded from both saving and borrowing. There is an
exogenous probability λ that they regain access to asset markets:

Such that
                                                       c ≤ z(k)

and the law of motion for human capital and aggregates are taken as given. For households
in good standing, at the start of every period, they must make a default decision:
                                            n                                       o
                       Ut (b, h, k; Ω) = max UtG (b, h, k; Ω), UtB (b, h, k; Ω) − χ

Let DU,t (b, h, k; Ω) denote the unemployed household’s default decision. Due to the finite
life cycle, a utility penalty of default, χ, is necessary to support credit in equilibrium.

    A similar problem holds for the employed. The value functions are denoted with a W for
employed households, and at the end of every period, employed households face layoff risk
δ. If they are laid off, since the period we will ultimately use is 1 quarter, we must allow the
workers to search immediately for a new job.20 We relegate the employed value functions to
Online Appendix D.

      This allows the model to match labor flows in the data.

5.1       Lenders

There is a continuum of potential lenders who are risk neutral and can obtain funds, without
constraint, at the risk free rate rf . Lenders may lend to households or firms. Recall e ∈
{W, U } denotes employment status. The price of debt for households must therefore satisfy
the inequality below:
                                                      h                                 i
                                                     E 1 − De0 ,t (b0 , h0 , k 0 ; Ω0 )
                             qe,t (b0 , h, k; Ω) ≤                                                       (5)
                                                                  1 + rf

Under free entry, the price of debt must yield exactly the risk free rate, rf , and this equation
holds with equality.

   The price of debt for firms follows a similar form. For the sake of brevity, and the
necessity for additional notation, this bond price will be shown below in the firm section.
Since lenders earn zero profit for each contract in equilibrium, lenders are indifferent between
lending to a firm or a household.


5.2       Firms

There is a continuum of risk neutral entrepreneurs that operate constant returns to scale
production functions. The entrepreneurs invest in capital k ∈ K ⊂ R+ and post vacancies
to attract workers in the frictional labor market. We assume capital is denominated in units
of the final consumption good.

   The entrepreneur, when attempting to create a firm, is subject to a financing constraint.
When a firm is not yet operational, the firm does not have access to perfect capital markets.
The firm must borrow the money, bf < 0 to finance the initial capital investment. We assume
the firm is not subject to the aggregate debt limit.21 If the firm fails to find an employee,
the firm defaults and the capital is lost.22

       When deciding whether or not to post a vacancy, the firm solves the following problem.
  21
     This is because we want to isolate the impact of household credit limits on the macroeconomy. In future
work, we are exploring the role of firm constraints on sorting.
  22
     We are envisioning specific assets with low liquidation value, however, in Online Appendix J.4 we allow
for an explicit partial liquidation by the lender (capital is denoted in units of the final consumption good,
and so this amounts to capital reversibility).




                                                        22
It chooses capital k ∈ K and what types of workers, indexed by human capital and age
(h, t) ∈ H × NT , to hire. In the event that the worker is hired, the firm has access to perfect
capital markets and repays bf immediately. In the event that no worker can be found, the
firm defaults. Let Jt (h, k; Ω) be the profit stream of a firm that has k units of physical capital
and is matched with an age t worker with human capital h. Let qf,t (b, k, h; Ω) denote the
bond price faced by the firm. Then the problem a firm solves when attempting to recruit a
worker is given below (recall b is negative if borrowing),

                κ ≤ max pf (θt (h, k; Ω))[Jt (h, k; Ω) + bf ] + (1 − pf (θt (h, k; Ω))) · 0             (6)
                     k,h,t


such that

                                        −k ≥ qf,t (bf , k, h; Ω)bf                                      (7)

With free entry in the lending market, the price of debt must be given by (note that k is
implicitly related to bf in the equation above),

                                                           pf (θt (h, k; Ω))
                                   qf,t (bf , k, h; Ω) =                                                (8)
                                                                1 + rf

Using the fact that Equation (6) holds with equality under free entry and that Equation (7)
must also hold with equality, the market tightness in each submarket which is entered with
positive probability is given by,
                                                                            !
                                                           κ + (1 + rf )k
                                  θt (h, k; Ω) = p−1
                                                  f                                                     (9)
                                                             Jt (h, k; Ω)

For tractability, we assume that workers and firms split output according to a constant piece-
rate α. We assume the firm keeps a share 1 − α of its production, and workers receive the
remaining share α of production. Of that remaining output, firms must then pay a fixed
cost fc .23 The value function for the firm is given by,

          Jt (h, k; Ω) = (1 − α)f (y, h, k) − fc + βE (1 − δ)Jt+1 (h0 , k; Ω0 ) ,
                                                                              
                                                                                        ∀t ≤ T
  23
    The representative entrepreneur will make exactly zero profits across plants and over time, even if some
firms are temporarily making negative profits. When calibrating the model this fixed cost will serve to
generate a small surplus for firms, and help the model match quantitative features of the data.




                                                     23
                                          JT +1 (h, k; Ω) = 0

There are three stark assumptions implicit in this value function, (i) zero liquidation value
of capital, (ii) static capital, and (iii) no on-the-job search. In Online Appendix J we allow
capital to have a nonzero liquidation value and we allow firms to dynamically invest in
capital. We do not explicitly model on-the-job search due to tractability (it would require
firms knowing workers’ asset policy functions, see Herkenhoff [2013] for a model with one
sided heterogeneity, credit, and OJS), but by allowing firms to invest in capital, we mitigate
workers’ incentives to switch jobs. In fact, with frictionless capital adjustment, firms set
capital to the surplus maximizing value and workers have no incentive to leave the firm.


5.3     Equilibrium: Definition, Existence and Uniqueness

Let x summarize the state vector of a household. An equilibrium in this economy is
a set of household policy functions for saving and borrowing ({b0e,t (x)}Tt=1 ), bankruptcy
({De,t (x)}Tt=1 ), and a capital search choice {kt (x)}Tt=1 , a debt price ({qe,t (x)}Tt=1 ) for both the
employed (e = W ) and unemployed (e = U ), a debt price for firms ({qf,t (x)}Tt=1 ), a market
tightness function θt (h, k; Ω), processes for aggregate shocks (y, b), and an aggregate law of
motion Φ(Ω, y 0 , b0 ) such that


  i. Given the law of motion for aggregates, the bond price, and market tightness function,
     households’ decision rules are optimal.

 ii. Given the law of motion for aggregates and the bond price, the free entry condition in
     the labor market (9) holds.

iii. Given household policy functions, the labor market tightness function, and the law of
     motion for aggregates, the free entry conditions for lenders making loans to households
     (5) and firms (8) both hold.

iv. The aggregate law of motion is consistent with household policy functions.


    We use the same tools as Shi [2009] and Menzio and Shi [2011] to solve for a Block
Recursive Equilibrium in which policy functions and prices do not depend on the aggregate
distribution µ (even though it fluctuates over time and can be recovered by simulation).




                                                   24
However, policy functions still depend on aggregate productivity, y, and the borrowing limit,
b.

    In Online Appendix E, we prove two propositions which we will use in the numeric portion
of the paper. First, a Block Recursive Equilibrium exists in this economy, and thus to solve
the model economy, we only need to solve the first ‘block’ of the equilibrium i.-iii. ignoring
iv., and then we can simulate to recover the dynamics of µ. Furthermore, we establish that
certain classes of utility, matching, and production functions yield uniqueness.



6      Calibration

The parameters are calibrated so that the model’s stochastic steady state is consistent with
1970-2007 averages. Stochastic steady state means that aggregate total factor productivity
(y) still fluctuates but that the borrowing limit (b) is constant forever.24 The period is set
to one quarter. We calibrate the productivity process to match the Fernald et al. [2012],
non-utilization adjusted total factor productivity series. The series is logged and band pass
filtered to obtain deviations from trend with periods between 6 and 32 quarters. Aggregate
productivity deviations are assumed to fluctuate over time according to an AR(1) process:

                              ln(y 0 ) = ρ ln(y) + 1 s.t. 1 ∼ N (0, σe2 )

Estimation yields ρ = 0.894 and σe = 0.00543, and the process is discretized using Rouwen-
hurst’s method.

   We set the annualized risk free rate to 4%. In stochastic steady state, we set b = −.5,
which is non-binding for all agents in our simulations. We set the job destruction rate to a
constant 10% per quarter, δ = .1 (Shimer [2005]). For the labor market matching function,
we use a constant returns to scale matching function that yields well-defined job finding
probabilities:
                                              u·v       
                               M (u, v) = ζ      ζ 1/ζ
                                                       ∈ 0, 1)
                                          (u + v )
The matching elasticity parameter is chosen to be ζ = 1.6 as in Schaal [2012].
  24
    A long sequence of productivity shocks is drawn according to the AR(1) process for y and held fixed. A
large number of agents (N=30,000) is then simulated for a large number of periods (T=270 quarters, burning
the first 100 quarters). Averages are reported over the remaining 170 quarters across R = 10 repetitions.
Online Appendix K describes the solution algorithm in detail.




                                                   25
   Preferences are given below, where η is the flow from leisure, and L=1 for employed
persons and L=0 otherwise:

                                                 c1−σ − 1
                                 u(c, 1 − L) =            + η(1 − L)
                                                   1−σ

We set the risk aversion parameter to a standard value, σ = 2. The life span is set to
T = 80 quarters (20 years), and newly born agents are born unemployed, with zero assets,
in good credit standing, and with a uniform draw over the grid of human capital. The
household share of income, α, is set to 23 , and the production function is Cobb-Douglas,
f (y, h, k) = yha k (1−a) with parameter a = 23 . The bankruptcy re-access parameter λ = .036
generates the statutory 7 year exclusion period.

    The remaining 8 parameters including the discount factor β, the unemployment benefit
z, the utility penalty of bankruptcy χ, the entry cost of firms κ, the fixed cost of opera-
tions fc , the flow from leisure η, the human capital appreciation p+∆ rate, and the human
capital depreciation p−∆ rate are calibrated jointly to match 8 moments: the fraction of
households with liquid asset to income ratios less than 1%, the immediate consumption loss
from unemployment, the bankruptcy rate, the unemployment rate, the relative volatility of
unemployment to productivity, the autocorrelation of unemployment, the wage growth of 25
year olds, and the long term consumption losses from layoff. We do not directly target the
duration elasticity or earnings replacement rate elasticity.

    The household discount factor β = .988, which implies a discount rate of about 5% per
annum, is calibrated to match the fact that 25.4% of households have a ratio of liquid assets
to annual gross income less than one percent.25 We argue that for high frequency search
models (in which unemployment durations are very short), that liquid wealth is the relevant
calibration target since it isolates the portion of wealth that can be drawn down in response
to a temporary income shock (such as job loss). As Kaplan and Violante [2014] show, it is
precisely access to liquid assets that determines the response of households to income shocks.

   The unemployment benefit is set to a constant, z(k) = .101 ∀k, in order to match
the observed consumption losses following job loss.26 This value of z yields an average UI
  25
     See Kaplan and Violante [2014] and Herkenhoff [2013]. The data is from the SCF (and it predecessor
survey the Survey of Consumer Credit). For each household, we sum cash, checking, money market funds,
CDS, corporate bonds, government saving bonds, stocks, and mutual funds less credit card debt over annual
gross income. We take the mean of this liquid asset to income ratio across households in each survey year,
and then we average over 1970 to 2007 to arrive at the moment.
  26
     Browning and Crossley [2001] find 16% consumption losses after 6 months of unemployment for Cana-

replacement rate of approximately 40% for the lowest human capital workers (Shimer [2005]),
but implies significantly lower UI replacement rates of 10% for higher human capital workers,
in line with Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis [2013].

   The labor vacancy posting cost κ = .034 is chosen to target a mean U6 unemployment
rate of 8.9% which is the 1994-2007 average,27 and we set the bankruptcy utility penalty
χ = .077 to generate the average bankruptcy rate in the US from 1970-2007 of approximately
.1% per quarter.28

   The processes for human capital are calibrated to generate 1.05% wage growth per quarter
while employed, as well as the long term consumption losses of displaced households.29 These
processes are governed by two parameters p−∆ and p+∆ .
                                     
                                     h − ∆ w/ pr. p

                                      
                                      h + ∆ w/ pr. p
                                                      +∆ if employed
                      H(h, W ) = h0 =
                                      h     w/ pr. 1 − p+∆ if employed

In the calibration below, the grid for human capital, h ∈ [.5, .6, .7, .8, .9, 1], as well as the
step size, ∆ = .1, between grid points are taken as given. Our estimates are p−∆ = .143 and
p+∆ = .077, which imply that once every year-and-a-half, unemployed agents in the model
expect to fall one rung on the human capital ladder. This generates between 10% to 20%
earnings losses (depending on the initial human capital) per annum, which is smaller than
dians, and as they explain, scaling food consumption losses in Gruber [1994] results in 15% consumption
losses in the year of layoff for US households in the PSID. We therefore target a 15% consumption loss
from the quarter prior to initial displacement until the end of the 1st year of layoff, 4 quarters after initial
displacement.
   27
      Since there is no concept of “marginally-attached” workers or part-time employment in the model, U6
is a better measure of unemployment for the model. The data is available from 1994:Q1 to present.
   28
      The bankruptcy rate is .41% per annum from 1970-2007 according to the American Bankruptcy Institute
(accessed via the Decennial Statistics).
   29
      Our measure of wage growth in the data is the median 2-year real-income growth rate for households
aged between 25 and 30 in the PSID between 2005 and 2007. In the data, the median growth rate among
this subset of households was 8.8% (we condition on at least 1k of earnings in each year). Converting this
estimate to quarters yields a quarterly income growth rate of 1.05%. Assuming agents are born at 25, our
model measure of wage growth is at the midpoint of that interval, measured among 27.5 year olds in the
model. Using the 2005-2011 PSID, we calculate a full consumption recovery (1% higher relative to pre-layoff
consumption) 2 years after layoff for unemployed households who have zero duration spells. For distressed
layoffs, Saporta-Eksten [2013]’s estimates long-run consumption losses of approximately 8% two years after
initial displacement. We take the average of these two estimates and target a 3% consumption loss.

the 30% per year Ljungqvist and Sargent [1998] target.

   In terms of the flow utility of leisure, we follow most of the quantitative search and
matching literature by setting η to target a labor market moment. We choose η = .237
to match the autocorrelation of unemployment since the flow utility of leisure determines
unemployed households’ willingness to remain out of work.

    We calibrate the fixed cost of operations for firms fc = .100, which determines how
sensitive firms are to productivity shocks, to match the observed volatility of unemployment
to productivity.

    Table 9 summarizes the parameters, and Table 10 summarizes the model’s fit relative to
the targeted moments. The key targeted moments that control the sensitivity of agents to
credit are the consumption drop upon layoff, which is most directly controlled by z (UI), and
the long term consumption loss which is controlled by p−∆ (the human capital depreciation
rate), and the model matches those targeted moments quite well. While the model produces
less volatility than the data in response to productivity shocks, as we show in the next
section, the model succeeds at replicating the elasticity of replacement rates and durations
with respect to credit, both of which were non-targeted moments. In other words, the
responsiveness of agents to credit in our model matches the observed responsiveness in the
data, independent of the model’s ability to generate volatility.

    The fundamental tension in the model is between generating borrowing/bankruptcies and
matching the business cycle facts: intuition would suggest that lowering the discount factor
would be the best way to generate borrowing/bankruptcies but doing so only exacerbates
the models ability to match business cycle facts.30 The more impatient are agents, the more
they want to work immediately, regardless of productivity, which dampens business cycle
dynamics. Because of the two sided heterogeneity, we cannot deploy the simple fixes in
Hagedorn and Manovskii [2008]; raising the value of leisure will, at best, make only the
lowest-human-capital agents indifferent between working and not, and reducing firm surplus
will, at best, make only the lowest-capital firms sensitive to productivity movements. The
remainder of the distribution of workers and firms will not, in general, respond to productivity
shocks. We discuss this more in Online Appendix F.

    To then generate more borrowing, the calibration moves into regions the parameters which penalize
default.

6.1     Non-Targeted Moments: Model Estimates of Duration and
        Earnings Replacement Rate Elasticities

In this section, we use the model generated policy functions to simulate a large mass of
agents and estimate the ‘global’ duration and replacement earnings elasticities with respect
to credit access.31 Since the model’s debt pricing schedule does not have an explicit credit
limit, we define the credit limit to be the minimum of the level of debt where the bond
interest rate first exceeds 30% per quarter and the exogenous debt limit b.32 We isolate
newly laid off agents, and then we compute each agent’s optimal search decision under loose
(b = bL ) and tight exogenous debt limits (b = bH > bL ), ceteris paribus.

    This calculation is feasible as the policy function of each agent is contingent on the
realization of Ω which includes the exogenous debt limit b. So at each decision node, encoded
in this policy function is the search decision of the agent if debt limits tighten as well as if
debt limits remain slack. What makes this experimental design valid is the block recursive
nature of the model; the menu of job choices faced by the household is not a function of b.
This allows us to determine the impact of changing debt limits, holding all else constant,
including the set of jobs from which households can choose.33 Online Appendix G provides
more detail on the way we calculate the model’s elasticities.

    Table 11 compares the model’s global elasticities to the data. The first row of Table
11 shows that if unused credit to income increases by 10% in the model, then agents take
.72 (=.608*12*.1) weeks longer to find a job. This falls in the mid-range of our OLS and
IV estimates. However, the elasticity calculated in the model is a ‘global’ elasticity and is
conceptually different from the local average treatment effect identified by the IVs.

    The second row of Table 11 shows that the model replacement rate elasticity (inclusive
of 0s) is -.024, which is quite small and in line with the insignificant coefficients found in the
data. To understand why this is the case, we decompose earnings losses in the model into
  31
      We calculate the duration and replacement earnings elasticities using 30,000 agents simulated for 270
periods (burning the first 100 periods), while holding the aggregate state fixed at y = 1, and defining bH =-.1
and bL =-.5. Agents hold the same rational beliefs over the transition rate Pb between bH and bL as Section
7.
   32
      Only .03% of the agents in the model will ever borrow at real quarterly rates above 30%. The results
are robust to alternate definitions of this effective debt limit.
   33
      The intuition is simple and is formally shown in the existence proof. JT (h, k; y) = f (y, h, k) does not
depend on b, and working back, neither does Jt (h, k; y) for arbitrary t. Therefore, using the free entry
condition, θt (h, k; y), which pins down the menu of operating submarkets, will not either.




                                                      29
two offsetting components: (i) access to additional credit depresses job finding rates which
tends to lower replacement earnings, and (ii) access to additional credit increases the capital
intensity of submarkets searched by agents which tends to raise replacement earnings.

    To capture the first component, the third row of Table 11 shows that when debt limits
expand by 10% of prior annual income, job finding rates fall by 1.1% as workers can better
self-insure while searching more thoroughly for jobs. This tends to decrease the replacement
earnings of agents, since unemployed workers have an earnings replacement rate of zero. To
capture the second component, the fourth row of Table 11 shows that being able to replace
10% more of prior income with credit allows agents in the model to search in submarkets with
2.7% greater intellectual or physical capital intensity. This tends to increase the replacement
earnings of agents. The combination of the two effects, namely the negative influence of job
finding rates and positive influence of capital intensity on replacement earnings, yields the
near-zero replacement earnings elasticity observed in the model.

   The fifth row of Table 11 is designed to remove any duration effects from the replacement
earnings elasticity. This row shows that among job finders at t+1 (the year after layoff),
being able to replace 10% more of prior income with credit results in a 1.8% greater earnings
replacement rate, which falls toward the high end of our IV estimates.

    Lastly, we can compare the impact of bankruptcy flag removal on duration and replace-
ment rates in both the model and data. The final two rows of Table 11 show that following
flag removal, displaced workers take .066 quarters longer to find a job, whereas in the data
this number is .178. Following flag removal, agents earn .7% more in the model, whereas in
the data, the impact on replacement earnings is insignificant.

    Overall, we believe the model’s self-insurance mechanism generates replacement rate
elasticities (both inclusive and exclusive of 0s) as well as duration elasticities that are in line
with our IV estimates.



7     Main Quantitative Experiment

Based on the model’s success at replicating key non-targeted micro moments, we now ag-
gregate across individual agents to explore how credit access impacts the macroeconomy. In
particular, we study the way changes in borrowing limits impact the path of output, labor




                                                30
market sorting and therefore productivity during the 2007-2009 recession. We do so by com-
paring aggregate outcomes across two economies, both of which have the same beliefs about
debt limit transitions Pb :

1. Tight Debt Limit Economy: The debt limit tightens from b = −.5 (a non-binding
   value) to b = −.1 in 2008-Q4 (the first quarter in which the aggregate consumer credit
   limit declined34 ), and stays there permanently. As we discuss below, the new debt limit
   generates a similar debt to income (DTI) and borrowing contraction as the data.

2. Constant Debt Limit Economy: The debt limit b = −.5 remains constant throughout
   the simulation.

In the experiments below, both economies are simulated in their ergodic stochastic steady
states with the non-binding debt limit, b = −.5, for a large number of periods. We then
feed in a realized set of shocks that replicates, as approximated on a grid, the path of the
Fernald et al. [2012] productivity residuals from 1974-Q1 to 2012-Q4. The borrowing limit
is held constant at b = −.5 through 2008-Q4 in both economies, for simplicity. In 2008-Q4,
one economy has the limit tighten to b = −.1, and it remains there permanently.

    We impose that both economies have the same beliefs over debt transitions. Let pl,l
be the probability of remaining in the ‘low’ debt limit state, b = −.1, and let ph,h be the
probability of remaining in the ‘high’ debt limit state, b =!−.5. Then the transition matrix
                                           pl,l    1 − pl,l
for the debt limit b is given by Pb =                        . Agents understand that if the
                                         1 − ph,h    ph,h
debt limit tightens, it is permanent, so we set pl,l = 1. And, agents also understand that
once every 34 years (from 1974 to 2008), debt limits will tighten, so we set ph,h = .9926. On
average, therefore, agents are rational.

    We show in Table 12 that the model economy replicates the liquid wealth of displaced
households leading up to the crisis. Furthermore, approximately 14% of agents in the model
borrow, and of those that borrow, they replace 9.8% of lost income using unsecured credit
which is in line with Sullivan [2008]’s findings. We then document in Table 13 that the new
debt limit b = −.1 delivers roughly the same magnitude decline in both borrowing and debt
to income (DTI) ratios as the data.

7.1       Model Results

Figure 5 illustrates the path for the exogenous component of productivity y and the path
for the borrowing limit b. These are the two inputs in the experiment. Each plot contains
two dashed lines that correspond to differing degrees of debt limit tightening. The dashed
blue line corresponds to the economy where limits tighten to b = −.1, and, for the sake of
robustness, we also include the dash-dot red line which corresponds to the economy where
limits tighten to b = −.2 (this delivers a drop in DTIs half as severe as the b = −.1 economy).

    Table 13 shows that the fraction of households borrowing falls by 3.09 percentage points
in the economy in which the aggregate limit tightens to b = −.1 and 1.21 percentage points
when the aggregate debt limits tightens to b = −.2. Economy-wide debt to income ratios
fall by 1.09 percentage points and .53 percentage points, respectively. In the data, the
fraction of households that stopped borrowing fell by 6.77 percentage points from 2007 to
2010 (measured in the SCF) while the debt to income ratio fell by .86 percentage points
from 2007 to 2010 (measured in the SCF).35

   Figure 6 plots the percentage change in employment during the 2007-2009 recession across
the economy with a tighter debt limit versus the economy with a fixed debt limit. When
debt limits tighten, employment tends to increase, persistently. The mechanism is that with
looser credit limits, unemployed households borrow to smooth consumption while thoroughly
searching for capital-intensive jobs. If debt limits tighten, they lose their ability to self-insure,
and, as a result, take low-capital-intensity jobs that are relatively quick to find. In other
words, when limits tighten, low-asset job losers take relatively less productive employment
opportunities. This introduces a strong tension between recovery speed and recovery health,
as workers find jobs more quickly but these jobs are of lower quality.

    As Figure 9 shows, the aggregate capital stock held by entrepreneurs drops severely
relative to the economy in which debt limits are held constant. This is entirely driven by
new entrepreneurial entrants posting more vacancies in submarkets with less capital, and
constrained households searching for jobs in those submarkets. The time it takes for the
aggregate capital stock to recover to its pre-recession levels is as much as 6 quarters longer
in the economy in which debt limits tighten.

       Because households become more constrained and take jobs in which there is less capital
  35
    While not reported here for the sake of space, the bankruptcy rate reaches .97% in the model in the
quarter in which limits are tightened, which is in line with ABI bankruptcies per capita.




                                                  32
per unit of labor, Figure 7 shows that measured labor productivity, defined as output over
employment, declines when debt limits are tightened. The economy in which debt limits
tighten the most has a .28 percentage point lower labor productivity as compared to the
economy with constant debt limits, and this productivity gap persists throughout the recov-
ery. In Online Appendix J, when we allow for capital investment to change over the course
of a match, the labor productivity decline is slightly less pronounced because firms have the
ability to invest more in existing matches during the recovery.

    In terms of production, the impact of tighter debt limits on aggregate output is theoret-
ically ambiguous: households find jobs faster, but the jobs workers find are less productive.
However, Figure 8 shows that quantitatively the reduction in capital per worker is so severe
that output falls by .11 percentage points.

    The mechanism at the heart of the output decline involves a reallocation of workers from
high capital firms to low capital firms. To understand this reallocation in greater detail,
we now turn to standard measures of sorting. Figure 10 plots the percentage change in the
correlation between human capital, h, and firm capital, k, during the 2007-2009 recession.
Figure 11 plots the corresponding percentage change in the Spearman rank correlation co-
efficient between human capital, h, and firm capital, k, as well (workers are ranked by h,
and firms are ranked by k, and the Spearman Rank correlation coefficient is the resulting
correlation between the numeric ranks of workers and firms). The raw correlation coefficient
between worker human capital and firm physical capital is approximately +.33.

    Figures 10 and 11 show that in the economy in which debt limits are tighter, these stan-
dard measures of sorting improve. The mechanism behind this sorting improvement is that
in the economy in which debt limits tighten, unemployed agents with low-human-capital
cannot borrow to smooth consumption while thoroughly searching for jobs. Therefore, they
take jobs that are less-capital-intensive, but more abundant. On average, since low human
capital workers are less productive (recall the assumption of supermodularity), tighter debt
limits force these ‘low quality’ workers to take ‘low quality’ jobs. As such, standard measures
of sorting improve, even as output falls, since they do not take into account the investment
decisions of firms. In this economy, these standard measures of sorting are not good prox-
ies for either productivity or output, even with a supermodular production function.36 In
  36
    In Online Appendix I we explore alternate measures of sorting in more detail, including other measures
of mismatch proposed in the literature. We show that alternate measures of mismatch, such as distance from
surplus maximizing match (Lise and Robin [2013]), are countercyclical in the model. This general pattern
of countercyclical mismatch is in line with the data, e.g. Moscarini and Vella [2008] and Şahin et al. [2012].




                                                      33
Online Appendix H, we show that households would be willing to give up .09% of lifetime
consumption to live in a world in which borrowing limits do not tighten in 2007, even though
standard measures of sorting would be lower in that world.

    Allowing firms to invest and workers to save are standard assumptions in most neoclas-
sical business cycle models but are often difficult to incorporate in search theoretic models.
The fact that standard measures of sorting move in the opposite direction of output and
productivity under these mild assumptions raises important questions about the welfare
implications of sorting patterns derived from search theoretic models with linear utility or
under the assumption of fixed firm types.


7.2    Robustness: Capital Investment and Liquidation Value

We conduct two robustness exercises in Online Appendix J. First, we allow for the en-
trepreneurs to invest in capital over time, mitigating concerns about both quits and on-
the-job-search. With costless adjustments to entrepreneur capital, there would never be a
reason to quit or change jobs. We find that our main results are largely unchanged, but
the ability to invest in capital during recoveries marginally dampens the response of capital,
productivity, output, and sorting to business cycle shocks. Second, we allow for a liquidation
value of firm capital, and again, the main predictions of the model still hold.



8     Conclusions

Our paper provides the first estimates of the impact of credit constraints on job finding rates
and subsequent replacement wages of displaced workers. Using new administrative data, we
find that medium-tenure displaced mortgagors, in response to being able to replace 10% of
their annual income with revolving credit, take .15 to 3 weeks longer to find a job but obtain
an earnings replacement rate that is 0 to 1.7% greater. Furthermore, displaced individuals
with greater credit access tend to find jobs at larger and more productive firms.

    We develop a labor sorting model with credit to provide structural estimates of the im-
pact of credit on the duration of unemployment and how much income displaced individuals
replace in their new job. The model yields estimates of approximately .7 and 1.8%, respec-
tively for the duration of unemployment and the income replacement rate, which are similar



                                              34
to our empirical estimates.

    We then use the model to understand the impact of consumer credit on productivity,
output, and employment. The model shows that tighter debt limits during recessions may
increase employment during the recovery, but depress both productivity and output. This
tension between the speed of recovery and health of recovery is at the heart of the mechanism:
tighter debt limits force constrained households to cut their job search short, taking relatively
unproductive jobs that are more abundant.

    Our empirical and quantitative findings have implications for the way both policy-makers
and economists think about the optimal provision of unemployment insurance (Marimon and
Zilibotti [1999], Acemoglu and Shimer [1998], Shimer and Werning [2005]) and the response
of labor markets to monetary policy (Gornemann et al. [2012], Auclert [2014]). The fact that
increases in credit access can reduce job finding rates by easing household credit constraints
brings into question the ability of the Federal Reserve Bank to effectively meet the mandate
of “maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.”

   We view this paper as the beginning of a research agenda which uses new micro data
and theory to understand how consumer credit impacts the allocation of households to firms.
The next step in our research agenda is to measure the impact of consumer credit constraints
on the other side of the market, on the Schedule C entrepreneurs and the workers they hire
(Herkenhoff et al. [2016]).

Notes. Model estimates derived from simulating 30,000 agents in steady state with productivity held at
y = 1 for T=270 (discarding the first 100 periods) and computing job finding behavior under
counterfactually looser limits. See Section 6.1 and Online Appendix G for more details. Data estimates
from Tables 2 through 4.

Notes. 2007 SCF liquid wealth calculated as the sum of savings, checking, money market, mutual funds,
CDs, bonds, and stocks less credit card debt, taken as ratio to gross family income. Job losers defined as
those who made the transition from employed to unemployed in the last quarter, in both model and data.
