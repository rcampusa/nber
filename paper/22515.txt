                                           ABSTRACT

As hospitals are increasingly held accountable for patients' post-discharge outcomes under new
payment models, hospitals may choose to acquire skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to better manage
these outcomes. This raises the question of whether patients discharged to hospital-based SNFs have
better outcomes. In unadjusted comparisons, hospital-based SNF patients have much lower Medicare
utilization in the 180 days following discharge relative to freestanding SNF patients. We solved the
problem of differential selection into hospital-based and freestanding SNFs by using differential
distance from home to the nearest hospital with a SNF relative to the distance from home to the
nearest hospital without a SNF as an instrument. We found that hospital-based SNF patients spent
roughly 5 more days in the community and 6 fewer days in the SNF in the 180 days following their
original hospital discharge with no significant effect on mortality or hospital readmission.

1. Introduction

         Medicare skilling nursing facility (SNF) care has been a major focus of recent policy

discussions because, although they provide valuable care for many, they also serve as a substitute

for both more expensive and less expensive types of care (Newhouse 2013). In the context of

poor outcomes such as long SNF stays and high rates of hospital readmissions, some have

questioned the underlying value of these services given their high cost to the Medicare program

(Ackerly and Grabowski 2014). One factor that has potentially contributed to poor outcomes is

the fragmentation in delivery between hospitals and SNFs. One recent study suggested that

stronger hospital-SNF linkages, independent of common ownership, were found to reduce re-

hospitalization rates (Rahman et al. 2013a). As hospitals are increasingly held accountable for

patients' post-discharge outcomes under new payment models, hospitals may choose to acquire

SNFs to better manage these outcomes. An open research question is whether patients who go to

hospital-based SNFs have better outcomes at lower episode costs than patients who go to non-

hospital-based SNFs.

         The number of hospital-based SNFs has ebbed and flowed over the decades in response

to policy changes. As way of background, Medicare covers medical care for older adults

including hospital and post-acute care services, while Medicaid is a means-tested programs that

covers chronic nursing home care. As a bit of history, hospital-based1 SNFs were largely an

afterthought in the 1970s and early 1980s when Medicare reimbursed inpatient hospital care on a

cost-based basis. However, when Medicare shifted to the inpatient prospective payment system

(PPS) in 1982, hospitals were paid a fixed amount per discharge and they were no longer


1
  The colloquial term in the literature for hospital-owned skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are “hospital-based” SNFs.
We acknowledge that some hospital-owned SNFs are not technically based in the hospital, but given the widespread
use of this term, we employ the term hospital-based in this study to encompass all SNFs owned by a hospital even if
they are located outside of the hospital campus.

                                                          1
incentivized to provide additional services or days of inpatient care. Given the payment incentive

to discharge “sicker and quicker” (Sager et al. 1989), many hospitals formed their own SNFs as a

potential discharge location. At that time, Medicare paid SNFs on a cost-based basis. Relative to

freestanding SNFs, hospital-based SNFs had higher costs per day and shorter length-of-stay.

Hospitals claimed this was due to a more complex case-mix, while freestanding SNFs suggested

it was due to accounting practices and unnecessary staffing costs. The number of hospital-based

SNFs peaked in 1998 with 2,173 facilities nationwide (or 13.83% of all SNFs). In 1998,

Medicare adopted a PPS system for SNFs that imposed a uniform payment system on

freestanding and hospital-based SNFs that did not recognize potential cost differences across the

two settings other than those related to case-mix, area wages, and urban or rural location.

Following the SNF PPS, many hospitals closed their SNFs (Rahman, Zinn, and Mor 2013c). By

2014, only about 800 SNFs (or 5% of all SNFs) in the U.S. were hospital-based.

       Answering the research question of the effect of SNF ownership on outcomes and costs is

complicated by selection. Clearly, whether a hospital discharges a patient to its’ own SNF is not

random. Prior research has suggested that good candidates for faster recovery and discharge to

the community are preferentially selected into hospital-based SNFs (Stearns et al. 2006). Thus,

simple comparisons of discharge outcomes across hospital-based and freestanding SNFs,

controlling for observable characteristics, will not yield causal estimates of the effect of SNF

hospital-based status on discharge outcomes. To address this issue, we instrument for choice of

a hospital-based SNF using differential distance from the patient’s home to the nearest hospital

with and without a SNF. Because distance is important towards predicting hospital choice and

an individual chooses where to live without regard as to whether nearby hospitals own SNFs, the

identifying assumption is that the instrument will be correlated with selection of a hospital with a



                                                 2
SNF but independent of patient-specific health issues that would determine selection. With this

instrument, we mimic randomization of residents into hospital-based SNFs when estimating the

effects of hospital-based status on SNF discharge outcomes.

       Using national Minimum Data Set assessments linked with Medicare claims, we study a

national cohort of residents who were newly admitted to SNFs from a hospital in 2009. After

instrumenting for hospital-based status, we found that hospital-based SNF patients spent 5.7

fewer days in a SNF relative to patients discharged to free-standing SNFs and 4.8 more days min

the community without home health services.



2. Conceptual Framework and Related Research

2.1 Conceptual Framework

       This conceptual framework explains the economics behind three choices central to our

empirical analysis of SNF quality of care for patients who enter a SNF upon hospital discharge.

First, the hospital chooses whether or not to have a hospital-based SNF. Second, after falling ill

or needing treatment, the patient chooses the hospital, which may or may not have a hospital-

based SNF. Third, upon discharge the patient (in consultation with clinicians or discharge

coordinators) chooses which SNF to enter. These three choices, which are made with an eye to

quality of care, make it impossible to run simple ordinary least squares regression to identify the

causal effect of being in a hospital-based SNF on quality of care. Fortunately, our conceptual

framework also reveals a valid instrumental variable. We discuss each choice in turn.

       Hospitals choose whether to have a hospital-based SNF or not, based on the expected

profit from owning a hospital-based SNF compared to not owning one. A hospital then chooses




                                                 3
to have a hospital-based SNF if the following expression comparing the expected present

discounted difference between revenues and costs holds.



         E −           |  -   > E −                 | 



This simple framework helps explain which types of hospitals are more likely to own a hospital-

based SNF and how this choice is endogenous with quality.

       The main costs of running a nursing home are capital, labor, administrative overhead

(including IT), and other input costs. Hospitals may have a lower cost of capital for raising

money to build or expand, or may face higher costs if land prices near the hospital are higher

than in more suburban or rural settings where nursing homes are typically located. Average

labor costs per filled bed could be lower in a hospital-based SNF if nurses can be redeployed

easily between the hospital and the SNF. Average costs can be lower in a vertically integrated

hospital-based SNF that shares fixed costs of overhead or purchasing supplies. In sum, larger

hospitals are more likely to have a hospital-based SNF than smaller hospitals.

       On the revenue side, there are some clear advantages and disadvantages to having a

hospital-based SNF. The fixed cost of running a SNF means that a hospital would need a

sufficiently large number of discharges to make it likely that the SNF would be at, or near,

capacity most of the time. A small hospital with few Medicare discharges would have higher

variability in the occupancy rate, leading to lower average revenue per bed.

       Hospitals with a hospital-based SNF have reasons to selectively steer certain patients to

remain in the hospital system. Given that Medicare pays the same daily rate for all for SNF post-

acute patients in a given resource utilization group (RUG), profitability across patients differs



                                                 4
entirely by their costs. Within a given RUG, hospitals then have an incentive to select the least

costly patients to be admitted to their own SNF and to send the more expensive patients to

freestanding facilities. Over the last few years, CMS has given hospitals an additional reason to

select particular patients for care in the hospital-based SNFthe hospital readmissions reduction

program and the hospital value-based purchasing programs penalize hospitals that have high

readmission rates and high 30-day episode spending. If a hospital believes that a patient is at risk

for readmission or high post-discharge expenses, the hospital can monitor that patient’s progress

better when admitted to their own SNF.

       Both of these patient selection issues cause endogeneity in a simple regression to predict

quality outcomes based on whether a patient enters a hospital-based or a freestanding SNF.

Patients selected to enter a hospital-based SNF due to expected low costs will have better health

status that is unobservable to the econometrician, causing omitted variable bias. Patients

selected to enter a hospital-based SNF due to concerns about mortality and risk of readmission

cause bias due to reverse causality.

       Turning to the patient’s choice of hospital, this complex function depends on things

including referral patterns, past experience, expectations of quality of care, patient health status,

and distance. Similarly, the choice of which SNF to go to (for patients discharged to a SNF)

depends on things including whether the hospital has a hospital-based SNF, referral patterns, past

experience, expectations of quality of care, patient health status, and distance. All else equal,

patients prefer to travel a shorter distance to receive medical care. Therefore, we expect that

some function of distance will strongly predict both the choice of hospital and the choice of

whether the patient is admitted to a hospital-based SNF, and that distance is unrelated to the

endogenous parts of the choices including the patient’s unobserved health status. In short, some


                                                  5
function of distance will be a strong and valid instrumental variable for whether the patient is

admitted to a hospital-based SNF upon discharge.

       This conceptual framework also provides an economic justification for why hospital-

based SNFs may provide better quality of care than freestanding SNFs, thus motivating our

central research question. Hospital-based SNFs may produce better discharge outcomes relative

to freestanding SNFs due to both economies of joint production and specialization. In this case,

joint production leads to better communication between hospital and nursing home staff in part

through a shared health IT system. Given that CMS pay-for-performance programs now

penalize hospitals with high mortality, high readmissions rates, and high episode payments,

hospitals with a hospital-based SNF can better align incentives in a vertically integrated system.

For example, if a patient at risk of readmission is kept in a hospital-based SNF, then the hospital

can develop a care plan appropriate for preventing avoidable readmissions.

       The second pathway through which hospital-based SNFs may affect outcomes is via

specialization (Norton 2000). In most freestanding SNFs, post-acute care SNF patients

constitute a relatively small proportion of total residents. The majority of nursing home residents

are long-stay, chronically ill individuals covered by Medicaid. Previous research has suggested

that some residents do better when nursing homes specialize in treating a narrow range of

patients (Grabowski et al. 2010; Grabowski, Gruber, and Angelelli 2008; Konetzka et al. 2006).

That is, when high- and low-margin payer groups receive care alongside one another, outcomes

for higher-margin patients typically decline, while outcomes for lower-margin patients typically

increase. We hypothesize that hospital-based SNFs will be more specialized in care for high-

margin patients because—unlike most freestanding SNFs—they do not have to cross-subsidize

lower-margin patients covered by Medicaid.



                                                 6
       Our conceptual framework argues that hospital-based SNFs are likely to have higher

quality of care than freestanding SNFs, that a simple regression will produce biased estimates of

the causal effect of type of SNF on discharge outcomes, and that a function of distance will be a

valid instrumental variable.



2.2 Previous Literature

       Few studies have specifically focused on the relationship between hospital-based status

and SNF quality of care, yet most SNF quality studies control for hospital-based status as a

covariate in the regression model (for reviews, see Grabowski and Norton 2012; Norton 2000). A

large literature has focused on the related issue of cost and case-mix differences across

freestanding and hospital-based SNFs. In a review of the early pre-PPS SNF evidence, Wiener

and colleagues (1986) concluded that hospital-based SNF patients were twice as costly per day

as freestanding SNF patients but case-mix differences explained less than half of the cost

differential. Using an endogenous switching model with data from the mid-1990s, Pizer and

colleagues (2002) concluded that the entire cost differential is attributable to setting effects and

case-mix selection plays a negligible role. In an analysis of 1999 data following the adoption of

the SNF PPS, hospital-based SNFs were found to have higher per diem costs for nursing and

non-therapy ancillary services, while freestanding SNFs had higher average costs for

rehabilitation services (Liu and Black 2003).

       In terms of research focusing on outcomes, Liu and Black (2003) examined unadjusted

discharge outcomes. Hospital-based SNFs had lower length-of-stay (13 days versus 27 days),

mortality (4% versus 7%), and hospital readmission (23% versus 28%). Whether these outcomes

are related to case-mix or differences in care is impossible to tease out from this study. Rahman



                                                  7
and colleagues (2013c) found local markets with greater closure of hospital-based SNFs between

1999 and 2006 experienced increased 30-day hospital readmissions. Stearns and colleagues

(2006) used propensity stratification to compare patient outcomes across hospital-based and

freestanding SNFs. The authors found that patients admitted to hospital-based SNFs had 16.7%

shorter stays, a 7.7% greater likelihood of home discharge within 30 days, and 2.3% fewer

preventable 30-day hospital readmissions. As the authors acknowledge about their study, “(o)ne

limitation of our analysis is that unobserved selection still may explain the remaining differences

in outcomes for patients of hospital-based SNFs. A natural approach to investigate this issue is to

use instrumental variables (IV) models” (page 620).

       We were only able to identify one previous study that examined patient outcomes in

hospital-based SNFs using an IV approach. Specifically, David and colleagues (2013) instrument

for a particular hospital owning a SNF by using the rate of SNF ownership by other hospitals in

the same market. Using this approach, the authors found lower 60-day hospital readmission rates

for patients discharged to a SNF owned by that hospital.


3. Data and Study Sample

3.1 Data sets

       For this study we need detailed data on individuals, including where they resided on each

day following discharge, when they died, and total Medicare reimbursement on all covered

services up to 180 days post discharge. We used several sources of data in this study to obtain

SNF and individual characteristics including the Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare claims,

the Medicare denominator file, SNF provider data, zip code level population characteristics

based on census 2000, and data from the American Hospital Association (AHA).




                                                 8
       The MDS assessment forms are completed for all residents in certified SNFs upon

admission and then at least quarterly thereafter. The MDS instrument has numerous data

elements and includes summary measures of cognitive and physical functioning, continence,

pain, mood state, diagnoses, health conditions, mortality risk, special treatments, and medication

use. Numerous reliability and validity studies reveal that most MDS items achieve an intra-class

correlation of 0.6 (Abt Associates Inc. 2002; Hawes et al. 1995; Mor 2004; Mor et al. 2011;

Morris et al. 1990; Phillips et al. 1997).

       The Medicare Standard Analytic File includes all claims related to inpatient, skilled

nursing facility care, home health, and hospice services for Medicare fee-for-service enrollees.

All Part A claims (inpatient, SNF) include dates of service and up to 25 diagnoses. The Medicare

enrollment file identifies individuals enrolled in Medicare within a given year and includes

demographic data, survival status, residential zip code, and program eligibility information for

Parts A, B and D, Medicare Advantage (managed care), and Medicaid.

       The Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) System is a compilation of data

elements collected by surveyors during inspection surveys conducted at nursing facilities.

Surveys are conducted at least once during every 15-month period to certify participation in the

Medicare and Medicaid programs. The database includes organizational characteristics such as

the number of beds, ownership, and chain membership and aggregate patient characteristics.

The AHA data are a census of United States hospitals based on the AHA Annual Survey of

Hospitals. The database includes different structural characteristics of hospitals. In this study, we

used AHA data from the 2007 survey.

3.2 Study cohort




                                                  9
       Applying the Residential History File methodology (Intrator et al. 2011), which

concatenates MDS assessment and Medicare claims into individual beneficiary trajectories, we

identified all Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries who were discharged directly from an

acute general hospital to a SNF for post-acute care in 2009. We excluded patients with any SNF

residence history in one year prior to admission because they would be frailer than post-acute

care patients from the community. We found 1.2 million individuals who were discharged from

hospital to SNFs during the study period who did not have a prior nursing home stay. We

dropped about 24 percent of the individuals who did not reside in the 48 contiguous states, were

not discharged from an acute general hospital, or were missing relevant hospital or SNF

identification. Our final sample consisted of 827,541 Medicare FFS beneficiaries discharged

from 3,173 acute care hospitals to 14,374 SNFs.

3.3 Outcome Variables

       To determine the post-acute outcomes, we followed each patient for 30 or 180 days after

their SNF admission by concatenating Medicare enrollment, Medicare claims claims and MDS

using the residential history algorithm (Intrator et al. 2011). On any given day, an individual can

be in one of the following five settings: death, hospital, SNF, home with home health care and

home without home health care. We constructed five outcome variables representing the number

of days in different settings such that summation of these variables for any individual is 180. The

mean number of days in different settings has been reported in Table 2. The mean number of

days in a nursing home is about 51 days. Of note, the number of days in a particular setting may

involve residence with different providers. Patients are sometimes transferred between hospital

based and free standing SNFs. About 16% of our patients who were initially discharged to a

hospital based SNF later stayed a free-standing SNF (with 11% direct transfer). Transfers from



                                                10
free-standing SNF to hospital based SNF is very rare. We also ran a related analysis examining

the likelihood of these five outcomes on a day-by-day basis.

       Of note, these five categories of outcomes show a patient’s location on a given day, but

they do not necessarily identify the intensity of services used by the patient on that day. As such,

we also examined specific types of care use over a one-month and six-month discharge period.

The 30-day outcomes align with the incentives in the CMS pay-for-performance programs, while

the 180-day outcomes give a longer-run perspective. More specifically, we examined aggregated

Medicare spending as well as Medicare spending on inpatient, SNF, and home health services

during these time windows. As shown in Table 2, Medicare spent about $8,000 on acute hospital

care, $14,000 on SNF care and $2,500 on home health care in the six months following SNF

admission for an average patient. These reimbursements do not necessarily correspond to the

number of days in a setting because some services are paid by the patient (out-of-pocket) or by

other insurers (including Medicaid). We also examined death (0/1) and any hospital readmission.

22% of the patients discharged to a SNF died within six months, while about half of all the

patients experienced a hospital readmission within six months following SNF admission.

3.4 Main explanatory variable

       Our main explanatory variable is an indicator of whether the treatment SNF is hospital

based or not. We identified the hospital affiliation of a SNF from OSCAR data which also

provides the identification number of the affiliated hospital. We did not use AHA data to identify

hospitals with SNF because AHA appears to under-count the number of hospitals with hospital-

based SNF and do not provide the identification of the affiliated SNF.

3.5 Control variables




                                                 11
       We included control variables from four different sources. We obtained age, gender, race,

and Medicaid eligibility from the Medicare enrollment file. We merged zip code characteristics

based on 2000 census using patient’s residential zip code from Medicare enrollment data. These

zip code level variables are poverty rate among elderly population, physical and mental disability

rate, share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage, population density and

racial composition of elderly population.

       From the index hospitalization claims prior to SNF admission, we included Elixhauser

(Elixhauser et al. 1998) and Deyo (Deyo, Cherkin, and Ciol 1992) co-morbidity indexes, hospital

length of stay, and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) days during the hospitalization. We

used home health claims to construct an indicator of home health utilization before the index

hospital stay. Other clinical characteristics were obtained from the MDS and include indicators

for common diagnoses (e.g., diabetes, serious mental illness etc.), the number of medications

taken in the last seven days, the Morris late loss ADL scale (Morris, Fries, and Morris 1999), the

cognitive performance scale (Morris et al. 1994), the resource utilization group (5.12) (Fries and

Cooney 1985; Fries et al. 1994) and the Changes in Health, End-stage disease, Signs and

Symptoms (CHESS) score (Hirdes, Frijters, and Teare 2003). The control variables are

summarized for the full sample (see Table 3).



4. Methods

4.1 Empirical specification

       This paper estimates the relationship between patient outcomes (number of days in five

mutually exclusive and exhaustive states, and Medicare payments) and SNF hospital-based status,

controlling for patient factors and hospital referral region fixed effects.

the treating SNF n is hospital based or not. '   is a vector of the individual’s demographic,

clinical and residential zip-code characteristics. )*++ are hospital referral region fixed effects.

We expect that the coefficients on "% to differ for each outcome.


4.2 Instrument

       The differential selection of individuals into hospital-based SNFs may reflect both

demand and supply side factors. On the demand side, this selection may relate to the value that

certain individuals place in receiving services from a hospital with their own SNF. In other

words, patients in worse health have the most to gain from vertically integrated SNF care. On the

supply side, hospitals that own their own SNF can siphon off those most desirable patients likely

to benefit from SNF care. Although Medicare SNF payment is case-mix adjusted, the system

uses a relatively narrow set of patient conditions in adjusting payments.

       If unobserved health is similarly correlated with SNF choice and quality, the assumption

underlying the linear regression model is violated. However, we can still generate a consistent

estimate of the effect of hospital-based status on quality if we can identify a variable DD that is

correlated with hospital-based status but not the error term ( ) in the quality equation. Given

DD, we can calculate an IV estimate of the effect of hospital-based status on quality.

       We assume that differential distance between the nearest hospital with and without a SNF

will strongly predict entry into a hospital-based SNF. That is, individuals that live closer to a

hospital with a SNF are more likely to be admitted to that hospital, and then conditional on being

admitted to that hospital, they are more likely receive care in a hospital-based SNF. Our data

suggest that 42% of patients discharged from a hospital with a SNF were admitted to a hospital-

                                                  13
based SNF versus 2% of patients discharged from a hospital without a SNF. A large health

services literature establishes the importance of distance in the choice of provider (e.g., Brooks et

al. 2006; Hirth et al. 2003; McClellan, McNeil, and Newhouse 1994; Rahman and Foster 2015;

Rahman et al. 2014; Tan et al. 2012). Indeed, in our study, the median distance traveled to a

hospital was 11.5 kilometers (or 7.1 miles). In the study that most closely mirrors the distance-

based instrument used in this study, Grabowski and colleagues (2013) found the relative

proximity to nonprofit and for-profit SNFs to be a strong predictor of the type of SNF chosen.

One important difference in this paper is that we use differential distance to the nearest hospital

with and without a SNF (rather than the differential distance to the nearest SNFs). The use of the

hospital distance is warranted in this study because we are leveraging hospitals increased

likelihood of discharging to a hospital-owned SNF.

       We also expect differential distance to be uncorrelated with unobserved factors that may

influence outcomes. We assert that individuals choose a place of residence without regard to the

proximity of hospitals with and without a SNF. This accords with common sense, and does not

preclude people from making housing choices on the basis of proximity to a hospital. The

relatively low rate of elderly migration supports this assumption (U.S. Census Bureau 2003). As

such, we hypothesize that the differential distance measure is predetermined for potential SNF

patients and unrelated to unobserved SNF outcomes. In the next section, we report a falsification

test to validate this assumption. We also report mean characteristics by value of the differential

distance (above or below median) in a balance table (see Table 3).

       To construct a differential distance (DD) measure for SNF patients, we calculated the

distance using the great circle formula from the centroid of the resident’s zip code prior to

hospital admission, as reported in Medicare enrollment data, to the exact geo-address of the



                                                 14
nearest hospital with and without a SNF based on the latitude and longitude of the respective

facilities. We used natural log of distance between zip code and the nearest hospital with and

without SNF. The differential measure was then calculated as the natural log of distance to the

nearest hospital with a SNF minus natural log of the distance to the nearest hospital without a

SNF. In other words, the measure’s interpretation is how much farther the patient would have to

travel to be admitted to the nearest hospital with a SNF. A negative value on this measure

indicates that the nearest hospital is one with a SNF. Therefore, we expect a negative coefficient

on differential distance in the first-stage results.

        Our instrument is strong and valid. First, the instrument is balanced with respect to the

covariates (see Table 3). Our analyses are based on comparisons of where patients lived relative

to the closest hospitals with and without a SNF. Thus, we split the sample by whether the

instrument was above or below the median to check for balance in the observable characteristics.

Although many of the paired comparisons were statistically significantly different at the 5

percent level due to the extraordinarily large sample size, the patient characteristics were

virtually identical across the two samples. The fact that none of these measured patients’

demographic and clinical characteristics are correlated with the instrument makes it hard to argue

that there are obvious sources of confounders that would make the instrument invalid.

        Second, the instrument is a strong predictor of the endogenous variable, hospital-based

SNF status, in the first stage (see Table 4). Column 1 reports the first stage where the IV is the

linear differential distance i.e., distance (in kilometers) of the nearest hospital with a SNF minus

the distance to the nearest hospital without a SNF. The first-stage estimates suggest that a one

kilometer increase in the differential distance between then nearest hospitals with and without a

SNF led to a 0.2 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of being admitted to a hospital-based



                                                   15
SNF. The second column reports the first stage where the IV is the difference in natural log

distance between the nearest hospital with and without a SNF (i.e., the natural log of the ratio of

distances). We used the log version of differential distance for our main analysis because of it is

less susceptible to the influence of extreme outliers in differential distance. The t-statistic based

on robust standard error is 20.06, meaning that the F-statistic is over 400. The partial R-squared

is 0.057. This is after controlling for hospital referral region fixed effects, so that the prediction is

based entirely on within-referral region correlations. Clearly, the instrument strongly predicts

the patient’s choice of a hospital-based SNF.

        As a final specification check, we conducted a falsification test of our instrument, which

we draw from the identification strategy of an unrelated recent study. Doyle (2011) used people

treated in Florida that did not reside there (“vacationers”) as a means of addressing selection of

individuals into high and low cost areas in studying the relationship between spending and health

care outcomes. We borrow from this idea by examining individuals who enter a hospital far

away from their primary residence. The concentration of hospitals with SNFs around their

primary residence should not affect entry into a hospital-based SNF for those individuals who

enter a SNF near a family member living elsewhere or get sick or need surgery while on vacation.

For this sub-sample of “vacationers,” the first stage should be close to zero. If it is negative and

large, then we could conclude that where individuals live relative to the nearest hospitals with

and without SNFs is correlated with unmeasured quality (which would violate the assumption

underlying a valid instrument).

        In conducting this falsification test, we excluded individuals entering hospital less than

100 km and alternately define this vacationer sub-sample as individuals entering a hospital over

100 km (N=48,287 or 5.8% of full sample), 200 km (N=27,449 or 3.3% of full sample) or 500



                                                   16
km (N=17,996 or 2.2% of full sample) away from their primary residence. The results suggest a

weak first-stage estimate of the DD instrument for the vacationer sub-samples (see columns 3-5

in Table 4). When we use a cutoff of 100 kilometers to define the vacationer sub-sample, the

first-stage estimate is roughly 23% as large as the result from the full sample. When we use a

cutoff of 200 kilometers, the effect is about 7% as large as the full sample. When we use a cutoff

of 500 kilometers, the first-stage estimate becomes statistically insignificant and it is 3.2% as

large as the result from the full sample. This gradual decline in the first stage relationship

suggests that we can say with some precision that this falsification check does not support the

idea that an individual’s place of residence relative to the nearest hospitals with and without

SNFs is strongly correlated with other (unmeasured) factors that predict quality of care.

        We used the typical fixed effect 2SLS estimation (using xtivreg2 command in Stata) to

estimate equation (1). All the test statistics are based on robust standard errors.



5. Results

4.1 Primary Findings

       The estimates of the effect of hospital-based SNF status on the days spent in different

discharge settings are presented in Table 5. Once again, we examine the first 180 days following

discharge of the individual from the hospital. In the table, we present both the standard model

that treats hospital-based status as exogenous (OLS model, row 2-3), and the IV model that treats

hospital-based status as endogenous (row 4). We show the OLS and IV results both with HRR

fixed effects. For the majority of outcomes, the results are quite different across the two models.

       In the OLS model treating hospital-based status as exogenous, we obtain results similar to

earlier estimates in the literature. That is, we find that hospital-based SNF patients spend 14



                                                  17
fewer days in a SNF over the 180 day post-discharge period and 8.8 more days in the community

without home health care and 4.1 days with home health care. We find very slight increases in

mortality (0.952 days) and any hospitalization (0.258 days). When we included HRR fixed

effects in the OLS model, the results generally became even larger, suggesting fewer days in

SNF and more days in the community. The fact that the within-HRR effects are so large is

consistent with the idea that hospitals are differentially selecting patients that are good

candidates for a quick discharge into their own SNFs.

       When we account for endogenous ownership in the IV models, we obtain results of a

much more plausible magnitude. Specifically, patients admitted to hospital-based SNFs spend

5.7 days less in a SNF relative to patients discharged to free-standing SNFs and 4.8 days more in

the community without home health services. When you put these results together, freestanding

SNF patients spend relatively more time in a health care institution and less time in community

in the 180 days following their original hospital discharge than hospital-based SNF patients.

       Figure 2 presents the daily distribution of individuals in the study cohort as they

transitioned through different locations of care following their first-time admission to hospital-

based and freestanding SNFs. Differences in the likelihood of residing in a given setting emerge

quickly. On any given day, free-standing SNF patients were more likely to stay in nursing homes

and less likely to be discharged back to the community without receiving home health care, as

compared to hospital-based SNF patients. We observed about six more home health care days for

hospital-based SNF patients (see row 1, Table 5). According to panel D of figure 2, all these

extra home health days were during the first two months following discharge.

       In order to examine the distribution of discharge outcomes on a day-to-day basis, we

estimated 180 daily linear probability models for each competing outcome using HRR fixed



                                                  18
effects and treating an admission to a hospital-based SNF as endogenous. Ideally, we should

have estimated multinomial outcome model for each day and calculated the marginal effects of

admission to hospital based SNF for each competing outcome. However, the presence of the

HRR fixed effect made the estimation procedure computationally very intensive. We plotted the

estimated effect of admission to hospital-based SNF on competing outcomes with respect to days

in Figure 3. We found differential impacts of hospital-based status over the 180-day window. For

hospital-based SNF patients, the likelihood of home health care use was higher initially while

SNF use was lower. Around day 20, the difference in home health care and SNF use reached its’

maximum. The fact that Medicare copayments begin at day 20 may be related to the differential

utilization across freestanding and hospital-based SNFs. Discharge home was higher for hospital-

based SNF patients during the first three months following discharge. Patients in hospital-based

SNFs were less likely to go back to hospital in the first week following discharge and then the

effect becomes statistically insignificant. This effect of fewer immediate bounce backs to the

hospital is consistent with other studies (Rahman et al. 2013a; Rahman et al. 2013c). There no

significant impact on mortality. All the effects were statistically insignificant after 100 days of

SNF admission, implying that there was no permanent effect of treatment in hospital based SNF

as we observed with the unadjusted gap in Figure 2. This figure also suggests our estimated

effects are not picking up any permanent unobserved patient characteristics that are associated

with hospital based SNF selection and outcomes.

       We also considered the impact of being treated in a hospital-based SNF on Medicare

spending in the first month and six months following hospital discharge (see Tables 6 and 7). In

the unadjusted comparison, 30-day Medicare spending following discharge was $3,432 lower for

individuals discharged from a hospital-based SNF. When we controlled for the covariates and



                                                 19
included HRR fixed effects, the difference fell to $2,456. When we ran an IV model, the

Medicare savings was $2,882. In these IV models, we observed a small and statistically

insignificant impact on mortality, suggesting the savings were not a result of censoring due to

mortality. The main source of savings was lower SNF spending, with some additional savings

from inpatient care and some additional spending on home health care. Comparing Table 6 with

Table 7, the only savings by month six was from lower SNF payments.



4.2 Specification Checks

       In order to examine the robustness of our primary model specification, we ran a series of

alternate models (see Table 9). We first experimented with an alternate form of the DD

instrument in which we used a linear distance instead of natural log transformed distance and a

binary instrument (above/below DD median) to take account of skewed values. Patients who live

in areas with no hospitals with SNFs will have large differential distance values using the linear

distance instrument. On the other hand, the binary version of the DD instrument will suppress the

role of large absolute values. The estimated effects using linear differential distance are much

larger. However our baseline results were similar to the results generated with a binary

instrument, suggesting our results are not being driven by outliers of the standard instrument.

       Another potential issue is that the effects we observed might be predominantly

concentrated in certain markets. As shown in table 1, hospital based SNFs are more prevalent in

rural areas i.e. 30% of all free-standing SNFs and 50% of all hospital based SNFs are located in

rural counties. When we estimated our models conditional on urban and rural markets, we found

that the results for rural markets were relatively similar to the overall results. We also

investigated whether the magnitude of our result varied based on the competitiveness of the local



                                                  20
market. Using the county to approximate the market, we split the sample based on the median

Herfindahl value. We found quite similar effects in both types of markets.

       Another potential check on selection is to focus our results on only those individuals

without a planned hospitalization. For example, a patient with a scheduled knee replacement

surgery will be able to weigh potential rehabilitation options across hospitals. However, for an

individual with an unplanned hospitalization, they will not be able to consider issues related to

whether the hospital has their own SNF. To investigate this issue, we examined hip fracture,

acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and stroke patients. The pattern of all three diagnosis results

was similar to the overall population, although both groups had even higher SNF utilization

among hospital-based SNF patients.

       One final concern is that hospital quality of care could be higher in hospitals with a

hospital-based SNF than in hospitals without one, and that higher quality of inpatient care could

spuriously cause our results. Although this is a valid concern, with Table 3 showing

insignificant differences in treating hospital characteristics between patients with lower and

higher values of the IV, our methods protect against this kind of bias. Our models control for

HRR fixed effects, sweeping away crude geographic differences. The local average treatment

effect of the IV analysis is that of the marginal patient whose choice of SNF is determined by

happenstance of home location, not those patients who chose to go to the hospital because of

perceived differences in quality of care. If inpatient quality of care was so important, we would

expect to see significant differences in mortality and readmission rates in the first few days post

discharge, yet we do not see such differences.




                                                 21
       In summary, the specification checks generally suggest our primary findings are robust,

although we did observe some heterogeneity across different markets (urban/rural, more/less

competitive markets).



6. Conclusion

       The research question of whether hospital-based SNFs produce better outcomes at lower

Medicare payments is important given recent Medicare policies that hold health care systems and

payers accountable for post-hospital discharge outcomes and spending. Our conceptual

framework provides economic reasons for why hospital-based SNFs may be different (and

better) than freestanding SNFs. On the other hand, it also suggests that simple correlations will

yield biased results due to selection. Our instrumental variable is strong and valid. The

instrumental variables results then give consistent estimates of the causal effect of going to a

hospital-based SNF (compared to a freestanding SNF). The 30-day results are most policy

relevant while the 180-day results provide a better understanding of the long-run effects.

       Our paper is suggestive of the idea that hospital-based SNFs generate some savings for

Medicare over the 6-month hospital discharge period. These savings are largely achieved via

lower SNF spending. As health care systems and payers increasingly take on risk for Medicare

hospital discharge episodes, these results provide some support for vertical integration of

hospitals and SNFs. Hospitals are faced with a “make-or-buy” decision in terms of partnering

with SNFs in that they can own their own SNF or they can establish relationships with

freestanding SNFs. ACOs and hospital networks are currently developing strategies to develop

networks of SNF partners (Lage et al. 2015; Maly et al. 2012). Previous research suggests that

when hospitals concentrate their discharges in a particular SNF, they will have lower



                                                 22
readmission rates from this SNF (Rahman et al. 2013b; Schoenfeld et al. 2016). From a policy

perspective, the key issue will be whether the potential additional savings we have observed in

this study are enough to justify the increased costs of owning a SNF under global and

accountable payment systems.

       We have found that discharge to a hospital-based SNF leads to more rapid community

discharge with a lower likelihood of hospital readmission. From a consumer perspective,

potential value exists in seeking care at hospitals that own their own SNFs. This issue could be

reported on Hospital Compare as a potential signal of quality for elective procedures that could

require post-acute care (e.g., lower extremity joint replacement).

       A potential limitation of this study is that it is based on SNF admissions in 2009. Though

the data are about six years old, the effect of more integrated acute and post-acute care on

patient’s discharge outcomes is not likely to change over time. Additionally, we must be careful

in over-interpreting these results. The marginal patient in our model is someone who received

treatment in a hospital-based SNF due to their prior residence being differentially closer to a

hospital with a SNF. The experience of these individuals may not generalize to the universe of

SNF patients. However, at least for these patients at the margin, we do observe some potential

savings associated with hospital-based SNFs via lower SNF utilization.

       In sum, we found that hospital-based SNF patients spent more days in the community and

fewer days in the SNF in the 180 days following their original hospital discharge with no

significant effect on mortality or hospital readmission. Medicare spent almost $2,900 less on a

hospital-based SNF patient in the 30 days following their original hospital discharge. As health

care systems and payers increasingly take on risk for Medicare hospital discharge episodes, these

findings provide some support for vertical integration of hospitals and SNFs.
