What Lies Beneath: Pipeline Awareness and Aversion

                                          ABSTRACT

Stated safety concerns are a major impediment to making necessary expansions to the natural gas
pipeline network. While revealed willingness to pay to avoid existing natural gas pipelines
appears small, it is difficult to know if this reflects true ambivalence or a lack of salience and
awareness. In this paper, we test this latter hypothesis by studying how house prices responded to
a deadly 2010 pipeline explosion in San Bruno, CA, which shocked both attention and
information. Using multiple identification strategies, we fail to find any evidence of a meaningful
shift in the hedonic price gradient around pipelines following these events. We conclude with a
discussion of how this result relates to latent, fully informed preferences, as well as the
implications for future pipeline expansions.

1        Introduction
Due to advances in drilling technology, the economically recoverable supply of natural gas in the
United States nearly doubled between between 2005 and 2014.1 In order to capture the full ben-
efits of this unexpected resource boom, significant increases in and improvements to the existing
pipeline network are required. Despite this, according to the regulatory body which oversees these
changes, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), new pipelines “are facing unprece-
dented opposition from local and national groups”.2 A major source of this opposition, particularly
in densely populated areas, is concern about pipeline safety (Parfomak, 2013, 2016).
        At first glance, it is easy to dismiss these concerns. Natural gas pipelines are extremely safe:
over the past two decades, transmission incidents have resulted in an average of only 2.3 deaths per
year. However, the psychology and behavioral economics literatures are rife with reasons why the
disamenity associated with this particular risk might exceed that captured by a more typical VSL
estimate. Consumers exhibit projection and availability bias, even when making large investments
in housing and automobiles.3 More generally, people overestimate the likelihood of risks that are
uncontrollable, catastrophic, and inequitably distributed (Slovic, 1987), and exhibit probability
neglect regarding fearsome risks (Sunstein and Zeckhauser, 2011).
        A second reason to be skeptical of safety concerns is that this vocal opposition to new pipelines
stands in stark contrast with apparent opinion towards existing pipelines. The U.S. has over 300,000
miles of high pressure natural gas transmission pipelines linking domestic supply and demand
centers. Despite a handful of high profile events, this network is seemingly uncontroversial.4 Recent
studies using cross-sectional regression or appraiser opinion have failed to find any effect of pipeline
proximity on home values (INGAA, 2016; Fruits, 2008). Citing these studies and, sometimes, its
own commissioned appraisals, FERC routinely dismisses concerns that pipelines may reduce nearby
property values when approving new pipeline routes.5
        What explains this disconnect between loud stated fears about new pipelines and revealed
ambivalence towards existing pipelines? One possible explanation is that new pipelines are much
more salient than existing pipelines. FERC requires a lengthy public comment period before a
new pipeline is approved, during which local news coverage and protests often draw attention to
the most concerning parts of a project. Conversely, existing pipelines are hidden underground

      For instance, Busse et al. (2012) show that swimming pools and central air have higher hedonic prices for homes
sold during the summer than during the winter.

      Over the 20-year period of 1995–2014, local distribution system accidents accounted for 279 fatalities and more
than 1,000 injuries, while transmission systems accounted for 42 fatalities and 174 injuries, or about one-seventh of
the total. Over the 4-year period of 2011–2014, there has only been one single transmission-related fatality. (United
States Department of Energy, 2015, pp NG-54)
    5
      For example, see the recent FERC Environmental Impact Statements for the Constitution Pipeline and Algonquin
Incremental Market. In the former, FERC describes contacting several appraisers in the area to ask whether they
think the pipeline will reduce property values. In each case the response was that there is no evidence to suggest
that (FERC EIS 0249F (2014) , pp 4-153).



                                                         2
and not well marked. Even if home-buyers are concerned about pipeline safety, finding a detailed
map of pipeline locations was made intentionally burdensome after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
As a consequence, when one study asked homeowners known to live near pipelines how close they
thought they were, 55% flatly denied living near one (Hansen et al., 2006). If people are not mindful
of or even able to locate existing pipelines, it will be very difficult to infer their true aversion to
this disamenity from house price data.
   In this paper, we look for evidence of this wedge between true preferences and observed prices
in the fallout from one of the deadliest pipeline incidents in U.S. history. On September 9th, 2010,
a 30-inch transmission pipeline owned by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) exploded in a densely
populated suburb of San Francisco, killing eight people. The event generated prolonged media
coverage, particularly in the state of California, bringing the issue of pipelines to the forefront
of people’s minds. In the weeks that followed, outrage swelled over the lack of pipeline location
information. It was revealed that, incredibly, even the local fire chief was unaware of the high
pressure pipeline’s presence before it exploded. The following spring, in response to this outrage,
PG&E sent letters out to all households living within 2000 feet of a pipeline alerting them to their
proximity.
   To test whether this shock to pipeline awareness and location information affected people’s
revealed preferences for living near pipelines, we look for changes in the hedonic price gradient
following these events. We combine data on the universe of housing transactions in California with
a proprietary map containing a snapshot of all natural gas transmission pipelines in the state. Our
main approach is a difference-in-difference strategy that compares housing transactions within 1000
or 1000-2000 feet from a pipeline to those between 2000 and 4000 feet away. Leveraging the size our
sample to finely control for differential trends in narrow geographic housing markets, we compare
the price gradient after the explosion and informational letter to the pre-explosion equilibrium.
   Using a variety of different temporal and spatial controls, we find little evidence that either
the explosion or the letter was capitalized into house prices. This null result is robust to zooming
in to just the counties surrounding San Bruno, and to triple-difference comparisons against other
properties near pipelines in southern California. Using a regression discontinuity design, we also
fail to find evidence of a spatial break in the hedonic price gradient at the 2000-foot cutoff for
receiving the informational letter.
   Given the nature of the variation generated by San Bruno and the reduced-form estimation
strategy used, we are not able to recover (or even bound) fully informed, attentive willingness to
pay (WTP) to avoid living near a natural gas pipeline. However, borrowing notation from the
energy efficiency gap literature (Allcott and Greenstone (2012), we show that the coefficient on
our DD estimator is equal to the product of the change in pipeline awareness and the true, fully
informed, price relationship. After providing evidence that households were uninformed before
the explosion, and that the aftermath events meaningfully increased attention and awareness, we
conclude that the second term in that product must be small to generate our estimates. In the
conclusion, we consider the policy implications of this interpretation.


                                                  3
        Our findings contribute to two literatures. First, there are a limited set of papers that examine
the housing market impacts of pipeline infrastructure. The study that most closely resembles our
own is Hansen et al. (2006). This paper examines housing prices in the aftermath of a gasoline
pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA in 1999, which killed three people. The paper finds that
houses closer to the pipeline sold at a discount after the explosion, but not before. However,
there is no formal test of the difference between these coefficients. In addition, areas near the
pipeline may have been adversely affected due to the loss of nearby parkland to the ensuing fire.
In our context, we consider the impact on houses in the “shadow” of pipelines much further away
that could not have been affected by the direct dis-amenity of the San Bruno explosion. Fruits
(2008) directly estimates the impact of a new natural gas pipeline in Oregon, and finds no negative
effect on property values in a difference-in-differences framework. Beyond this paper, however,
most other attempts to capture pipeline capitalization are consulting studies that do not credibly
account for unobserved housing characteristics and other omitted variables. More broadly, our
paper contributes to a growing literature on the the relationship between house prices and energy
infrastructure, such as natural gas wells (Muehlenbachs et al., 2015) and power plants (Davis, 2010).
        There is also an empirical literature exploring the impact of imperfect information on hedonic
models. Pope (2008) was one of the first papers to explicitly discuss how asymmetries in buyer
and seller information can affect the hedonic price gradient and complicate analysis. A number of
other papers have expanded upon this empirically, testing how information disclosure may affect
the capitalization of an amenity. Some more recent examples include Mastromonaco (2015) and
Guignet (2013).
        The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the natural
gas pipeline system and the events in California related to and following the San Bruno pipeline
explosion. Section 3 describes the data, Section 4 discusses our various empirical strategies, and
Section 5 presents the results. Sections 6 and 7 discuss policy and other implications and conclude.


2        Background
2.1       Natural Gas Pipelines
For all intents and purposes, pipelines are the only real option for transporting natural gas from
the wellhead to the end-user.6 This stands in contrast to crude oil, where pipelines compete
with barge and railway shipping. There are three main types of natural gas pipelines: gathering,
transmission, and distribution. Gathering pipelines are found in the producing region, and collect
gas from the wellhead and ship it a processing plant. Transmission lines then send large quantities
of processed natural gas to demand centers. Because of the distance and volume involved, these
pipelines are larger in diameter (20-42 inches) and operate at much higher pressure than gathering
or distribution lines. Once the gas has reached its destination, the gas is depressurized. Some of the
    6
    While an increasing amount of natural gas being shipped as liquefied natural gas (LNG) on enormous tankers, the
costs of liquefaction are prohibitively high except on very large scales in the presence of substantial price differentials.



                                                             4
gas will be delivered directly to industrial customers or electricity generation facilities. Residential,
commercial, and some industrial users are serviced by distribution pipelines. These pipes are much
smaller in diameter and operate at low pressure.
      This paper focuses on transmission pipelines, which carry large quantities of gas at very high
pressure. There over 300,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines in the United States, but recent
upstream and downstream shocks have prompted a wave of expansion requests. Since the advent
of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, U.S. natural gas production has skyrocketed and
shifted in geographic terms. On the demand side, retiring coal-fired and nuclear power plants are
increasingly being replaced by natural gas generators, further stressing the existing grid. In light
of these changes, thousands of miles of new and expanded natural gas transmission pipelines have
been proposed. The Department of Energy projects that $42 billion will be spent on expanding
natural gas pipeline infrastructure during 2015-2030 (United States Department of Energy, 2015).
      Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). They are granted power of eminent domain, but must meet the requirements for a Certifi-
cate of Public Need. The approval process typically involves an environmental impact statement or
assessment, a public comment period, and public meetings. This process, along with easement ne-
gotiations, will inform local residents about the construction plans, future existence of the pipeline,
and may prompt further information acquisition.
      The information available and attention given to pipelines during the siting process declines
considerably once they are in operation. As a recent review on the subject concluded, “Americans
often pay little attention at all to the nation’s energy infrastructure until they face a nearby pipeline
leak, rail accident, or other natural or man-made disaster” (Klass and Meinhardt, 2014). Part of this
is because pipelines are not well marked unless necessary. Further, obtaining information on pipeline
location was made more difficult by the advent of the Critical Energy Infrastructure Information
(CEII) designation following 9/11. Although FERC revised its rules in 2006 to exclude purely
locational information from the CEII designation, the only publicly available source of information
on transmission pipeline location remains the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). This
website does not allow one to download spatial data, view more than one county at a time, or
resolve the location of pipelines beyond a 500 foot tolerance. The only individuals allowed to
access the database directly are government employees (who may access pipeline data under their
jurisdiction) or pipeline operating companies (who may access data about their own pipelines).

2.2     The San Bruno Explosion and Aftermath
On September 9, 2010, a segment of 30-inch diameter PG&E transmission pipeline 132 exploded in
the middle of the Crestmoor neighborhood in San Bruno, CA. Eight people were killed, 38 homes
were destroyed and an additional 70 homes had major or minor damage as a result of the explosion
and fire.7 The explosion occurred when an electrical glitch led to an increase in pressure, which
blew open an existing welding flaw. In the aftermath of this disaster, PG&E was fined $1.6 billion
  7
      Appendix Figure A.1 provides a sense of the scale of the damage.


                                                         5
by the California Public Utilities Commission, paid out over $565 million in civil settlements, and
was eventually found guilty of six criminal counts in federal court.8
    Media coverage of the disaster was widespread, and often focused on the existence of local
pipelines running along major roads or through neighborhoods.9 Shortly after the incident, PG&E
was pressured to release a list outlining the 100 pipeline segments of highest priority for maintenance
and monitoring. Although this list was generated using a number of criteria, the press coverage
dubbed these segments the 100 “riskiest” pipeline segments, generating further publicity for the
location of natural gas transmission pipelines throughout Northern California. In November 2010,
one community in Northern Sacramento even closed an elementary school mid-year after discovering
that it was near PG&E pipelines and natural gas storage tanks.10
    The spike in attention suggested by these anecdotes about media coverage are backed up by
Google search activity. We collected Google Trends data on searches for stories that Google has
determined are related to the San Bruno pipeline explosion. Figure 1 displays search activity for
this set of stories over time, relative to the overall level of search activity in the geographic area.11
In the first graph, we compare search rates in various media markets. All three major California
markets saw substantial search activity, though LA was less affected. New York City also shows
some activity, suggesting that, while this was a major national news story, it got disproportionate
attention in California.

geographies within a given graph.

                                   Series” as determined by Google algorithm.


   We cannot observe absolute search activity, but we can compare the San Bruno event to another
group of stories thought to be important to Bay Area residents. In the second graph, we compare
the San Bruno explosion search rate to that for stories related to the Major League Baseball World
Series, which was won by the San Francisco Giants in October 2010. Searches related to San Bruno
were roughly 20% of the peak search activity related to the Giants’ Series win, suggesting that
pipeline-related coverage and information acquisition were substantial.
   By Spring 2011, regulatory pressure led PG&E to send letters to customers living within 2000
feet of a natural gas transmission pipeline. These letters (presented in Appendix Figure A.2)
noted the tragic nature of the San Bruno explosion, informed the resident that they lived within
2000 feet of a pipeline, provided a link to their online pipeline location map and the National
Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS), and outlined some of the new safety measures that PG&E
was implementing. The letter did not give residents any detailed information about their specific
distance to the pipeline, or the location of that nearest pipeline. According to the local real estate


                                                       7
community, this letter could be considered “knowledge of material fact”, which technically requires
the homeowner to disclose this information to any potential buyer.12 An important detail is that
if a transmission pipeline is near – but not actually encroaching – the property, there is otherwise
no requirement to disclose this information to a potential buyer.13 We discuss the implications of
this disclosure ambiguity in Section 6


3         Data
To study the impact of the San Bruno events, we combine data on housing transactions with a map
of pipeline locations. We purchased detailed GIS shapefiles of pipeline infrastructure from S&P
Global Platts, a private firm that specializes in data related to energy and other heavy industry.
These maps provide us with a snapshot of all natural gas pipelines in the state of California, as
of October 2015. We observe the owner of the pipeline segment, and (in some cases) the parent
pipeline’s name and the segment’s diameter. As our policy questions and treatments relate to
transmission pipelines, we take measures to pare the pipeline map down to segments that are
most likely used for transmission purposes.14 Although we cannot independently verify this, Platts
claims that these maps are highly accurate, coding all but two segments in the shapefile as being
within 40 feet (78% of all pipeline segments in the sample) or within 165 feet.
         We combine this pipeline map with information on all housing transactions in the state of Cal-
ifornia from January 1996 - June 2012. The data come from DataQuick (now a part of CoreLogic),
a firm that aggregates and produces housing data from markets across the United States. In addi-
tion to information on the parties and transaction price, the data contain information on the the
exact street address and accompanying geolocation, and housing characteristics such as year built,
square footage, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, the presence of a pool, and the presence
of a garage. The housing characteristics are observed once – they are the most recent assessment
at the time the data were collected for our purposes. Similar data have been used in many hedonic
applications in the last several years (e.g., Muehlenbachs et al., 2015).

3.1        Sample construction
Like the rest of the United States, California’s housing market experienced a sharp correction in
late 2008. Figure 2 plots the average log housing price by month for houses near and far away from
    12
      This     issue    was    raised    in    a     press    release     by    a    real    estate   disclosure     firm
(http://www.firstamsms.com/content/natural-gas-pipelines-now-disclosed-1), and confirmed by Kate Konschnik of
the Harvard Environmental Law Clinic (Kate Konschnik, 2016).
   13
      As of July 1, 2013, all contracts for the sale of residential real property in California must contain a specified
notice pertaining to gas and hazardous liquid transmission pipelines (California AB 1511, year 2012). However, this
notice simply informs the buyer that pipelines exist (not necessarily near the property), and that they should go to
the NPMS to find out if there is one nearby. It does not discriminate on the basis of actual pipeline proximity in any
way. Unfortunately, our housing data ends prior to this law going into effect.
   14
      Specifically, we drop any pipe from a system with a name that indicates distribution activity or if the diameter
is known to be less than 6 inches. We also drop a pipe if the diameter is missing, unless it has information about the
system it belongs to or is an interstate pipeline. Our results are very similar using the full network of pipelines.

pipelines. Our identifying events occur in the immediate aftermath of that crash. Thus, although
we obtained house price data going back to 1996, in our empirical analysis we restrict our sample
to begin on June 16, 2009, after the housing market began to recover and 450 days prior to the
San Bruno explosion. In Section 4, we discuss strategies to address related potential threats to
identification.

                                  Figure 2: California house price trends




       We then take a number of steps to ensure that our dataset contains only valid, arms-length
transactions that reflect the valuation of potential homeowners. We drop any transactions that are
flagged as non-arms length transfers, are non-residential properties, mobile homes, and those whose
addresses could not be mapped to a valid latitude and longitude. In each year, we drop transactions
with prices in the top and bottom one percent. Finally, we drop properties that sell more than 5
times in our 16 year dataset, properties with more than 5 bedrooms or bathrooms, transactions in
which the buyer appeared to be a corporate entity, and transactions that took place less than one
year since the previous sale. Our main DD specification restricts the sample to counties that are
unambiguously serviced by PG&E, excluding any homes within 1 kilometer of the site of the San
Bruno explosion.15 Table 1 reports the number of transactions by time period and distance group
after making these sample restrictions.
  15
    These counties are Alameda, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Contra Costa, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Marin,
Mariposa, Mendocino, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Sacramento, San Benito, San Francisco, San Joaquin, San Mateo,
Santa Clara (excluding Palo Alto, which is serviced by a municipal utility), Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus,
Sutter, Tehama, Tuolumne, Yolo, and Yuba.

 runs from September 9, 2010 to April 20, 2011 when the PG&E letters were sent. The “Post-Letter” period runs from that
                                      date until the end of the sample, June 30, 2012.



3.2    Descriptive statistics
A fundamental concern with using house price differentials to infer latent preferences for avoiding
pipelines is that pipelines are not located randomly. Figure 3 plots histograms of covariates for
houses 0-2000 and 2000-4000 feet from the nearest pipeline. The overall distribution of these
variables is generally quite similar across the two bins, with substantial overlap. Table 2 formalizes
this by regressing each covariate on distance bin dummies and census tract fixed effects. Houses
within 1000-2000 feet of a pipeline are generally more similar than houses within 1000 ft to the
2000-4000 ft. control bin. Relative to the sample means, these differences are modest, but they
should be pointed out. Houses near pipelines tend to be slightly smaller, less likely to have a pool
or garage, and were more likely to be sold under some measure of foreclosure distress. Although
our difference-in-difference approach should alleviate most concerns, we also allow for rich local
trends as well as recent local foreclosure activity.

    Coefficients come from a regression of the housing characteristic on pipeline distance bins and census tract fixed effects.



4      Empirical strategy
We begin with a hedonic equation relating house prices to pipeline proximity,

                                         ln Pit = αo + γit α1 Closei + Xit δ + it                                            (1)

where Pit is the sale price of house i with characteristics X at time t, and Closei is an indicator for
whether the household is close to a natural gas pipeline. To capture the fact that home buyers may
not be aware of or attentive to pipeline proximity, we introduce a discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1]. When
people are imperfectly informed or inattentive (γ < 1), this discounting attenuates the observed
empirical relationship between pipelines and equilibrium home prices towards zero, limiting our


                                                               11
ability to recover the true, informed, relationship, α1 , which is the policy parameter of interest.
       In this paper, we seek to estimate the extent of this attenuation in California prior to San
Bruno. To do this, we employ a difference-in-differences (DD) approach, comparing properties near
a pipeline to those farther from a pipeline, before and after the explosion and subsequent letter
campaign.

  ln Pit = αtr + µt + βP re Closei + βExpl Closei × Explt + βLetter Closei × Letterit + Xit δ + it (2)

Where Explt indicates that the sale happened between 9/9/2010 and 4/20/2011 (the “post-explosion”
period), Lettert indicates that the sale happened after 4/20/2011 (the “post-letter” period). 30-day
time period dummy variables µt are constructed such that they perfectly partition the pre- and
post- San Bruno periods. αtr is a locational fixed effect for the property’s census tract, which is a
relatively homogeneous geographic unit containing an average of 4000 residents.
       An alternative to tract level fixed effects would be to include property fixed effects. While this
would account for any time-invariant house heterogeneity within census tracts, the downside of
this approach is that it requires us to restrict the sample to properties that sell multiple times in
the data. As was discussed in Section 3.1, the period of interest comes on the heels of a massive
housing market correction, which limits the explanatory power of time invariant unobservables and
hedonic price gradients. The implications of eschewing property fixed effects are further discussed
in Appendix B.
       It is important to note that this empirical specification does not allow us to recover the true
WTP to avoid living near a pipeline (α1 ) without additional assumptions.16 During our sample, the
pipeline network is constant, and we are just looking at changes in price around existing pipelines.
To provide a mapping between Equations 1 and 2, let γP re , γExpl , and γLetter be the discount factor
households use prior to San Bruno, after the explosion, and after receiving a letter. Then

                                                 βP re = γP re α1

                                        βExplosion = (γExpl − γP re )α1                                         (3)

                                          βLetter = (γLetter − γP re )α1                                        (4)

This means that even if we assume γLetter = 1, we cannot recover the full effect, α1 = βpre +βLetter ,
without assuming away any time invariant unobservables that are correlated with pipeline proximity
and house prices. As we showed in Section 3, this is unlikely to be the case. Thus, instead of
recovering α1 , our goal is to consistently estimate the change in pipeline aversion following the
explosion and letter campaign. We further discuss the interpretation of βExplosion and βLetter in
Section 6.
       Consistent estimation of βExplosion and βLetter requires the assumption of parallel trends: absent
  16
    As we discuss in Section 4.1, we would require additional assumptions to claim that the capitalization effect α1
equals WTP.



                                                        12
the San Bruno events, the difference in unobserved price drivers between properties near and far
from pipelines would have remained constant. To lend credibility to this assumption we restrict the
sample to properties within 4000 feet of a natural gas pipeline. We define Closei to be indicators
if the property is within 1000 feet of the nearest pipeline or between 1000 and 2000 feet from the
nearest pipeline. The control group is houses between 2000 and 4000 feet from the nearest pipeline.
   We also take several steps to account for the fact that these identifying events occur in the
aftermath of an unprecedented housing crash. It is known that there were systematic local trends
in the housing market during this time driven by factors like foreclosure activity (Campbell et al.,
2011). First, we include very fine space-time fixed effects: tract-specific period dummies and tract-
specific quarter dummies, where periods line up with our DD periods. This approach allows census
tracts to flexibly differ in their recoveries from the crash. Second, we flexibly control for foreclosure
activity. If there is any indication that a sale involved a property in distress, we control for the
nature of this distress. In another robustness check, we control for the number of foreclosure sales
that occurred within one-quarter mile of the sale in the previous six months. This operates as a
highly localized measure of the severity of the housing crisis and recovery, while also accounting
for the potential spillover effects of neighboring foreclosures (Campbell et al., 2011; Anenberg and
Kung, 2014).

4.1   Regression discontinuity
Recent work by (Banzhaf, 2015; Kuminoff and Pope, 2014) discusses concerns with using difference-
in-difference strategies to identify hedonic models. In particular, Banzhaf shows that the DD
estimator is a lower bound on the true equivalent surplus associated with an amenity change. We
cannot directly address this concern for our entire analysis. However, the letter sent by PG&E
lends itself to a regression discontinuity design (RDD), which exploits only cross-sectional variation
rather than relying on parallel trends and a time-invariant hedonic equilibrium. Specifically, we
are able to compare houses on either side of the 2000 foot mailing cutoff and test whether housing
prices change at that threshold. We follow the suggestion of Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and take
a local linear approach within a relatively narrow bandwidth. The sample is further restricted to
only house sales after the letters were distributed and only properties between 1000 and 3000 feet
from a pipeline. We then control for separate linear functions on either side of the cutoff, and
estimate whether there is a jump at 2000 feet. Formally, we estimate:

                                       RD
        ln Pit =α0 + β0 (di − 2000) + βLetter ∗ (−1)(di > 2000) + β1 (di − 2000) ∗ (di > 2000)       (5)

where di is the distance from the property to the nearest natural gas transmission pipeline. Assum-
                                                                                     RD
ing that no other unobservables change discontinuously at this cutoff, the estimate βLetter reflects
the causal effect of letter receipt. We multiply the discontinuity at 2000 feet by (-1) so that the
sign on this coefficient matches that of our DD estimator. The main weakness is that the estimated
effect is a local average treatment effect at 2000 feet, which is outside the blast zone of any exist-


                                                   13
ing pipeline. Still, this provides a test of whether information conveyed by the letter, along with
follow-up information acquisition, affected housing prices.


5         Results
5.1         Difference-in-differences
We begin by presenting the estimates from Equation 2 in Table 3. The sample is restricted to
households living within 4,000 feet of a natural gas pipeline and living in a county served by
PG&E. All specifications include month of sample dummies and controls for housing and transaction
characteristics.17 Moving from left to right in Table 3, the specifications in Columns 1 through 4
include increasingly fine controls for spatial and temporal unobservables. Column 1 contains time-
invariant tract fixed effects. In Column 2, tracts are partitioned into properties 0-1000, 1000-2000,
and 2000-4000 feet from the nearest pipeline, and a time-invariant control is included for each tract-
distance group. In Column 3, the tract fixed effects are interacted with DD time period indicators.
Column 4 interacts the tract fixed effects with quarter-of-sample dummies, where quarters are
defined as three consecutive 30-day sample windows.

The dependent variable in each regression is log house price. All models contain month of sample dummies and housing

         The results are quite stable across specifications. The main effect on the distance bins reveal that
properties within 1000 and 2000 feet of a pipeline are worth about 3% and 1.5% less, respectively,
    17
    These characteristics are the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, log of square footage, presence of a pool,
presence of a garage, type of property (e.g., single-family vs. condo), 10-year bins of property age at time of sale,
and dummies for categories of distress.

than properties within the same tract 2000 to 4000 feet away. However, as discussed above, these
estimates are also picking up any unobserved neighborhood and housing characteristics correlated
with pipeline presence.18 Turning to the coefficients of interest βExpl and βLetter , there is no evidence
across any of the models that this difference in home value changed after either the explosion or
the subsequent informational letter. Taking Column 3 as an example, the average price effect of
the explosion on houses within 1000 feet of a pipeline is -0.07%, with a 95% confidence interval of
[-1.05%, 0.91%].
       The remaining three columns in the table present robustness results. Columns 5 and 6 are
analogous to Columns 3 and 4, except that we restrict the sample to the “core Bay Area” counties
of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. In Column 7, we
turn back to the full PG&E sample with tract-period fixed effects, but also control for the number
of foreclosures within one-quarter mile in the six months preceding the sale and the distance to
nearest highway interacted with our DD periods. The results for the Bay Area only sample are
small and not statistically different from zero as well. However, the point estimates, while not
statistically distinguishable, are slightly larger than our estimates for the full PG&E territory. This
may represent statistical noise, or some hint of a response in the area closest to the explosion. In
Column 7, the additional covariates meant to capture highly localized market trends do not have
an appreciable effect on our estimates.

5.2      Triple difference
One possible concern with the difference-in-differences strategy is divergent trends. There could
be price trends in other neighborhood characteristics that are correlated with pipeline locations,
perhaps due to the housing crisis, that would confound our estimates. While we cannot directly
test for this, we run a triple-difference estimator where we use Southern California as a control
group. Equation 2 becomes:

       ln Pit = αtr + µt + Xit δ + βP re Closei + βExpl Closei × Explt + βLetter Closei × Letterit
                   +P GEi × [βPP re

    It is interesting to note that these result differ from other cross-sectional studies referenced by FERC (INGAA,
2016; Fruits, 2008). Those studies typically find no correlation between house prices an pipelines either in in cross-
sectional regression or in a “comparables” study carried out by appraisers.

the triple-difference results using PG&E territory as the area of interest, with Southern California
Gas and San Diego Gas and Electric service territories as a control group. Again, we find no impact
on prices, and can rule out even modest price decreases. Columns 3 and 4 restrict the Northern
California sample to the Bay Area, and use only Los Angeles and Orange Counties as the control
group. We find that the treatment effect in the Bay Area is very close to zero when measured
relative to trends in the Los Angeles area.

5.3       Quarterly treatment effects
The previous regressions failed to find any evidence of a permanent shift in the hedonic price
gradient after the explosion or the letter. However, it is possible that these shocks to awareness
were more fleeting. In order to test for shorter impacts, we also perform an event study-style
regression. That is, we allow the difference-in-difference treatment effects to vary by quarter.19
A priori, we do not know how long it should take for the effects of the explosion or letter to
arise in equilibrium prices. For example, the letter campaign was announced in a press release
and subsequent news coverage on April 20, 2011. However, we do not know the exact rollout
dates of these letters, and attempts to obtain them from PG&E or the California Public Utilities
  19
       The results are similar if we estimate monthly treatment effects rather than quarterly effects.

       Table 5 confirms this visual interpretation using the linear regression from Equation 5. Column
1 presents the results where the only controls included are month dummies. The point estimate
implies that houses just within the letter radius are 0.2% more valuable than houses just outside the
radius that were not sent a letter. Column 2 and 3 add in tract dummies and housing characteristic
controls. Column 4 narrows the bandwidth further to include just households within 1,500 and

6    Discussion
What do these results tell us about willingness to pay to avoid natural gas pipeline risk? As was
discussed in Section 4, the answer depends on the magnitude of (γExpl − γP re ) and (γLetter − γP re ).
The background evidence presented above suggests γP re was well below 1 prior to the explosion.
Coverage lamenting lack of information was ubiquitous, and even first responders were uninformed
about pipeline locations. Moreover, the PG&E letter was initiated precisely because awareness was
so low.
    While it seems safe to assume γP re was close to zero, taking a stand on the change in γ after
the explosion and letter is more difficult. This was the top national news story for a week, and
coverage persisted much longer in California. As the Google search data shows, many of those
living Northern California also turned to the internet for information on pipelines at a rate never
seen before. While we cannot relate this directly to the number of homebuyers affected, let alone
their priors, it seems reasonable to assume that this bump in attention was non-negligible.
    Turning to the change in γ from the letter, this is also tough to gauge. On the one hand, this
is about as powerful an information treatment as we could imagine implementing at scale. PG&E
compiled a list of all residents living within a relatively large area around each of its pipelines.
It then sent millions of residents a concise letter invoking the still salient tragedy of San Bruno,
alerting them of their situation, and directing them to a website for more information. Like all
mailers, we have no way of knowing how many of these letters were opened and internalized.
    A potentially larger limitation of the letter treatment is that the information was only given
to homeowners, not buyers. As was discussed above, there is conflicting information over whether
this was a legally material fact that should be disclosed when closing. Regardless of the literal
letter of the law, we doubt that this disclosure often happened in practice. Instead, we interpret
any change in γ as coming from coverage of the letters and word of mouth, rather than from a
formal disclosure process. Given this, it is important to note the distinction between this paper
and earlier disclosure work by Pope (2008), which focused on disclosure laws explicitly mandating
disclosure to potential buyers.
    If we assume that the shock to γ from either the explosion or the letter was significant, then our
results suggest even a fully informed housing market would reveal little willingness to pay to avoid
pipeline safety risk. This is consistent with fully informed households having rational expectations
about this small risk. We can invert the standard VSL formula to back out an implied willingness
to pay to avoid this risk.
                                  M W T P = V SL × P iplineRisk

Between 1996 and 2015, there were 12 fatalities from natural gas transmission pipeline incidents in
California (including San Bruno). In the CoreLogic data, 28% of CA households are within 2000
feet of a transmission pipeline, which implies an annual pipeline risk of 0.053 deaths per million
people. Using the current EPA VSL figure of $8.5M, this implies an annual willingness to pay of
just $1.32 per household.


                                                  19
    How can we relate this revealed rational apathy, to the current stated opposition to new
pipelines? One possible reconciliation is preference heterogeneity. If the most concerned house-
holds have already sorted, then the loss in utility from pipelines that encroach into new areas may
be steep, even if the gradient near old pipelines appears flat.
    An alternative explanation for this apparent disconnect between stated and revealed concern
is NIMBYism. New pipelines do impose some distinct disamenities on local communities, partic-
ularly during construction or when eminent domain is invoked. These affected parties may realize
that messages related to pipeline safety are particularly effective at drumming up community and
political support. Even if this is the case, it should be noted that efforts to increase pipeline
awareness and information availability may still be valuable, even if they do not affect avoidance
behavior. Accurate information allows those living near pipelines to make safety plans and respond
accordingly should another disaster like San Bruno occur.


7    Conclusion
Safety concerns are a major impediment to making necessary expansions to the natural gas pipeline
network. While there appears to be very little revealed willingness to pay to avoid existing natural
gas pipelines, it is difficult to know if this reflects true ambivalence or simply a lack of salience and
awareness. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this ambiguity by studying the fallout from the
San Bruno disaster, which shocked both salience and information. Using multiple identification
strategies, we fail to to find any evidence of a meaningful shift in the hedonic price gradient
following these events. While there efforts to raise information and salience may still be valuable,
these results suggest their absence are not obscuring some large latent pipeline aversion. Extending
this null result to new pipelines involves making assumptions about construction disameneites and
heterogeneity in preferences. This topic is left for future work.

B     Property fixed effects
One potential concern with our approach is that we are not sufficiently controlling for unobservable
housing characteristics that are correlated with pipeline proximity. Given that our housing data
strectches back to 1996, property fixed effects allow us to examine this concern. The housing market
equilibrium has clearly changed substantially during and after the housing crisis. Thus, we do not
want to use data stretching back that far as our “pre” period. Unfortunately, restricting ourselves
to four years of repeat sales data both reduces our sample considerably, and also introduces severe
sample selection problems. Instead, we use the full sample, but include a “double-difference” term
for the period before 6/16/2009. We want to compare the post-explosion period to a reference
period that is relatively stable. This approach “removes” the data generated in the pre-crash
market equilibrium from directly “helping” to estimate the treatment effect. We still leave this
data in because it allows us to use property fixed effects in some specifications without losing all of
our data (or selecting on properties that sell twice during 2009-2012). We estimate the following
specification:



                                                    24
          ln Pit =αi + µt + βP re Closei + βP C Closei × P reCrasht + βExpl Closei × Explt +                    (8)
                   βLetter Closei × Letterit + Xit δ + it

which is identical to Equation 2, except that we now include property fixed effects αi and the extra
“Pre-crash” DD term. We present the results of Equation 8 in Table B.1. Comparing Column 1 to
Column 2 and Column 3 to Column 4, it is clear that accounting for unobservable time-invariant
housing characteristics has very little effect on the difference-in-difference estimates.
