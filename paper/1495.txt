                       The Costs of Worker Displacement


                                   ABSTRACT


This study defines the nature of worker displacement and develops a mechanism
for inferring the amount of losses caused by displacement in a way that is
tied to economic theory. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are
first used to identify the characteristics of displaced workers. After a
demonstration that usual methods of evaluating workers' losses cannot provide
correct measures of the cost to society, a game—theoretic model determining
the amount of firm—specific investment in workers is developed. As workers'
and firms' horizons decrease, such investment will be reduced; this will be
exhibited in a flattening of the wage—tenure profile as the date of
displacement approaches. Examination of the profile thus provides a test
whether firms and workers have good information about impending displacement.

     Using the P5W data for workers displaced between 197? and 1981, the
study shows there is no significant flattening of the wage—tenure profile in
the entire sample. (However, some flattening does occur among unionized
workers, and also among workers who are laid—off permanently from a plant that
remains open.) This suggests that workers are surprised by displacement, for
they continue investing in firm—specific human capital up to the time of
displacement. The present value of the worker's share of the lost returns on
this investment is around $7000 (1980 dollars) under intermediate assumptions
about the real rate of discount, depreciation on such investment and the
effect of tenure on the rate of voluntary separation.

 I. Introduction

     Perhaps the liveliest recent discussion of labor—market policy has been

about declining industries and the workers attached to then. Calls for an

 inchoate 'industrial policy;" proposals to aid "displaced workers;' and

attempts to prevent future losses, are all responses to this perceived

problem.1 In this study I consider the meaning of the notion "displaced

worker" and present a partial evaluation of the magnitude and burden of the

costs produced by displacement. In essence the study thus examines the costs

of adjustment to shifts in production, transaction costs that are presumably

outweighed by the long—run improvement in the allocation of labor.

     The term 'displaced worker' is not well specified.2 Therefore, I use a

national sample of workers to identify the characteristics o4 those who might

be classified as displaced. Most important, the study devises a method for

specifying and measuring the cost to society of these workers' job losses.

The output of this approach is an answer to the question whether workers

experience a loss in human capital upon losing their Jobs, or whether the loss

is solely a reduction in the rents (to characteristics such as sex, race,

union status, etc.) that accrued on their previous Jobs. As such, it

provides a way of evaluating the costs of worker displacement that is more

closely grounded in economic theory than is the existing literature (which is

surinarized in Bal&uin, 1984). This method can provide the basis for schemes

that might be offered to compensate for losses attendant on worker

displacement.


II. Who Are Displaced Workers?


     In order of increasing breadth, three definitions of a 'displaced worker'

can be appl ied to existing data. The narrowest includes only those workers
whose Job losses resulted from competition froni imports. Its difficulty is

its inabil it>' to identify which job losers are unemployed because of import

competition.3 Indeed, empirically it is difficult to distinguish these Job

losses front those that result from high cQsts induced by wage rates in excess

of those paid to otherwise identical workers.

     A less narrow definition includes all workers whose jobs disappeared

because their employer closed the plant or business. The difficulty with this

definition is that it distinguishes artificially among workers depending on

whether the employer closed or merely curtailed operations. Thus a third, and

still wider definition, adds to these workers others who lost their jobs

through layoffs that were not part of the closing of an entire plant. In this

section I use these last two definitions to examine the characteristics of

workers who might be classified as displaced. One should note that both

definitions relate to the nature of workers' separation from their previous

jobs; neither depends upon their current labor—force status.

     While other studies have counted workers who might be categorized as

'displaced,' none has been able to distinguish between the second and third

definitions.4 I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to identify workers who

left their jobs either because they were laid off or because the employer's

business closed.5 I thus distinguish between workers identified as flaid—off'

and those called 'displaced,' even though both can be classified as displaced

according to the third definition above. iong national samples the PSID is

unique in making this distinction.

    Table I presents estimates of the extent of displacement, and of the

characteristics of displaced workers, based on the PSID for the years 1969
                6
through 1981.       The Table is based only on heads of households (since the data

are available only for them); some involuntary separations are missing, and

 the data may be overstating or understating national average displacement

 rates, depending on whether household heads are more or less likely to be

subject to displacement. As the Table shows, the rate of "displacement is

roughly half that of the layoff rate. Despite this difference1 though, a

surprisingly large fraction of workers lose their jobs each year because the

entire place of business closes.

     Only two aspects of the demographic characteristics of job losers are

surprising. One would expect, given the cawuon practice (in both union and

nonunion establishments) of layoffs by inverse seniority, that permanently

laid—off workers are fairly young. This is borne out by a comparison to the

average age of all household heads in the P610 sample. However, displaced

household heads are not substantially older than the typical head in the

PSID.7 The incidence of displacement does not fall disproportionately on the

older worker (though the burden of any private loss may). The other

unexpected characteristic is the fairly low percentage of displaced workers

who are married. Perhaps the unobserved characteristics of individuals who

are displaced from Jobs overlap those characteristics that led them to fail to

find satisfactory matches in the marriage market.

     Both laid—off and displaced workers have lower educational attainment

than does the typical household head, and both groups are less likely to

contain non—Hispanic whites than the typical household. There is little

difference between laid—off and displaced workers in educational attainment.

However, it is noteworthy that the composition of this group of workers who

experience plant closings is much more representative of the racial/ethnic mix

of household heads than is that of laid—off workers. Using the broader

definition of displacement makes the problem more closely coincident with the

problems of minorities in the labor market. That both laid—off and displaced




                                    —3—
groups consist disproportionAtely of men is unsurprising given the lower

labor—force participation rates of female heads of households.


III. The Nature of the Losses


     The large literature on displacement in the labor market stems mainly

from an interest in the effects of foreign competition. This literature has

evaluated the losses incurred by displaced workers using two approaches (often

together.) The first considers the value of the time the displaced worker

spends unemployed (Bale, 1976; Neumann, 1978); the second compares workers'

wages or earnings on the Job that was lost to those on the Job eventually

obtained (Jacobson, 1978; Jenkins—I'lontmarquette, 1979; Kiefer—Neumann, 1979;

Sandell—Shapiro, 1983; Glenday—Jenkins, 1984). Only if: 1) Workers realize

that the characteristics that produced rents on the previous Job have no

effect on the wage—offer distribution they must search over; 2) There is no

unemployment insurance; and 3) Earnings obtained on the previous Job are

adjusted appropriately, can one obtain a correct estimate of the cost to

society.

     To see the first point, assume that the wage on the previous Job was:


(1) Wb = G(X,


where b denotes the previous Job, X is a vector of characteristics of the

worker that yield the sane return on average on the previous Job and in the

market generally, and Z is a vector of characteristics that cannot !. post be

expected to yield equal returns on subsequent jobs. Thus, for example, the

union status of the previous job (see Wachter, 1983); returns to racial or

ethnic favoritism, or accumulated firm—specific human capital are included in

7. Let the worker's reservation wage after displacement be characterized as:




                                    —4—
 (2) r = HUL*,o*             )




 where the starred variables in H(.) are the mean and standard deviation of the

 density function of wages that the worker perceives at the time of

 displacement.

          Assume the displaced worker searches a density function of wages that is

 in fact described by 4(W), O<W<—. Let F(W*) be the distribution function of f

 from 0 to (4*. Assuming for simpl icity that the worker samples one offer each

 time period, the average duration of unemployment, I?, will be 1/(1—F(W")], and

 the wage rate on the worker's new Job will be:


(3)       (4 =
           a     cwf(w)dwCl_F(Wr)].
                 Jwr

So long as W           is   affected by 2b' i.e. so long as the mean and variance of the

ex (ante) perceived distribution of offered wages are affected by

characteristics specific to the previous Job, the duration of unemployment and

the subsequent wage will be affected by those characteristics. The duration

of unemployment will be longer and the subsequent wage will be higher than

otherwise.8 These biases arise because workers leave their Jobs with inflated

expectations of how the market will reward them for some of the

characteristics that raised their wages there,               because of problems in
      -
                                                 .
specifying the error structure of equations describing      -
                                                       duration          or (4
                                                                              r
          Simply relating wages before displacement to those obtained on the next

Job, as is proposed in most of the studies cited above, will thus
                                                                           produce
erroneous estimates of the social cost of displacement. As I have
                                                                            shown,
there is an implicit simultaneity between wages on the two Jobs that works

through the relation between the reservation wage and the components of

Even though those components may not be productive outside the original Job,

they will affect the entire function describing wages on subsequent Jobs. The




                                             —5—
second point follows from the same logic as the first: The presence of

unemployment insurance will induce workers to search longer, also producing

longer unemployment and a smaller drop in wages than would otherwise be the

case.

   Ignoring these two problems, one must (see Sandell—Shapiro, 1983) adjust

wages (not wage functions) on the previous job for differences in the

components of Z between jobs. The difficulty with even this partial solution

to the errors implicit in before—after wage comparisons is that not all of

what is lost when the values of the components of Z change represents a loss

to society. For example, rents may have accrued because some factor that

protected the worker from competition may be lost if a new job is not

similarly protected. If the job from which the worker is displaced is

unionized, but the job subsequently obtained is not, the worker suffers a loss

in wages, ceteris paribus. However, the loss should not affect the ability of

employers in the union sector to fill jobs in the future.9

        Also included in the loss may be a reduction in human capital. Workers

and firms invest in human capital expecting some horizon over which the

returns will be reaped. Impending displacement may represent a shortening of

the horizon and perhaps a capital loss to the worker and/or the firm. Here

the distinction between general and specific training is crucial. General

training is included in X; by definition it is as applicable in any subsequent

job as in the job that disappeared. Firm—specific human capital, however, is

included in      and is lost when the worker leaves the firm. This investment

may have been made with the expectation of a longer payout period than in fact

occurred. Both the firm and the worker may suffer a capital loss because of

the separation, with the size of each party's loss dependent upon the length

of the payout period that was expected, the amount invested, and the sharing




                                      —6—
 of investment costs.1°

     These considerations suggest that the social costs in the labor market

 include at least the lost firm—specific human capital, measured using

 information uncontaminated by the biases induced by the effect of Zb Oil

subsequent wages. Firm—specific human capital is the only component in

that clearly has no productivity on any subsequent Job and that represents an

investment on which the return may be below—market. Displaced workers may

reap below—market returns on their investment in occupation— or

industry—specific skills; but, unless the entire occupation or industry

disappears at once, the magnitude of this loss is also affected by the

worker's search behavior in the face of a (possibly changing) distribution of

returns to these skills. Similarly, there is a social loss that is positively

related to the excess of the displaced workers' market wages over their

reservation wages, and to the duration of time they spend between Jobs. Both

components of the loss that occurs during the time the workers are unemployed

are affected by their search behavior, and thus possibly by characteristics of

their previous Jobs. For these reasons the remainder of this study examines

lost firm—specific investment, recognizing that society may also lose both the

worker's labor services during the time between Jobs and part of a stream of

expected returns on investment in skills specific to an occupation or

industry.


IV. Inferring the Effects of Impending Displacement


    Measuring lost firm—specific human capital is not an easy task, insofar

as the stock must be inferred from wages, and the costs of investment in

firm—specific human capital are shared by workers and firms. Nonetheless, one

can use data on wage—tenure profiles along with some consideration about the




                                    —7—
efficient split of investment costs between workers and firms to answer the

questions: 1) Is there any loss? That is, are investments being made that

have a payout period that extends beyond the date 04 displacement? and 2) If

so, which party, the worker or the firm., bears the costs of these H post poor

investments?

      Consider the following technology for producing firm—specific training:


(4)        B    8(t)


where t is the fraction of the initial period of employment that is spent in

training. (All firm—specific training is assumed to take place during this

first period.) B is the amount that the training adds to the worker's

productivity each period; it is assumed constant over the entire life of the

investment.    I assume that production of specific training is characterized by

diminishing returns, i.e., B'>O, B<O, and that B(O)0. The costs of producing

the training are also a function of t, with C(t) described by C', C>D, and

C(O)=O. There is little evidence either way on the assumptions describing the

shapes of B and C; I have merely made standard assumptions about

technologies.12 In making them I also ignore for simplicity any costs of

training other than the value of trainees' time.

      The worker and the firm are assumed to have identical discount rates and

have utility functions U, U')O, U"<O, defined over the benefits and costs of
                          13
firm—specific training.        Let T. be each party s horizon, the length of time

it expects to reap returns on the investment in specific training, where i

refers to the firm (F) or the worker (W). This assumption implies point

expectations about the duration of the job. It too is simplifying; but the

results carry through with the more realistic assumption that both workers and

firms maintain subjective probability distributions about the job's duration.




                                        —B—
          The worker bears some fraction s of the cost of the investment and reaps

that same fraction of the expected returns. The worker's expected utility

stream is thus defined as:


                                Tw
 (5)                —   U(sB(t)) E Dk + U(—sC(t)),
                                k-i

where D is the discounting factor 1/Citri.                 identical to Z except 1—s
                                                      ZF

replaces s, and TF replaces Tw.

         Because this is a shared investment, in which each side has monopoly

power, the outcomes, t*, the optimal fraction of the initial period spent

investing, and s*, the optimal fraction of the benefits and costs accruing to

the worker1 are subject to bargaining between the firm and the worker. The

Nash equilibrium solution to this bargaining problem is the pair Ct*, s*) that

max imi zes:



(6)       Z =


Assuming TF = Twi the assumption of identical discount rates and utility

functions produces the standard Nash result that s*=.5, and some t*)O if

     ( t*)O   T. ) >Z ( t*=O IT. )
 I              I        I       I




        The burden of displacement is based in the parties' expectations about

the nature of the shortened horizon over which the shared returns to the

investment in firm—specific training will be reaped. Thus the nature of the

information available to both sides about the continued existence of the job

in which the investment has been made determines tIE and s*.          I examine cases

in which the information available to each party is identical (symmetric), and

in which the firm has better information about the job's impending demise

<asymmetric). Asyrwuetry in the opposite direction, udth the worker better able

to foresee the job's disappearance, seems unlikely given the firm's control




                                                —9—
over decisions about operating its plant.


                      CASE   l.A.   Synvnetrjc   Lack of Information


     In this case neither party is aware that the job will disappear until the

day the firm discovers that its profit—maximizing conditions dictate that the

worker be laid—off permanently (or the plant closed). Thus at all times up to

the date of separation the horizon seen by workers and the firm is unchanged

at TFTW, both greater than the j post payout period of the returns to the

investment. Since in this case the information is identical to what it is         in

the absence of any information about the job's disappearance, the outcome of

the bargaining problem that determines t* and s* is unchanged. Both parties

will experience a capital loss when the displacement occurs.


            CASE LB. Syniietric Information About Impending Displacement


     Assume in this case that the worker and the firm real ize that, because of

an exogenous drop in product demand, the worker's expected tenure in the firm

has dropped to T'w<Tu. Because information is synrnetric, T'F=T'W. This change

reduces both parties' perceived utility from investing in specific training.

If training is still profitable at some t*>O, it will be undertaken.       And,
since the      are still equal (though reduced), 5* remains at .b. Given the

assumptions about the shapes of B and C, though, t*'<t*: With a shorter

horizon over which to reap the returns to firm—specific training, a smaller

investment in such training will be made. The size of the profit over which

the parties bargain will be smaller. For some 1* the investment will no

longer be profitable and t* will be zero.


                         Case II. Asymmetric Information

         both the worker and the employer realize the horizon has shortened, but the

         firm acquires this information first. However, the general nature of the

         problem can be analyzed Just as well if we assume that the worker has no

         knowledge that the layoff is inninent, while the firm knows the horizon has

         shortened. Thus:


           T•'w =      >   T' ) 0.


         This means that the stream of returns seen by the firm is lower for every t at

         s*.5 than that perceived (incorrectly) by the worker.

                Because information is asynvnetric, the Nash solution no longer applies;

         and unfortunately the game—theory literature has not produced an explicit

         solution to the noncooperative game implicit in the assumption of asynwnetry.

         Let us therefore merely consider two possible situations under this

         assumption. If TF is sufficiently short, the firm will realize that it cannot

         make any profit if s<1. The solution is no longer bargained: The amount

         invested is determined solely by the worker maximizing Z with s*=1, with t*

         smaller than before due to the shape of the worker's utility function. If
                                                                                       TF
         is not this short, the parties are engaged in a noncooperative bargaining

         situation. While nothing can be inferred with certainty about the outconie,

         one might assume that continuity applies. If so, as TF increases Just beyond

         the point where the firm is indifferent about taking part in bargaining over s

         and t, s will be close to one. That being the case, t* will also be lower

         than it was before the firm acquired information that led it to revise its

         horizon.               -




                One might ask why workers do not recognize that an increase in s* signals

         that       has decreased and reduce Tw too. This question is equivalent to




— 11 —
viewing the bargaining process over s and t as a supergame, in which each

party learns from the outcome of a particular solution Ct*, *) something

about the other party's horizon and modifies its own behavior accordingly on

the next round. Indeed, if there were sufficient rounds in such a supergame

and the firm knew with certainty the date of closing, there would be no loss

from displacement: Workers and firms would repeatedly modify the amount and

sharing of investment based on the firm's horizon, as revealed by the outcomes

of the previous stage. Investment would occur along a path such that the

value of firm—specific human capital was zero at the date of displacement.

What the empirical work in this study does is test whether in fact information

is sufficient and the parties are clever enough bargainers to avoid

investments that will not pay off.


     The likely outcomes on s* and t*, both the Nash solutions when
                                                                       TF=TW and
the results when information is asymmetric, are shown in Figure 1 as functions

of TF and     The greater the divergence between the parties' horizons, the

more the spl it in the benef its and costs of the investment differs from •514

The shorter the horizons become, the smaller the investment will be.

     This discussion allows us to use changing wage—tenure profiles to infer

the information available to displaced workers and their employers. 1) If the

profile does not change as workers near displacement, either Case l.A. is

correct, or Case Ii is valid, but workers' horizons have decreased somewhat.

2) If the profile becomes flatter as the date of displacement draws nearer,

either Case I.B. is correct, and firms and workers have the same, fairly good

information about the impending displacement; or the asymmetric case II is

correct, but the worker's information is sufficient to reduce the total amount

invested by more than enough to offset the worker's increased share of the

costs of training.15 3) If the profile becomes steeper as the date of

 (Abowd—Ashenfelter, 1981; Topel, 1984) for the risk of unemployment, perhaps

one sufficient to compensate also for the potential loss of firm—specific

human capital. Both displaced workers and others in the same firms will

receive this extra pay. What is considered here is whether there are any

losses of such capital, or whether the differential need only compensate for

the time the displaced workers expects to spend unemployed.


V. Measurement and Estimation


      !n this and the next section 1 examine the determinants of wages of both

displaced and laid—off workers. The basic equations to be estimated are of

the form:


(7)   ln w =   fl   +   VP

where w is the wage on the worker's main Job, 2 is a vector of control

variables, and 2' is a vector containing measures of total experience and

tenure. The data used are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,

      The P5W has the virtue of providing a long, continuous panel, but it has

one severe drawback for our purpose: Tenure with the employer, a measure of

the time available for investment in firm—specific training, is reported only

in the interviews of 1976 and 1977.17 Since the main purpose is to observe the

wage—tenure relationship among workers who are later displaced, this lack

greatly restricts the number of observations from the PSID that can be used.




                                    — 13   —
 (Because no information on the tenure of people who report themselves

 displaced in 1976 or earlier is available, only people displaced between 1977

 through 1981 have the required information.) The paucity of data on tenure

with the employer combines with workers' mobility to limit the sample still

further: Many of the workers involuntarily separated in, e.g., 1981 had

changed jobs several times since 1977, when their tenure was last reported)-8

     Equation (7) is estimated using observations for years 1—1, T—2, T—3 and

T—4, where, as before, T is the date of involuntary separation.19 Starting

with 1421 household heads who left their jobs because of a permanent layoff or

a plant closing in 1977—1981, the exclusions reduce the sample sizes in the

estimates of (7) in years 1—i, i1,...,4, to 362, 305, 246 and 200

observations respectively. Of these people, 36 percent of those included in

the samples for 1—2, 7—3 and 1—4 were displaced workers, while 33 percent of

the sample for T—1 were.

     The variables included in 2 are standard in equations like (7).    nong
them are: Years of formal education, or a vector a dumy variables for

completion of college, some college, or completion of high school; whether the

worker is a union member, white, married, or male; whether the worker resides

in the South or in an SN in which the largest city has a population above

500,000; the worker's occupation in the job that disappeared (professional or

manager, craft, or operative or laborer); and the industry of that job

(manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, or finance and services). The

means of these variables in the four samples suggest these involuntarily

separated workers are not typical of the U.S. labor force: There are fewer

whites, more Southerners and more manufacturing workers. These differences

are consistent with the P910's oversampling of low—income households and with

the greater propensity of manufacturing employers to lay off workers.




                                    — 14   —
     The variables included in 2' are tenure with the employer, TN, and years

 of actual full—time labor—market experience since age 18, X. A quadratic term

 in experience is also included in the equations, as is a quadratic term in

 tenure in some of the estimates. The average tenure prior to involuntary

separation is only five years. Nonetheless, between 33 and 37 percent 04 the

workers in the four samples had more than five years' tenure with their

employer, and between 17 and 20 percent had at least ten years of tenure. The

average total experience in the samples impl ies a mean age in the middle

thirties, roughly what is implied for all laid—off and displaced workers in

Table 1.


VI. Estimates of Wage Profiles MonQ Displaced and Laid—off Workers


     The estimates of P in (7) for those variables not in P are shown in

Table A.!. The results are quite standard among estimates of wage equations

using micro data and merit little conitient here. Suffice it to note that their

very rout ineness suggests that, along most dimensions that produce wage

differentials, the particular samples selected from the P210 are not unusual.

     Table 2 presents the estimates of the parameters on the experience and

tenure variables from (7), including only a linear term in tenure. The

wage—experience profiles have shapes that have generally been found in

research in this area (e.g., Mincer—Jovanovic, 1981). However, the results in

Table 3, which include a quadratic term in tenure, show only slight evidence

of the usual concavity in the wage—tenure profile. This may result froni the

peculiar nature of the sample, from the use of tenure with the employer

instead of the less appropriate tenure in the Job that has been used in many

studies, or from the relatively small samples that the focus on involuntary

separations produces.




   — 15 —
     The major issue of interest in this study is the pattern o4 effects of

tenure with the firm. As a comparison of the coefficients in Table 2 on this

variable makes clear, there may be some flattening of the wage—tenure profile,

but it is not very pronounced. The profile is still far from flat even in the

year ininediately preceding displacement.2° It may of course be that the

profiles for all four years are much flatter than those for years t—5 and

earl ier, and flatter than those for workers who are not separated

involuntarily. However, the slopes in Table 2 are remarkably close to those

produced by Altonji—Shakotko (1984) using similarly specified equations

covering employed white males in the PSID.

     Consider how the wage—tenure profiles vary with the worker's union

status. Trade—union wage—setting differs from that in nonunion plants in the

effects of experience on wage rates (see Johnson—Youmans, 1971) and in how

workers process information about the workplace (see Freeman, 1980). It may be

that unionized workers, merely because the union provides a means of gathering

information about the employer's plans, avoid investments in specific human

capital that will not pay off, an avoidance that would be reflected in

wage—tenure profiles that flatten out as displacement approaches.

     The results of estimating (7) including interaction terms of experience

and tenure with union membership are shown in Table 4. While the vector of

interaction terms is not jointly significantly different from zero, the

results are nonetheless suggestive. The use of a quadratic in X makes it

difficult to infer the effect of unionism on changes in the wage—experience

profile simply by inspection, and I defer the discussion of that issue.

However, inspection of the interaction terms with tenure suggests a striking

pattern: The wage—tenure profiles for union workers are much steeper in the

third and fourth years before displacement than they are in the first and

and 1—4, and .006 and 0 in years 1—1 and 1—2. Among nonunion workers there is

essentially no change in the steepness of the wage—tenure profile as

displacement nears. This difference is co.nsistent with the role of unions in

providing information that protects workers from management discretion, in

this case, information about impending involuntary separation.

    Another possible difference in behavior may arise in those plants that

experience closings. In such cases the employer may make more of an effort to

hide information than in cases when an isolated worker, or group of workers,

is to be laid off. To examine this possibility equations (7) were reestimated

including interaction terms of the tenure and experience variables with th

reason for involuntary separation. The results are shan in Table 5. The

vector of interaction terms is jointly significant in the equations for year

1—4, though not in the other equations. Most interesting, the implied slopes

of the wage—tenure profiles decl me steadily from .0213 to .0054 as the date

of layoff approaches. Apparently, workers facing layoff obtain enough

information about it to reduce their firm—specific investment. This is not

true among the one—third of the sample who lose their jobs because of plant

closings: The coefficients on TN alone in Table 5 shu that the slope of the

wage—tenure profile increases steadily as the date of closing nears.21

     The constancy of the slope of the wage—tenure profile with impending

displacement suggests eith!r that there is an asynnietry in the information

available to workers and their employers about the timing of the displacement,

or that neither party can plan well for it. Since it is unlikely that workers

have more information than their employers, the invariance of the wage—tenure

profiles with time remaining until separation shows that there is a high

degree of ignorance on the part of the workers. if workers' knowledge of the

impending displacement were less than employers', but still substantial, total

firm—specific investment would drop so much that workers' costs of an

increased share of the investment would fall •22

     Because the quadratic terms in experience make it difficult to infer any

changes in the pattern of investment in general training as the date of

displacement approaches, for each year before displacement Table 6 shows the

average wage in the samples as a function of experience, evaluated at the

means of the other variables. The clearest result is the lack of change in

the wage—experience profile as displacement approaches. Even among union

workers, whose wage—tenure profiles indicated they had fairly good information

about the displacement, the wage—experience profile changes little. Only when

the profiles are calculated for laid—off workers separately is there a

noticeable steepening, while among workers affected by plant closings the

profile flattens out.

    At first consideration the results for the subgroups, and for the entire

sample, are surprising. If workers were fully rational, had perfect

information about the impending displacement, and did not face any liquidity

constraints, they would invest more in firm—general training, the nearer the

time when they would need such training to obtain a job in another firm.    I


have shown, though, that workers do not have good information about the

approaching displacement. The results for the entire sample can be

rationalized by noting that workers who face liquidity constraints must trade

off investment in general training for investment in firm—specific training.

Since they do not change the pattern of investment in specific training, they

are unable to change that in general training. Undoubtedly other explanations

can be offered, but this one is at least consistent with utility—maximizing

behavior, the inferences I have made about investment in firm—specific




                                    — 18 —
training, and the evidence for the entire sample. This view also explains the

differences in the changing wage—experience profiles between laid—off and

displaced workers: The former exhibit a steepening wage—experience profile

along with a flattening wage—tenure profile, while the opposite pattern exists

for workers who face plant closings.


VII. Estimating the Loss


      The value of lost firm—specific investment can be estimated using the

results from Section VI along with assumptions about quit behavior.   I


calculate only the social cost attributable to the worker: The total cost to

society of the lost specific human capital——the sum of the worker's and the

firm's losses——cannot be calculated without extraneous information on changes

in s* as the date of displacement approaches. Whether these are losses that

should be compensated is not at issue here; all I am measuring is the size of

the range of negative returns on firm—specific investment.

      The present value of the loss for the typical worker with TN years of

tenure in the firm is:

                                   68-A
                                   £       P(TN+t)
(8)       L   R(w*(TN) —   w(O)]
                                   t0 [(1+r)(1+6)J

where L is the loss; P is the probability the worker would otherwise have been

employed in the firm t years after displacement; A is the worker's age; H is

hours worked per year; w*(TN) is the wage rate gross of the cost of investment

in specific training for a worker with Th years of tenure, and w(O) is the

wage rate the same person would get with tenure of zero years; r is the

discount rate, and    is the rate of depreciation of firm—specific investment.

Throughout I assume H=2000; L is calculated over the range of values of r and

& on the intervals tO, .101 and 1.05, .15] respectively.23

        The wage loss is estimated using the quadratic wage—tenure profile for

 T—I that is presented in Table 3. The effect of tenure on the worker's net

wage is calculated using the coefficients on TN and TN2 from that regression.

The gross wage loss, however, is the appropriate measure to use in estimating

 the value of lost firm—specific investment, since it measures the current

return on the stock of past firm—specific investment without
                                                                subtracting any
current investment. It is calculated using the coefficients from this same

regression under the assumptions that the rates of return to education and

firm—specific training are equal, and that the ratio of investment in

firm—specific training declines linearly with years of tenure (Mincer, 1974).

        I assume that workers would have remained in the firm unless they quit

voluntarily. Thus P is calculated as:
                        t
 (9)       P(TN+t) —    II   [1—q (k)1.
                       k-O

where        is the voluntary quit rate of a worker with TN years of tenure.

Since q cannot be calculated for the workers on whom the estimates in Section

VI are based, I use estimates of quit rates as functions of workers'

characteristics based on micro data sets with broad coverage. Three of the

available studies——Freeman (1980); Mincer—Jovanovic (1981), and Viscusi

(1980)——are based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.24 The other, Mitchell

(1982), uses the Quality of Employment Surveys for 1973 and 1977.

       The loss in <8) is calculated for each of the 362 displaced workers

included in the sample over whom equation (7) was estimated for the year

before displacement. The average loss in the sample is presented in Table 7

for each of the four quit functions and for various pairs of r and S. The

estimated losses (in 1980 dollars) are quite large, even when high values of

the discount and depreciation rates are assumed. The failure of workers who




                                          — 20 —
are later displaced to adjust the path of investment in firm—specific training

generates large losses for them when the displacement occurs.25 One should

remember that I have excluded the firm's share of lost specific training, and

have not included the value of lost occupation— or industry—specific training,

or the value of time unemployed. Viewed this way the social cost of worker

displacement seems quite large compared to the measures of workers' losses

that have been produced in the literature.


VU]. Conclusions


     In this study I have shown how changes in the horizon for a shared

investment like that in firm—specific training a4fect the amount and burden of

that investment.   I have used the predictions of that demonstration to analyze

how the wage—tenure profile changes in a particular sample of workers as they

approach the date of their displacement. The estimates indicate that

involuntarily separated workers incur a loss in the form of an unexpected

depreciation of the firm—specific human capital in which they have invested.

This loss is one component of the social cost of labor—market adjustment.

Other components——including the value of the time displaced workers spend

unemployed, and the value of lost occupation— and industry—specific

training——must be added to obtain an estimate of the total cost of

labor—market adjustment.

1. One example of this kind of response is the introduction of bills requiring
prior notification of a plant closing. The. 'National Employment Priorities
Act,' 98:1, H.R. 284?, mandates at least one year's prior notification of a
permanent layoff or a plant closing involving more than 100 workers. Such
legislation is similar to what exists in many other developed countries.

2. See Congressional Budget Office, fliclnrat.d Unrkpp: 1ci'sg      Fpilsrpl
flptinnc, July 1982, Chapter 3, for discussion of various approaches to
defining the issue.

3. In the 1960s this difficulty coupled with politics to prevent any payments
to workers under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 1962. Beginning in
1969 payments were made increasingly to workers whose employer's product
market merely contained foreign competitors.

4. Congressional Budget Office,     cit., uses the Current Population Survey
to classify unemployed workers, but does not base its criteria for
displacement on the reason for job loss. Sandell—Shapiro (1983) estimate the
economic and demographic characteristics of job losers, not classified by
reason for loss, in a sample of older workers only.

5. Currently employed workers were considered to be laid—off or displaced if
they changed employers for one of these reasons within the past year.
Unemployed or retired individuals were counted as laid—off or displaced in the
most recent year in which they reported the involuntary separation.

6. All the information is calculated using the survey's sampling weights (so
that the characteristics are comparable to national averages).

7. This finding contrasts with the evidence in Wilcock and Franke (1963, p.
40) showing a median age above 45 among workers displaced in the closings of a
group of meat—packing plants.

8. That the previous wage, not merely the components of the vector X, affects
the reservation wage is suggested by the results of Kiefer—Neumann (1979) and
Sandell (1980).

9. I assume, following Farber (1983), that such jobs must be rationed.

10. Obviously, some firms and workers whose relationship lasts longer than
they expected will experience unexpectedly high returns on their joint
 investment. For that reason these estimates may be viewed as tests for the
existence of, and measures of he size of, the lower tail of the distribution
of returns to firm—specific investment. Since many social policies focus on
compensating people in the lower tails of various distributions, e.g., income,
weeks employed, this approach is consistent with the analysis of other
policies.

11. That there are such skills is suggested by Shaw (1984). In addition to the




                                      —25—
 labor—market costs that are ignored, there are other costs, such as unexpected
 capital losses on innobile housing stocks, that must be included in a complete
 accounting of the social costs of adjustment to industrial change.

 12. All that is required for the results to go through is that 9 < C.

 13. This too is a simplifying assumption designed to ease the exposition; the
 results do not depend on it.          -




 14. Obviously, if the 2. differ the split will not be centered on
                                                                   .5; but the
qualitative results will remain unchanged.

 15. See, for example, Mincer—Jovanovic, 1981, for an example linking these
profiles to patterns of firm—specific investment. While the argument here and
 in most of the literature has based the wage—tenure profile on investment in
firm—specific training, one might inquire whether a similar link could be
estabi ished in a model of bonding such as Lazear's (1981). If both parties'
horizons suddenly shorten in such a model, new workers will be less willing to
forego current wages in exchange for higher wages later. Indeed, with a
sufficiently short horizon workers will not sacrifice any current wages, and
the profile will be flat. Thus the bonding model seems observationally
equivalent to the model developed here; in both a flattening of the
wage—tenure profile implies workers have acquired substantial information.
(However, the models may have substantially different implications for
appropriate policies on compensation,)

16. Hashimoto (1975) was the first to recognize the importance of the
specific—general distinction in discussing worker displacement. However, he
ignored the game—theoretic aspects of specific investment and the effect of
changing horizons, and provided no link between empirical results and the
theory of specific investment. Bartel—Bor,jas (1981) were also aware of the
role of specific training in separations, but they did not focus on the
wage—tenure profile's relation to time remaining on the job as we do below.

17. While tenure in a particular Job is available more often in this panel,
that measure does not reflect firm—specific investment very well. Consider
two workers, one with the firm for five years on five separate Jobs, each
lasting a year, the other in the firm for one year on the same Job. Though
each has tenure of one year on the job, the appropriateness of using total
tenure is apparent.

18. Yet another problem limiting the sample size is the restriction of the
data to household heads. Since some small fraction (below 10 percent) of the
households change heads each year, and since the data of interest are reported
for household heads, observations must be discarded because the information on
tenure and other variables cannot be linked to the date of displacement.

19. As people separated involuntarily in 1977—81 are included in the sample,
wage rates are made comparable across calendar time for T—i, i=1 , . . ,4, by
inflating using the growth in private nonfarm hourly earnings between the time
the worker's wage is observed and 1980.

20. One possibility that might explain the apparent lack of flattening is that
the linear, and even the quadratic forms of TN misspecify the equation, and
that newer workers must be treated separately. To examine this I reestimated




                                           —26—
(7) for each of the four samples, first including a duirny variable for workers
with at most 1 year of tenure, then including a duriwny variable for those with
at most 2 years of tenure. Only one of these eight variables added
significantly to the equations' explanatory power, and in no case did their
addition change the inference that there is little flattening of the profile
as displacement approaches.

21. Equations (7) were also estimated separately for years T—1...T—4 for the
samples disaggregated by union status, and disaggregated by reason for
involuntary separation. Only for T—4 was the hypothesis that the
layoff—displaced subsainples could be pooled rejected at the 5—percent level of
confidence, and only for 1—1 for the union—nonunion disaggregation was the
hypothesis rejected even at the 10—percent level.

22. This conclusion corroborates the sense of surprise expressed by workers
and their representatives when plants close. One local union president
discussed how his employer expanded for several years and then, .. .we were
notified that in three weeks we would be shut down. The people in the town
were quite shocked.... It completely caught us off guard.' (James Savoy,
"Statement, House Subcommittee on Labor—Management Relations, 98:2,
                                                                     liaatings,
May 4, 1984.

23. This range brackets the estimates of the rate of depreciation of
on—the—job training in Johnson (1970).

24. Because Mincer—Jovanovic use OLS estimation, the simulated quit rate
becomes negative for high values of tenure in the firm. I arbitrarily
restrict q to be nonnegative in the simulations.

25. Since these estimates exclude lost fringe benefits, particularly unvested
pension benefits, even they underestimate the lost future remuneration.
