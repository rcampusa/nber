                The Case of the Developing Country Debt Crisis



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper reviews the management of the debt crisis to date, and considers

several possible alternative approaches for international cooperation in the

future. The first part of the paper briefly reviews the scope of the crisis,

and some of the reasons for its onset. Then, the paper describe the

internationally coordinated policy responses to the crisis, as well as the

conceptual underpinnings of this coordinated response. In the latter part of

the paper, some of the reasons for the incomplete success of the policy response

are described, and several alternative measures for the future are discussed.

The discussion emphasizes the possible merits of debt forgiveness in addition to

debt reschedulings as an instrument for the future management of the debt

crisis.

                International Policy Coordination: The Case of

                     the Developing Country Debt Crisis


I.   Introduction


     The LDC debt crisis has differed from other problems in the world economy

in an important and fascinating way. From the beginning of the crisis, all

leading governments have acknowledged the need for an activist and

internationally coordinated policy response. Even the ostensibly

laissez—faire Reagan Administration went swiftly into action in August 1982

when the global debt crisis exploded with Mexico's announcenent that it would

be unable to meet its international debt service obligations. Within days,

the U.S. government arranged for billions of dollars of emergency financing

for Mexico. Since then, the U.S. government has taken the lead in managing

the international response to the crisis, a response which has called for the

coordinated actions of the leading creditor governments, the debtor

governments, the international banks, and the multilateral financial

institutions.

     The management of the crisis has been only a partial success. On the

positive side, the dire predictions of pessimists in 1982 have not come to

pass: the countries with the largest debts have serviced their debts and not

defaulted; the international commercial banks have remained solvent; the

international capital markets have continued to function, and indeed except

for the debtor countries, have expanded in their scope and functions; and the

world has not fallen into a default-induced depression. These favorable
                                     —2—


outcomes resulted in significant part from the actions of policymakers at key

junctures in the past five years.

     On the other hand, the economic results for most of the debtor countries

has been poor. Economic development for hundreds of millions of people has

been halted or partially reversed. The long—term adequacy of the current debt

strategy therefore remains very much In doubt, despite the success to date in

avoiding a financial crisis. Contrary to the forecasts of the IKE, the

creditor governments, and the commercial banks, the debtor countries have

enjoyed neither sustained recovery nor renewed access to market lending under

the current rules of the game. In some countries, the economic situation has

become so desperate that governments have been forced into a unilateral

moratorium on debt servicing, even at the cost of a serious rupture of

international financial relations.

     This mix of success and failure is related to the kind of international

policy coordination advocated and managed by the United States in recent

years. The U.S. government and the other leading creditor governments

(including the U.K., Japan, and Germany) have worried more about continued

debt servicing to the commercial banks than about the pace of economic

development in the debtor countries. By opting to use their political and

economic influence to bolster their banks' positions, the creditor governments

have been able to sustain the flow of debt payments from the debtor countries,

but often at very high economic and political costs to the debtor countries

themselves.

     The policy emphasis on debt servicing to the commercial banks is not

surprising, and was certainly not inappropriate in the first couple of years
                   a   -
                                          —3—




of the debt crisis. The threat of insolvency of the world's largest

ccerclal banks was the •ost serious problem raised by the debt crisis at its

inception. As shown in the data of Table 1, the LOC exposure of the          largest
U.S. commercial banks greatly exceeded 100 percent of bank capital at the end

of 1982. The same is apparently true of the largest banks in Europe and

Japan. although data on bank exposures and bank capital are not      generally
available outside of the United States. Widespread debt repudiations could

have easily triggered a global banking crisis, and it was not unreasonable for

policymakers to fear that such a crisis could have pushed the world from a

deep recession into a deep depression.

      Moreover,   various analyses suggested that   if the short—term problems of

the   debt   crisis could be contained, then most of the debtor countries had the

longer—term capacity to resume debt servicing and to restore economic growth,

a viewpoint which has been    bolstered   by the continuing decline in world

Interest rates. Most of these analyses also stressed, however, the need for a

continuing flow of new capital into the debtor countries, a need which was

widely recognized by policymakers but which has not been satisfactorily

satisfied.

       In the past two years. the nature of the debt .anage.ent has provoked

increasing opposition in the debtor countries, since the debtor countries have

been making large sacrifices but without renewed growth, and since spectre of

a global banking crisis has lessened. Moreover, the worlSdde drop in

commodities prices since 1985    worsened the economic situation in many of the
debtor countries, as did a further drying up of bank lending. Several smaller
debtor   countries have recently   rejected   the international rules of   the game,

and have unilaterally restricted debt servicing, Peru being the best known

case. The threat of a breakdown In continued dtht servicing led U.S. Treasury

Secretary James Baker III to propose the "Baker Plan" In October 1985, which

called for increased inflows of private and official capital into the debtor

countries in return for Internationally supervised policy adjustments in those

countries. However, more than a year after the announcement of the Baker

Plan, there is little evidence of a renewed flow of private foreign capital

into the debtor countries.

considers several possible alternative approaches for international

cooperation in the future. Section II of the paper briefly reviews the scope

of the crisis, and some of the reasons for its onset. Section III describes

the Internationally coordinated policy responses to the crisis. Section IV

describes the conceptual underpinnings of this coordinated response, and

Section V then describes some of the reasons for the Incomplete success of the

policy response. Section VI discusses several alternative measures for the

future, Conclusions from the paper are summarized in Section VII.



II. The Scope and Origins of the LDC Debt Crisis


     The basic outlines of the LOC debt crisis are by now very well known, so

that only a brief summary of the onset of the crisis will be needed here.

(Detailed accounts of the crisis can be found in several recent books,

including dine (1984), Lever (1986), Lonax (1986), Kakin (1984), and

Nunnenkamp (1986)). Spokesmen in the developing countries sometimes Insist

that the debt crisis arose solely because of global economic dislocations,
                                     —5-


while creditor country policymakers sometimes suggest that mismanagement by

the debtor countries is entirely to blame for the crisis. The truth is of

course somewhere in the middle. The fact that more than forty countries

simultaneously succumbed to crisis suggests that global factors were crucial

to the onset of the crisis. But the fact that many countries affected by

global shocks avoided a crisis (for example most of the debtor nations in East

Asia) highlights the importance of country-specific factors, often Involving

important policy mistakes, in the onset of the crisis. We turn first to the

globa! factors in the crisis, then to the mistakes of economic management in

the debtor countries themselves.


A.   Global Factors in the Onset of the Crisis

     After the bond defaults of the Great Depression, international commercial

lending to the developing countries virtually disappeared, until the

development of cross-border commercial bank lending in Eurodollars in the late

1960s (see Sachs (1981), Eichengreen and Portes (1986), and Fishlow (1985) for

descriptions of the ups and downs of international lending during the past

century). During the period 1950 to 1970, foreign direct Investment provided

the bulk of international private capital flows, and private capital flows as

a whole were smaller In magnitude than official flows from the multilateral

Institutions and from individual creditor governments. In the early 1970s,

private capital flows to the developing countries began to exceed official

flows, as private bank lending rose to become the dominant form of

International capital flow. The sharp rise in world liquidity during 1971-73,

related to overly expansionary U.S. monetary policies and the demise of the
                                               —6-


    fixed exchan9e rate system, contributed to the expansion of the Eurodollar

    market and to an increase In bank funds available for onlending to developing

    countries.
-
                    Thus the rise in International bank lending predated the first

    OPEC oil shock of late 1973.

         The   first OPEC shock in 1973 dramatically increased the pace of LDC bank
    lending,   as the new   savings of the Persian Gulf countries were channeled to
    the international comuiercial banks, which lent (or "recycled") these savings

    to the developing countries.       This burst of lending was not simply the result

    of oil—importing countries trying to maintain their real consumption levels

    after the rise in oil prices, as is sometimes suggested.              Indeed, many oil

    •xoortina LDC5 outside of the Persian Gulf (i.e. countries such as Nexico and

    Nigeria) borrowed substantially from the international banks, so that by 1983,

    after   the   enormous rise in real oil prices during the previous decade, the

    large    10 developIng country debtors, as       a group, were oil exporters.1

            Nost of   the international lending during this period        was   undertaken by

    official      borrowers (i.e. central governments, public sector development

    banks, parastatals, etc.) rather than by the private sector, though the

    proportion of public and private borrowing differed by country.                In many

    cases, the borrowing was used      to finance ambitious public sector investment

    programs that could now be funded with readily available international banks
     credits   at low real interest rates. The        strategy of a rapid growth takeoff,

     based on foreign financing of large scale public Investments, has been termed

     "indebted industrialization" by Friedan (1981), who has studied the politics

     of this strategy in some detail In the cases of Brazil, Korea, and Mexico.

            An idea of   the share of public   and -private   borrowing   can be gleaned from
                                     —7-


the World Bank Debt Tables, which separates public sector and publicly

guaranteed borrowing from private sector borrowing (the World Bank data refer

only to medium-and long-term debt, since the data do not provide a breakdown

of the short—term debt by kind of borrowing). For Latin America as a whole,

about three-fourths of all long—term borrowing at the end of 1978 and also at

the end of 1983 was public or publicly guaranteed. Note that this ratio might

be biased upward to some extent because debts contracted by the public sector

are probably more completely covered by the World Bank Debt Reporting Service

than are debts contracted by the private sector.

     The fact that the external debt is heavily concentrated In the public

sector has had profound implications for adjustment to the debt crisis by the

debtor countries. As I stress later, these countries have two fundamental

problems to overcome. The first, and most widely recognized, Is that of

transferring national Income (via trade surpluses) to the foreign creditors.

The second problem, which is perhaps as difficult, Is that of transferring

income from the private sector of the debtor country to the Dublic sector so

that the public sector may service Its debts. In many countries, the nation

as a whole does not lack the resources to pay the forel9n creditors, but

rather the public sector is unable or unwilling to tax the private sector

sufficiently to generate an adequate debt—servicing capacity.

     As of 1979 the pace of International lending did not seem to pose a

particular danger to the banks or to the world economy. Various debt

indicators, such as the popular debt-export ratio, gave very few signs of

danger. Exports from the borrowing countries were booming, so that

debt—export ratios (Table 2) actually fell between 1973 and 1980 despite the

jump In total debt of the non—oil developing countries (hereafter NOLDC's)

from $130.1 billion in 1973 to $474 billion in 1980. With this happy state of

affairs, international financial specialists, academics, and policymakers

welcomed the continued "recycling" of OPEC money, and worried little about a

debt crisis.

     The key to this happy state of affairs was that nominal Interest rates on

dollar loans were consistently below the rate of growth of dollar export

earnings of the borrowing countries (another way to put the same thing is that

real interest rates were consistently below the rate of growth of real export

earnings). In 1979, for example, as shown in Table 2(a) and 2(b), nominal

U.S. Interest rates averaged 11.2 percent, while the export earings of the

LDC nonfuel exporters grew by 27.1 percent. In these circumstances, a debtor

country can borrow all the money that it needs for debt servicing (i.e. all

of the interest and amortization due) without experiencing a rise in its

debt-export ratio.2

     However, if nominal interest rates exceed the growth of nominal export

earnings, then a country that borrows all the money it needs for debt

servicing will experience an ever-increasing debt—export ratio.   Sooner or

later, the country will be cut off from new borrowing, and it will have to pay

for its debt servicing out of its own resources, I.e. by running trade

surpluses. With nominal interest rates in the mid— to—late 1970s at 10

percent or so (see Table 2), and with LOC export earnings growing at •ore than

15 percent per year in dollar terms, debt—export ratios were easily kept under

control. Very few observers suspected that In the near future, the debtor

countries would suddenly have to shift from new borrowing to trade surpluses
                                      —9-


as the way to meet their debt—servicing needs.
    The second and devastating phase of international borrowing took place in

1980-82, after the heady and highly profitable experience of 1973-79. Almost

none of the relevant actors, neither borrowers nor lenders (nor, It should be

said, academic observers) understood quickly enough that the success of the

first period was built squarely on the temporary condition of low interest

rates and high growth In export earnings. Prudent debtors and bankers should

surely have expected that within a few years interest rates might rise to

exceed growth rates, but few could have anticipated the sudden and dramatic

turnaround in the interest rate—growth relation after 1980, which Is shown In

Figure 1 (and In the data of Table 1).

       The debt crisis followed relentlessly upon the rise in interest rates and

collapse in export earnings. Once this reversal took place, all of the debt

warning signs started to fly off of the charts, as seen by the rapid Increase

In the debt-export and debt—service ratios after 1979 (Table 1). Bank

lending itself dropped off, with gross 815 bank claims on the NOLDC5 rising at

the rate of 24 percent in 1980, 18 percent in 1981, and 7 percent in 1982, but

the growth in export values declined even ore sharply, from 26 percent in

1980, to 5 percent In 1981, and —4 percent in 1982. Consequently, the

debt-export   ratio rose quickly.
       As Is well known, the rise in interest rates had an especially pronounced

effect   because of the nature of the LDC debt   to   the aaercial   banks, most of

which was in   the form of .edium—term   (generally 3 to 7 years) rollover

credits,   with interest rates at a fixed spread over    a short—term reference

rate). Thus, just as soon as short-term interest rates rose at the end of

1979, the interest rates charged on the existing syndicated bank loans to the

LDCs rose by the same amount. Also, since the great bulk of the debt was

dollar denominated, the rise in the dollar exchange rate (and the consequent

fall in dollar prices of internationally traded commodities) was especially

painful.

     The reasons for the rise in interest rates and fall in the dollar value

of trade have been widely discussed. After the second OPEC price shock, the

leading industrial countries embarked on a widely endorsed policy of rapid

disinflation, based on very tight monetary policies which raised interest

rates around the world. No international organization, not the tHE, nor the

World Bank, nor the OECD, gave any hint at the time that the suddenness and

sharpness of the monetary tightening would be problematic. To the contrary,

international officials everywhere applauded the seriousness of purpose of the

anti—inflation fight. The rise in interest rates was particularly large in

the U.S. in 1981 and after, because in addition to tight monetary policies

there was the prospect of many years of large budget deficits caused by the

Reaganomics tax cuts of 1981. As is now well understood, the especially high

U.S. interest rates created a capital inflow into the U.S., and a sharp

appreciation of the dollar.


B.   The Role of Domestic Policies in the Onset of the Crisis

     Without the global shocks, the debt crisis would not have occurred.

However, in almost all countries that succumbed to an external debt crisis,

domestic policy •istakes also played an important role, a point which makes
                                     —11—


commercial bank lending (especially after 1979) harder to understand, since

the banks should have seen some of the policy disarray in these countries.

Some economies that faced severe external disturbances, such as South Korea

and Thailand, were able to surmount the shocks and maintain international

creditworthiness and growth, at least after a short interval. Other

economies, which actually could have benefitted on balance from the external

events, such as the oil—exporters Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela, collapsed

under the weight of higher world interest rates. What were the crucial

differences that led to successful adjustment in some cases but not in others?

     In a recent paper (Sachs, 1985), I explored some of the possible

differences, by looking at the experiences of the Latin American and the East

Asian debtor countries. Among the major Latin American countries, all but

Colombia succumbed to a foreign debt crisis (as Indicated by the need for a

commercial bank debt rescheduling and by the exclusion from continued

borrowing on normal •arket terms), while in Asia all of the countries avoided

the need for a bank rescheduling with the exception of the Philippines.

Interestingly, the differences in experience were not fundamentally due to the

differences in the size of the external shocks hitting the two regions. As an

example, Mexico's debt crisis arose despite a nearly fourfold increase in

export earnings (due to oil) during 1978 to 1982, so that Mexico benefited

rather than suffered from the commodity price movements In the years preceding

the debt crisis. Rather, as stressed also by Balassa (1982) among others, the

orientation of trade and exchange rate policy was vital. Countries with

export—promoting trade policies were far sore successful in surmounting the

external shocks. Third, and not sufficiently stressed In the 1985 paper, the
                                       —12—



short-run   policy responses after 1979 were vital: a quick reaction to the

change in the International environment was necessary for a successful

adjustment.

     The key economic difference in the two regions is the rapid export growth

in Asia, which kept down that region's debt—export ratios. The

export—orientation of the Asian economies, in contrast to the

import—substitution strategy in Latin Anierica, is well known and well

documented. It should be stressed that the export orientation of the Asian

countries is decidedly a matter of poF Icy choice rather than inherent

structure, since two of the leading examples of export-led growth (South Korea

and Indonesia) went through a Latin—American styled Import—substitution phase

in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the result that exports were stifled

and growth was retarded. Incredibly, South Korean exports were a mere 3

percent of GNP in 1950. compared with 37 percent of GNP in 1983. Indonesian

exports rose from 5 percent of GNP in 1965 to 23 percent of GNP in 1983!

     In addition to the question of long-term policy orientation, the external

shocks imposed serious challenges for short-run policy after 1979. The rise

in world interest rates placed direct and significant pressures on government

budgets, because of the rise in debt servicing costs on both foreign and

domestic debt (domestic debt In most   countries   experienced a rise in interest

rates in response to the rise in world rates). It also provoked      capital
outflows and reserve losses in countries with fixed exchange rates (virtually

all of the developing countries at the time).      Exports dropped as world trade
slowed, and investments fell in response to higher interest rates. Thus

aggregate demand and employment tended to fall, at the same time that deficits
                                     —13-


were rising and foreign reserves were falling. The freedom of action for both

 onetary and fiscal policy was therefore extremely limited.

     In Asia, budget deficits were kept under control and exchange rates were

devalued after 1979 in response to these shocks (remarkably, Indonesia took a

preventative devaluation to spur non-oil exports In 1978, In the belief that

oil exports would remain weak). Starting from a diversified export base,

these policy changes in Asia caused a fairly quick rise in the region's export

volumes. Also, both policies helped these countries to avoid the problem of

capital flight, which tends to occur in anticipation of a currency

devaluation, an anticipation which in turn is naturally raised by large budget

deficits.

     In Latin America, the story Is almost the opposite. In almost all of the

countries concerned (certainly including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico,

Uruguay. and Venezuela) the exchange rate was allowed to become substantially

overvalued during 1979 to 1981, with the result that export growth in the

early 1980s was meagre. Brazil was the Important exception to the exchange

rate overvaluatlon, and It alone enjoyed an export boom between 1981 and 1984.

To the extent that the Latin American governments endeavoured to maintain

economic growth, they did so mainly through expansionary fiscal policy, which

exacerbated the budget deficits that were already bulging because of higher

interest payments on home and foreign debt. Money financing of the budget

deficits Increased in many countries, with the result of enormous capital

outflows and reserve losses during 1981 and 1982. After the reserves and

access to borrowing ran out In 1982, the continuation of money—financed

deficits led to sharp currency depreciations and an explosion of Inflation
                                             —14-


(with triple digit inflations in Argentina. Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, and now in

1986, Mexico).

       The data in Table 3 show    the differences     In real exchange rates of the

two regions (vis—a—vls the U.S.) during the          years building up to the crisis.

The   real   exchange rate is measured   here as the country's consumer price level

relative to the U.S. consumer price level, adjusted for exchange rate changes.

A value above 100 signIfies a real appreciation after 1978, Implying that the

country's goods and labor became relatively expensive in International

markets. The results of these exchange rate policies are reflected In the

superior export performance of the Asian economies:

C.     The   Collapse of Bank Lending in 1982
       The warning signs of impending crisis were everywhere in 1981, but were
virtually Ignored. World interest rates were at historic highs and
 international trade was stagnant. Several countries, Including Bolivia,
 Jamaica, Peru, Poland, and Turkey were already in serious debt difficulties by
 the end     of   1980. By the end of 1981. massive capital flight was occurring in
 Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, as unrealistic exchange rates came under attack,
 and as large domestic budget deficits (particularly In Argentina and Mexico)
 fed a rapid Increase in the money supply. According to one estimate, by the

     If the banks could be excused for their lending during 1973—79, It

is •uch harder to justify a veritable explosion of bank lending to Latin

America In the circumstances of 1980-82. Latin Americans by the thousands

were lining up at their local banks to take money out of their countries

during 1981 and 1982 at the same time that the commercial banks were

shovelling the money in. High ranking Mexican officials have recounted off

the record that at the end of 1981, MexIco had decided to undertake a

desperately needed devaluation, but was discouraged from doing so by a leading

New York bank, which assured the Mexican government that a large line of

credit would be available to the government to continue defend the prevailing

parity.

     Thus, as shown in Table 4, the net claims of International banks on

Mexico virtually doubled In the two years between end—'79 and end-'Bl, and the

net claims more than doubled for Argentina. The combined claims on the three

large debtors, Argentina. Brazil, and Mexico, almost exactly doubled in the

two—year period, increasing by $48 billion.        In Asia, only the   net   claims on

South Korea increased markedly, and   then from a much lower level than In Latin

America.

     By early 1982, the International commercial banks began to understand the

 longer—term implications of the rise in   world   interest rates and the     fall   In

export    growth rates. Projections of debt-export ratios prepared in these new
 international circumstances showed that the debt—export ratios of the

developing countries would rise rapidly in the near future unless these

countries shifted towards a trade surplus, something that was hard to imagine

at the time. Bank jitters were increased by the growing number of countries

with 'special' problems, such as Poland in 1981, and Argentina (at war In the

Falklands) in the Spring of 1982. Banks also came to appreciate the

possibility of a classic liquidity squeeze. Given the buildup of debt, and

the large share that was short term, the total debt servicing due in 1982

(including all short term debt, as well as amortizations and Interest on

medium and long—term debt), came to exceed 100 percent of exports in 1982 for

several Latin countries, though not for the Asian countries. Taking the

average debt service ratios for 1980-83 for the two regions, we see the

difference in Table 5. Thus, a cessation of new lending (including an

inability to roll over short term debts) would inevitably force the Latin

countries into a moratorium on debt servicing, even if all of exports were to

be used for that purpose!

     Mexico, of course, set off the global shock In 1982. In the beginning of

1982, Mexico finally devalued Its grossly overvalued currency, but then almost

immediately lost international confidence by giving a large public sector wage

increase as compensation for the devaluation. The budget deficit remained

enormous (an estimated 17.6 percent of GD!' in 1982), meaning that even the new

pegged level would soon become unsustainable. In the spring of 1982, Mexico

canvassed the banking community for a new large international loan, but

received a cool response. International reserves fell sharply throughout the

sprIng and summer, and the Mexican public speculated against the new exchange

 rate. Unable to win bank confidence under these unsettled circumstances, the

Mexican government took several remarkable steps in August, Including: a

freezing of dollar accounts in Mexican banks, a renewed depreciation of the

currency under a new dual-rate system, an Imposition of new exchange controls,

and most Important, a declaration of a temporary suspension of debt—service

payments. Soon thereafter, in a parting shot, outgoing Mexican President

Lopez Portillo nationalized the Mexican banks.

     These events of course stopped all new lending to Mexico, and the drop In

lending rapidly spread to the other debtor countries, especially in Latin

Aaerica. In quick response, more than a dozen debtor countries began

negotiations    with the banks and the official bilateral creditors on

rescheduling of debt payments for 1982 and 1983. The list of reschedulers

eventually ran up to more than forty countries.



III. The Creditor Response to the Debt Crisis


     So   far   we have   established, in rough terms, how the debt crisis arose.
Now we turn to the        international   policy response   to   the crisis itself. The

theme of this section is that a credit crisis poses certain key and

Identifiable needs for International coordination, and that to an important

extent, such needs were fulfilled by international policy coordination. The

style of International management was set first in the Mexican bailout of

1982, to which we     turn    first.


A.   The 1982 Mexican Bailout

     The events In Mexico prompted strong and almost Iediate actions in

support of Mexico from        the official   International financial cosunity, under
                                       -18—


the leadership of the U.S. government, especially the U.S. Treasury and the

Federal Reserve Board. Within days of Mexico's announcement of a suspension

in debt servicing, the following actions were taken: (1) the U.S. government

committed nearly $3 billion to Mexico, including $1 billion In prepayments for

oil purchases for the strategic petroleum reserve, $1 billion In finance of

agricultural exports to Mexico from the Commodity Credit Corporation, and a

$925 million bridge loan from the Federal Reserve Board; (2) the Bank for

International Settlements extended a bridge loan to Mexico of nearly $1

billion; (3) the export credit agencies of the leading creditor countries

agreed to Increase their lending to Mexico by $2 billion; and (4) talks got

underway   for a large IMF loan. By November   1982, the INF agreement was

reached,   providing for $3.1 billion of lending over three years. The IMF
agreement called for budget and monetary austerity in Mexico in view of the
country's   reduced access to foreign borrowing. In the following year, Mexico

rescheduled it debts with its official creditors in the Paris Club forum.

      The great novelty of the IMF agreement was to link the IMF financing to

new lending from Mexico's bank creditors. The IMF declared that it would put

new money into Mexico only if the existing bank creditors also increased their

loan exposure. The requisite agreement with the commercial banks took effect

in early 1983. The bank agreement called for a rescheduling of Mexico's

existing debts falling due between August 1982 and December 1984 (the term    of
the   IMF program), as well as a new loan of $5 billion, to be extended by the

existing banks In proportion to their existing exposure. The rescheduling

provided for continued and timely payments of interest on market terms on

Mexico's existing debts, and In fact the spread over LIBOR on Mexican debt was
                                    -19-


increased in the agreement. Thus, in present value terms there was no

sacrifice made by the banks In the debt rescheduling or in the new loan,

assuming that both would continue to be serviced.

     Moreover, under prevailing accounting conventions, the U.S. banks would

not have to show any loss at all under the rescheduling agreement, since what

is crucial for income accounting for the banks is the continued and timely

servicing of Interest on the loan, not principal. Indeed, the rise In spreads

on Mexico's rescheduled debts meant that the banks would report higher, not

lower, income as a result of the rescheduling operation. This concern of U.S.

bank accounting with the interest flow on bank claims, rather than with

changes in the underlying values of the claims, helps to explain the single-

minded concern In the bank agreements with a continued and timely servicing of

Interest: no Interest relief, then no loss of short—term profits.

     In the discussion that follows, I will use the terms "debt relief" or

"debt forgiveness" for arrangements that reduce In present value terms the

contractual obligations on debt repayments. The term "debt rescheduling" will

be taken to imply (as In the Mexican program) a postponement of repayments,

but one that maintains the present value of contractual debt servicing

obligations.


B.   Generalizing the Mexican Example

     The Mexican program was rather quickly Improvised, but It nevertheless

became the norm for the dozens of reschedulings that followed. Like the

Mexican program, virtually all of the debt restructurings have had the

following characteristics:
                                      —20-


     —-   The IME has made high—conditionality loans to the debtor QOvernment,

          always contingent on a rescheduling agreement being reached between

          the country and the commercial banks;

     ——   The commercial banks have rescheduled existing claims, by stretching

          out principal repayments, but without reducing the contractual

          present value of repayments;

     ——   The debtor countries have agreed to maintain timely servicing of

          interest payments on all commercial bank loans;

     ——   The banks have made their reschedulings contingent on an IMF

          agreement being in place;
     —-   The official creditors have rescheduled their claims in the Paris

          Club setting, and have also made such reschedulings contingent on an

          IMF agreement.

While it has been true that all bank reschedulings have preserved the

contractual present value of the banks' claims, only some of the rescheduling

agreements have involved concerted lending. The amounts involved in the

concerted lending dropped significantly in 1985, and revived only partially in

1986, entirely on the basis of a new loan to Mexico, as shown by the data of

Table 6. The fall off in concerted lending occurred not because of diminished

needs for such loans, but because the banks have strongly resisted new lending

in the past two years except in cases of when default appeared to be a

plausible alternative for the country in question (such as Mexico in 1986).

     In cases with concerted lending, the packages have followed the initial

Mexican pattern:

    —-   Explicit   backing for the loan by the IMF and U.S. government, often

         with pressure exerted on the banks by the U.S. Treasury and the IMF

         Managing Director;

    —-   A pro rata allocation of the new loan aong the existing banks, with

         a possible proviso excluding the smallest of the bank creditors;

    —-   A linkage of the bank loan to the debtor country's compliance with

         an IMF agreement.

     Zn addition to orchestrating the relationship between the debtor

countries and the banks, via the IMF, the creditor governments also confront

the debtor countries directly as official bilateral creditors, mainly through

export credit agencies. For the most heavily indebted countries, most

external debt (about three-fourths of the total) is owed to commercial banks

and other private creditors, but for many of the smaller debtors, especially

those with lower per capita income levels, •uch more than half of the debt has

been extended by official creditors, often at concessional terms.4 In

general, official lending to the heavily Indebted countries did not decline In

the years after 1982, though there is some hint in the data of a slowdown of

official bilateral lending in 1985 and after.

     Official bilateral debt (but not the debt of the multilateral

institutions) is rescheduled in the Paris Club setting. Paris Club

reschedulings differ from commercial bank reschedulings in two important ways.

First, reschedulings of debt In the Paris Club often represent a fort of

forgiveness, since some of the debt in question is already set at a

concessional interest rate. Second, the Paris Club does not object as a rule

to rescheduling part or all of the interest payments due, so.ething that is
                                     —22—


anathema to the commercial banks. This discrepancy is consistent with the

overall strategy of the creditor country governments, which is not to maximize

debt service payments by the debtor countries, but rather to protect the

servicing of Interest on the bank debt.

     The World Bank and the multilateral development banks (MOBs) are the

other major actors in the international management of the debt crisis, and

their role has been growing under pressure from the U.S. since 1985. The

World Bank has recently increased its lending to the heavily indebted

countries, with many loans now coming as part of an elaborate package

including IME, commercial bank, and creditor government loans (as in the 1986

Mexican package). The role for the World Bank is expanding under two

pressures. First, the direct lending of the IMF is somewhat constrained, as

many of the Important debtor countries are near their ceilings on drawings

from the IMF, and in fact will be net repayers to the IMF in the next three

years. Second, as the problems of the debtor countries are increasingly seen

as structural and medium term (rather than simplyreflecting a short- run

liquidity squeeze), the long-term development finance of the World Bank is

seen as increasingly relevant.

     One substantive change in World Bank lending since the onset of the debt

crisis is the shift from project lending to so—called policy—based lending.

In policy-based lending, money is made available to facilitate policy changes

on a sectoral or national level, mainly involving the liberalization of

internal and external markets. In March 1986, the World Bank Executive

Directors expressed support for a rise in policy-based lending to between 15

and 20 percent of all World Bank lending during 1986-1988, up from around 10
                                      —23—


percent in the early 19805. For the heavily indebted developing countries,

policy—based lending accounted for as much as 35 percent of all lending by the

World Bank to the countries during 1986. A second substantive change in World

Bank lending is the increasing resort to cofinancing arrangements with private

sector creditors, as a way to sti.ulate new private lending via new public

lending.

     The regional multilateral development banks (Asian Development Bank,

African Development Bank, Inter—*aerican Development Bank) are also attempting

to increase their lending to the heavily indebted countries in conjunction

with Increased World Bank lending. In fact, these MDBs have had great

difficulty in disbursing more loans In the past two years because 44DB lending

generally requires counterpart funding from the developing country itself,

much of which has been dropped from austerity budgets. In fact, despite the

extensive talk of increased public lending in recent years, the combined loans

of the World Bank and the multilateral development banks has grown rather

slowly since 1980. To the fifteen largest debtor countries, the net

disbursements per year hove risen from $2.1 billion in 1980 to $3.7 billion in

1985, a rather meagre Increase of $1.6 billion (see IMF International Capital

Markets, December 1986, pp. 74—81).



IV. The ConceDtual Basis of the Debt Management Strateav


     An interesting aspect of the management of the debt crisis is one thing

that did      happen: no leading official in the Reagan Administration or in

other leading creditor governments said that the crisis was a matter for the
                                     —24-


private markets only, with no role for the government intervention. From the

very first days of Mexico's August 1982 crisis until now, the U.S. government

has been deeply involved in managing the crisis. One reason for this

Involvement was gut fear. At the end of 1982. the LDC exposure of the nine

U.S. money center banks was $83.4 billion, or 287.7 percent of bank capital

(see Table 1). In Latin America alone, the exposure was 176.5 percent of bank

capital, and more than 70 percent of that was to Brazil and Mexico alone. It

seemed obvious that If the largest debtor countries unilaterally repudiated

their debt, then the largest U.S. banks could fail, with dire consequences

for the U.S. and world economy. The creditor governments therefore

recognized the Importance of continued debt servicing, and were willing to

provide official financing for that purpose. But the motivation for official

management of the crisis went deeper than fear, and that was the widely shared

assumption, anchored in the experience of the Great Depression, that one can't

simply "leave it to the markets" in the case of a financial crisis.

     The policymakers took the view that the debt crisis reflected a short— to

medium-term liquidity squeeze, rather than a fundamental problem of solvency.

It was felt from the beginning that if the debtor countries could be nursed

along for a few years without a breakdown of the system, they would enjoy an

economic recovery and be able to resume normal debt servicing, and normal

borrowing from the international capital markets. This conclusion, which must

be tested on a country by country basis (since there are clearly some

countries were solvency Is really at stake), has been reached by a number of

analysts, including dine (1984), Cohen (1985), and Feldstein (1986).

     For all of these analysts, the basic point is the sae. Since the debt

to a run (see Sachs 1984 for a more formal discussion of this point). This

kind of behavior is well recognized in the context of domestic bankruptcy law

(especially in corporate reorganization), which stops individual creditors

from collecting on their claims, and thereby enforces collective

decisionmaking by the creditors. In this sense, the IMP pressure for

concerted lending played some of the role of the bankruptcy code in a

corporate reorganization.

 Problem 2: The Overemphasis on the U.S. Money Center Banks

      Just as four countries represent "the debtor nations" in the minds of

 many policymakers, so too do nine U.S. banks represent the "world financial

 system". The U.S. bank debt is concentrated not only among countries, but

 also among banks, with the money—center banks holding the great bulk of the

 bc claims. At the end of March 1986, for example, the nine top U.S. banks

 held 65 percent of the LDC debt held by all U.S. banks, although the

 money-center banks accounted for only 40 percent of U.S.        bank capital. The

 money—center bank exposure In Latin America was 119.7 percent of capital,

 while for the rest of U.S. banks, the exposure was only 43 percent of bank

 capital. Thus, the risks to the U.S. banking system from the debt crisis can

 be isolated among a handful of banks, a fact which is often not appreciated in
                                     —37—


banks (and shortsighted) than comparable policies in other countries. The

banks can report high earnings and pay large dividends on the basis of their

LDC exposure even though future debt servicing Is In question. The U.S.

taxpayers thereby bear much of LDC risk (via potential claims on the FDIC in

the event of bank failures) while the banks continue to make dividend

payments. In other countries, the regulatory treatment of the debt seems to

be much more realistic. In Canada, for example, there have been forced

partial writedowns for 32 developing countries. In Europe. writedowns of debt

are encouraged by a system of hidden reserves   which are   given favorable tax

treatment. By all reports, which admittedly are difficult to verify in view

of the lack of published European data, the European banks have written off

far more of their LDC debts than have the U.S. banks, and are therefore in a

stronger position to handle any new shocks or any program of debt relief.

     The U.S. money center banks have sought, and obtained, by far the

greatest Influence of the international commercial banks in designing banking

policy vis-a—vis the problem debtor countries. The policy influence is felt

most directly in the bank steering committees that negotiate with the debtor

countries. As shown in Table 10, U.S. money center banks chair the bank

negotiating committees for all of the largest debtor countries, including

Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines (Bank of Tokyo co-chair),

and Venezuela (Lloyds Bank co—chair), and the U.S. banks have a plurality of

votes in the case of every debtor country shown In the table except for Cuba,

Madagascar, Morocco, Poland, and Rumania. No doubt the European and Japanese

banks find the hardline position of the U.S. banks a convenient one, since It

 has produced years of complete debt servicing by the largest debtors. But it

    able   to absorb a debt strategy that is more generous to the debtor countries.

           One of the ironies of the current situation is that while the U.S. banks

    have vociferously opposed greater writedowns of L.DC debt, and all plans
-

    involving   debt forgiveness, the market value of these banks has already

    declined in anticipation of future debt writeoffs.     The stock market puts a

    value on the commercial banks according to the values of the underlying assets

    and liabilities of those banks. Not surprisingly, the market appears to value

    the banks' claims on the problem debtor countries at much less than the face

    value of those claims, as seen by a decline in bank stock prices relative to

    the book values of the banks (see Kyle and Sachs (1984)). Evidence of

    depressed stock prices is fully consistent with the discounts on LDC debt that

    trade among the banks In a secondary market. Recent quotations (Salomon

    Brothers, December 1986) on LDC debt show the following bid prices (per $100

    of face value):

                           Argentina      66
                           Bolivia         7
                           Brazil         75
                           Chile          67
                           Mexico         56

                           Venezuela      74

           Thus, In a sense, a market writedown of LDC claims has already occurred.

    However, the debtor countries have enjoyed no benefit from this writedown

    (since it has not been matched by actual debt forgiveness), and the regulators

    have not forced the banks to bring reported earnings and dividends into line

    with these more realistic asset values.

    Problem 3:   The Instability of New Private Lending

         The bargain between debtors and creditors since 1982 has been clear: the

    debtor countries are to continue servicing the Interest on their bank, debts In

    return for a postponement of principal repayments, easy terms on official

    credits (both old and new), and new concerted lending from the commercial

    banks. The third leg of this strategy has been shaky in the past two years,

    despite the stated support for new lending from the U.S. government, In the

    context of the Baker Plan.

        Three things have happened. First, for reasons described earlier, the
-
    U.S. regional banks have been able to avoid their pro rata share of new

    lending, as have many European and Japanese banks. The burden of new debt

    servicing has (predictably) been left to those banks that are already most

    deeply exposed, since the lesser exposed banks are able to free ride. Second,

    the willingness of the large U.S. banks to engage In concerted lending has

    also waned. As was shown In Table 6, the amounts of money provided in

    concerted lending declined in 1985 and 1986 relatIve to the two previous

    years. In 1986, concerted lending' rebounded somewhat over 1985, but only

    because of loans to a single country, Mexico, and only after a bitter fight

    between the banks and the U.S. Treasury (a battle not yet completely over at

    the time of writing this paper). Third, while the concerted lending has

    provided some new money to the public sectors of the debtor countries, the

    private sectors have been net debt repayers, so that the banks are reducing

    their total exposures in the debtor countries even while their loans

    outstanding to the debtor country governments are rising.

         The result is an enormous breach between rhetoric and reality. During
                                     —40-


the year since the Baker Plan was unveiled, banking exposure has declined

sharply. A recent report of the 11W contained the stunning news that the in

the first half of 19B6, the developing countries repaid $7.1 billion (in

addition to making interest payments!), in contrast to a net borrowing of $9

billion in 1985, $15 billion in 1984, and $35 billion in 1983. (IMF Survey,

12/15/86) Among the 15 countries singled out by Baker for special attention

under the Baker Plan, bank exposure fell by $3.4 billion. Data showing the

decline in bank lending, by region of LDC borrower, is shown in Table 11.

     The 1986 bank settlement with Mexico, which included $6 billion of new

financing for Mexico over an 18 month period, might be seen as revitalizing

the process of concerted lending, but It Is just as likely to cause a backlash

against concerted lending, since •any of the banks deeply resented the

pressures to lend more to a collapsing Mexican economy, in which Inflation was

surging above 100 percent per year. As evidence for this resistance,

countries such as the Philippines which followed Mexico in the "queue' for

bank rescheduling, hit a stone wall at the banks, who were particularly

fearful of making the Mexican program into a precedent for other countries.

     Overall, the current method of involuntary lending is unsatisfactory for

two reasons. First, the amounts involved appear to be Insufficient to finance

renewed   growth In most of the debtor countries. Second, the amounts are
unstable year to year. Whenever an economy looks like It can survive a year
without new funds, the banks vociferously resist new lending. The lending

resumes only in the context of a renewed balance of payments crisis. This

kind of on—again, off—again lending greatly discourages Investments In the

debtor countries, sin'e Investors recognize that the debtor country will be

prone to balance of payments crisis for the foreseeable future.

Problem 4: Macroeconomic Oversimplifications in Conditionality

       Even under the best of circumstances, the return of a debtor country from

the financial brink Is difficult. Lenders and investors are wary of an

economy until a new and successful track record is established. New

industries •ust be developed to replace the declining sectors that were

previously fed by domestic demand, or that have suffered from the collapse of

International commodities prices. These difficulties usually require

significant time and luck (a resource discovery, a terms of trade improvement,

a rise In foreign demand), and can come unhinged from domestic political

unrest that follows in the wake of economic austerity. Moreover, the growth

of new sectors often requires substantial public sector investment to provide

the infrastructure (e.g. roads, energy, irrigation, etc.) to make the new

industries viable.

       One of the lesser recognized problems mentioned earlier is the fact that

the bulk of the external debt is heavily concentrated In the public sector, so

that the fiscal situation in .any debtor countries has retained devastated

even after the country's trade balance has improved. Thus, the debtor
                                                                                   -


economies have remained the victims of very high interest rates (when the

government deficit is bond financed), very high inflation (when money
financed), or   very inadequate public sector investments (when expenditures are
cut to make room for debt   servicing),    or a combination of all of these
afflictions.    Higher tax rev nues in    many of the debtor countries will be a
part   of a realistic solution to the continuing fiscal crisis. Remarkably,

however, the U.S. has recently opposed tax increases in the debtor countries

as a •atter of supply-side principle, almost regardless of the realities in
                                       —42—


the countries themselves. It Is also true that, politically and economically,

raising tax revenues during a recession is very hard, especially since the

contractionary effects of a tax increase may intensify the recession.

       The "official view" of the creditor Community (with the U.S.. the IMF,

and the World Bank In the lead) has simplified the macroeconomic picture by

arguing that drastic liberalization of tride and domestic markets will solve

the   problem of economic recovery. These pronouncements Ignore the problems
just   raised and are also ahistorical. The great successes of liberalization,

such as in Japan or Korea, have been affairs over the course of decades, not

months. Rapid liberalizations, as In the Southern Cone at the end of the

1970$, have more often than not failed. Moreover, strong government

intervention in the Asian miracle economies of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan,

appears to have fostered, rather than hindered, economic growth.


Problem 5: Underemphaslzing the Creditor Country Responsibilities

       The creditors have made much of the policy mistakes of the debtor

countries, and have stressed that recovery from the debt crisis will require a

change of behavior in those countries. This emphasis has some merit, we have

seen, since most of the debtor countries made serious policy mistakes in the

past decade. But the focus Is also seriously misleading, since it reduces the

much-needed scrutiny of the behavior of creditor countries as well. As noted

earlier, forty countries did not simultaneously fall into crisis because of a

virulent epidemic of bad behavior; rather, the shocks of macroeconomic

policies of the creditor governments also played a key role. Similarly, the

worsening of the debtor situation since 1985 Is not a result of debtor country
                                         —43-


 behavior,   but rather the collapse of commodities prices, which is a global

macroeconomic phenomenon.

        The leading governments have only recently begun to coordinate

macroeconomic policies in ways conducive to recovery from the debt crisis.

The Reagan Administration spent its first five years denying any

responsibility for high world interest rates, and renouncing any intention of

coordinating macroeconomic policies. That Is beginning to change, though the

enormous U.S. fiscal deficit, which continues to hold world interest rates at

unusually high levels (to the debtor country detriment), is only fitfully

being brought under control.

     Moreover, the U.S. and other creditor governments have successfully

divorced   discussions about the   debt strategy from   discussions about   their own
trade   policies.   It is an elementary proposition that rising LDC exports are a

key to a successful resolution of the debt crisis, and yet with increasing

frequency, trade actions by the U.S. and the Europeans work directly against

this imperative. As an example, the U.S. recently (1/2/87) cut the benefits

under the Generalized System of preferences for eight developing countries,

including the debtor countries Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Yugoslavia.

Similarly, voluntary restraints on steel exports into the U.S. instituted in

1984 resulted in a restriction on steel exports from many debtor countries,

most importantly Brazil and South Korea. in general, with worldwide trade in

agriculture, textiles, steel, and increasingly electronics, subject to

extensive protectionism and controls, it is extremely difficult and risky for

a debtor country to   embark on an aggressive export push as a way to climb out
of a debt crisis.

Problem 6: The Failure of Diplomacy

    The final problem that I shall raise is one of political style, rather

than economic substance: the diplomatic manner in which the debtor countries

have been dealt with in recent years, and the role of theseicountries in the

formulation of the debt management strategy. My point of reference is the

Marshall Plan, which had as one of its major ambitions the development of

political, as well as economic, stability in Europe after World War II. One

of the key aspects of the Marshall Plan was that the European nations were

required to work out a recovery plan on their own, and then to submit that

plan to the U.S. for review and financing. After much debate, the Senate

rejected Imposing strict conditionality in the program, arguing that it would

not be conducive to developing European support and dedication for their own

recovery program. In fact, the only specific condition imposed in the program

was the establishment of a joint and continuous European organization to

oversee the recovery effort.6

      In the case of the debt crisis, the developing countries have not been

 treated with such dignity, but rather as if they needed constant scolding from

 superior developed country brothers. This has been an extremely harmful

 aspect of the recovery process, with much time spent on fights between the

 debtor countries and the IMF, which has rather autocratically attempted to

 i.pose Its views in stabilization programs.   The bad will also spilled over

 Into the Baker Plan, which dictates a radical free market solution as the

 remedy for all of the debtor countries' problems.

      This attitude of the creditor countries Is particularly hard to

 understand In view of the fact that the debt crisis arose In most cases in
                                                —45—


 South America under autocratic
                                       military dictatorships that have since been
 replaced by legitimate and responsive democratic
                                                                governments.     Democracies
 have replaced military dictatorships in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador,

 Peru, and Uruguay, and in every one of those cases, the debt problem emerged

 under the previous military regime. In Asia, the same can be said about the

 Philippines. In     other   words, the most     important step towards        better
 government has already been taken.


 VI.    Some New Steps in Managing      the Debt Crisis

     The earlier discussion in this paper suggests that the debt management
has leaned too far in the direction of protecting the commercial banks, and
not far enough In promoting economiä growth in the debtor countries. Several
innovations in debt •anagement could be effective in promoting debtor
                                                                                        country
growth,    seemingly without posing major risks to the financial system. I will
discuss    three kinds of innovations, many of which have been debated in policy
circles    in the past couple of     years. First,      it has been suggested that       for
countries in the most extreme difficulties, there is a case for providing

partial debt relief. The present value of the
                                                          country's obligations would be
reduced    through one of a number of mechanisms mentioned later.                Second, for
most other debtor countries, there may be a case for increasing and

stabilizing the inflows      of   new capital, particularly in view of the fact that
the    concerted lending   process seems   to   be functioning poorly. Third, some          of
the    risks now faced   by debtor countries could be      shifts     onto the
internationai capital markets, to allow the            debtor   governments a greater
                                           -46—



ability   to meet   the   uncertainties of interest rates, the terms of trade,

protectionism, and growth in the industrial countries.

     These changes, which are discussed at greater length in a moment, could

be combined with other changes responsive to the problems identif led in the

previous section. Bank regulators might force a greater capitalization of

U.S. banks, and sore writeoffs, to cushion theni against losses on [DC debts

in the future. International macroeconomic coordination could        focus on the

trade   and interest rate linkages needed to overcome the crisis. Diplomacy

could enhance, rather than diminish, the stature of the new democracies of

Latin America.


A.      Partial end Selective Debt Relief

        Twenty years ago, policymakers would have been much more enthusiastic

about the case for selective debt forgiveness. In the generation after World

War II, policymakers in the creditor governments knew that the failure to

grant timely relief on International debt had severely weakened U.S. allies in

 the case of interallied war debts after World War I; had contributed      to the

 rise   of Hitler in the case of German reparations; and had contributed to the

 attractiveness of Peron's demagoguery in Argentina in the 1940s and 1950s.

 These considerations led the creditor governments to grant debt forgiveness to

 Indonesia as recently as 1970.

        Policymakers today fear debt relief because of its potential impact on

 the commercial banks. However, relief could be granted selectively and

 partially to a restricted group of debtor countries, in a way that would pose

 only minimal risks to the international financial system. One proposal,
                                     -.47—



suggested in Sachs (1986). would grant relief according to a formula that

gives relief to the countries that have experienced the largest declines in

per capita income in recent years (other criteria could be applied, such as

granting relief only to the poorest countries, or those that have experienced

the greatest terms of trade shocks, etc.). In order to minimize moral hazard

problems, it is recommended that the relief be granted only as part of an

internationally supervised program of stabilization and reform.

     In the specific Illustration in Sachs (1986), relief Is given In the form

of 5 years of complete forgiveness of Interest payments from debtor countries

that have suffered a drop in per capita GOP of 15 per cent or more since 1980.

In Latin America, this criterion Includes most of the debtor countries, but

Importantly excludes Brazil and Mexico, whose GDP decline has been less

severe. The suspension is to apply to all debts currently subject to

rescheduling by the commercial banks and by the official creditors In the

Paris Club. It turns out that the overall relief provided by U.S. banks to

five major Latin debtor countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay,

Venezuala) would total $6.6 billion In present value, and by all 815 banks,

19.1 billion. The forgiveness by U.S. banks would represent approximately

6.2% of bank capital. This 6.2% of bank capital Is much less than the market

writedowns of banks stocks that have already occurred!

     How could relief by the banks actually be effectuated? One way would be

through moral suasion of the creditor governments and the IMP, or even through

legislation. A different and Interesting way, suggested by Kenen (1983) and

Hatori (1985), would be through the Intermediation of a financial Institution

(either an existing Institution such as the World Bank, or a new one created
                                     -48-


for this purpose). In the Kenen—Hatori plan, the international entity would

issue a bond that is guaranteed by participating crditor governments, and

would swap the bond with the commercial banks for their LOC   claims.   The new

guaranteed bonds would have an Interest rate somewhat below the •arket rate,

and that lower rate would be passed along to the debtor countries. As in the

previous example, the reduction in interest rates could be tied to the extent

of deterioration of the debtor economy.

     This plan has two key desirable feature. First, the banks would be

relinquishing a risky income stream with a positive spread over LIBOR for a

safe asset with a negative spread. The improvement in the quality of the

banks' portfolio would be enough to justify such a swap to bank shareholders,

who might otherwise object to a straightforward writedown of debt.

Shareholder objections would be moot, since it is clear that the market is

already heavily discounting the value of LOC assets in the secondary •arket.

Second, the plan would offer debt relief with no direct cost to the creditor

governments (or their taxpayers). It would be self financing, in the sense

that the commercial bank shareholders would effectively be supplying the

relief.


B.   Increasing Net Capital Flows to the Debtor Countries

     Many countries do not need explicit relief. Rather, they require

Increased and steadier inflows of public and private capital. The question

here is how to generate the increased and steadier inflows, in view of the

fact that the commercial banks are reducing, rather than Increasing their

exposures. Most proposals for vast amounts of new official lending are
                                            —49—


non-starters, particularly in this period of budget austerity in the major

industrial countries. There will have to be a continued reliance on private

market lending to provide the needed capital, and the key to such lending is

to •ake new private lending safer, in one way or another, then the existing

stock of debt. There are several ways to do this. One coemon suggestion is

for •ore cot inancing of projects between          the   World Bank and the private

sector, thereby allowing the private lenders to piggyback on the seniority of

World Bank loans (which by convention are never rescheduled). A related

method would be to strengthen the insurance system for international

investments (such as the MbA).

       A different way    that   leads to the same outcome, but without the need for

any new official money, is proposed in Sachs (1986). In the proposal, an

explicit agreement among the existing creditors would allow the debtor country

to borrow a predetermined level of new funds that would be earmarked as senior

to the existing debt. In other words, all creditors would agree that the

specified new debt would be serviced in entirety before any of the existing

debt   is serviced. The new       lenders under   this arrangement would not have to be
banks. Senior lending could be made on the basis of marketable securities
purchased by asset funds, corporations, or private wealthholders. As with the
relief proposal, eligibility for seniority borrowing should be limited to
countries with poor economic performance, but not so poor as to trigger debt
relief. For example, eligibility might be given to countries that
have suffered a decline In per capita GDP during the 1980s.
       The multilateral   Institutions   would have several functions in this
proposal.   First, the IKE would reach an agrccacnt with the country on the
                                      —50-


amounts of incremental lending that will be raised on a senior basis.

Unlimited new   borrowing would not be allowed. Rather, the amount of senior
debt would be linked to growth targets in the debtor country, and the quality

of investment opportunities. The Fund would record and monitor the new senior

borrowing, and help to verify the senior treatment of the new debt. The World

Bank and the multilateral development banks would continue to play their

existing roles of defining and monitoring the investment programs of the

country, to support the effective utilization of the new borrowing.

     The proposed arrangement would have the virtue that new capital could be

provided to the debtor countries without having to make a judgement about the

eventual fate of the existing debt. If the debtor country resumes Its growth,

both old and new debts will be serviced.     If growth does not resume, the old

debts will be written off, which presumably would have happened anyway under

the current system of concerted lending. The proposal has both pluses and

minuses for the existing creditors. By agreeing to such a program, the banks

could suffer a reduction in value of their existing claims, but at the same

tl.e they would be freed from the obligation of involuntary lending, which now

puts the burden for new lending precisely on those banks whose portfolios are

already filled with the largest exposure in the debtor country. Additionally,

the value of the existing debt would be raised by this plan, not lowered, to

the extent that the new borrowing enhances the debt servicing capacity of the

country by more than the Interest cost of the new loans.

     The amounts of new senior borrowing might represent S or 7 percent of the

existing stock of debt each year for the next few years. This level would

eliminate the net resource transfers currently made by the debtor countries to
                                          —51—


the creditors. At this rate, for example, Mexico would accumulate

approximately $35 billion of new senior debt over the next 5 years. an amount

that could readily be raised by new market borrowing, since $35 billion of

debt could be easily serviced by Mexico in the future, as long as that $35

billion is serviced before any of the existing $100 billion of Mexican debt.


C.   Shifting Risks to the International Capital Markets

     So far, the international capital markets have done little to diversify

the profound economic risks facing the debtor countries.            Loan agreements

have few contingencies, for example, linking the level of repayments to the

state of the borrowing economy, its terms of trade, or any other indicators of

the borrowing country's economic wellbeing. Coodity linked bonds have never

gotten off the ground, for reasons that are not well understood by financial

specialists. Interest rate risk is borne entirely by the borrower, since

almost all debt is In the form of variable interest securities. The borrowers

also face the risks of credit cutoffs, with little possibility of obtaining

credit   co.mitments for future borrowing.
     It would seem that many of the risks facing the debtor countries could be
more efficiently diversified through more complex loan agreements. An initial
example is the   Mexican   accord reached in 1986, which contained two       important

Innovations. First, there was      a   link of new   financing (and of 11SF performance

criteria) to the   price   of oil: a drop in the price of oil raised the level of
funds to be   made available to Mexico, and a drop did the reverse.          In either
direction,   the change    in funding is gradually phased    out   over several
quarters,    so that eventually Mexico has to adjust to, and not sily finance,
                                     —52-


the changes In Its terms of trade. The second special facility is a growth

contingency loan, which allows Mexico to draw on more official and private

funding for increased government spending if for any reason, Its growth does

not meet the program targets during a fixed period. Given the complexity of

the determinants of growth in the short term, negotiators felt that it was

Impossible to write an even more elaborate contract which linked the "growth"

lending to changes in underlying conditions, even though the agreed terms

suffer from the moral hazard problem that self—Inflicted growth slowdowns are

also rewarded by new lending.

     There are several additional proposals that have been made in recent

years of a similar nature. Interest rate capping was widely discussed in

1984, before being dropped, but it remains a promising way for shielding the

debtor countries from some market risks. The debt—equity swap mechanism is

also partly a way to shed risks (and also partly a hidden mechanism for

partial debt forgiveness), by making the creditor take an equity position in

the debtor economy.   Finally, the mechanism of linking debt servicing

payments to the level of exports, as unilaterally adopted by Peru in Its

ceiling of debt servicing to 10 percent of exports, or to GUlP (as proposed by

Feldstein (1986)), is yet another way for shedding some of the risks of debt

servicing. Brazil, in a more consensual manner, is adopting the Peruvian

position in Its current debt negotiations, by seeking to limit net resource

transfers to its creditors to 2.5 percent of GUlP. Such a rule would

automatically alter the amounts of debt servicing according to market interest

rates and according to GUlP growth In Brazil.

VII. Conclusions


     The •anagenient of the LDC debt crisis since 1982 has been an important

example of successful international policy coordination.       At the time of the

outbreak of the Mexican debt crisis in the ster of 1982. many observers

feared that the crisis would provoke an international banking crisis, and a

global depression. Those fears have not come to pass, in large part because

of the active involvement of policymakers from the creditor countries, the

debtor countries, and the multilateral financial institutions.

     The origins of the debt crisis can be found both in the shift in the

global macroeconomic environment in the early 1980s and in major policy

mistakes   in   many   debtor countries. From a macroeconomic perspective, the
fundamental change In the global economy was the rise In interest rates to
levels exceeding the growth rate of exports of the debtor country. Once this

rise in interest rates occurred, the debt—export ratios of the debtor

countries could be stabilized only by a shift to trade balance surpluses in

the debtor countries, a shift which required deep and often painful

macroeconomic adjustments. Moreover, since most of the foreign borrowing had

been undertaken by the public sectors of the debtor countries, the shift in

interest rates also required sharp budget cuts in the public sector. For most

debtor countries, the long-term debt servicing prospects are not bleak, and it

Is realistic to expect over the long-term that needed adjustments to the trade

balance and the budgets can be made in most countries. These recent declines

 in global   interest rates greatly enhance the long-term prospects for a
successful resolution of the       crisis. Nonetheless, short—term difficulties
                                     —54—


could still easily derail a successful resolution of the crisis.

     Policymakers recognized three distinct roles for public Intervention in

managing the debt crisis. First, public authorities recognized that the

marketplace itself could not provide adequate enforcement of the existing debt

contracts. A complete hands—off attitude of the public authorities would

likely have resulted in widespread defaults by the debtor governments, with

adverse consequences for all parties concerned. Second, the policynakers

recognized that if left by itself, the loan market would likely provide

insufficient levels of new funding for the debtor countries.   There is an

inherent gap between the self—interest of individual banks, who want to pull

out willy-nilly from new lending, and the collective interest of all

creditors, that are best served by continuing to •ake new loans to the problem

debtor countries. Third, the policymakers recognized that there is a role for

the IMF to impose conditionality on debtor countries in return for new

lending, particularly in cases where misguided policies contributed to the

onset of the debt crisis.

     The public role was conceived with these problems in mind. Led by the

U.S. government, the creditor governments coalesced around a strategy that

included: (1) pressure on the debtor countries to •aintaln debt servicing;

(2) pressure on the coetercial banks to continue lending, in "involuntary"

lending packages; and (3) IMF conditionality as the cornerstone of new lending

a9reements. To a significant extent, this package has forestalled widespread

defaults, and has prevented the worst fears of 1982 from coning to pass.

     There continue to be serious problems, however, with the implementation

of this strategy. First, the pressure to maintain debt servicing payments has
                                         —55—


been carried to a point of absurdity, so that even countries in        the   midst of

50,000 percent hyperinflatlons, or free falls of income, have been pressed to

maintain debt servicing. Second, the pressure on commercial banks to continue

lending has waxed and waned. Involuntary lending has proved to be too little

and too   unstable   a financial basis for economic   recovery   in most of the debtor

countries. Third, the contents of conditionality have been oversimplified,

with the IPIF and the World Bank pressing for mediate liberalization as the

key to recovery in the debtor countries, contrary to logic and historical

experience. This has led to a backlash from the debtor countries, that

strongly resist such simple and politically dangerous prescriptions.

     Several recommendations were discussed in this paper as possible remedies

to these shortcomings. The recommendations revolved around three areas:

partial debt relief; stabilized capital Inflows; and a shifting of risks now

borne by th. debtor countries to the international capital markets. It was

suggested that partial debt relief would not have to pose profound risks for

the international system, and that such relief could be targeted to the

countries most in need. With respect to new capital inflows, a proposal for

new senior lending to the debtor countries was broached, with the aim of

stabilizing and Increasing the size of capital inflows into the debtor

countries. Finally, various proposals were discussed that aim at shifting

risks from the debtor countries to the international financial markets, such

as interest rate capping and commodity—linked lending.

1.   The top ten debtor countries in 1983 ranked by gross external debt to BIS

banks were Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Korea, Venezuela, Philippines,

Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Egypt. and Chile, of which Mexico, Venezuela,

Indonesia, and Egypt are oil exporters, and Argentina is approximately

self—sufficient. Oil exports exceed oil imports for this group of countries

as a whole.

2.   A country that borrows the aoney it needs to make its debt service

payments will have its debt grow at the rate of Interest (e.g. with interest

rates at 10 percent, a country that borrows Its debt servicing bill will see

its total debt grow by 10 percent per year).    As long as that interest rate

is equal to or less than the growth rate of export earnings, then the

debt—export ratio will be stable or falling.

5.   The analytical oversimplifications tend to come in several places, as

.entioned later in the text. First, in order to service the country's debts,

GNP must be in an acceptable form, specifically, In the form of export

earnings. However, as economies shift from domestic production to exports,

measured GNP •ay well decline in the short run to intermediate run. Second,

since the debts are generally owed by the public sectors of the debtor
                                          —57.-



countries, debtor governments must raise taxes or cut spending in order to

service the debts. Such fiscal actions will tend to exacerbate •any

•acroeconomic problems, such as unemployment and recession. Third, private

investors are likely to shun economies suffering from debt crises, thus

undermining the economic      growth that is counted upon to facilitate future debt
servicing.
