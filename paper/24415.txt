                                           ABSTRACT

"Intermediary asset pricing'' understands asset prices and risk premia through the lens of frictions
in financial intermediation. Perhaps motivated by phenomena in the financial crisis, intermediary
asset pricing has been one of the fastest growing areas of research in finance. This article explains
the theory behind intermediary asset pricing and in particular how it is different from other
approaches to asset pricing. The article also covers selective empirical evidence in favor of
intermediary asset pricing.

1     Introduction
This paper aims to introduce a reader to the growing literature on “intermediary asset
pricing" that links movements in asset prices and risk premia to frictions in financial inter-
mediation. In classical approaches to asset pricing, as presented in the well-known paper by
Fama [1980], intermediaries satisfy the assumptions of the Modigliani-Miller theorem and
are a “veil." Asset prices reflect the tastes and shocks of the households who may invest in
asset markets through intermediaries, but are the ultimate owners of all assets. However,
the performance of many asset markets – e.g., prices of mortgage-backed securities, corpo-
rate bonds, derivative securities, etc. – depend on the financial health of the intermediary
sector, broadly defined to include traditional commercial banks as well as investment banks
and hedge funds. The 2008 financial crisis and the 1998 hedge-fund crisis are two com-
pelling data points in support of this claim. Phenomena in the recent crisis in particular
have called into question the veil hypothesis and motivated the study of intermediary asset
pricing.
    Our article clarifies the theoretical underpinnings of intermediary asset pricing. What
does it take to break the veil hypothesis and justify an intermediary pricing kernel? It is
commonplace to argue for intermediary asset pricing in certain markets by asserting that
because trade is dominated by intermediaries, they must be marginal. But any asset-holder
not at a corner in her portfolio choice is marginal. So what is the content of intermediary
asset pricing and does intermediary asset pricing refute traditional consumption-based asset
pricing? We provides answers to these questions in the first part of the paper, which builds
a simple intermediary asset pricing model.
    The second part of the paper reviews a small group of papers that are evidence in
favor of intermediary asset pricing. The paper review is not exhaustive. Our purpose is
to highlight different approaches to testing intermediary asset pricing theories and discuss
the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches.
    Our paper is an introduction to intermediary asset pricing that can be understood by
anyone who has completed the first-year of graduate level work in finance. It is not a
comprehensive survey of the area. For a survey on asset market illiquidity and financial

crises see Amihud et al. [2012]. There are connections between intermediary frictions and
macroeconomics that are important and interesting but omitted in this article. Brun-
nermeier et al. [2013] is a survey of financial frictions and macroeconomic activity. Two
influential papers that make the case for intermediary asset pricing are Franklin Allen’s
2001 presidential address to the American Finance Association (Allen [2001]) and Darrell
Duffie’s 2010 presidential address to the same body (Duffie [2010]).



2         Theory
The basic ingredients needed to have a well defined model of intermediary asset pricing are
as follows: There is an intermediary sector and a household sector. The household sector,
or some part of the sector, does not directly invest in some "intermediated" assets. Instead
they delegate their investments in these assets to the intermediary sector. Contracting
frictions in the intermediary mean that such delegation is not a veil. This leads to a pricing
expression for the intermediated assets that depends on intermediary frictions, and drives
a wedge between the household and intermediary valuation of assets.
        A central assumption is that there is limited participation by the households in a set
of assets. This assumption implies that households will not be marginal in pricing these
assets. In other words, as we show more formally, their Euler equation will not apply to
the pricing of intermediated assets, which opens the door to studying intermediary asset
pricing. We can motivate this assumption in two ways. It may be that households lack the
knowledge necessary to invest in complex assets (e.g., credit-card asset backed securities)
and hence delegate investments to the intermediary. This will be the leading motivation
for our article. But, the assumption, albeit in a different form, may also apply in markets
that the households have some knowledge, such as the equity market. In these markets, we
note that many investors evaluate their consumption and portfolio holdings decisions only
infrequently. If households rebalance in a coordinated fashion, say at the end of the tax
year, then a standard representative agent consumption CAPM may apply only on these
infrequent dates (as documented by Jagannathan and Wang [2007]), but not all dates.1 In
    1
        Jagannathan and Wang [2007] show that the consumption CAPM holds for December-December equity


                                                    3
contrast, since intermediaries are marginal at all dates, intermediary pricing will apply at
all dates, with there being a wedge at some dates. The wedge may be higher at some times
and for some assets. We clarify these points in the formal model.
    Last, as suggested by our motivation of limited participation of households in complex
assets markets or annual portfolio rebalancing of households, the intermediary asset pricing
phenomena we are concerned with may persist for many months, or even years. Household
Euler equations may not apply for long periods of time. We are concerned not with the high-
frequency asset price swings of market micro-structure research, but much lower frequency
phenomena. The empirical evidence in Section 3 shows this point.


2.1     Model

We consider a two period (t = 0, 1) Constant-Absolute-Risk-Aversion (CARA) normal
model with only one risky asset. Later we extend the model to the multi-asset case. The
                     f ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ) per share at date 1. The exogenous gross interest rate
risky asset pays out D
is 1 + r. The aggregate supply of the risky asset is θ.
    There is a unit mass of two classes of identical agents: intermediary managers (indicated
by M ) and households (indicated by H). Both agents have CARA preferences over their
date-1 wealth. We denote the risk tolerance of managers as ρM (inverse of the coefficient of
absolute risk aversion) and the risk tolerance of households as ρH . Thus, agents maximize
the objective
                                                            Wi
                                                           (        )
                                              
                                      ui W1i       = − exp − 1 ,
                                                            ρi
with i ∈ {H, M } and W1i denoting the end-of-date-1 wealth.
    By assumption, the households cannot directly invest in the market for the risky asset
at date 0. For example, the risky asset may be credit-card asset-backed securities which
requires specialized knowledge to value. Intermediary managers have the know-how to
invest in these assets. This creates scope for intermediation. Households can give some of
the wealth to intermediary managers who invest in the risky asset on their behalf. Later,
we extend the model to include sophisticated households who are able to invest directly in
returns. See also Abel et al. [2013] for a model of infrequent portfolio choices.

the risky asset and bypass intermediaries.


2.2    Principal-agent problem

We assume that intermediation is not frictionless. Following He and Krishnamurthy [2012,
2013], we assume that households can contract with managers to invest on their behalf in
the risky asset but subject to a moral hazard friction. Frictions in intermediation are central
to intermediary asset pricing and distinguish the approach from models with heterogeneous
agents such as Dumas [1989] and Wang [1996] where agents differ in their risk aversion but
otherwise trade in markets that are complete and frictionless. We discuss the difference
further below.
   A manager in an intermediary chooses the quantity of risky assets to buy, xF , as well
as a due diligence decision when making investments, s ∈ {0, 1}. If the manager chooses to
“shirk," setting s = 0, the intermediary return falls by ∆ and the manager gains a private
benefit of b. We can think of shirking as capturing actions such as trading inefficiently
in a manner that reduces the fund’s return. Throughout our analysis, we assume that
parameters are such it is optimal to write a contract that prevents shirking (i.e., shirking
is socially costly). Households cannot directly observe the due diligence action and must
provide incentives to the manager to not shirk. We assume that households and managers
sign an affine contract parameterized by (K, φ) where φ is a the linear share of the return
generated by the fund that is paid to the manager, and K is a management fee paid
by households to managers, which is independent of the fund’s return. In general, K
will depend on the market protocols according to which households and managers form
intermediaries. For example, if this is a search market, then K will be affected by bargaining
powers of the parties; while if it is in a Walrasian market, K is set based on the supply
of intermediary managers. He and Krishnamurthy [2012, 2013] investigate these different
cases. In our CARA setting, the lack of wealth effect implies that the fee K plays no role
in asset demands and equilibrium prices. We therefore dispense with K, setting it to zero
without loss of generality.




                                              5
   A manager with contract (φ) solves,
                                 (                                                  )
                              1 h  f                       i
                 max − exp −     φ xF D − (1 + r) p − s∆ + s b
               xF ,s∈{0,1}   ρM

which, since D
             f is normally distributed, is equivalent to the following standard mean-

variance optimization:

                                                                x2F φ2 σ 2
                      max       φ {xF [µ − p (1 + r)] − s∆} −              + s b.         (1)
                    F
                   x ,s∈{0,1}                                     2ρM



The first term is the expected excess return on purchasing xF units of the risky asset and
receiving a share φ of this expected return. The asset pays a mean dividend of µ and is
purchased at price p. The one period interest rate is 1 + r. If the manager shirks, the fund’s
return falls by ∆. The second term is the penalty for risk, which is proportional to the
variance of the payoff to the risky asset investment, and inversely proportional to ρM , the
risk tolerance of the manager. These terms are all familiar from the textbook treatment of
portfolio choice in the CARA-normal setting. The last term captures the manager’s private
benefit from shirking due to moral hazard.


2.3    Incentive compatibility and equity capital constraint

This section derives an equity capital constraint that arises from the incentive compatibility
constraint in the above contracting problem. The manager’s effective holdings of the risky
asset when the manager chooses xF and receives a share of the fund’s return of φ is,


                                           xM = φxF ,                                     (2)


while the household’s effective holdings are,


                                        xH = xF (1 − φ) .                                 (3)




                                                6
We can interpret these effective holdings in terms of the financing of an intermediary. The
manager and household set up an intermediary with each contributing a fraction of the
intermediary’s equity capital. For each φ dollars the manager puts in, the household-
investor puts in 1 − φ dollars; or, equivalently, for each one dollar the manager puts in,
                                 1−φ
the household investors put in    φ
                                       dollars. The manager and investors share in the return
generated by the intermediary, proportional to their ownership of the equity of the fund.
   The incentive compatibility constraint to implement working (s = 0) in problem (1) is,

                                                        b
                                       φ∆ ≥ b ⇒ φ ≥       .                               (4)
                                                        ∆

In words, managers have to own a sufficiently large equity share of the intermediary to
retain incentives not to shirk. Define,

                                          1 − b/∆   ∆
                                   m≡             =   − 1.
                                            b/∆     b

Then m is the maximum amount of dollars of outside equity that investors are willing to
purchase in an intermediary per dollar of equity that the manager purchases. If m is high
(i.e. b is low indicating a small agency friction), the manager can be incentivized with a
small φ, i.e., with only a little “skin in the game."
   The above discussion implies that we can write the incentive compatibility constraint
equivalently as an equity capital constraint,

                                                 1
                                           φ≥       .                                     (5)
                                                1+m

From now on we will refer to the primitive incentive compatibility constraint as an equity
capital constraint.


2.4    Equilibrium asset price

We now derive equilibrium asset prices. It useful to first do so in a frictionless economy so
as to understand the effect of frictions. Suppose that households could fully participate in


                                                7
the risky asset market. Their demand for the risky asset is

                                               µ − p (1 + r)
                                     xH = ρH                 ,
                                                    σ2

and market clearing requires that,


                                          xH + xM = θ.


Solving we find that,
                                       µ      1     θσ 2
                               p=         −       ·      .                                     (6)
                                     1 + r ρH + ρM 1 + r
   In our model with frictions, given the equity fraction φ to be determined endogenously
shortly, the optimal portfolio solution xF to the manager’s problem in (1) satisfies (recall
Eq. (2)),
                                                    µ − p (1 + r)
                               φxF = xM = ρM                      .                            (7)
                                                         σ2
Given this choice of xM , the household’s effective (i.e. via his investment in the intermedi-
ary) holding of the risky asset is

                                               1 − φ µ − p (1 + r)
                         xH = xF (1 − φ) =          ρM             .                           (8)
                                                 φ        σ2

And the same market clearing condition implies that

                                            µ    φ   θσ 2
                                     p=        −   ·      .                                    (9)
                                          1 + r ρM 1 + r

Comparing (9) with (6), we see that the frictionless economy requires an equity share of

                                                 ρM
                                          φ=           .                                      (10)
                                               ρM + ρH

This is intuitive. In the frictionless benchmark, each agent group owns risky asset according
                                                      ρM
to their risk tolerances, with managers owning      ρM +ρH
                                                             of the risky asset. In the equilibrium
of frictionless benchmark, both agents’ risk tolerance parameters determine the asset price



                                                8
as in Equation (6).
   To understand the impact of the frictions, suppose that ρM is low relative to ρH ; in
other words, managers are relatively risk averse. Then, with moral hazard, we see that the
frictionless equity share may violate the equity constraint in (5),

                                                ρM       1
                                       φ=             ≥     .
                                              ρM + ρH   1+m

That is, the frictionless risk allocation may not be achievable given the incentive compati-
bility constraint implied by the moral hazard friction. Rearranging, we say that when

                                                          ρH
                                                 m≥          ,                             (11)
                                                          ρM

intermediation is a veil. When this condition is violated, intermediation is not a veil and
intermediary financing frictions affect asset prices. These results are summarized in the
following Proposition.

discount which is proportional to asset supply, θ, and risk, σ 2 . From the first line, we see
that when m is small, intermediary frictions are tight and the risk discount is large and
increasing in the intermediary frictions (i.e., falling m). From the second line, we see that
when m is large enough, intermediary frictions do not affect prices.


2.5    Intermediation shocks

In the world, shocks to intermediation may affect asset prices. Such shocks can be de-
creases in intermediary capital caused by losses or investor withdrawals or increases in the
complexity of intermediary investments which increase the moral hazard friction. There


                                                      9
is considerable empirical evidence (which we review in Section 3) that such effects were
present in the financial crisis. Indeed, the model implies that shocks to intermediation
should especially affect asset prices during financial crises. To see this, take the case of an
increase in moral hazard, corresponding to a decrease in m. During the crisis, given the
complexity of investment environment it is likely that delegation became harder, increasing
                                                                                                          ρH
b and hence decreasing m. A decrease in m lowers the risk asset price p only if m ≤                       ρM
                                                                                               ρH
so that equity constraint binds. When m is high (i.e., b is small) so that m >                 ρM
                                                                                                  ,   changes
in m have no effect on p. This non-linearity is a central feature of the intermediary asset
pricing model of He and Krishnamurthy [2012, 2013].2 Indeed it is one clear distinction
between the intermediary pricing model and the two-agent model of Dumas [1989]. From
Proposition 1 when m is very large (no frictions) we see that the asset price reflects the
average risk tolerance of agents in the economy. In a two-agent model such as Dumas [1989]
this average risk tolerance is a function of the relative wealth of the two agents in the econ-
omy, which is a slow-moving state variable. There is no notion of a constraint so that the
mechanism linking relative wealth and asset returns works in the same manner throughout
the state space, rather than particularly sharply in some parts of the state space. Thus,
this approach does not lead to the non-linearity which is evidently a feature of financial
crises. Additionally, phenomena such as increases in moral hazard or complexity of assets
play no role in such a model.
       He and Krishnamurthy [2012, 2013] show that shocks to the manager’s wealth, which can
be interpreted as capital shocks, impact asset prices in a non-linear fashion. Capital shocks
have no role in the present analysis because agents have CARA utility and wealth effects
are absent. In a Constant-Relative-Risk-Aversion (CRRA) preference model we will have
such effects, and we can see how such effects work by considering a local approximation.

The agent’s absolute risk aversion,        ρM
                                              ,   is related to the coefficient of relative risk aversion,
   2
    Models such as Allen and Gale [1994] which mix segmentation and cash-in-the-market pricing deliver
the non-linearity and have been useful frameworks to understand financial crises (see Allen and Gale
[1998]). But these models do not connect to the empirical asset pricing evidence we discuss in Section 4.
In particular, the evidence regards variation in the cross-section of asset returns and ties such variation to
an intermediary stochastic discount factor. Under the cash-in-the-market pricing model of Allen and Gale
[1994], there is no variation in the cross-section of expected returns across intermediated assets.

A fall in WM translates to a fall in ρM . Then from our analysis of the CARA model, such
a change will lead the equilibrium asset price p to fall. While this wealth effect will be
present both when intermediation is constrained and when it is not, the effect is larger
when intermediation is constrained.
   More formally, we can see the wealth effects as follows. When the equity constraint
binds, the Sharpe ratio of the asset, denoted by SR, is given by

In fact, we can relate the Sharpe ratio to the coefficient of relative risk aversion as,

           SR =                                                    θσ/(1 + m)

Here W0,M represents the date 0 wealth of the manager, which is invested in the equity of
the intermediary, and W0,I is the date 0 total capital of the intermediary, which is equal
to W0,M (1 + m) when the equity constraint binds. The date-0 capital of the intermediary
is W0,I = θp, since the intermediary purchases all of the risky asset. The second equation
clarifies that the price of risk is the coefficient of relative risk aversion of the marginal agent,
multiplied by the volatility of the marginal agent’s wealth return.


2.6    Regulatory capital

In practice, financial intermediaries face regulatory capital constraints that may affect
their demand for assets and impact asset prices. The effects of these type of constraints
are similar to the wealth effects we have discussed. Whether or not they affect asset prices

                                                             11
depends on financing frictions and whether intermediaries are a veil. The effects of shocks
to capital are non-linear and depend on whether or not capital constraints bind.3
       To see these points, we extend our model. We have noted that the key incentive
compatibility constraint (4) of the model can be interpreted in terms of the equity financing
of an intermediary. The manager and household set up an intermediary by each contributing
a fraction of the intermediary’s capital. For each one dollar the manager puts in, the
                                                    1−φ
household investors put in at most m =               φ
                                                            dollars, so that the manager’s equity share φ
never falls below 1/ (1 + m) as in (5).
       Suppose that a manager has wealth of WM with which he invests in the intermediary as
equity. The total equity capital of an intermediary is EF , subject to the equity constraint
derived above,
                                             EF ≤ WM (1 + m).                                            (13)

Suppose an intermediary purchases the risky asset and makes some commercial loans of L to
an unmodeled corporate sector. The portfolio is subject to a regulatory capital constraint,


                                         kx · pxF + kL · xL ≤ EF ,                                       (14)


where kx and kL correspond to the capital charges on the risky asset and on loans in the
spirit of Basel risk-based capital requirements.4 Denote the Lagrange multiplier on (14) by
λRC ≥ 0.
       Putting these two constraints in (13) and (14) together, we have


                              kx · pxF + kL xL ≤            EF     ≤ WM (1 + m)              .           (15)
                            regulatory capital constraint        equity capital constraint


       It is important to note that the capital requirement binds (i.e., the first inequality in
   3
      It should be evident that the two-agent approach of, e.g., Dumas [1989], cannot speak to these reg-
ulatory capital effects. If an intermediaryâĂŹs regulatory capital constraint binds, but intermediation is
frictionless so the Modigliani-Miller theorem applies, the intermediary would raise more equity capital and
adjust its capital structure so that the constraint is slack.
    4
      One can think of the regulator as a principal, who, like the household, has a payoff that is tied to the
manager’s portfolio decisions. For example, the regulator may be concerned with a default externality and
hence wants to limit intermediary risk and leverage. Then the regulatory constraint is also an incentive
compatibility constraint on the manager, that can be loosened if the manager has more equity capital.


                                                        12
(15)) only if the equity constraint binds (i.e., the second inequality in (15)). In other
                                        1
words, λRC > 0 only when φ =           1+m
                                             so that the equity constraint (5) binds. If the equity
constraint remains slack, then intermediaries can raise equity capital from households to
fund the investment in the risky asset, and households are willing to do so as long as the
delegated investment in the risky asset is profitable. As a result, if the equity constraint is
slack, no constraints will bind and we will again find that intermediation is a veil.
       The manager of the intermediary chooses holdings of the risky asset to maximize his
objective subject to (14). The optimization over xF is,5

                                                        φσ 2 2
                         max xF (µ − p (1 + r)) −           x − λRC · kx · xF p
                          xF                            2ρM F

Recall λRC ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier on the capital constraint, (14), i.e., the return on
equity of the intermediary. By purchasing a unit of the risky asset, if the constraint already
binds, then the intermediary needs to scale back a profitable loan to free-up regulatory
capital by kx · xF p.
       This optimization problem gives,

                               φσ 2                          ρM
            µ − p (1 + r) −         xF − λRC kx p = 0 ⇒ xF =      [µ − p (1 + r + λRC kx )]
                               ρM                            φσ 2

Imposing market clearing, we find the equilibrium price,

                                          µ               φσ 2 θ

       The supplementary leverage ratio requirement (SLR), which is not risk-based, corre-
sponds to a requirement where kx (= kL ) is constant and independent of asset character-
istics. We see that in this case a tighter capital constraint (a higher λRC ) amounts to an
increase of the discount rate on the risky asset.
       In the case of a risk-based capital requirement, kx is proportional to risk, i.e. kx = k × σ
   5
   We are suppressing the optimization over xL as it only plays a role in our analysis via its influence on
λRC .

for some positive constant k > 0. For relatively small σ, the price expression allows for the
following approximation
                                                                 !

                                             1 + r (1 + r)ρM

so that the equilibrium asset price reflects an additional compensation for risk.
   Finally, we have shown that the equilibrium price is affected by the capital requirement
(λRC > 0) only if the equity capital constraint binds. Moreover, as the Lagrange multiplier
λRC on the regulatory capital constraint should increase with losses in equity capital EF ,
the model extension with regulatory capital also implies non-linear effects of shocks to
capital for asset prices.


2.7       Multiple assets and households

We return to the basic model without the regulatory capital constraint, and instead in-
troduce a second asset into the model; it is straighforward to generalize to N assets. As-
                                                        
                                       f ∼ N µ , σ 2 . For simplicity, we assume that
set j ∈ {1, 2} has date-1 risky payoff Dj     j   j
            
Cov D  f = 0. We assume that households can participate in asset market 2 but must
    f ,D
     1  2

go through intermediaries to invest in asset market 1. For example, asset market 1 is credit
card asset-backed securities and asset market 2 is the S&P500 index. Mapping to our model
which puts underlying agency fictions at the asset level, another equivalent interpretation
is that asset 1, potentially due to its sophisticated nature, has a relatively high agency
friction b1 which gives rise to a low m1 , while there is much less (or zero) agency friction
in asset 2 (and hence an arbitrary high m2 ).
   We also introduce a third class of agents, sophisticated households, who have CARA
utility with risk tolerance ρS . We assume these households can fully participate in all asset
markets, but unlike managers they cannot set up intermediaries. Denote the demand of
asset j ∈ {1, 2} by agent i ∈ {H, S, M } as xji .
   In our CARA-Normal framework, independent payoff distributions imply independent
demand system for each asset, and one can easily derive the equilibrium asset prices as
presented in the following proposition. More importantly, the comparative statics results

                                               14
with respect to m, capital, and the non-linear effects we have described continue to hold
in the equilibrium with two assets.

                                                                                      ρH
Proposition 2 Suppose that the intermediation constraint binds, i.e., m1 <            ρM

market equilibrium is:

                            p1 =        −                             ,                           (17)

                            p2   =      −                        .                                (18)
                                   1 + r (1 + r) (ρS + ρH + ρM )

    The two asset case illustrates one approach to testing intermediary asset pricing. Sup-
pose that we have two similar assets, one of which is intermediated (asset 1) and one which
is not (asset 2); and we construct the spread p1 − p2 . Suppose further that one can credibly
identify a shock that increases intermediation frictions (decrease in m1 or ρM ). Then, the
spread p1 − p2 should rise after this shock. This difference-in-difference strategy has been
employed in a number of empirical papers documenting intermediary asset pricing effects
in the crisis. We discuss some of these papers in Section 3.


2.8     Degree of intermediation

We next describe how assets that are more intermediated will be affected by intermediary
frictions. Suppose that the mass of the sophisticated households is S. We have derived
price expressions for the case of S = 1, but it is straightforward to generalize the formulae.
When the intermediary constraint binds, the risk premium on asset 1 which is denoted by
Π1 (m1 , θ1 , S) is:

                                                                     θ1 σ12

                                                            − 1. As noted, an increase in m1 reduces
the intermediation friction, which reduces the risk premium:

                                            =−                        < 0.

                                                  15
   We highlight a further comparative static. Asset 1 is held by both intermediaries and
sophisticated households. We will say the asset is more intermediated if the share held by
intermediaries is higher, and we vary S to illustrate the effect. A larger S means that more
sophisticated households hold asset 1, which implies that intermediaries hold less of the
asset. Then we have

                               ∂ 2 Π1 (m1 , θ1 , S)        2θ1 σ12 ρM ρS
                                                    =                        > 0.
                                    ∂m1 ∂S            [(1 + m1 ) ρM + SρS ]3

As S rises (less intermediated asset), the sensitivity of the asset premium to the interme-
                     ∂Π1 (m1 ,θ1 ,S)
diation friction          ∂m1
                                     ,   which is negative, is dampened.
   As an example, both intermediaries and sophisticated households trade equities. But,
intermediaries are a more significant player in the equity options market than the equity
market. Thus, we would expect to see that a shock to intermediation would have a larger
impact on equity options than equities. As the next section illustrates, this translates to a
higher beta for equity options than equities, all else equal.


2.9     Euler equation tests

We next show that one can use the first-order-conditions of the agents to express the
expected return on asset j in the standard λβj form, where λ is the price of risk associated
with a risk factor and βj is the loading of asset-j on the risk factor. A number of papers
in the empirical literature construct an intermediary stochastic discount factor (SDF) and
show that this factor successfully prices asset returns. Our analysis clarifies the manner in
which these papers test intermediary asset pricing theory.
   The intermediary managers are marginal investors in both asset 1 and asset 2 so that
                                                                                ρM θ1

   These expressions are intuitive. The risk premium is proportional to the inverse of the
risk tolerance of the manager ( ρ1M ), the variance of the manager’s wealth, and the beta
of asset-j (βjM ) with respect to the manager’s wealth. That is, a CAPM holds with the
manager’s wealth as the market factor, with the price of risk being denoted by λM in the
above expressions.
   What is the content of tests of an “intermediary SDF"? We see from these formulae
that an intermediary SDF should price all assets. But this will be true whether or not
intermediary constraints bind. The real bite of these tests is in β1M versus β2M . Comparing
the numerators of the beta expressions, we see that a binding intermediary constraint



                                                        17
increases β1M relative to β2M . That is, all else equal, more intermediated assets should have
a higher beta with respect to the intermediary factor than non-intermediated assets. These
effects are increasing in the strength of intermediary frictions (i.e., as m1 falls, β1M rises).

   Next consider the pricing expressions for sophisticated households. These households
trade both asset 1 and asset 2, and we should expect that a λβj -pricing formula similar to
the intermediary one should apply in this case as well, but with sophisticated household
wealth as the market factor. After some algebra, we find:

These agents’ wealth prices asset 2, but not asset 1. This is simply because their investments
in asset 1 is constrained by the intermediary friction, i.e., households are not marginal in
the asset 1 market. Indeed, the households’ pricing expression for asset 1 is an inequality,
reflecting the limited participation constraint.
   The fact that the pricing expression for asset 1 is an inequality, while that of asset 2
holds with equality, offers a further prediction of intermediary asset pricing:

                                                  β1M   β1H
                                                      >     .                                                        (19)
                                                  β2M   β2H

Relative to the beta for asset 2, the intermediated asset will have a higher beta with
respect to intermediary wealth than with respect to household wealth. Moreover, this dif-
ferential should increase with intermediary frictions (lower m). These testable implications
are developed and evaluated in a recent paper by Haddad and Muir [2017], who explore
the dependence of the heterogeneous sensitivity across asset classes on households’ direct
participation costs.
   Our analysis lead us to a number of conclusions:

Proposition 3

  1. An intermediary based pricing factor will price the cross-section of asset returns

                                                        19
       whether or not intermediaries are a veil. Empirical results demonstrating the success
       of an intermediary factor are necessary but not sufficient conditions for frictional
       intermediary based asset pricing theories.

    2. A sophisticated household based pricing factor will price the cross-section of asset
       returns whether or not there are intermediary frictions. Such frictions would only
       affect the betas.

    3. A sufficient condition for rejecting intermediary based asset pricing is that the Euler
       equations for the households who delegate their funds to the intermediary prices the
       intermediated assets.

    This last point is a key one for SDF-type tests of intermediary asset pricing. Inter-
mediary asset pricing requires that an intermediary SDF prices returns and the household
SDF fails to price returns. Note that testing intermediary asset pricing involves a joint
hypothesis problem. We need to specify the SDF of the households, so that the test is a
joint one of a household and intermediary SDF.



3      Empirically Connecting Capital Shocks to Asset Price
       Changes
The financial crisis has provided a number of data points in support of intermediary asset
pricing theories. During the crisis, intermediaries suffered losses to their capital. In terms
of the model, m fell. The returns on assets that are commonly associated with intermediary
trading rose. See Krishnamurthy [2010] and Mitchell and Pulvino [2012], who document
these phenomena in a number of asset markets.
    Figure 1 is from Krishnamurthy [2010]. It graphs the option-adjusted spreads on GNMA
mortgage-backed securities, a security which was at the heart of the financial crisis, over a
period from 2007 to 2009. Spreads rise in the crisis in 2008 coinciding with intermediaries
suffering losses to their capital. As the crisis abates in 2009 and as banks raise equity
capital from the U.S. government and public equity markets, the spreads fall.

   Figure 2 considers a 2005 episode of a dislocation in the convertible bond market. The
figure is from Mitchell et al. [2007]. The left panel plots the quantity of assets of three
types of financial intermediaries, convertible bond arbitrage hedge funds, multi-strategy
hedge funds and convertible bond mutual funds. Convertible bond arbitrage hedge funds
specialize in purchasing convertible bonds, hedging out the equity risk, and capturing a
return when such a hedged strategy is profitable. In 2004, there were withdrawals from
these hedge funds which resulted in a substantial fall in the capital available for trading by
these funds. Related funds such as convertible bond mutual funds or multi-strategy hedge
funds did not see similar redemptions. The capital reductions were matched by a reduction
in the prices of convertible bonds and increases in returns on convertible bonds, as pictured
on the right panel of the figure.
   Figure 1 and 2 are good examples of the intermediary asset pricing phenomena this
paper is concerned with. The disruption in intermediation is associated with movements
in the prices of intermediated asset classes. The price movements reverse over the course
of months, not the minutes or days that is the province of research in market micro-

structures. The phenomena reflect “slow-moving” intermediary capital in the language of
Darrell Duffie’s presidential address to the American Finance Association (Duffie [2010]).
       However, these figures are not conclusive. Suppose intermediation is a veil and suppose
that a shock increased the risk premium households demand for holding mortgage risk
(or convertible bond risk). In this case we will see a reduction in the prices of mortgage
bonds (convertible bonds), losses to intermediaries specializing in these types of assets, and
subsequently higher returns to these bonds. This type of problem is a challenge for many
empirical studies of intermediary asset pricing. The rest of this section describes empirical
experiments which solve this identification problem.


3.1                              CIP deviation

The failure of covered interest parity (CIP) is one of the most glaring asset pricing anomalies
in the crisis. Consider two trades.

       • Trade A: Convert one US Dollar into Euros at time t at exchange rate St . Invest the
                           funds in the Euro market at a riskless interest rate iEuro
                                                                                 t    for a term of one period to
                           receive St (1 + iEuro
                                            t    ) Euros at t + 1. Simultaneously purchase a forward contract at
                           price Ft from a financial intermediary that converts Ft Euros into one US Dollar. By


                                                                                                                                               22
     striking this forward, the payoff at t + 1 in dollars is,

                                            St
                                               (1 + iEuro
                                                     t    ).
                                            Ft


   • Trade B: Invest in a one-period bond in US dollars at riskless interest rate iUt SD to
     receive 1 + iUt SD at date t + 1

Trade A and Trade B both invest one dollar at time t for return at time t + 1. Thus we
may expect that,
                                   St
                                      (1 + iEuro
                                            t    ) = 1 + iUt SD
                                   Ft
In fact, while this relation held almost exactly prior to 2008 (based on LIBOR for the two
interest rates), during the crisis and beyond, the pattern has been that,

                                          St
                      CIPtDeviation ≡        (1 + iEuro
                                                   t    ) − 1 + iUt SD > 0.

borrowers lost access to US dollar short-term money market funding. They were unable to
rollover dollar loans. One way they dealt with this dollar liquidity squeeze was to borrow
Euros and convert the Euros into dollars, while hedging the repayment in the forward
market. That is, they took the opposite side of Trade A.
   Typically, a US bank took the other side and hence needed to absorb an increasing
quantity of trade A. In terms of the model, the supply of asset A, θA , increased (or ρS
increased). As a result, and given intermediation frictions, the return on trade A rose
relative to that of trade B as frictions worsened in the crisis. The pattern is evident in
Figure 3 where we plot the CIP deviation (also referred to as the “basis”) for the Euro
relative to the US and the Yen relative to the US. Notice that the CIP deviations widen in
late 2008 and take many months to reverse, rather than days as may be expected with a
market micro-structure friction.
   We can understand these violations through the lens of intermediary asset pricing. The
return to trade A corresponds to a more intermediated asset return than the return to


                                               23

trade B. This is a natural association because trade A involves a forward contract (i.e. the
forward price Ft ) that is written by a bank. Moreover, US households directly own trade
B which is riskless investments in USD. So their SDF prices trade B. But trade A offers a
higher return than trade B, implying their SDF does not price trade A. Figure 1 is evidence
of intermediary pricing because as intermediation frictions worsen in the crisis, the relative
return between trade A and B rose. If intermediation was frictionless, households would
provide more capital to intermediaries to take advantage of the return spread, and drive
the spread to zero.
   Du et al. [2017] provide sharper evidence tying the movements in CIP deviations to
capital frictions in intermediation. They note that capital requirements on some banks are
based on a snapshot of their balance sheets at quarter-end. Banks thus face tighter capital
requirements at quarter-ends relative to days before and after. They show that the CIP
deviation widens on quarter-ends consistent with this capital tightness. Figure 4 graphs
this pattern not for the USD/Euro but for the USD/Yen CIP deviation, which reflected
the same economics. The graph is for a period from 2014 to 2016, well after the financial
crisis, but still reflecting intermediation frictions. The CIP deviation jumps at quarter end
consistent with the pattern of capital constraints. Moreover, the jump is largest for the

shortest maturity one-week contract because this contract’s term has the largest fraction
( 17 th) for which the capital constraint is tight, as suggested by theory. It is hard to reconcile
these patters with any theories involving household risk preferences, so that the evidence
for intermediary asset pricing is quite strong.


3.2    Insurance markets

Some of the clearest evidence for capital effects in intermediary asset pricing comes from in-
surance markets. Froot and O’Connell [1999] study property and casualty insurance. They
show that the price of such insurance is described by a cycle: a natural disaster results in
reductions in the capital of insurers; the price of new policies rise and the quantity of insur-
ance sold falls; as capital builds up, the prices fall and quantities rise. This is compelling
evidence of shifts in the supply of insurance induced by capital shocks, because a non-
intermediary asset pricing story would have to tie the cycle in insurance prices/quantities
to a cycle in the probability of a natural disaster, which seems implausible.



                                                       25
   Koijen and Yogo [2015] study life insurers and their pricing of a long-term insurance
policies during the financial crisis. They demonstrate a capital effect in the pricing of
these policies, albeit in a counterintuitive manner. In contrast to Froot and O’Connell
[1999] where insurance premium rises following an impairment of capital, Koijen and Yogo
[2015] show that insurers sold policies at prices below actuarial fair value, and that this
gap was larger for insurers facing tighter capital constraints. They show that this behavior
is because sales of such insurance increase regulatory capital in the short-run.
   The Koijen and Yogo [2015] evidence is consistent with the rest of the evidence for
capital effects we have discussed in this section and thus reinforces support for theories of
intermediary asset pricing. It goes beyond the other evidence in two ways, which are worth
highlighting.
   First, the market for retail insurance allows the econometrician to observe different
transaction prices for the same asset, sold by different insurance companies and purchased
by different households. In the forward exchange rate market, we observe only one price,
the “best" price for the forward contract. This means we can only learn how shocks to
capital impact the aggregate supply curve for forwards, which involves studying a single
time series of capital shocks and forward prices. In the retail setting, given the search and
attention frictions, each insurer has market power in selling contracts. Thus, we can learn
about the supply curve for insurance at the insurer level, providing much more variation to
study. Since the economics of capital effects remain the same, that is, capital shocks impact
supply, the study has external validity beyond the retail insurance setting. For instance,
Bao et al. [2017] document that the liquidity provision by dealers has been adversely affected
by the regulatory tightening of the Volker rule in the context of corporate bonds traded in
the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market.
   Second, the rest of the studies we have described convincingly demonstrate a capital
effect, but they stop short of quantifying the capital effect. Ultimately for model construc-
tion, it is necessary to know how a reduction of say x% in capital impacts supply. Koijen
and Yogo [2015] take a structural approach to estimation, allowing them to quantify the
capital effect.

4     Stochastic Discount Factor Methodology
In the previous section, we discussed evidence in favor of the prediction that shocks to in-
termediary capital/constraints will explain movements in the prices of intermediated assets.
We now discuss a second empirical literature that investigates how intermediary variables
explain the expected returns on intermediated assets. This literature constructs a factor
that is posited as a proxy for the intermediary SDF and examines its pricing power for
intermediated asset classes. It likewise constructs a SDF for the household sector which
in a frictionless (veil) world should also price these assets. The test of intermediary asset
pricing relies on showing that the intermediary SDF can explain variation in asset returns
while the household SDF cannot.
    We discuss two papers in the literature, Gabaix et al. [2007] and He et al. [2017]. As
we explain, these papers are less well identified than the papers discussed in the previous
section, but the approach is particularly well suited for quantifying models of intermediary
asset pricing. Both papers estimate an intermediary price of risk which can serve as targets
to match in quantitative intermediary asset pricing models.


4.1    Mortgage-backed securities market

Gabaix et al. [2007] (GKV) study the pricing of prepayment risk in mortgage-backed se-
curities (MBS), providing evidence to support intermediary asset pricing models. MBS
securities rise and fall in value based on the exercise of homeowners’ prepayment options.
When a homeowner prepays a mortgage, the corresponding MBS is called back at par.
Depending on the interest rate environment, unexpected prepayments can either hurt or
benefit the MBS investor. For an MBS with a low coupon trading in an environment where
market interest rates are high, unexpected prepayments benefit the MBS investor. In the
opposite case, where the coupon is higher than market interest rates, unexpected prepay-
ments hurt the MBS investor. GKV define prepayment risk as the risk of prepayment that
are orthogonal to market interest rates (which investors are able to hedge out), and study
the pricing of this prepayment risk.
    Importantly, for an investor who specializes in the MBS market and therefore holds

                                             27
a concentrated portfolio of MBS, prepayment risk represents a risk to the value of his
portfolio. GKV posit that financial intermediaries, such as mortgage funds, will hold such
a concentrated portfolio and be exposed to prepayment risk. They derive an SDF of such
an investor and empirically demonstrate that this SDF prices the cross-section and time
series patterns in the spreads of MBS over Treasury bonds.
   They also provide evidence that a household SDF does not price prepayment risk. They
note that for every MBS investor who is short a prepayment option, there is a homeowner
who is long the prepayment option, and hence prepayments do not cause changes to ag-
gregate wealth or the aggregate endowment. Thus under a non-intermediary model the
pricing of prepayment risk should refect the covariance of prepayment shocks with aggre-
gate household wealth or consumption.
   There are three principal empirical results in the paper. First, they show that in the
cross-section, MBS with more prepayment risk (i.e., securities that fall in value when pre-
payments are unexpectedly high) carry a higher spread than those with lower prepayment
risk. That is, prepayment risk carries a positive risk premium. Second, the observed covari-
ance between prepayment risk and either aggregate wealth or consumption implies a sign
that is opposite that required to match the observed prices of prepayment risk. Prepay-
ments are modestly procyclical so that MBS securities that fall in value when prepayment
shocks are high should carry a negative risk premium rather than positive risk premium.
Last, they derive a proxy for the riskiness of the MBS market and show that the market
price of prepayment risk comoves with this proxy.
   Figure 5 presents the main result from the paper. For each month, the price of prepay-
ment risk is estimated from the cross-section of MBS spreads. That is, the β with respect
to prepayment risk is estimated for each MBS, and the price of prepayment risk is then
the spread compensation per unit of β. The time series of this price of prepayment risk is
plotted in black. Theoretically, an investor who is long the entire portfolio of MBS will
price prepayment risk depending on the investor’s exposure to prepayment risk. If the mar-
ket portfolio consists of MBS with higher coupons relative to the market interest rate, the
unexpectedly faster prepayments result in larger losses to the investor. Thus the investor’s
exposure to prepayment risk will depend on the average coupon of the market portfolio of

MBS relative to riskless interest rates, or CBAR-R. The figure shows that the theoretical
and estimated price of prepayment risk move together. Regression analysis reported in
GKV confirm the pattern evident in the figure.
   The empirical approach of GKV is to construct a theoretically derived intermediary
SDF and show that this SDF prices MBS prepayment risk while a household based SDF
does not price MBS risk. The approach is fruitful in this case because the object studied,
prepayment risk, will carry opposite risk prices depending on the posited SDF. However,
this statement rests on accurately measuring the household SDF. GKV use household
consumption and aggregate wealth data to assess the household SDF.
   Finally, we note that Gabaix et al. [2007] studies a small sample that ends in 1998.
Recent papers such as Boyarchenko et al. [2017] and Diep et al. [2017] consider a longer
sample and larger cross-section of MBS. Their results are also consistent with intermediary


                                             29
asset pricing in the MBS market.


4.2     Broker/Dealer Capital

He et al. [2017] (henceforth HKM) propose an empirical measure of the SDF of financial
intermediaries based on broker/dealer capital ratio and explore its pricing power for seven
asset classes, including equities, US government and corporate bonds, foreign sovereign
bonds, options, credit default swaps (CDS), commodities, and foreign exchange (FX). The
approach of confronting intermediary asset pricing theory with a broad set of asset classes
is in contrast with Gabaix et al. [2007] who focus only on the highly specialized MBS
market. HKM build on the seminal paper in this literature, Adrian et al. [2014], which uses
broker-dealers’ leverage rather than capital to measure the intermediary SDF. Adrian et al.
[2014] explore the pricing power of broker-dealer leverage for equities and US government
bonds, while HKM expand the approach to include more intermediated asset classes.


4.2.1   Intermediary capital ratio

HKM study primary dealers who serve as counterparties of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York (“NY Fed” henceforth) in its implementation of monetary policy. These dealers are
large and sophisticated financial institutions that operate in virtually the entire universe
of capital markets, and include the likes of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Deutsche
Bank. It is natural to focus on these dealers because they are active (hence are marginal
investors) in many asset markets, just like the intermediaries of the model with multiple
assets analyzed in Section 2.7 to Section 2.9.
   Following He and Krishnamurthy [2012, 2013] and Brunnermeier and Sannikov [2014],
HKM postulate that these dealers’ equity capital ratio is the key determinant of the inter-
mediary’s SDF. When the intermediary experiences a negative shock to its equity capital,
say, due to an unexpected losses in MBS, its risk bearing capacity is impaired and its
value from an extra dollar of equity capital rises. More specifically, HKM construct the
intermediary capital ratio, denoted by ηt , as the aggregate value of market equity divided
by aggregate market equity plus aggregate book debt of the banking holding companies of

In the language of the Intertemporal-CAPM model (Merton [1973]), the intermediary cap-
ital ratio ηt is state variable that captures the soundness of the financial sector and hence
matters for risk compensation, in addition to the aggregate market return RtW which poten-
tially capture other economy-wide shocks. Based on a parsimonious Intertemporal-CAPM
style two-factor-structure consisting of the intermediary capital factor ηt∆ (the percentage
innovation to ηt ) and the stock market return RtW , HKM empirically show that the in-
termediary capital factor has significant explanatory power for cross-sectional variation in
expected returns in the seven asset classes mentioned.

     Market values of equity arguably better reflect the financial distress of intermediaries. In the empirical
corporate finance literature that studies the capital structure of nonfinancial firms [Leary and Roberts,
2005], book values of debt are used to approximately measure unobserved market values of debt. The
approximation is more accurate in our context of financial firms, as for banking institutions the majority of
their liabilities consist of safe short-term debt such as deposits, repurchase agreements (repo), and trading
liabilities which are to a large extent collateralized and have market values equal to the face or book value.




                                                            31
       Figure 6 graphs ηt and ηt∆ over the period from 1970Q1 to 2012Q4 reported in HKM,
along with NBER recessions as shaded areas. There are several noteworthy observations
regarding the relation between ηt∆ and business cycle macroeconomic conditions. The most
negative shock to intermediary capital occurred during the 2008 financial crisis, which
coincided with the Great Recession. Somewhat surprisingly, it is the liquidity crisis during
the fall of 1998 that witnessed the second largest negative ηt∆ , an episode that coincided
with turmoil in the options market but little action in the broad stock market. Last, despite
a significant stock market crash (the Tech bubble burst) during the 2001 recession, we only
observe a relatively modest negative drop in ηt∆ . These observations illustrate the difference
between the fundamental shocks (as reflected by RtW ) and financial shocks (as reflected by
ηt∆ ).7


4.2.2      Price of intermediary capital risk

As shown in Section 2.9, the standard risk-return relationship implies that any asset j
with a βj loading on the intermediary capital risk factor ηt∆ should be compensated by an
expected return of λη βj in equilibrium. Importantly, λη is independent of the asset class,
because the price of risk λη should only be specific to the characteristics of the investor for
whom we measure the SDF. For instance, in the asset pricing model analyzed in Section
2.9, the price of risk is proportional to the relative risk aversion of the marginal investor
(either managers or sophisticated investors) and the variance of their return on wealth.
Asset classes with different degrees of intermediation (say equity versus CDS) might differ
in their risk loadings to ηt∆ , so that some asset classes are more sensitive to intermediary
capital shocks, but this heterogeneity should be reflected in the asset βj only.
       HKM test this prediction. They first perform cross-sectional asset pricing tests within
each class separately, i.e., obtaining betas of each asset j in asset class k from time-series
regressions, then running a cross-sectional regression of average excess portfolio returns on
   7
    Muir [2017] present more comprehensive evidence from a large international panel on the differential
impact of financial and real shocks for asset prices. He compares recessions involving financial crises (e.g.,
bank runs, bank closures) to non-financial recessions with similar declines in aggregate consumption, and
shows that the risk premia on stocks and corporate bonds rise substantially in the financial recessions
relative to the non-financial recessions.



                                                     32
the estimated betas. This procedure allows HKM to estimate the asset class-specific risk
prices λkη for each asset-class k.8 Theory suggests that these risk prices λkη should be positive
and equal across asset classes, subject to estimation error. This is indeed what HKM find.
Figure 7 plots intermediary risk prices from different asset classes, together with the 95%
confidence intervals. As shown, their test rejects the null of a 0% risk price in all classes,
but cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimated risk price is equal to 9% per quarter
(the value found in the all portfolios case which pools all testing porfolios together) for any
of the individual asset classes, at the 5% significance level.

    Theoretically, the prediction of equal risk prices relies on the following assumptions.
First, the proposed equity capital ratio (20) represents the intermediaries’ marginal value of
wealth. Second, intermediaries are active traders in all asset markets (though not necessar-
ily with large net positions). Also implicit in these assumptions is a degree of homogeneity
in the pricing kernels of individual financial intermediaries. That all financial intermedi-
    8
      Recall that we have emphasized nonlinearity, i.e., the price of risk is state dependent and may rise
during severe economic downturns. This is illustrated by GKV in Figure 5. Under the assumption of
constant asset beta, the unconditional estimate obtained in HKM can be viewed as the average price of
risk over time.


                                                    33
aries are homogeneous is perhaps the most tenuous of these assumptions. Its failure could
potentially explain the somewhat higher price of risk in options and FX point, for example,
if intermediaries that specialize in trading these securities differ in substantial ways from
other intermediaries [see, for example, Gârleanu et al., 2015].


4.2.3   Necessary and sufficient for intermediary asset pricing?

Still, in light of Proposition 3 in Section 2.9, Figure 7 showing that the intermediary’s SDF
has explanatory power for a wide range of asset classes is necessary but not sufficient to
demonstrate the core of intermediary asset pricing, i.e., intermediaries are not a veil. To
claim that, one needs to show that the households’ SDF fails. Although there exist some
papers aiming to explain the time-series behavior of index options under the rare-disaster
consumption-based asset pricing framework (e.g., Barro and Liao [2016]), we are not aware
of papers that successfully explain the cross-section of expected returns for the non-equity
asset classes considered by HKM using an SDF constructed from household consumption
data.
   Another way of approaching the issues is to see what SDFs do not work in explaining
returns. The model developed in Section 2 says that if all plausible SDFs work, then the
intermediary is just a veil. HKM present two sets of results to reject the veil hypothesis.
First, HKM show that the well-known factors commonly used in the literature, including
the Fama-French five factors, momentum, and liquidity (Pástor and Stambaugh [2003]),
perform poorly. If we interpret the earlier success of these factors as due to their capturing
the SDF of households in the equity market, this result shows that their SDF fails to price
the non-equity-heavy asset portfolios in HKM. Furthermore, HKM postulate that within
the broker-dealer sector, primary dealers, who are large and active in almost all asset
markets, are the intermediaries of intermediary asset pricing models. The SDF of non-
primary dealers, who tend to be smaller, standalone, broker-dealers for the equity market
but who trade little in derivatives markets, should not price the cross-section of returns.
HKM repeat their main asset pricing test using the equity capital ratio constructed from
non-primary dealers. The SDF works for equity portfolios but not for other asset classes



                                             34
(Table 7 Panel A in HKM). This result may imply that non-primary dealers are a veil
whose trades reflect the preferences and tastes of households. The fact that these other
constructed factors fail to price the assets studied in HKM while the primary-dealer equity-
capital ratio does, is the strongest evidence presented by HKM in favor of intermediary asset
pricing.9



5         Summary and Conclusion
We have explained both the theory behind intermediary asset pricing as well as some of
the empirical approaches taken to testing the theory. There is now a large body of work
in this area. On the theory side the basic groundwork for intermediary asset pricing has
been laid out. On the empirical side, there are a number of papers that have demonstrated
intermediary asset pricing effects along the lines that we covered in Section 3. There is a
smaller but growing body of literature that tries to construct an intermediary stochastic
discount factor.
        We close with a short wish-list for future work in this area. For empirical work: What
are the most salient financial frictions driving intermediary asset pricing? Which class of
intermediaries are most prominent for understanding asset prices? How much does hetero-
geneity within the intermediary sector matter? What is the relation between intermediary
risk prices as measured from asset prices and macroeconomic activities such as corporate
and residential investment? For theoretical work: We need to construct tractable models to
replicate the empirical findings both qualitatively and quantitatively. These models need
to be embedded within a macroeconomic framework to elucidate links between the finan-
cial sector, asset prices, households, and the real sector. Finally, these models need to be
quantitative in nature in order to evaluate policy counterfactuals that can guide financial
regulation.

    Note that this evidence also differentiates intermediary asset pricing from heterogeneous agent fric-
tionless models such as Dumas [1989]. In that frictionless model, the pricing kernel of any agent should
price all assets, and there is no particular reason why the SDF derived from primary dealers will perform
better than that of any other.
