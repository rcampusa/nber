Assessing Consumer Gains from a Drug Price Control Policy in the U.S.

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper uses national data for the period 1960 to 2000 to estimate an aggregate private consumer
demand for pharmaceuticals in the U.S. The estimated demand curve is then used to simulate the

value of consumer surplus gains from a drug price control regime that holds drug price increases to
the same rate of growth as the general consumer price level over the time period from 1981 to 2000.

Based upon a 7 percent real interest rate, we find that the future value of consumer surplus gains

from this hypothetical policy would have been $319 billion at the end of 2000. According to a recent

study, that same drug price control regime would have led to 198 fewer new drugs being brought to

the U.S. market over this period. Therefore, we approximate that the average social opportunity cost

per drug developed during this period to be approximately $1.6 billion. Recent research on the value

of pharmaceuticals suggests that the social benefits of a new drug may be far greater than this

estimated social opportunity cost.

1.     Introduction


The on-going public debate over prescription drug prices represents one of the most

contentious issues in the history of U.S. healthcare politics. The commonly held

perception that U.S. drug prices are “too high” has been fueled by the fact that real drug

prices in the U.S. have been rising steadily, and at a rate faster than that of the general

consumer price index for over two decades. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry has

come under intense criticism, with both politicians and special interests groups calling for

new legislation making pharmaceuticals more affordable, either through legalized

reimportation from price-regulated markets such as Canada and the European Union, or

more directly through government imposed price controls.

       While these calls for legislative action are not new, the U.S. does appear to be, for

the first time, very close to a major policy change regarding U.S. drug prices.1 The U.S.

government may, like all other industrialized governments around the world, soon begin

regulating drug prices2. In addition to several reimportation bills currently on the Senate

floor, proposed amendments to the recently passed Medicare Modernization Act of 2003

also exist that will allow the U.S. government to negotiate directly with drug

manufacturers for Medicare prescription drug purchases (the MMA currently has a non-

interference clause), which will amount to approximately 60 percent of all U.S. drug

purchases (Vernon, Santerre, and Giaccotto, 2004).

       While regulated drug prices in the U.S. will undoubtedly improve the public’s

access to today’s medicines, and thus generate both cost savings and improved public

health, it will simultaneously reduce firms’ incentives to invest in pharmaceutical R&D

because of lower levels of pharmaceutical profitability. Less investment in
                                                                                             4


pharmaceutical R&D will have a negative effect on the rate of future pharmaceutical

innovation. Recent research has documented the considerable benefits of pharmaceutical

innovation in terms of improved longevity (Lichtenberg 2002; Miller and Frech, 2002) as

well as the sensitivity of R&D investment to real pharmaceutical prices (Giaccotto,

Santerre, and Vernon, 2005) and profits (Vernon, 2004a). Thus, in addition to the short-

run benefits associated with lower, regulated drug prices, long-run costs also arise. This

is precisely the tradeoff the U.S. patent system tries to balance by awarding limited-term

patents to new drug products.

       Even though a policy of regulated drug prices in the U.S. involves a tradeoff

between short-run benefits and long run costs, the former outcome often receives more

attention in policy debates (Scherer, 2004). Interestingly, however, efforts to quantify

these short-run benefits from a rigorous economic perspective are nonexistent.

Therefore, in the current paper, we attempt to do just that. We also compare our findings

with the results from an earlier study by Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005)—one

that employed the same data and modeling techniques, but which measured the economic

costs of the same U.S. price control policy—in terms of reduced levels of pharmaceutical

innovation. Thus, we are able to weigh the benefits of pharmaceutical price controls (in

terms of consumer surplus gains) against the costs (measured in terms of forgone drug

discoveries). While these studies are retrospective in nature (out of necessity), and

consider only one type of U.S. price control policy (one that requires pharmaceutical

prices grow no faster than the consume price index), the price control policy simulated is,

nevertheless, similar to an actual policy enacted in 1992 for drugs purchased by the

government for the Veterans Administration (VA) health system. Moreover, and for the
                                                                                             5


first time, a formal cost-benefit analysis of a particular type of drug price control is

possible, and this may offer new insights.

    Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section II we construct an empirical model of the

aggregate consumer demand for pharmaceuticals in the United States. We also outline

our empirical strategy and describe the data. Section III reports and discusses our

empirical estimates. In Section IV we simulate the consumer surplus gains from a

hypothetical price control policy in the U.S.: one that limits the growth rate of

pharmaceutical prices to that of the consumer price index from 1981 to 2000. We then

assess the net benefit of this policy by comparing the gains of consumer surplus to some

fairly plausible estimates of the value of the R&D (and drugs) that would be lost had the

policy been enacted. Section V provides a summary and offers some conclusions.




2. Conceptual and Empirical Models of the Aggregate Consumer Demand for
   Pharmaceutical Products

We begin by assuming a one-period model in which a representative consumer, given her

exogenous tastes and preferences, t, derives utility from consuming the units of “health

services”, s, that flow from her health capital, h, and some composite good, x. Stated

mathematically:

U = U ( s, x; t ).                                                                     (1)

We also make the following standard assumptions about the individual’s utility function:

∂U                   ∂U         ∂ 2U            ∂ 2U            ∂ 2U
   > 0;                 > 0;         < 0;            < 0;            > 0.
∂s                   ∂x         ∂s 2            ∂x 2            ∂s∂x

That is, utility is assumed to increase at a decreasing rate with respect to both health

services and the composite good. We further assume that health services are produced
                                                                                             6


with various combinations of prescription drugs, q (e.g., dosages), and medical services,

m (such as office visits or inpatient days), conditioned on the representative consumer’s

initial endowment of health capital, h0. Thus, for ease of exposition, we ignore a set of

other healthcare “goods” and “bads” such as exercise, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, etc.

and the consumer’s time involved in producing these healthcare activities.3 A production

function for units of health services can thus be written as follows:

s = s (q, m; h0 ) ,                                                                   (2)

where s is assumed to be concave with respect to both q and m.

         Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), allows utility to be expressed in terms

of the production function for health services and the composite good. It is assumed that

expenditures on the two inputs that produce health services, and spending on the

composite good, fully exhaust the consumer’s income net of insurance premiums, y. The

consumer’s optimization problem is therefore to select the amounts of prescription drugs,

medical services, and the composite good that maximize her utility subject to the

constraints of net income and the out-of-pocket prices for drugs, PO , medical services,

PM , and the composite good, PX . Stated more formally we have:4

Maximize U = U [s (q, m; h0 ), x; t ]   s.t. qPO + mPM + xPX = y .
         Using the method of Lagrange Multipliers to find the solution to this constrained

optimization problem generates the familiar first-order conditions. Using the first-order

conditions, we can solve for the marginal rate of substitution between drugs and the

composite good. This yields the following:

                      −1
 ∂U ∂s        ∂U               PO
    ⋅                      =      .                                                   (3)
 ∂s ∂q        ∂x               PX
                                                                                              7


The first partial derivative in the left-most bracket captures the marginal utility of good

health while the second reflects the marginal productivity of drugs on good health.

Equation (3) implies that, in equilibrium, the representative consumer equates the

marginal benefit of the last drug consumed with its marginal cost, as reflected by the

relative out-of-pocket price of an additional drug.

       For purposes later in the paper, it is important to consider here that the marginal

benefit of an additional drug dosage is influenced by both the value that the consumer

places on being in a state of good health and the marginal product of an additional drug

on good health. As a result, the price paid for an additional drug in the marketplace

captures the consumer’s willingness to pay for a small reduction in the probability of

dying and/or a marginal improvement in her quality of life. This notion becomes

particularly important when we use the demand curve to estimate the consumer surplus

from a drug price control regime. That is, consumer surplus captures the value of life and

the marginal contribution of an additional drug to good health.

       Defining x as the numeraire, it also follows from the utility maximization process

that the representative consumer’s quantity demanded of prescription drugs can be

derived as a function of the relative out-of-pocket drug price, relative out-of-pocket

medical price, and her real net income. Expressed generally, the demand function takes

the following form:

       PO PM Y
q=q      ,  , ; t , h0 .                                                                (4)
       PX PX PX

Horizontally aggregating across all consumers, and assuming that the aggregate

consumers’ demand for prescription drugs can be written in log-log form for estimation

purposes, the following result can be obtained:
                                                                                              8


                      PO          P          Y
ln(Q) = β 0 + β1 ln      + β 2 ln M + β 3 ln    .                                       (5)
                      PX          PX         PX

Given the log-log form, the coefficients in equation (5) may be interpreted as elasticities.

According to the law of demand, the quantity demanded of prescription drugs should be

inversely related to its relative out-of pocket market price ( β1 < 0 ). The relationship

between the quantity demanded of prescription drugs and the relative out-of-pocket price

for medical services depends on whether pharmaceuticals and medical services are

substitutes ( β 2 > 0 ) or complements ( β 2 < 0 ). Finally, if prescription drugs can be

classified a normal good, real income will have a direct impact on the quantity demanded

of prescription drugs ( β 3 > 0 ). Obviously, an inverse relation holds if prescription drugs

are inferior goods.

        Because we are interested in calculating the area under this demand curve for

pharmaceutical products to measure the consumer surplus from a drug price control

policy, the parameters of equation (5) are now estimated with multiple regression

analysis. The empirical analysis is conducted at the macro level by using expenditure data

from the health accounts at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), price

data from the Bureau of Labor Statisics (BLS), and income data from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA) over the period from 1960 to 2000.

        In the regression equation, real drug expenditures per capita serves as our measure

of the quantity of drugs consumed, Q, the dependent variable in equation (5). Real

pharmaceutical expenses per capita are calculated by dividing nominal drug expenditures

by the pharmaceutical consumer price index and by population. Data for nominal

pharmaceutical expenditures are obtained from the CMS. It should be noted that
                                                                                             9

pharmaceutical expenditures capture purchases of both existing and new drugs but a

demand curve assumes a standardized product. Technical change over time obviously

changes the mix of old and new drugs and thus might present a problem when estimating

long-run elasticities. However, variables are first differenced in our multiple regression

models. Thus, we are estimating short-run elasticities and technical change therefore

presents less of a problem.

       The (nominal) out-of-pocket price of drugs is calculated in the following manner:

P0 = cP,                                                                             (6)

such that the out-of-pocket price is determined by multiplying the average consumer

coinsurance rate, c, by the price of pharmaceuticals, P. The expression in equation (6) is

then divided by the price of the composite good, PX, to derive the real out-of-pocket price

of drugs. For empirical purposes, the average consumer coinsurance rate is measured by

dividing all consumer out-of-pockets payments by total pharmaceutical expenditures. But

theoretically, c should include just coinsurance payments because only coinsurance

possesses a substitution effect. Unfortunately, separate data for various types of consumer

payments are unavailable at CMS. Therefore, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance

payments must all be lumped together and treated similarly. Because of this data

limitation, in the empirical analysis we allow c to interact with the price term as specified

in equation (6), but also allow for our measure of c to have its own separate impact on the

consumption of drugs in a slightly alternative specification of equation (5).

       The consumer price index (CPI) and its components, as calculated by BLS,

provide our aggregate measures of pharmaceutical price, P, medical price, PM, and price

of the composite good, PX. As noted by several researchers, consumer price indices are
                                                                                           10

not measured without error because substitution effects and quality changes over time are

not fully incorporated (e.g., Hausman, 2003). Several authors have also pointed out the

biases that previously existed in pharmaceutical price indices because of (1); the

undersampling of new drugs, (2); the failure to treat generic drugs as lower-priced

substitutes for branded drugs rather than new drugs, and (3); the use of list instead of

transaction prices (Berndt, Griliches, and Rosett, 1993; Scherer, 1993).

       Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical price index represents the best available time

series indicator of drug price swings in the U.S. (Beginning in 1995, BLS has taken steps

to correct some of these biases in the pharmaceutical price index (Santerre and Neun,

2000.)) Moreover, since we are examining changes in the ratio of the pharmaceutical and

general CPI measures over time, some of the substitution and quality bias in the

numerator and denominator may tend to cancel out. In addition, average year-to-year

parameter estimates are obtained in the multiple regression analysis. These short-run

estimates may avoid some of this bias because sufficient time does not pass for

substitution effects and quality changes to fully work themselves out. It should be kept in

mind, however, that any remaining measurement error biases the parameter estimates

towards zero if the rest of the model is properly specified.

       The real out-of-pocket price of medical care is obtained by multiplying the ratio

of the medical care consumer price index and the general price index by the percent of

medical care expenditures that were out-of-pocket expenses. Real net income per capita,

Y, is measured by real GDP per capita less real aggregate health insurance premiums per

capita. Real GDP per capita data are obtained at BEA. Aggregate premium data are
                                                                                             11

collected from the national health accounts at CMS, divided by population and the

consumer price index to arrive at real aggregate health insurance premiums per capita.

       Before presenting the multiple regression results, it might be instructive to discuss

how real pharmaceutical expenditures per capita and the pharmaceutical out-of-pocket

price and its components changed over time during the sample period. This information is

provided in Exhibit 1. Notice that real drug expenditures per capita increased rapidly

from 1960 to 1975, continued to increase but at a diminishing rate from 1976 to 1994,

and then began increasing at an increasing rate once again from 1995 to 2000. These

changes over time may reflect the law of demand given that out-of-pocket real

prescription drug prices inversely mirrored these movements in per capita real drug

expenditures during this time period. For instance, the out-of-pocket real price of drugs

declined rapidly from 1960 to 1975 and from 1993 to 2000, the two time periods when

real drug expenditures per capita were rising quickly. Attention should also be drawn to

the fact that most of the changes in real drug expenditures have been driven more by

adjustments in real drug prices than the consumer out-of-pocket share given that the

consumer out-of-pocket share continued to decline throughout the period.



3.     Empirical Results


       A high degree of serial correlation necessitated first differencing of the data (after

taking logarithms). First differencing of the data seems particularly appropriate because

diagnostic tests revealed the presence of unit roots in several of the time series data (i.e.,

real drug spending per capita and real GDP per capita) before they were first differenced.

Unit roots can result in spurious correlations among variables. We also included in our
                                                                                              12

empirical model a lagged measure of real drug expenditures per capita as an additional

independent variable (after first differencing). The lagged measure was included to

control for unobserved demand factors like tastes and preferences, T, and the initial

endowment of health, H0, as specified in equation (4).

       Both ordinary (OLS) and two stage least squares (TSLS) estimates of the

parameters are obtained by the empirical analysis. The real long-term corporate AAA

bond rate for all private industries and a one-year lagged pharmaceutical price index

serve as instruments in the two stage least squares procedure. Specification of the real

interest rate as a supply-side instrument is based on the notion that pharmaceutical

companies tend to hold a sizeable stock of physical, R&D/intellectual, and promotional

capital. Over the long-run, pharmaceutical companies most likely attempt to earn

sufficient revenues to cover the opportunity cost of holding these capital items through a

series of short-run adjustments in drug prices. It stands to reason, therefore, that changes

in real interest rates alter the opportunity cost of holding capital in the long-run and lead

to corresponding adjustments in short-run prices.5 Note that this real interest rate is

determined in the aggregate market for corporate loanable funds and outside the

exclusive control of the pharmaceutical industry. It therefore can be treated as being

exogenously determined.

        As previously mentioned, two different OLS and TSLS specifications are

estimated and reported. The restricted specification treats the out-of-pocket price, cP, as

an interactive term such that the coinsurance rate and pharmaceutical price share a similar

elasticity. The unrestricted specification allows each component of the out-of-pocket

price to separately enter the estimation equations so their elasticities can differ. Recall
                                                                                                 13

that our measure of c, the coinsurance rate, may include copayments and deductibles,

which theoretically possess income but not substitution effects. In addition, there is no

theoretical reason to suspect that consumer response to changes in the coinsurance rate

will be the same as that resulting from similar percentage changes in pharmaceutical

prices.

          The four regression results are reported in Exhibit 2.6,7 We note that, for a first-

difference model, a sizeable amount of the variation in the dependent variable is

explained by the right hand side variables. As anticipated, all estimates of own-price

elasticity of demand are negative and statistically significant. As one might expect, the

TSLS procedure produces lower price-elasticity estimates than the OLS technique. In

addition, it appears that consumers do not respond dramatically different to changes in

the coinsurance rate than to similar percentage changes in drug prices given that the

estimated coefficients on c and P are not statistically different from one another. Our

short-run own-price elasticity estimates, ranging from -0.333 to -0.489, are very close to

Coulson and Stuart’s (1995) longer-run estimate of –0.34 and also fall within previous

estimates ranging from –0.06 to –0.64 as noted by these same authors. Earlier research

focused on the demand for pharmaceuticals by elderly individuals. Our own-price

elasticity is most likely slightly higher because it captures the demand of the

representative consumer, rather than the representative elderly individual. Because of

their relatively more depreciated health capital, elderly individuals are likely to face

fewer health-related choices than the general population, and thus may possess less price-

elastic demands for pharmaceuticals. However, it should be noted that our long-run price

elasticity estimates are higher than those reported by Coulson and Stuart and range from
                                                                                             14

-0.68 to -0.92.8 These estimates still lie within the inelastic range as reported by prior

research and probably reflect the relatively long adjustment period of 40 years.

       The positive and statistically significant cross-price elasticity estimates suggest

that medical care and prescription drugs are substitute products. For example, our results

indicate that a 10 percent increase in the price of medical care is associated with a 4.5 to

5.6 percent increase in the quantity of prescription drugs demanded. The direct relation

between the price of medical care and the quantity of prescription drugs demanded

suggests that decision-makers have some ability to substitute one good for the other in the

production of good health when relative prices change. This finding is consistent with

Lichtenberg’s (1996) research, which found that increased expenditures on

pharmaceuticals lead to reduced expenditures on hospitalizations, ambulatory care, and

physician services.

       Net income elasticity estimates are positive and statistically significant, indicating

that pharmaceutical products can, collectively, be treated as normal goods. The income

elasticities are fairly sizable and suggest that a 10 percent increase in real income per

capita produces a 5 percentage increase in the quantity of drugs demanded. Studies tend

to suggest that health care represents a normal good (Santerre and Neun, 2004).

       Although predominately influenced by private demand because public health

insurance for pharmaceuticals was largely absent on an outpatient basis during the sample

period, public financing may also influence total real drug expenditures per capita, the

dependent variable in equation (5). During the time period under investigation, the

government paid for drugs administered to inpatients if they were covered by one of the

various public health insurance programs. The government also paid for prescription

drugs for outpatient care under the Veterans Administration and Medicaid programs.

Reimbursement for pharmaceuticals is fairly restrictive under the latter two programs, but

the programs do provide some of the population with financial access to pharmaceuticals.

In any case, we considered it might be important to include in the multiple regression

equation a control variable for the percentage of pharmaceutical expenditures paid by

government. The government’s share of spending on pharmaceuticals ranged from a little

under 3 percent in 1960 to slightly under 22 percent in 2000. However, inclusion of this

additional independent variable (after taking first differences in logarithms) did not

significantly alter the results shown in Exhibit 2. In addition, the coefficient estimate on

the public financing variable proved to be highly statistically insignificant. Public

financing may have had no independent impact on pharmaceutical consumption because

of its relatively low percentage over time, at least until very recently, or because this

public financing variable captures a host of widely diverse government reimbursement

schemes.



4.     Simulating Consumer Gains from a Drug Price Control Regime



We now use the multiple regression results in Exhibit 2 to estimate the future value of the

consumer surplus gains from a drug price control policy that holds drug price increases to

the same rate of growth as the general price level over the period from the beginning of

1981 through the end of 2000. To measure the consumer surplus gains for each year, we

estimate the area under the demand curve between the market and controlled prices.
                                                                                           16

       We pick the years between 1981 and 2000 to conduct the experiment because real

drug prices increased throughout that period, as depicted in Exhibit 1. Moreover, in a

recent study, Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005) used that same period to estimate

the number of new drugs that would have been lost from a similar drug price control

regime. These authors assumed Congress enacted a law in 1980 requiring pharmaceutical

prices in the U.S. to grow no faster than the general price level. This approach mirrors

one of the actual mandates in the Veteran’s Health Care Act of 1992: namely, that drug

prices paid by federal agencies cannot grow at a rate faster than the urban consumer price

index. Thus, while our experiment is couched within a hypothetical and historical

context, it will nevertheless reflect an actual approach employed by the Federal

government to control pharmaceutical prices (albeit on a relatively small scale). By

combining the results from these two studies, some insight may be gained into the net

consumer benefits arising from a drug price control system that holds the rate of growth

of drug prices to the same rate of growth as the overall CPI.

       Retrieving the elasticities from the multiple regression results shown in column 3

in Exhibit 2, we can express an aggregate consumer constant elasticity of demand curve

for drugs in the following form:

              −0.370        0.459        0.519
    P                  PM           Y
Q=A O                                            Qt0−..1517
    PX                 PX           PX

Or more simply, we can write:

              −0.370
    P
Q=K O
    PX

and define,
                                                                                                     17

             0.459        0.519
    P                Y
K=A M                             Qt0−..1517
    PX               PX

It follows that K, the amount of drug consumption that results from all factors other than

the real out-of-pocket price, can be determined by dividing Q, real pharmaceutical

                                               −0.370
                                         PO
expenditures per capita, by                             for each year between 1981 and 2000. Using
                                         Px

standard integration techniques, we estimate the area under the demand curve between

the actual drug price index and the drug price index that would have resulted from a

policy that held the rate of growth in pharmaceutical prices to that of the general

consumer price index. For the purposes of our simulation, the price control policy holds

the ratio of the market price of pharmaceutical goods to all other goods at the same level

observed in 1980.

       Economic theory suggests that welfare gains should be measured off of the

consumers’ marginal benefit curve (notional demand) and not the effective demand curve

which depends on the generosity of health insurance. Coinsurance provisions rotate the

effective demand curve. Hence, it is imperative that c, the coinsurance rate, is held

constant to estimate the marginal benefit curve and not some combination of the marginal

benefit curve and effective demand curve.9 As a result, we perform simulations that hold

c at a three different values throughout the period. More specifically, we set c equal to 1

such that the consumer is uninsured and set c equal to 0.67 and 0.45, the optimal values

for the coinsurance rate that were estimated by Feldstein (1973) and Manning and

Marquis (1996), respectively. For sensitivity purposes we also experiment with several

values for the own-price elasticity of demand and different values for the real return on

savings (3, 7 and 10 percent) to compute the value of future consumer surplus gains.
                                                                                             18

Own-price elasticity is assumed to be -0.370, as described above, and values that are one-

half and twice that amount.

        The results of the consumer surplus simulations are shown in Exhibit 3. Not

surprisingly, the future value of consumer surplus gains increases with own-price

elasticity of demand (because the price control generates greater quantity demanded), the

coinsurance rate (because consumers personally have more to gain), and the real interest

rate on savings. Exhibit 3 shows that the estimates of the future value of consumer

surplus gains range from $176 to $767 billion for various values of the three key

variables. This represents the range of savings that would have accrued to consumers at

the end of the 20 year period if government had held the rate of growth of drug prices to

the same rate of growth as the overall consumer price index. It also reflects the future

value of annual improvements in health because of better financial access to existing

drugs as a result of the price control. Thus, at first blush, it appears that a drug price

control of this type could have benefited consumers by a considerable amount in terms of

the greater longevity and quality of lives that lower pharmaceutical prices could have

purchased in the short-run.

        However, over this same time period, Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005)

estimated that this same price control regime would have caused firms to reduce

pharmaceutical R&D expenditures (in $2000) by between $264.5 and $293.1 billion,

because of lower profit expectations and possibly reduced levels of internal funds (which

are the primary source of R&D finance)10. This reduced investment in R&D would have

led to approximately 38 percent fewer new drugs being brought to market in the global

economy. If this 38 percent figure is applied to the total number of new chemical entities
                                                                                           19

approved for marketing during this period in the U.S., we can use our simulation results

to calculate the average social opportunity cost per new drug.

       During the period from 1980 to 2000, 520 new chemical entities were approved

for marketing in the U.S.11 This figure suggests that 198 drugs would have been “lost” if

the assumed price control regime was imposed. Dividing the $176 to $767 billion of

consumer surplus gains from price controls over the period from 1980-2000 by the

number of new drugs “lost” due to price controls, we estimate that, on average,

consumers (in the aggregate) gave up $0.9 to $3.9 billion in consumer surplus per new

drug developed. Moreover, assuming the most likely values for the real interest rate (3

percent), the coinsurance rate (45 percent) and the price elasticity of demand (-0.37),

consumers would have lost about $1.1 billion of surplus per new drug developed.

       This raises the question of whether or not the benefit of a new drug brought to

market during this period was greater than or less than this range of estimates. If the

former is the case, then the fact that price controls were not imposed (in the manner we

describe and model) was, on net, good for the U.S. If, however, the latter is the case,

then not imposing price controls had a net social cost for Americans. While recent

research has documented the significant benefits associated with medical and

pharmaceutical research, and even suggested that U.S. may be currently underinvesting in

R&D (Murphy and Topel, 2003), very few studies have documented the value (in dollar

terms) of new drugs or pharmaceutical R&D. A notable exception is the econometric

study by Lichtenberg (2002). In his study, which covered a similar time period in the

U.S. (1960-1997), Lichtenberg approximated that, on average, every $1,345 spent on

pharmaceutical R&D “produced” an additional U.S. life year.
                                                                                           20

       While speculative, we can use this average productivity measure of R&D to

compare the benefits of price controls (as modeled in this study) and the costs in terms of

“lost” R&D and drugs12. To do this we divide Giaccotto and colleague’s estimated range

of forgone capitalized pharmaceutical R&D ($264.5 to $293.1 billion), by $1,345 and

multiply this by $100,000, which is one measure of the value of a U.S. life year (Cutler

and McClellan, 2001). Of course, both higher and lower estimates of the value of a life

year exist. This simple first approximation places the cost of our hypothetical price

control policy at between $19.7 and $21.8 trillion in terms of value of lives lost. This

range of figures is over 28 times larger than our estimated range for the consumer surplus

gains produced by this drug price control policy ($176 to $767 billion). This leads to the

conclusion that a price control regime of the type described here would have done much

more harm than good from a social welfare perspective.

       One very important caveat should be mentioned at this point. Our analysis

implicitly assumes a market environment in which drug firms either unilaterally or

collectively are capable of exercising market power by restricting output and raising

prices. Based upon several structural characteristics (e.g., few dominant firms, brand

names, patents, and huge role of promotion expenditures) and the relatively high

profitability of this industry, it may seem reasonable to assume that pharmaceutical

companies truly possess some degree of market power. If drug firms do exercise market

power then theory suggests that a price control can lead to increased output supplied and

greater consumer surplus and our estimates of the welfare loss remain intact.

       However, if drug firms in the aggregate behave competitively rather than exercise

market power, our estimates of the consumer surplus gains from a drug price control
                                                                                             21

regime will be overestimated because firms will react to the price control by reducing

output below the competitive level. Indeed, one might argue that countervailing forces

such as generic competition and managed care buyers induce a sufficient amount of

competition into an otherwise structurally oligopolistic industry. It follows that drug price

controls will impose an even greater net burden on society than that estimated in this

paper if the aggregate pharmaceutical industry behaves reasonably competitive. Thus our

estimates of the potential damages from a drug price control policy, at least the type

entertained here, may be conservative.



5. Conclusion


Rising drug prices have captured the attention of the media, various public interest

groups, and politicians. Some have pointed to price controls as a way of reining in what

many perceive as “runaway” drug prices. But as economists have known for centuries,

price controls simply represent “bad economics”. Economic theory suggests that price

controls often create shortages, reduce quality, lead to price discrimination, and can harm

incentives for innovation. The only benefit to price controls is that some individuals gain,

at the expense of others, through an increase in their consumer surplus as a result of the

lower controlled prices.

       In this paper, we estimate the consumer surplus gains, or benefit, resulting from a

hypothetical price control policy in the U.S. To accomplish this objective, we use

national data from 1960 to 2000 to estimate the aggregate demand for pharmaceuticals.

Based upon our empirical results, the demand for pharmaceuticals is shown to be

inversely related to its own-price and directly related to the both medical prices and real
                                                                                         22

income. Moreover, the empirical estimation generates elasticity estimates with plausible

magnitudes that are in general agreement with previous research findings.

       We then use the parameters from the estimated demand curve to simulate the

consumer surplus gains associated with an assumed price control policy that holds the

increase in pharmaceutical prices to the rate of growth of the general consumer price

index. Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005) have conducted this same experiment, and

found that this same price control regime would have reduced the number of new drug

innovations by about 38 percent. For the nation as a whole and using the most likely

values, we estimate that the future value of the consumer surplus from the assumed price

control regime would equal about $221 billion in 2000. On a per drug basis, we estimate

that the consumer opportunity cost of not imposing this price control policy was

approximately $1.1 billion. However, when compared to the estimated benefits of the

additional pharmaceutical R&D that was undertaken because these hypothetical price

controls were not implemented, these costs appear to be very small. Given our results,

and those reported in prior research, society may be better off discovering more efficient

ways than price controls to improve access to existing drugs.

Endnotes (Footnotes)

  Approximately 10 years ago the Clinton Administration’s Health Security Act had provisions for directly
controlling drug prices. In addition, the drug industry has been under the political microscope since the
1960s (Scherer, 2004)
2
  There are numerous theoretical reasons why reimportation may not generate the desired prescription drug
cost savings that the advocates of this and related policies expect. See, for example, the paper by Kanavos
et al. (2004). If this occurs, direct price regulation will have to follow to procure the cost savings that such
reimportation policies were intended to achieve.
3
  For instance, Miller and Frech (2002) examine empirically the effect of pharmaceuticals, medical care,
and various lifestyle factors on measures of the quality and quantity of life using a sample of OECD
countries. Among other results, they find that pharmaceutical consumption extends and improves lives.
4
  For simplicity, it is assumed that the decision to purchase pharmaceutical and medical expense insurance
coverage has already been made.
5
  First stage results can be found in Appendix 2. Note that a sizeable proportion of the variation in drug
prices is explained by the right hand side variables and that both instruments possess plausible signs and are
statistically significant.
6
  Mathematically, the intercept term in equation (7) falls out after first differencing of the variables.
Statistically, an intercept term proved to be no different from zero.
7
  As noted in the text, a one-period lagged value of Q (in logs) was also included in the specification to
control for changing tastes and preferences and initial endowment of health. Because a lagged value of the
dependent variable is specified on the right hand side of the equation, the typical Durbin Watson statistic
cannot be used to detect serial correlation. We remind the reader, however, that our specification contains
first differences of the variables and not levels so we report the Durbin Watson statistic. We also
experimented with other diagnostic tests such as the Q-statistic and Durbin’s alternative test (Maddala,
1992). These tests failed to detect the presence of serial correlation.
8
  Long run price elasticity estimates can be derived by dividing the short run elasticity by one minus the
coefficient estimate on the lagged dependent variable.
9
  We thank the reviewers for emphasizing this point.

   The latter would be the case if capital market imperfections imparted a cost advantage to internal funds
over external debt and equity (see Vernon, 2005).
